Hello,
this problem has been on the list a couple of month ago, but no
solution was provided on the list:

Netscape (current version 4.6) still pops up show page
source/page info windows without any controls and decoration.
I suppose it is a DU-netscape problem, but on CDE it works fine.

Maybe someone has any clues ?

Second problem: I cannot get fvwm2 to recognize any xpm icons,
although XPM support is compiled in. the bitmap path works fine,
so does the pixmap path with bitmaps, but pixmaps are never
displayed.

Well, and fvwm1 had the nice feature of a command to toggle window
scrolling. The man says this is covered by the EdgeScroll
parameters in the config, but I just want to be able to stop
scrolling for a little time without restarting the WM. I don't
see a way to do this with the EdgeScroll config.

Hints welcome.

TIA

Tschüß,
						Dieter

I do this 
Key 1      A       M       EdgeScroll 0 0 
Key 2      A       M       EdgeScroll 100 100

so alt-1 disables scrolling and 
   alt-2 re-enables it.

Try this, instead:

Key F1		A	M	Raise
#Key F1		A	M	Popup "Utilities"
Key F2		A	M	Popup "Window"
Key F3		A	M	Lower

 ... and so on...

The "A" means "all contexts," so it'll work regardless of focus or mouse
position.  The "M" is "Meta", so it really is Alt-F1.  You should be
able to change this to C for control, or N (I think) for no modifiers.

Then again, I could be wrong.  I just know what works for me.  :)

I discovered something I consider curious when I tried this to see whether
it worked for me.  I invoked 

Popup "Utilities"

from the FvwmTalk module and all worked well (I, too, have a menu named
"Utilities").  I then used FvwmTalk to make the key binding

Key F1 A N Popup "Utilities"

(to make the key active everywhere instead of just the root window) and
all worked well, as long as I was in the root window.  When I moved into
any process window, however, the Utility menu did not pop up.  I used the
menu from the root window to pop another terminal and I found that the F1
key would work within that terminal, but not in any window which already
existed at the time the key binding was applied! (at least, _I_ think it
was worth an exclam).  Key bindings can be hidden in this way when people
are toying with their configs.  A Recapture makes the F1 binding active
everywhere.  I hope this helps somewhat.

(The following is with fvwm2 2.0.46)

Say I start a few xterms, and iconise them all. They automatically fill
the icon box I've defined, in the order I iconise them. But they don't
remember their places - it seems that fvwm2 will automatically "pack"
the icons into the box. What I want is for the icons to remember where
they started, and stay there when re-iconised (like olvwm).

It seems this is possible, as I noted fvwm2 will remember the icon's
placement if I physically position the icon where I want it - it always
returns to this position. (I don't want to have to specify an icon
position on the command line).

This is useful primarily for when I have a dozen editor windows open and
I can keep track of them by simply remembering where the icons stay.

Any ideas?

Hey all,
I'm trying to install FVWM2 on my Sun Sparc 2, running Solaris 2.6.  I
have the latest gcc compiler (2.7.2 or the like?), and first gnu
complains of an unrecognized language (cg92) but appears to continue to
compile, but then I get a:
Picture.c:33: X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory

I checked in /usr/include/X11, and sure enough, its not there!  I tried
commenting out the line that calls the xpm header file, but that didn't
help (I don't know much C to be honest).  So, any help would be
apprecaited.  Resond privately, if possible.

Hi,
	The X11/xpm.h is part of the Xpm package that you can find in
	in ftp.x.org. I think that it is in the contrib directory.

	With respect to the gcc errors, they are due to the fact that
	you have configured your xmkmf for the Sun C compiler, if you
	want to stop the warnings you need to change the configuration
	of that.

Hope this helps.

Later, Juan.

Yep, I found the bit that does the auto icon placement in icons.c,
function AutoPlace (now who on earth thought up the names for these
things :-). The code was explicitly examining only currently iconised
windows to see what space was available in the icon box area. It also
packed the icons such that the icons would end up moving around over
time. I changed this to look at all windows, iconised or not (removed
the test (test_windows->flags&ICONIFIED)). This allows any window which
has ever been iconified to "mark it's place", so to speak. I also added
a hack to set the ICON_MOVED flag on all icons in the iconbox, so that
they won't move from where they started, even if something's been moved
to overlap them. (This should also (insignificantly?) speed up
iconification).

The behaviour of this change with slippery icons is not ideal, (slippery
icons leave a hole in the other desks which won't be filled), but if you
use slippery icons it'd probably be best to stick them in a separate
icon box (?).

just a side note, root bindings don't work very well with sloppy focus,
since you don't lose the focus of the window when you move out of a window. 

if you're using sloppyfocus, you should avoid R bindings. :)

It would be convenient if you could specify a PATH for the applications just

as there is a path for the pixmaps and bitmaps.

This would make it easier to use fvwm on multiple platforms without having to 

modiy the .bashrc or .kshrc or equivalent.

Oh, I dunno. I use lots of R bindings with SloppyFocus with no problems
at all. JM2c.

Hey all, 
thanks for the fvwm tips, I found xpm in package format, and have
installed it, and am trying fvwm again.  All day actually!  Now, after
several errors during the make... the final error is:
lk: fatal: library -lXpm: not found
What gives?  I know I installed xpm, and in /usr/include/X11, xpm.h
exists... what am I missing (I know its gotta be dumb)

add this to the linker command:

-L/usr/lib... whatever the path to the libXpm.so. library is. you
don't specify the actual library, just the path to it.

the problem is that the linker does not know where to find the lib.
this may also be fixed by simply running ldconfig and then trying to
link the package.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to gnu.emacs.help,comp.emacs as well.


I grabbed on the net wingmr-mode.el which is suppose to be a mode to
edit the .fvwmrc and alike.

It is said to put the following in your .emacs

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)
              ("\\.[A-Za-z]*wmrc" . winmgr-mode) 
	      auto-mode-alist)))

(autoload 'winmgr-mode "winmgr-mode"
  "Mode for editing window manager config files")

(add-hook 'winmgr-mode-hook
	  '(lambda ()
	     (font-lock-mode t)
	     (setq font-lock-keywords winmgr-font-lock-keywords)
           (font-lock-fontify-buffer)))


When I tried to byte compile .emacs an error message about the
auto-mode-alist appeared:

file mode specification error: (wrong-type-argument listp auto-mode-alist)

I am using Gnu Emacs-20.3 on Redhat Linux 5.0

Any idea what is wrong with this?

Thanks

Hi,

It would be nice if FvwmButtons had the following feature:

Let me describe it...

In HTML you can create a clickable image just like you can have a "clickable

pixmap/bitmap" in FvwmButtons. If you use 

<img src="foo-bar.gif" alt="[ this picture says foo-bar ]"> in the HTML file

then pointing at the image with the mouse on the browser causes the sign

"[ this picture says foo-bar ]" to show up 

(at least this is true with Netscape).

So, can we produce a similar effect in FvwmButtons, that is, I point at an 

icon and FvwmButtons gives me a brief description of the Icon?

I think this would be a nice feature.

Neil

No.  Mouse acceleration is not specific to the window manager, but to
the X server.  Read the `xset' man page.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a major mode for editing window configuration files and
;; also defines font-lock keywords for such files.

;; winmgr-mode mode will automatically get turned on if you visit a
;; a file whose name looks like that of a configuration file
;; (IE, .fvwmrc, .mwmrc, .tvtwmrc, etc)

;; The current font-lock keywords are:

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by whitespace gets colored using
;; font-lock-function-name-face.

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by a "(" (IE, an m4 macro) gets colored using
;; font-lock-comment-face

;; Put this in your .emacs :
;;
;;(setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)
;;              ("\\.[A-Za-z]*wmrc" . winmgr-mode)

Try using this instead, and see if it helps:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)
=09=09("\\.[A-Za-z]*wmrc" . winmgr-mode))
=09=09auto-mode-alist))

Parantheses must balance in emacs lisp. It appears that you have given
append only one argument.

There is alos a newer version of this that ships with xemacs, that gets
set up automatically and has all the builtin customize stuff.

Hello,

I use Fvwm with the Raise, Lower, RaiseLower options to perform the obvious
window operations.

Say I have 10 windows on the desktop and one window (theone with the focus)
is on top of another 6.
Clicking lower or raiselower (by selecting the window operation from a menu)
will place the window below all other 6 windows.
It would be nice if there was a StepLower function that placed a window only
below the one right below it. That way things get a little easier on cluttered desktops, especially when using the top three of six windows all at a time on
a small screen.

Unfortunately for now I am not interested to install xemacs ( space
is getting scarce).  However, if you do not mind and the license
authorizes it, could you attach the file  and send me a copy of it?
The other option is cumbersome, download xemacs retrieve the file
then erase xemacs...


Thanks

Hello,

I would like to hide things from the FvwmPager in a similar manner in which
one hides things from FvwmWinList with the (? WindowSkip ?) Style option.
Objects falling into this category wold be sicky clocks and the buttonbox 
module I have checked the FvwmPager man pages but found nothing there.
Does anyon know of a solution. If this feature has not ye been implemened then 
it would certainly be a nice add-on.

Hehe.  Its me again.  Trying to compile fvwm on sparc 2, under solaris
2.6.  I got the xmkmf -a to run without errors, but now when I run a
'make' i get multiple errors, about how it can't 'linker input file
unused since linking not done'.  Then it tries to run ar, and fails,
then it complains about how it can't make livfvwm2.a'.  Hm.  I've
reinstalled xpm, and deleted and re-extracted fvwm again.  No dice.  I
recently upgraded to gnu gcc 2.8.1... if that helps.

I'm sorry to bother the whole list with this question, but neither the man
page nor the FAQ for 2.0.46 seem to answer this (at least after a basic
search):

Is there a way to disable the feature in the resize operation that requires
you to stretch a window bigger than its current size before you can make it
smaller?  (I'm running on a SunOS 4.1.4 system, in case that matters.)

This has been driving me nuts for a long time.

To resize a window you must start a "Resize" operation.
How this is done will depend on the system configuration file or on
your own personal .fvwmrc / .fvwm2rc file if you have one (the latter
would usually be found in your home directory).
The most popular ways of starting a "Resize" operation are by clicking on
a button of the title bar of the window you wish to resize and holding the
mouse button down and/or choosing "Resize" or the like from a Popup menu
and then clicking on the desired window and holding the mouse button down.
Once you start a resize operation the following things will happen:
a) you can shrink (or widen) a window horizontally by first moving the pointer
   to a vertical side bar
b) you can shrink (or widen) a window vertically by first moving the pointer
   to a horizontal side bar
c) to shrink (or expand) a window in both directions just move the pointer
   to the frame (in this context the word "frame" stands for the corners).

... as you can see, there should be no need to enlarge a window before
shrinking it.

I hope this helped,

Neil

Hello,

I was looking at some postings dating back to last month.

Regarding BorderWidth and HandleWith, the man pages are correct.

Only windows that do not have handles can have borders. What can

be slightly confusing is the following:

All windows with no handles are set by default to have:

Style * BorderWidth 1

Now, let us look at a window with handles: if you drag the mouse to the

edge of the handles the pointer/cursor changes from being one kind of arrow

to another kind. And yet the same operations are performed on the outer

edge of the handle as inside the handle.

Why then, is the cursor changing?

If we put

Style * HandleWith 100
and
Style * BorderWith 0

we still get those 1 pixel lines at the edge of the handle which change the

shape of the pointer.

Also try:

Style * HandleWith 2
Style * BorderWith 0

and

Style * HandleWith 1
Style * BorderWith 0

... in the second case there is no inner handle resulting in one pointer

type (the outer one) throughout the 1 pixel frame.

On the other hand,

Style * HandleWith 10
Style * BorderWith 10

does not add any other border to windows wich have already a handle.

... **** so, what is the deal with these 1 pixel thick lines ****
    **** around handles changing the shape of the pointer?   ****
    **** What is the significance of the pointer's change in ****
    **** shape?                                              ****

Hello everyone,

I believe that the HiLightColor option would be better if it were a 

Style option. Why? Personally I don't think I would use it that often but

others might. Why would they? For the same reason that they can change the

color of handles/borders that do not have focus.

Hi,

About the 1 line pixels at the edge of the Handle:

their behavior is different from on the handle, contrary to

what I said earlier (sorry, I'm writing from a vt510).

The cursor on those outer pixels is the same as on the title bar, and,

on those outer pixels, I cannot resize without making the window larger

first, which is similar to what someone else was saying earlier on, though

I *can* resize without making a window larger on the inner part of the 

Handle/frame.

Hello,

There seems to be a bug in windowlist as it appears to report false
geometries, especially the XxY part of 0:XxY+u+v .
This is especially ture of modules like FvwmButtons and FvwmPager.

You probably don't have a HandleWidth defined you want something like

Style "*" HandleWidth <n>
where n is how wide in pixels the handles are if you look in the corner of
a window and slowly look up there should be a slight break in the border
if there isn't then you have no handles.

Hello,

I would like to hide things from the FvwmPager in a similar manner in which
one hides things from FvwmWinList with the (? WindowSkip ?) Style option.
Objects falling into this category wold be sicky clocks and the buttonbox 
module I have checked the FvwmPager man pages but found nothing there.
Does anyon know of a solution. If this feature has not ye been implemened then 
it would certainly be a nice add-on.

Neil

OK this isn't intended in any way to be a 'proper' feature but it might
help you for now. All it does is ban from the Pager the same windows
that are banned from the windowlist. Quick 'n' dirty.

Apologies if the patch doesn't apply, but I'm not used to doing them
(Any hints gratefully accepted :)

Wouldn't it be better if IconPath would be renamed to "BitmapPath" in view of the fact

that there is a "PixmapPath"? After all Fvwm2 is already incompatible with Fvwm1 so

this extra naming fix should not be a big change in view of what has already been 

changed.

Thank you (and others) for your replies.  I appreciate the fact that you were
trying to help, but I see now that I wrote my question in such a way to make
it seem like I was a clueless newbie.

Let me try to restate the question.  I know about resize handles.  It is true
that if you resize using the resize handles, you can shrink a window without
having to grow it first.  I failed to explain that I normally use resize from
a mouse binding.  I do this very simply, using the following in my .fvwm2rc:

    Mouse 2 WFSTI	MS  Resize

This allows me to start a resize operation with the cursor anywhere on a
window, by pressing meta-shift-button-2.  (I find modifier key + button
combinations much faster to use than having to first seek out the appropriate
window frame/border element.  It's a big win for operations like iconifying
and pushing/popping windows.)

What I find annoying is that after I press meta-shift-button-2 on a window, I
cannot resize it until I slide the cursor to the edge of the window and
actually make the window *larger*.  Then I can strink it.  I wish it were
possible to avoid that, and start the resize operation right away, without
first moving to the window edges.

Another list reader (Chris Siebenmann) understood what I meant in my original
question, and said that this is probably a hardcoded feature of fvwm.  If so,
then I guess there is no configuration option that would change the behavior,
and it would require modifying the C code (which I wouldn't mind trying, if I
only had the time....).

hi,

i want to ask what is the proper way to use Fvwm variables within
a shell script for FvwmCommand.  

Especifically, what about $w ?

In the shell script i am attaching, in the second if clause,
i am attempting to use $w, to write a window id to a file.

I tested the 'Prev' command by itself in FvwmTalk, and it succeeds in writing
the window id to a file.

But it does not work from my shell script.  File does not get written.
(i tried using '$$' and quoting...  -- no luck) 

BTW, the rest of the script works just fine.  I can toggle back and
forth between 2 windows in different pages, from the xterms' command line.

[There must be simpler ways of doing window toggling, 
but I just wanted to play...]

- thanks, josin

I am not quite sure what you script would do, but...

It looks like you are sending $w evaluated by shell. I think what it
should be single quoted, '$w'.

Only if it were currently implemented as an alias, and then perhaps have
"IconPath" deprecated post-2.2. Many of us are using IconPath currently,
and we shouldn't implement a change that breaks an existing config file,
except on an early development track (earlier than the late-beta track Fvwm2
is currently on).

ello,

This is why you should use *FvwmPagerGeometry instead of *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale:

If you specify

*FvwmPagerGeometry XxY+a+b

and you have a

DeskTopSize mxn

then your X must be of the form X = k * m + (m-1) = (k+1)*m - 1

and similarly Y must be of the form Y = (l+1)*m - 1

simply because the pages must all be of equal height and width for it to

look nice and you have to take into account for the one pixel horizontal and

vertical lines separating the pages. If you have an outer border around your

pager then this one comes from the BorderWidth which by default is set to 1

pixel. To get rid of it (if you really want to) just set it to

BorderWidth 0 . Otherwise, if you have a frame around it then it comes from

the FrameWidth which by default is 7 (which is thicker so you *would* 

notice this one).

... back to what I was saying ...

If you use *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale instead then you risk having the virtual

pages in the FvwmPager looking a pixel or two smaller than the space allocated

for them by the FvwmPager. It's a minor thing but can be annoying.

If you're really concerned about maintaining undistorted aspect ratio then

use *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale and then adjust it by trying to find an

*FvwmPagerGeometry that lies within plus or minus 4 pixels width/height

of that given by the *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale . However, IMHO, undistorted

aspect ratio is not the best feature of *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale : its

best feature is the fact that if you're on a LAN and go from a 15" to

a 17" monitor then you don't risk having the Pager reappear too small.

Best Regards,

Neil

I agree with you. Drastic changes can have bad side effects.

Smooth changes are the way to go. I vote for it to be implemented as

a temporary alias and then if we all like it in the future then we can

all switch.

You would have to patch the code to do this.  You would also have to
come up with some way to let fvwm know which edges you want to move i.e.
there are eight different resize directions so you would need eight new
commands or a new command with fancy args.

There is something you can do that might help, it won't do exactly what
you want but it might make it bearable.  If you bind Alt-keypad-5 to pop
up a menu you can have the menu give all eight choices hot-keyed from
numbers.  Each menu choice would call a function that warps the mouse to
the appropriate edge or corner and then call resize.  You would still
have to grow the window to get the resizing to start but at least the
mouse would be in the desired part of the window.  The numbers for hot
keys will give you an intuitive key sequence where you hit alt-keypad-5
(in the middle of the pad) then the number key in the direction you want
to resize.  Let me exemplify:

Key KP_5 WTSF M resize_menu #WTSF means anywhere but root or icon

AddToMenu resize_menu "Pick a resize direction" Title
+ "&7 Up Left" resize_dir 0 0
+ "&8 Up" resize_dir 50 0
+ "&9 Up Right" resize_dir 100 0
+ "&6 Right" resize_dir 100 50
+ "&3 Down Right" resize_dir 100 100
+ "&2 Down" resize_dir 50 100
+ "&1 Down Left" resize_dir 0 100
+ "&4 Left" resize_dir 0 50

AddToFunc resize_dir "I" WarpToWindow $0 $1
+                    "I" Resize

Let me know if you think this is useful.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hmmmm...

I was able to fix this behaviour in .fvwm2rc for switching applications
when clicking on the menu bar, but *not* when clicking in the interior
of the window.  There doesn't seem to be any option to control this
outside of patching the code.  A search of the FAQ and the fvwm mailing
list archive doesn't reveal how to fix this either.

It's either a documentation problem or a bug.  If it's a bug, it's not
in the change log for recent versions and it's not on the developers
TODO list.  If it's a documentation problem, it's not documented in the
latest man pages.

I have been following the discussion started by Hucka about window
resizing features, and it makes me recall a module written by Elad Eyal,
<elad@cs.bgu.ac.il> a year or so ago.  My last update on it was Aug 1997.
It is a module with which you bodily take the named window and put it
where you want it and resize it as you go.  Click of the mouse gives one
corner, release gives the other corner.  I gave the author marginal help
ni testing his module, and flagged some issues with other color depths
than he was using.  It seemed very usable, but my normal window habits
are not very conducive to using FvwmGeom.  If the files are not available
from the author, I could tar up the source again and send it to interested
parties.

I don't think FvwmGeom is part of the regular distribution.  If it is,
please ignore me gracefully.

What's really happening is that you are moving the cursor to go and grab
the rubber band used for resizing. This behaviour dates all the way back
to twm.

I for one can't think of an alternative scheme to the rubber band for
indicating arbitrary resize operations. Anyone got good ideas?

Yes, we could resize windows dynamically like in AfterStep.
In any case I don't see why you should move outward to grab the rubber
band.
Why can't the window automatically turn to a rubber band and shrink toward
the pointer when you start a resize operation?

is there an Fvwm command to produce a window name given a window id ?

-- i could do it (non Fvwm) with xprop, but i want to avoid the overhead.

thanks - josin

A little while ago i wrote about how to write (from a shell script)
	a window id produced by an Fvwm command to a file.

    I was trying to do this (after calling '. FvwmCommand.sh' from 
	my bash shell script):

    Next [ *${window_name}* ] Exec echo \$w > /tmp/ztest4


Well,  the solution i got, which was to escape the '$w' did not work.

So, i tried a simple test, and it apparently turns out that I
cannot even echo "FFFF" into a file !

the test script follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash
# to test fvwm's  FvwmCommand Exec command from shell
#
. FvwmCommand.sh
#
    # this works ok (expected)
    echo "foo" > /tmp/ztest1

    # this does create a file 
    Exec touch /tmp/ztest2

    # this produces an empty file.........
	# (but it works OK from FvwmTalk) <-- <--
    Exec echo FFFF > /tmp/ztest3    

    # this produces an empty file too.  errors file has no contents.
	# (but it works OK from FvwmTalk) <-- <--
    Exec cat /tmp/zfoo > /tmp/ztest4  2> /tmp/zerr

#    this is what i would like to do in the end...
#    Next [ *${window_name}* ] Exec echo \$w > /tmp/ztest4


----------------------------------------------------------------------

thanks for any insights... - josin

OK, never mind about my last.  I found the bug, and it was mine.

    Next [ *${window_name}* ] Exec echo \$w \> /tmp/ztest4

	needed to escape the '>' as well !!

	(forgot that in bash you can create files by just typing "> filename" !)

Where on the internet can I get more doc help on configuring the

I want to change the menu options and add apps.  I also want to
change the defaults of window icons. ...etc.

I heard about gnome and kde- who's the best?? (Don't know much)

Which are the most popular (and best) X11 window managers??

Also, is fvwm going to be gnome-compliant someday??

Thanks!!

	Has anyone had a the following problem with fvwm?  
When I startup fvwm, it seems to stall until I move the mouse.
None of the other window managers I tried seems to do that.

	Here's the details of my system:

Hardware:	
	CPU:		PII 266MHZ
	M/B:		Abit LX6
	Mouse:		Logitech Trackman Marble FX (PS/2)
	Video Card:	Matrox Millennium G200
Software:
	Fvwm Ver.:	2.0.46
	OS:		RedHat 5.1 running Linux Kernel 2.1.120 
	X Ver.:		Xfree86 3.3.2p2
	X Server:	XFCom_Matrox

	If anyone has any ideas or needs more info let me know.
This problem is more of an annoyance rather than a serious
problem, but I would like to find out the cause just the same.

-Harold

Hello...

I've been using Fvwm for quite a while, and have recently noticed some
odd behavior regarding menu key-shorcuts.

I can bring up a "Start" menu by pressing Ctrl-Esc (cheesy, I know, but
I find it useful).  I frequently use it for "Ctrl-Esc, (P)rograms,
(I)nternet, (N)etscape)".

If my emacs window has focus, the "Ctrl-esc" and "p" go to the menu
system, and the "i" and "n" are sent to emacs.  If I move the focus to
any other window, the problem disappears, and does not come back until
next time Fvwm is started.

This isn't a really annoying bug, but it seemed like it was worth
mentioning.  I'll investigate further if anyone cares.

What I always do with RedHat systems, before doing anything else, is get
rid of AnotherLevel.  Your milage will probably vary, though.  But I'd
recommend installing the most recent Fvwm (fvwm-smr-2.0.46.4), and
ditching the RedHat desktop setup.  You'll need to modify many files in
/etc/X11 to do this, though.  The /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc is useful, as
is /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients, and /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession.  Be sure to back
things up first!  :)

Personally, I've set up my system so that users can choose which window
manager they want to use.  If they have a $HOME/.wmrc, the system will
ask them which window manager they want to use.  Otherwise, they get
Fvwm.

> I heard about gnome and kde- who's the best?? (Don't know much)

It's not really a good question right now.  Eventually, gnome should be
better; but it's not developed far enough yet.  KDE does more,
currently, but many people boycott it because it has some odd legal
problems.  I'm using neither, because I'm having difficulty compiling
gnome on my old slackware system.  :)  Anyone know where to get the
dynamic linking libraries?  (libdl, libdld, ...)

> Which are the most popular (and best) X11 window managers??

Most popular:  Enlightenment.  However, it's mostly useless at the
moment because it's in pre-alpha.

Besides that, AfterStep, Fvwm, and WindowMaker seem popular.  Look at
this site for more info:
http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/

My opinion is that Fvwm is by far the most useful at the moment, but a
lot of people like the NeXTStep look so much that the reduced
flexibility doesn't matter to them.

Enlightenment is still popular, but only because it's so amazingly
pretty to look at.  It really isn't usable yet as a window manager.

> Also, is fvwm going to be gnome-compliant someday??

Yes, probably.  Look at the "FwvmGnome" project.

Hello,

I posted this message to c.o.l.x, but I got no reply:
Any here any idea?

Hello,

I sometimes find myself losing keybindings such as "META-LeftButton"
in a window is "Move", CTRL-ArrowLeft is "Scroll Screen Left". You
know em.
I suspect Netscape from doing this. I don't know why, I just have that
feeling.....
It's very annoying, and restarting fvwm2 doesn't help.
Only logging out and in, so that fvwm2 gets "cold-started" helps.

Is there anything I can do to this?

Please email any help!

Ivo Janssen

I am not sure if this is the cause of problem, but next time you lose
the keybinding, check if you have numlock on.

But which border should shrink toward the cursor?   That's the most
difficult part to acheive otherwise I would argue that it's a nice
feature to have but unless you define eight different key presses/mouse
actions/buttons how does the WM decide which way you want to resize?

Hmm, well I've noticed this problem for some time, but until now hadn't
noticed that it only happened when Emacs had focus (And after
experimenting a bit it seems that you're right about that!)

If you can find out what's wrong I'll be very grateful, I've dug a bit
in the sources but couldn't find anything that seemes obviously wrong
and I really don't have the time for in depth checking :(

Cheers,
Lee.

It seems that checking the numlock key indeed fixes the problem. 
Who would suspect that Numlock is some sort of "Modifier". I'd
like to see this in some sort of FAQ (if it isn't already, in which
case I should RTFM better). Or remove the stupid "feature" from fvwm,
make it an option like "NumLockTrigger [true|flase]"

This may be a newbie question, but I can't seem to find the answer to it
anywhere in the man pages. Is there some way to destroy the definitions
of a buttonbar? something like "DestroyMenu" for buttons?

When I make a new buttonbar, I experiment a lot with it before it's
final. I put it in a tmpfile and from FvwmTalk read the file and start
the module. The thing is, every time I read the file, it just adds to
the previous definitions.

Any way to work around this?

Thanks,

The closest one to the cursor.

Hence you could have:

Mouse 1 A SC MoveSideResize
Mouse 2 A SC MoveFrameResize

There must be some way for the program to determine the shortest distance
from the mouse to the side (S) or corners (F). Of course, if the poiter
is equidistant from 2 sides/corners then a choice will have to be
performed. That's up to you.performed. That's up to you.

   That's the most

Can't the WM figure out the 4 distances from the pointer to the 4
borders/corners and determine the shortest one?

Actually, it's not fvwm which treats NumLock as a modifier, but the X
server which does.  It's something that changed in X11R6.something.

I'm pretty sure I've used a window manager (I don't remember which
one) which would divide the window into 9 equal rectangles:

	1 2 3
	4 5 6
	7 8 9

If you started a resize while the mouse was in region 1, 3, 7, or 9,
it would resize that corner.  If you started a resize while the mouse
was in region 2, 4, 6, or 8, it would resize that size.  I don't
remember what would happen if you started a resize from region 5.

Now I see where you're coming from.
Here is an alternative to the problem. Divide a window like this:

Join the points 1,*,2,*,3,*,4,*,5,*,6,*,8,*    in that order.

(see diagram below)

with straight lines. The hard part is computing the positions of the

points. To do that first draw a circle centered at *, then divide the

circle in 8, then draw a box around the circle, and shrink the box so that

the vertical side is original_side * height / widh . This defines a

compression of the contnets of the box and hence the points on the circle.

Then draw the lines *----1', *-----2', ... *----9' where 1', 2', ..., 8'

were those points on the circle. These lines intersect the frame at points

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

This gives you the reqired points 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 . Now you only have to

worry about the behavior at point *. Chose whichever you prefer, eg. one

corner goes to the center.

One advantage of the scheme I described is that once you've started
the resize, the window manager puts up the move/resize rubber-bands.
In fvwm (and in the window manager I'm remembering), these divided the
window into 9 rectangles; this would give you feedback as to whether
you selected the region you thought you selected.

Also, in terms of predictability, I think it may be easier for people
to figure out where the regions are with my scheme.

the short answer:

include this command just before the section where you define
FvwmButtons within the file:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*

the long answer:

from what i understand, it is common for an experienced fvwm user to
incluse the Destroy tags just before defining certain items (menues,
functions, decors and modules).  this ensures that if the file is re-read
by fvwm, the old definitions are erased.  for example, in my .fvwm2rc file
i'm going to define a menu named "Beep".  Including the DestroyMenu tag
that, full definition would look like this:

DestroyMenu "Beep"
AddToMenu "Beep" "Beep Me" Title
+ "" Nop
+ "ok!" Beep

:)

i hope this helps...

That's true. With my scheme things get tough when you move the pointer
toward the ceneter. I was just inspired by pthe "Pie WM" for a moment.

Would it be possible if when you clicked on 5 then for the whole window
to shrink to a dot? Then you can pull it out in whatever direction you
wish.

Alternatively (and perhaps this is a bit more complex), take the GNU
approach: recursion. The middle window is divided into 9 just like
the big window. If when you do that your pointer is still in the center
then apply this idea recursively. Unless the pointer was in the very
center of the window then this recursion must end. If the pointer just
happens to be right in the middle then shrink everything to a dot like in
what I suggest above.

Best wishes,

Neil

Oh, I forgot to say that in the second appproach, each time the pointer is
in the center during the recursion process the whole window shrinks to
the central rectangle. I hope this clarifies things a bit.

just add a style command to your .fvwm2rc - if your using the default name,

That's why I didn't find it. When I loose keybindings, I'm not going
to search through a FAQ for words like "Numlock" or "Modifier".
Hmm, "mouse bindings".... Forgot that. Maybe the question should be
rephrased to something like:

42) How can I restore keybindings or mousebindings when they don't work
    anymore for no apparent reason.

A: Probably you pressed Caps-Lock or Num-Lock, which X (and fvwm
also, then), treat like modifiers. Press 'm again and your bindings
will work again.

Well I have to say that I don't really like the dot approach that much,
I'd prefer that if the mouse really is in the _exact_ centre then we
just act as now ie leave the window the same size and the user would
have to go drag the sides ...   Oh and I would shrink each time with the
recursion idea or not in real-time anyway. I'd just wait till we'd find
out which direction we're shrinking in and then drag that side/corner
to the mouse ...

Much nicer, please make it so I can turn it off though. Half the time I
start a resize it is to find out how big a window is so I can set some
Xdefaults for the next time it pops up. The current behaviour shows the
current size and then can be aborted with ESC.

I posted a patch to the workers list that allows the keypad numbers to
select menu items if the hot keys 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 are used.  This
lets me pop a menu with keypad_5 and then select a resize direction from
a keypad number which moves the mouse to the appropriate edge and then
starts a resize.  If you do the above change then resizing will start
right away at the current size i.e. shrinking won't involve enlarging
first and the resize will start at the current size.

As another whizzy enhancement would anybody be interested in a patch
that would make resize use the keypad number keys to move the pointer
(and therefore resize the window) in an intelligent way?  What I am
thinking is that e.g. keypad_9 would move the pointer up and right by
the resize increment specified by the window or 23 if none specified,
shift-keypad_7 would move up and left by 5 times the resize increment or
100 if none specified.

The numbers 23 and 100 seem to be what resize moves by when using the
arrow keys.

This would let you grow a term window by 5 columns by hitting keypad_5
(or alt-keypad_5 if you want to be able to type numbers in using the
keypad) then keypad_6 to start a resize_right_edge then keypad_6 five
more times to add the columns ad then return to actually do the resize. 
I might even allow keypad_enter to work like return (actually this would
be useful in menus too.

All we need now is OpaqueResizeSize.

Cheers,
Tim.

I take it you're joking :-) . I was referring to the recursive acronym

standing for "GNU's NOT UNIX". Of course there's only one iteration

otherwise it becomes:

((((GNU's not Unix)'s not Unix)'s not Unix)'s not Unix)...

which makes little sense.

Yes, I think seeing the window shrink many times would look ugly.

I was just trying to illustrate the concept.

I use an fvwm2 setup which gives a similar effect to (but is not
derived from) fvwm95. Is there a means of getting the allocation
of mini-icons to the title bars of apps based on eg the window
class as opposed to its name? As an example gmc (the gnome
midnight commander) has -

Name <home directory>
Icon Name <home directory>
Class gmc
Resource gmc

The window appears with the default mini icon, presumably because
the Style for gmc is not recognised (it looks for a Style <home
directory> ... leaving aside apps like code crusader which
appear to have meaningless entries in all the above is there a way
of getting the style to be based on the Class or Resource? Or could
a qualifier be added to the Style lines to point it at a specific
characteristic? (like the below)


Style  R "gmc"           MiniIcon mini-filemngr.xpm

or

Style  C "MyApp"         MiniIcon mini-lashup.xpm

This would also be useful for apps which spawn multiple windows, eg
an IDE that launches say an editor, debugger, help browser etc -
commonly one ends up with the mini-icon correct on only one of the
windows. One can set them individually but it would be useful if 
(where one of the above is common) one could set the mini-icon 
common to all.

Any comments/Observations?

Cheers

Kim

Hello,

It would be nice if one could define a menu in fvwm2 in terms of smaller 
submenus without having to pop the submenus up.Rather, the submenus could be 
part of the main list itself. The advantage would be you could use the submenus
in more than one place either as part of a bigger menu or as a pop-up menu.

Hi,

I have a small problem that, although it is not impeding me from
starting or using fvwm, I really would like to find the answer for.
Okay, for whatever reason I had in my mind that day, I bought the new RH
5.1, and upgraded my setup.  Everything was nice and perky with the
default installation (upgrade).  Well, even though I had been using KDE
for the past year, I decided not to use KDE, nor the default X setup
that comes w/ RH.  Instead, I wanted to go back, and give a try to fvwm
again.  Fvwm is so customizable that I didn't feel like I was missing
anything.  Well, this is my problem.  I setup .xinitrc by copying it
directly from xinit.  Xresources was already setup in my home
directory.  No problem up to now.  I ran 'startx', and everything seemed
fine.  I had virtual desktops, and all the functions that were setup in
.xinitrc.   But then I decided to also setup .fvwmrc.  I copy it
directly from system.fvwm,  and now when I start fvwm I don't get the
applications that I had set up in .xinitrc.  It is kind of funny that
system.fvwmrc is under /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2, instead of
/usr/lib/X11/fvwm.  My only conclusion is that fvwm was not reading
system.fvwm in the first place.  If .fvwmrc is not present, I get the
virtual environment (pager) and GoodStuff, which appear in .xinitrc, and
I get the default menus when I click the left (1) and right (3) buttons
of my mouse.  If .fvwmrc is present, I don't get a virtual environment;
the programs that were started within .xinitrc do not appear; and I can
only get, by clicking the right mouse button, the "icon manager".  Once
I exit fvwm, I see that there were many errors when the .fvwmrc file was
read.  Any suggestions will be more than appreciated.

Thanks, ajam

I am setting up fvwm2 (2.0.46) on a few XTerminal servers.
I would like to use the IconBox module, but do not want to
have icons in there for the xclock and several other
processes.  Is there a Style modifier that I can use to
accomplish this?  I can keep processes from being listed in
the WindowList, but not in the IconBox.


Thanks!
Dan

Thanks for your response.  Actually, I just did what you suggested.  I got
rid of every wm that came with the RH distribution, and only reinstalled
fvwm.  Again, if I don't have ~/.fvwmrc, all the programs specified in the
~/.xinitrc will appear when I start fvwm.  Once I set up ~/.fvwmrc, the
originally programs specified in ~/.xinitrc disappear w/ the exception of the
main root window color (xsetroot) and the position and size of the xterm.
My confussion is that if I don't have ~/.fvwmrc setup, fvwm is supposed to
look for "system.fvwmrc".  Thus, having a ~/.fvwmrc equal to "system.fvwmrc",
should not change a thing!?  Either way, thanks again for your interest

I searched with 'nm' every where for "__sF"; I find it appears only

I tried with the GNU linker by removing the -B/usr/ccs/bin/, however
it still complains about "__sF".

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Summary: How do I make sticky windows a different color in fvwm
2.0.46?

Full message:  
Hi all!  This probably is a FAQ but I have searched the web, the
archives, and all available sample files to no avail.  How do I make
sticky windows a different color in FVWM 2.0.46?  The sample 2.xx
files say I should use:

# sticky colors 
StickyColors    black/Maroon

But this does not work.  It says:
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'StickyColors' in ModulePath '/exp/rcf/share/X11R5/fvwm2'

I tried: 

Style "*sticky*"    Color black/Maroon

But that also failed.  Is it possible to make the sticky windows a
different color in fvwm 2.xx?  Or am I just dreaming?  Thank you!!

-Amy, N3ZTY

Hi:
	I am not on the list so I am not sure if this question will reach
you. Anyway, my questions both are related to window focus:

1. Is it possible to switch between two arbitrary windows using "Next
Focus" or "Prev FlipFocus"? I found out that the latter one only works
between windows next to each other in the window list order.

2. Is it possbile to automatically put focus on one of the windows in the
same virtual screen when I destroy or close one window in that virtual
screen? The situation is like that I have open a lot of netscape windows
and when I view them one by one and close the one I just finished reading,
the window focus usually will not be put on any of the remaining windows
on the same virtual desktop, which requires an extra mouse click to get
one of the window into focus.

Thank you for your patience.

Lai

1. Is it possible to switch between two arbitrary windows using "Next
Focus" or "Prev FlipFocus"? I found out that the latter one only works

this is the default behavior of fvwm95. In fvwm95, "Prev Focus" switch
bewteen the window with previous focus.

2. Is it possbile to automatically put focus on one of the windows in the

Hello,

I heard some rumours that some "alien" (i.e. non-fvwm2) window managers are
advancing and producing new interesting features. I always assumed that
fvwm2(.0.46) contains all possible features one can ever dream of in the
mighty X Window System. Now someone tells me that Enlightment is capable of
producing "semi-transparent" windows whereby you can see what is happening
on the background xterm while having focus on a foreground one. That's a
neat feature and I hope fvwm2 does support it.

So, the question is - what do I tweak in my ~/.fvwm2rc to make it work?

My .fvwm2rc is attached, btw if anyone is curious - it's got lots of nice
shortcuts.

Regards,

As I understood it, it wasn't quite that clever - simply that if you
set up the root window with Esetroot and used ETerms, the background to
the ETerm was the region of the root window image the Eterm was over.
This gives 'transparency to the root window' but not to any other
underlapping window contents. I assume this is done by Esetroot setting
an environmental variable to the root window image and the ETerms,
which are said to be rxvt derived picking it up and using their own
coordinates to window the relevant part. I also gather that the effect
fails if you change the root window image which tends to support it
being something like this.
It may be the case that the interaction is purely between ETerm and
ESetroot, in which case, the fvwm2 setup is irrelevant.

Fun, certainly, but not as useful as anything approaching true
transparency could be.

Well...

The bad news is that Fvwm does not support this.  The other bad news is
that Enlightenment doesn't either.

However, a program called "Eterm" does, sort of.  It is the
Enlightenment version of XTerm, and can only be translucent (so far)
with respect to the root window.  And...  it's very slow.

To do it, you'll need Eterm, which requires a bunch of other libraries;
and the Esetroot program which comes with Eterm.  If you set the
background with Esetroot, you can then start up Eterm with the "--trans"
and/or "--shade" or "--tint" options, to get a shaded, translucent
terminal.

And I would like to see, when one performs an operation that involves a
'Raise', the window is raised over sticky (always on top) windows
followed by a 'Lower' back under them when the operation is complete.

Tying in with your 'levels of raising' effectively raising a dragged
window (for example) to a top 'level' above that of a (Sticky) task bar
for the duration of the drag.

Anyone else want this? or know how to do it?

Cheers

Kim

Er ... wishful thinking?

Because it's really not a window manager issue, but an application
issue.

True transparency would be very difficult to achieve. You can see a program
with a transparent window at

  http://www.df.uba.ar/~miquel/xtail/index.html

and observe the performance hit compared to an opaque window. Even then
it is a static transparency, that doesn't update with a window beneath it.

<ObDisclaimer>I know very little about X programming...</ObDisclaimer>

As I understand it, in order to achieve True Transparency in a terminal
program, each individual letter displayed in the terminal would need to be
its own shaped window.  This would not only (I assume) be a programming
nightmare, but would also make Eterm's current transparency seem like a
speed demon..

The coding of this is left as an exercise to the reader.. ;)

Hi:
	Did anyone still using tkgoodstuff8.0 ?  I have problem make it to
work.
My system is a sun ultra1, running sunos 5.6 undre fvwm95.  After I
installed tcl8.0.3 and
tk8.0.3 and tkgoodstuff.  When I try tkgoodstuff -f sample-rc/minimal,
I see the window with clock,biff show up correctly.  But when I try
to click the menu, it pop up a menu with nothing on it.
If I click for preference menu, it also show nothing(no text) on it,
but if you select item on menu, it works, just don't know what it will
do until you click.  Also for balloon effect, it show you yellow box
with no text on it.  I guess there may be something wrong on my X setup
?
Just don't know what is wrong exactly.
Any advise is appreciated.

Thanks

I use Eterm and fvwm2 and i can attest that they do work well together. 
If you want i'll put up a screen shot on my web page, but you can also
use your imagination. :)

I also figured out ways to make all of it look better on 8-bit displays
(fvwm included). If anyone's interested, email me.

Wait for future versions of the E stuff for real transparency.  But
_real_ transparency may not work without the Enlightenment window
manager taking care of all the details. :( 

** The pseudo transparency would work great if FVWM2 had a
"StaysOnBottom" command...

Hi guys,

I really needed someone to help explain to me why Fvwm modules won't run
on one of my linux system.  I hate it when this problem caused me delay of
several weeks.  I spent way more than the time I can afford on installing
Fvwm.

I first installed fvwm-2.0.46 on a Linux machine for private use a month
ago and tried out FvwmCDE. The installation process was smooth like a
breeze.  Then I decided to let my users have the CDE interface using
Fvwm2.  I repeated the same installation steps that I documented the first
time I installed on the first machine.  This time I installed it on the
department linux machine, which used basically the same software.  Fvwm2
managed to run; so are FvwmTalk, FvwmDebug and FvwmAuto (AutoRise).  
However, FvwmIdent, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIconBox, FvwmPager,
FvwmTile, FvwmWinList, FvwmScroll, FvwmGoodStuff, FvwmCDE, etc. failed to
respond.  I'm sure that Fvwm2 found the modules as by renaming the
modules, the same command gave different error message.  Under certain
circumstances, I got messages like the following in ~/.xsession-errors :

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed:
/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2/FvwmCommandS
No such file or directory

I don't understand at all what the second message is about.  The file was
definitely found.

When I placed a debugging print statement in the DeadPipe signal handler
routine, my debugging message appeared in .xsession-errors, which showed
that the module was executed and the pipe was somehow not working.  Or
other problem may have happened and Fvwm2 closes the pipe to the module.

Later I installed the same softwares on yet another linux machines and
after a small problem of permission setting, I can run the software
perfectly too.  So, why this single machine wouldn't work?

Due to this, I pain-takingly reinstalled X, which costed me yet 2 days
messing around with the monitor resolution, definition and stuffs.
Finally, when X was running, I tried Fvwm2 again.  Still the same modules
were not working.  I tried intalling fvwm-2.0.45 and fvwm-2.0.46 multiple
number of time and I got the same result.

What is this mysterious failure is about?  

If anybody can suggest a way to help debug this problem, please do send a
copy of the reply directly to me.  I really appreciate this.  Thanks.

Daniel.

This sounds like the problem that I was having.  Fvwm starts but you don't
get the modules that you are suppose to have, and maybe the colors are not
the ones you were expecting to get.  Well, what I did was to get rid every
single window manager that came with my distribution (i.e. AfterStep,
AnotherLevel, ...), including fvwm, fvwm2, ..., and reinstall fvwm or fvwm2,
alone.  Just simply go back to your distribution CDROM, and reinstall it.
Maybe this is not the full solution, but it did the trick for me.  I could be
wrong, but I believe the default 'wm' in my distribution (RH) is
AnotherLevel, which mixes different 'wm's together by modifying somewhat
their comfig files.  Again, maybe I'm completely wrong, but that is the way I
see it.  If you get rid of all the window managers and their respective
config files, and install the one(s) that you want again.  The possibility is
that everything will work out fine.  Also, I have a feeling that having fvwm
and fvwm2 installed together might produce a conflict.  Thus, just try
install one or the other.  (I hope that someone with more know-how than I
will correct me where I mess up).  Either way, that's my scoop!

Regards, ajam

Hmm, there's something else I forgot to mention.  The version of Fvwm2
which comes with RedHat is modified, and seems to be broken in various
ways.  I'd suggest renaming the RedHat fvwm to fvwm.redhat, and
installing Fvwm2 from the original sources, probably from
fvwm-smr-2.0.46.tar.gz, if you can find it.  This will let you configure
the default places the program looks for config files, and thus
partially bypass the RedHat desktop setup (which is also IMHO broken).

It's also probably worth browsing through your /etc/X11 directory to see
what you can fix there.  Much of the RedHat setup is designed so that
newbies can configure things without knowing much about the system; but
it also tends to get in the way for more experienced users.  Often
times, the only way to get things to work "right" is to rewrite the
scripts which run everything.  The RedHat system is very nicely done
(especially with some of the gui configurators), but there seems to be
no option to revert to "normal unix" mode; and changing the system
behavior often involves breaking the RedHat setup.

Instead of using a .xinitrc file, you might want to try using a
.Xsession file.  That way, you can get the normal setup used by the
global xinitrc, and have your own X programs start too.  With the setup
I'm using, both the global xinitrc and the global Xsession execute
~/.Xsession for automatic user-specified X programs, and figure out
which window manager to use via a ~/.wmrc file.  Fvwm is set up so that
the global config file is customizable via a ~/.fvwm2rc.extra file. 
That way, users can customize things without losing the benefits of a
frequently-updated global config.


BTW, please don't use HTML format for email messages.  It usually
bothers people.  :)

I remembered that I kept getting the following warning :

#xmkmf 
mv -f Makefile Makefile.bak imake -DUseInstalled
-I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config In file included from
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/Imake.tmpl:90,

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/Imake.tmpl:45: warning: this is the location of

Could it be that gcc has something to do with my problem?  How can I get
rid of this warning?

After looking at the directory structure, I wonder if deleting all other
window managers is promising.  It is hard to imagine that there is a
connection somewhere now.  Is there anybody familiar with the fvwm code
knows if conflict with other window manager can really happen?

Thanks.

Daniel.

Hi FVWM2 Users,

I've got a little problem with FVWM2-2.0.46 on my Linux computer.  I have
this line in my ~/.fvwm2rc file:


Style "*"              ActivePlacement


but i've noticed that generally if ActivePlacement works for most application,
it does not work for some KDE tools such as Kmidi or Kscd or some GNOME
applications.I've noticed too that ActivePlacement was working for these
applications with fvwm95.  
Did i missed something in my /.fvwm2rc file to have an user placement for
all applications with fvwm2?

Thanks.

Nothing of the kind. I don't know (and don't care) if the way it achieves
the transparency is by treating each character as a window or anything
else. It works fine, stable, extremely fast and only has 3.2M of memory
image (some of it is shared).

On the other hand, I, of course, would laugh at anyone using anything
slower than a dual PII/450 with 128M ram and at least 8M video card as a 
"decent X workstation". It is, imho, the minimum useable configuration and I am
quite happy with it. In fact, even that config is not fast enough so I
offload a dozen or so netscape's (different versions) to run on small PII
machines on the network (3 in total).

I actually have a patch for this, which I use for keeping xloads below
my icons so I can see what's happening on lots of machines. It's very
horrid and inefficient code, but it works, and I don't have time to
improve it at the moment.

If anyone wants a copy, let me know and I'll try to extract the patch
for this from my CVS tree containing a few hacks that I decided I
needed. It's against 2.0.46.

I just subscribed to the list.  So hello to everyone.  :-)

My first question is - is there a way to set the unhilighted color?

I've looked and looked but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this.
So I'm also putting in a suggestion:

Could hilightcolor be changed to:

ActiveColor  and  InactiveColor

???

I believe this would be more in keeping with the rest of the way in
which fvwm works.  (ie: TitleStyle, ButtonStyle, BorderStyle, et al.)

TIA!  :-)

Hmmm...

What say you just take a look at my .fvwm2rc?  It's got good examples of
what you can do with "decors" and what you can't.  Here's the URL:
	http://www.vis.colostate.edu/~scriven/Linux/fvwm/

The setup has several different "themes" in one configuration file, and
the page has a screenshot of each theme.  A theme includes only the
appearance of the window borders, including size, color, texture,
etc...  However, all the themes share a common "inactive highlight"
color because it otherwise looks bad when windows from more than one
theme are onscreen.  Another attribute not configurable per-window with
themes is the border width.  :(  So, even though "themes" include this
attribute, it's a hack and doesn't work well when changing themes
per-window on the fly.

Suggestion:

It would be nice if FvwmButtons had an option that allowed buttons to stay
depressed for a certain amount of time (eg. 3 deciseconds) after the mouse
button was released after clicking on a button.
This option (say *FvwmButtonsDepressTime ) should be independent of ClickTime.
I find that right now, the default FvwmButtonsDepressTime is too quick for the 
buttons to feel like "real" buttons.
So no matter how long it takes an application to start, a button should stay
depressed for *FvwmButtonsDepressTime after it is clicked.

Hope you like my suggestion.


Question:

Say I open two windows with xterm and put these in Fvwm's InitFuction.
Can I have these windows maximized without having to use the geometry flag.
That way the windows would be maximized no matter what size monitor I use.

TIA,

Best Regards,

Neil

	Think about that for a minute - would you really want true
transparency?  It seems to me that being able to see the output of even
two or three windows which happened to be stacked would be messy at
best.  Certainly E could use some polishing up but I think that they
have implemented pseudo transparency pretty well.  Just my $.02

I tend to use a mixture of text and 'graphical' apps together and whilst
text over text (particularly if the text is the same colour) probably
becomes a mess rapidly the same is not necessarily true if the
underlying app is heavily 'guified' (or particularly where one of the
apps is a graphics program). 

Many of the applications where it could be useful, having thought about
it could probably be done better with explicit interactive control of
window stacking 'levels' (and having the focus separated from it so
one can edit an underlying window without it coming to the front).
(This would probably be necessary to make good use of transparency
anyway). 
How one would implement a multi level window stack like this and
particularly how to control it efficiently I don't know, just 'up one'
'down one' 'send to back' and 'bring to front' would not likely
be sufficient.

Cheers

Kim

Thanks to Chris Rode, i made a taskbar using FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan.
I have a little problem with FvwmIconMan in the *FvwmIconMan*action definition :

I've included in my .fvwm2rc :

*FvwmIconMan*action  Mouse 1  N	sendcommand "Iconify -1", sendcommand Focus, sendcommand Raise
*FvwmIconMan*action  Mouse 2  N	sendcommand "Module FvwmIdent FvwmIdent"
*FvwmIconMan*action  Mouse 3  N	sendcommand "PopUp Window-Ops "

where Window-Ops is:


AddToMenu	Window-Ops
+	"Resize"				Resize
+	"Raise"				Raise
+	"Lower"				Lower
+	"(De)Iconify"			Iconify
+	""				Nop
+	"Destroy"				Destroy
+	"Delete"				Delete

If i click with the third mouse button on an iconified window button in  FvwmIconMan,  i have the
menu appearing but whatever the  choice is ( Raise, Iconify, Delete ...)  the resulting action is to quit fvwm2 !

So where is the problem ?

Thanks.

Jerome

I'm temporarily working on an HP unix box which is running the CDE window
manager.  I've installed FVWM but I can't figure out how to get it to run 
instead of CDE (on my IBM I just type startx and it works).  Can any HP 
users out there tell me how to run FVWM instead of CDE?

Thanks,
Greg

Doesn't it have the main "xinit" file and/or the local ".xinitrc" file,
where you only have to change at the end of the file something like "cde" or
"cdewm" to "fvwm"?  Just fo a search (i.e. find / -name xinit -print) for
them.  Good luck!

Hi,

On Solaris CDE, the trick I use is to configure ~/.dtprofile to
run an XDM session instead of a DT session; that's cause around here
they do not have fvwm in the session options of the CDE login mennu
(yet :) ...

So, at the end of your ~/.dtprofile, place something like:

# ekxran - yes, please do source my .bash_profile <- .profile anyway!
DTSOURCEPROFILE=true
 
export SESSIONTYPE="xdm"
export SDT_ALT_SESSION="$HOME/.xsession"
export SDT_ALT_HELLO="/usr/openwin/bin/xsetroot -default &"


And setup your ~/.xsession something like:


screens=`xdpyinfo | grep screens | awk '{print $4}'`
if [ $screens -eq 2 ] ; then
    hostname=`uname -n`
    export DISPLAY=${hostname}:0.1
    fvwm2 -s -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc.0.1 &
    export DISPLAY=${hostname}:0.0
    fvwm2 -s -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc.0.0 
else
    fvwm2
fi


HTH,

	Rob -
