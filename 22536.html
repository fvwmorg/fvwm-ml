<br />
Dear Internet Marketer,
<br />
<br />Are you tired of endlessly posting your ad to online classified sites that
<br />
just don't get the job done? The fact is there are over 300 such sites
<br />
scattered about the Web and frankly none of them generate enough traffic
<br />
to be worth your while. Even when someone does visit one of these sites,
<br />
your ad is hopelessly lost in a myriad of similar offerings.
<br />
<br />The true professionals of online marketing have known for some time that
<br />
nothing creates results the way a direct bulk email campaign does. We have
<br />
assembled a complete package on one CD-ROM that will enable to get your
<br />
message out to millions for surprisingly little cost and effort.
<br />
<br />INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1
<br />
<br />We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the 
<br />
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!  We
<br />
added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we combined them
<br />
all, we had in  excess of 100+ million addresses in one huge file. 
<br />
<br />We then ran a super &quot;sort/de-dupe&quot; program against this huge list. 
<br />
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It
<br />
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public by
<br />
putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This created
<br />
many duplicate addresses. They also had many program
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;generated&quot; email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc. 
<br />
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those 
<br />
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc. 
<br />
<br />We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to remove 
<br />
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,
<br />
&nbsp;webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu,
<br />
.mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining
<br />
list, it  reduced it down to near 16 million addresses! 
<br />
<br />So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all
<br />
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like
<br />
using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot less money and a
<br />
lot less time!!  
<br />
<br />Besides the 16 Million general email address we include over 400,000
<br />
TARGETED addresses of Business Opportunity Seekers, MLM'ers and
<br />
other Internet Marketers. These are people EAGER to hear about your
<br />
products and services. 
<br />
Other services charge upwards of 5 cents per address for this type of
<br />
list. We include it at no extra extra charge when you purchase Millions
<br />
Vol. 1
<br />
<br />We also included a 5+ million &quot;Remove/Flamer&quot; file broken into seperate
<br />
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes. 
<br />
<br />To help you manage your email lists, you'll find a fully functional
<br />
evaluation copy of BulkMate 4.05 on your CD. BulkMate is an indispensible
<br />
tool for the serious bulk mailer. Among its 10 utilites are the ability to
<br />
filter any address list against a remove list, sort any list
<br />
alphabetically and automatically remove dupes, remove specific domains
<br />
from any list and count the number of addresses in each list.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST.   Your choice.
<br />

<br />What our clients are saying:
<br />
<br />&quot;I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
<br />
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over the
<br />
course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I received
<br />
less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied with my
<br />
purchase!!  Thanks Syrynx!!&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;This list is worth it's weight in gold!!  I sent out 10,000 emails for my
<br />
product and received 185 orders!

<br />

<br />
I've received. I can't thank you enough!
