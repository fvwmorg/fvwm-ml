-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
<br />
<br />I've switched over to fvwm2 and notice that it seems to be designed much
<br />
better than the original fvwm. There are, however, a number of suggestions
<br />
that I'd like to make for future improvement. I'm sorry if these things are
<br />
already possible, if so, perhaps explaining how to do them would be helpful
<br />
to many people. I'm also for sending this to a mailing list that I'm not
<br />
on; chances are that these things have already been discussed - I don't
<br />
see any archives, so I can't check.
<br />
<br />First of all, I like the TogglePage clamp. Something that would also be
<br />
nice is the ability to either control a button being &quot;pressed in&quot; or better
<br />
yet, being able to cycle between pixmaps and the functions assigned to them.
<br />
For example, why have a button for both &quot;dial&quot; and &quot;disconnect&quot; when only
<br />
one of them is needed at a time.. Another good feature would be the ability
<br />
to specify that something being run requires parameters from the user.
<br />
<br />Another thing is that when a window is moved (in non-opaque mode) there is
<br />
apparently no way to set the color of the &quot;wire frame&quot; of the window that
<br />
you see while it's being moved. I have seen several colors being used for
<br />
this, but I can't find where to set it.
<br />
<br />I have a mail program which pops up a password-prompt window called
<br />
&quot;authenticate&quot;. Because I have SloppyFocus (wonderful feature, by the
<br />
way), I worry about accidently knocking my mouse into another window and
<br />
accidently broadcasting my password into an irc window or something. There
<br />
is already a &quot;Stays On Top&quot;, and I'd swear I've seen something like &quot;stays
<br />
focused&quot; but can't find it. The ability to specify that something stays
<br />
focused unless the user specifically clicks on another window would not be
<br />
widely used, but it would be very reassuring for those who do use it. 
<br />
<br />Finally, a number of my friends have mentioned to me that they would like
<br />
to be able to focus a window by clicking anywhere inside the window, citing
<br />
this as the major reason why they don't use FVWM. If it is possible to
<br />
implement, this would definately be a widely used feature.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your time.
