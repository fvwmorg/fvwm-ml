<br />David&gt; Does fvwm v2.x support tabbing a la twm?  To make sure we're
<br />
David&gt; talking about the same thing: what I'm looking for is the
<br />
David&gt; ability to make the title bar just wide enough to hold the
<br />
David&gt; window title (and whatever buttons end up in the title bar).
<br />
David&gt; In twmrc, this is called option &quot;SqueezeTitle&quot;.  I find this
<br />
David&gt; feature invaluable in giving fast and convenient access to
<br />
David&gt; multiple stacked windows.
<br />
<br />Fvwm doesn't have this feature of twm.
<br />
<br />David&gt; If it hasn't been implemented yet, any chance that it will be
<br />
David&gt; added soon?
<br />
<br />I doubt it...  Or if so, at least not soon.
<br />
<br />David&gt; If not, what's the reason for not implementing it?
<br />
<br />Well, I'll give a few:
<br />
<br />1. I've only browsed twm and hadn't really seen that feature until I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried it after your note came in.  Then I read the man page to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get a little more info on it.
<br />
<br />2. I'm not trying to emulate every feature of every window manager
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this includes win95) out there.  One of fvwm's goals is to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(stay) small and fast, and adding more features generally
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detracts from this.  I'm pretty selective.  Generically powerful
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features that don't cost too much memory, speed, or code
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complexity have a possibility of being added to fvwm.  Other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things should be added as modules, perhaps.  If they can be.
<br />
<br />3. If I were to implement it, it should probably be part of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recently added TitleStyle stuff, and all of that moved as a parm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the Style command, and I'm all out of style flags for the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment.  Perhaps after the 'Great Style Flag Rewrite' which will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occur shortly after the seemingly mythical 'First Official 2.xx
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release'.  But then, do we want the added memory overhead of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title style info added to each window?  Can it be arranged to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheap as far as memory usage goes?  Possibly...
<br />
<br />4. Doc updates, build/install process fixes, and bugfixes are more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important to me than most other things right now, mostly to help
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reach the 'First Official 2.xx Release' goal.
<br />
<br />David&gt; I'd love to switch to fvwm but can't do so until tabbing is
<br />
David&gt; supported.
<br />
<br />That's unfortunate.  But if that's the feature that makes it for you,
<br />
and no other features of fvwm make you want to switch, you're probably
<br />
better off sticking with twm (or perhaps ctwm, vtwm, or tvtwm, which
<br />
all have this feature as well since they are more directly spawned
<br />
from twm) for the time being.  You've got to use what works for you.

</em><br />
<br />Jeff&gt; That sounds like a GREAT feature.  I second the request!
<br />
<br />I think it sounds interesting, but never having used it I'm having a
<br />
hard time seeing how it would be more useful than having the full
<br />
sized titles, which really don't take up that much more room.
<br />
<br />Perhaps my typical window layouts make a difference here, since I can
<br />
see that they probably wouldn't benefit at all from this feature.
<br />
<br />I can see a potential benefit if you like to lay out your windows
<br />
overlapping horizontally.  Do you do this?  Do a lot of people out
<br />
there do this?
<br />
<br />I'll have to think about this feature...  I'll add it to the TO-DO
<br />
list with a question mark to remind me to investiage it when I get a
<br />
chance, but I can't make any guarantees.
<br />
<br />If people can provide examples to sway me one way or the other, that'd
<br />
be helpful.
