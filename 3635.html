<br /><em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; FVWM cannot control the case of characters typed in your telnet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; window.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; Would that it were so.
<br />
<br />But, it _IS_ so.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; But, unfortunately, I do start our in lower case and then after a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; while usually while editing a file with vi, the window manager
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; switches all my keystrokes to upper case so that if I go to another
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; open xterm I will get all upper case there.
<br />
<br />This &quot;mysterious combination of keys&quot; that you mention almost certainly
<br />
consists of one and only one key: the CAPS LOCK key :).
<br />
<br />If you set CAPS LOCK on your keyboard, then everything you type in all
<br />
your windows will be uppercase (unless, usually, you hit SHIFT-&lt;letter&gt;,
<br />
in which case &lt;letter&gt; will be _lowercase_).
<br />
<br />Press CAPS LOCK again, and it will toggle off.  Another idea is to
<br />
rebind your CAPS LOCK key to do something else (be a CTRL modifier is a
<br />
common choice--that's what I do).  However, the window manager can't do
<br />
that either; use xmodmap to tell the X server what keybindings you want.
<br />
<br />It's completely up to the _X server_ to manage all that stuff.  The X
<br />
server is the focal point: it controls the input devices (keyboard,
<br />
mouse, etc.) and the output device(s) (monitor), and when keyboard input
<br />
comes in it translates that into a keysym and sends it to the
<br />
appropriate client.
<br />
<br />In _no_ way does _any_ of this involve the window manager.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; I think you are overestimating the involvment of the window
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; manager.  Window managers wrap borders around windows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; but they don't control the display of every pixel inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; the window.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; It seems to me that the window manager has to place the app
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; on the desktop current-viewport according to the resources
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; specified in the app resources file.  I think this placement
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; and all other drawing would go through the window manager:
<br />
<br />No; that's not at all how it works.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; maybe not? Who would be responsible: lesstif? or XFree86?
<br />
<br />The X server is ultimately responsible for drawing everything, and
<br />
handling things like clipping, etc.  You can think of an X window as a
<br />
frame, which is drawn by the window manager, and the contents, which are
<br />
created and drawn by the application.  Both the window manager and the
<br />
application talk directly to the X server: the application does _NOT_
<br />
send its draw requests to the WM.  The WM knows the dimensions of the
<br />
window, and it draws a border around it.  That's all it knows.
<br />
<br />In fact, the WM is just an X application; there's nothing really that
<br />
special about it.
<br />
<br />As for initial placement and sizing, the application can allow the WM to
<br />
be involved with deciding where the x/y offset of the window will be on
<br />
the screen, and it can allow the WM to resize the window (although the
<br />
application doesn't _have_ to allow any of this).
<br />
<br />Once that is decided, it's completely up to the application, talking
<br />
directly to the X server, to draw the right pixels at the right
<br />
locations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; With Motif applications you can usually set X-Resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; to cause Motif to use a different font depending on the screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; size.  Heres something I use in my X-resources for controlling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt;&gt;&gt; the Emacs window size:
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; That's how it should work, and I have written some apps which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; start with the font and size the app depending on the font 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; characteristics. I don't know of anyone else who has done that,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; however. Even in your example, you still have to size the apps
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; using geometry: a very well behaved motif app should size itself
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; from the font characteristics, I think.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; 	#elif ( HEIGHT == 1200 ) /* My home machine, 1600x1200 use side x side layout */
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;d&gt; If you can do this, why can't fvwm?
<br />
<br />FVWM _could_ size _itself_ from the font characteristics (or vice versa).
<br />
<br />But, FVWM cannot influence the font sizes, button sizes, or other
<br />
internal dimensions of _other applications_.
<br />
<br />FVWM may be involved with deciding the x/y offset on the screen, and it
<br />
may be involved with deciding the total height and width of the outer
<br />
window (the one that it decorates with borders), but it is decidedly
<br />
_not_ involved, and cannot influence in any way, the way the application
<br />
uses that window space.
