</em><br />
<br />Well, speaking for myself, it was the number of pages per desk, as well as the
<br />
naming of the desks.  I wanted to use 5 desks of size 1x1, instead of the usual
<br />
4 in 2x2 format.  I wanted to edit this setting in the theme I was using, but a
<br />
cursory glance didn't turn up anything.  Now, I'm sure if I really put my mind
<br />
to it, I would find it eventually.  But I think the main point of fvwm-themes
<br />
is to make all these configuration things as near a no-brainer as possible.
<br />
Hence my frustration at it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or you mean you want to hardcode a number of pages? Modules in some themes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require specific number of pages (6x1) to look nice. Anyway, you may try

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to force &quot;DesktopSize 3x2&quot; in ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/modules-extra file.
</em><br />
<br />This is part of the problem I kept encountering: I'm fairly familiar with the
<br />
basic configuration options and methods of .fvwm2rc files, but in the
<br />
fvwm-themes setting I don't really know what goes where, or where to look for a
<br />
particular .fvwm2rc option.  Some things aren't too bad, like for example
<br />
setting the various well defined color sets in the &quot;colors&quot; component, but, for
<br />
example, DesktopSize in modules/modules-extra?  I would have never guessed.  As
<br />
a fvwm-themes newbie I would have rather suspected it would be somewhere in
<br />
&quot;settings&quot;, or maybe even &quot;startup&quot;...
<br />
<br />Which leads me to ask: can anyone outline the purpose/content of the canonical
<br />
components?  Or perhaps this is already mentioned somewhere, or in some file?
<br />
I think as a fvwm-themes newcomer this is the most vital piece of information
<br />
I'm missing at the moment.  Although some components are self-explanatory, such
<br />
as colors or fonts, others aren't: what's windowlook, and how's it differ from
<br />
globallook, and what's globalfeel?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That, and trying to override the menubar font in the osx theme...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want to change this font you may edit themes/osx/menustyle file.
</em><br />
<br />We're talking about the menubar that's at the top of the workspace, right?
<br />
(only present in osx theme, as a module, and not the regular menus one gets by
<br />
clicking various mouse buttons on root window)
<br />
<br />If we're indeed talking about the same menubar, then again, it didn't occur to
<br />
me to look at &quot;menustyle&quot;... &quot;fonts&quot; seems like the most reasonable place to
<br />
look... (at least to me)
<br />
<br />I tried all kinds of things by playing around with the &quot;fonts&quot; component.  No
<br />
beans.  I was able to change the window title font, others, but never the
<br />
menubar at top of workspace.  Odd.
<br />
<br />BTW, just in case this is news, with the osx theme, and only with that theme, I
<br />
get frequent pixmap corruption.  For example this would happen: I would click
<br />
on root to get the main menu, everything is fine; the next time I bring that
<br />
menu up, the menu background pixmap is garbled with some dark vertical lines
<br />
evenly spaced; the next time it's fine again; then garbled again.  It's not
<br />
always exactly alternating like this, sometimes twice in a row it would be
<br />
garbled, or twice correct.  Similar occurs anywhere else that background pixmap
<br />
is used.  (I'm using FVWM 2.5.5; haven't tried fvwm-themes before so I can't
<br />
say whether this is recent behaviour)
