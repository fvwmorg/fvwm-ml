<br />Before I actually did much looking at the fvwm2 code I noticed the lack of
<br />
progress and I privately suggested basically just this to Chuck about 3
<br />
weeks ago.
<br />
<br />And I also like what &quot;Eric S. Raymond&quot; &lt;esr_at_snark.thyrsus.com&gt; has written
<br />
about the &quot;Cathedral and Bazaar&quot; models of software development.  He's
<br />
attributed the success of Linux to the bazaar model.  He has written and
<br />
talked about this and you can find TEXT and REAL AUDIO of his talk at
<br />

<br />I like the way that the Apache group handles this...  Here's a trimmed down
<br />
version of ABOUT_APACHE from the apache-1.2.0 distribution....

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apache HTTP Server Project
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 1997
<br />
<br />The Apache Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed
<br />
at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available
<br />
source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server.  The project is
<br />
jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using
<br />
the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and
<br />
its related documentation.  These volunteers are known as the Apache Group.
<br />
In addition, hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and
<br />
documentation to the project.  This file is intended to briefly describe
<br />
the history of the Apache Group, recognize the many contributors, and
<br />
explain how you can join the fun too.
<br />
<br />[...]
<br />
<br />============================================================================
<br />
<br />How to join the Apache Group
<br />
<br />There are several levels of contributing.  If you just want to send
<br />
in an occasional suggestion/fix, then you can just use the bug reporting
<br />
form at &lt;<a href="http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi">http://www.apache.org/bugdb.cgi</a>&gt;.  You can also subscribe to the
<br />
announcements mailing list (apache-announce_at_apache.org) which we use to
<br />
broadcast information about new releases, bugfixes, and upcoming events.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to become an active member of the Apache Group (the group
<br />
of volunteers who vote on changes to the distributed server), then
<br />
you need to start by subscribing to the new-httpd_at_apache.org mailing list.
<br />
One warning though: traffic is high, 1000 to 1500 messages/month.
<br />
To subscribe to the list, send &quot;subscribe new-httpd&quot; in the body of
<br />
a message to &lt;majordomo_at_apache.org&gt;.  We recommend reading the list for
<br />
a while before trying to jump in to development.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: The developer mailing list (new-httpd_at_apache.org) is not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a user support forum; it is for people actively working on development
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the server code and documentation, and for planning future
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directions.  If you have user/configuration questions, send them
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the USENET newsgroup &quot;comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix&quot;.
<br />
<br />The Apache Group is a meritocracy -- the more work you have done, the more
<br />
you are allowed to do.  The group founders set the original rules, but
<br />
they can be changed by vote of the active members.  There is a core group
<br />
of people who have logins on our server (hyperreal.com) and access to the
<br />
CVS repository.  Everyone has access to the CVS snapshots.  Changes to
<br />
the code are proposed on the mailing list and usually voted on by active
<br />
members -- three +1 (yes votes) and no -1 (no votes, or vetoes) are needed
<br />
to commit a code change during a release cycle; docs are usually committed
<br />
first and then changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote.
<br />
<br />Our primary method of communication is our mailing list. Approximately 40
<br />
messages a day flow over the list, and are typically very conversational in
<br />
tone. We discuss new features to add, bug fixes, user problems, developments
<br />
in the web server community, release dates, etc.  The actual code development
<br />
takes place on the developers' local machines, with proposed changes
<br />
communicated using a patch (output of a context &quot;diff -c3 oldfile newfile&quot;
<br />
command), and committed to the source repository by one of the core
<br />
developers using remote CVS.
<br />
<br />New members of the Apache Group are added when a frequent contributor is
<br />
nominated by one member and unanimously approved by the voting members.
<br />
In most cases, this &quot;new&quot; member has been actively contributing to the
<br />
group's work for over six months, so it's usually an easy decision.
<br />
Anyone on the mailing list can vote on a particular issue, but we only
<br />
count those made by active members or people who are known to be experts
<br />
on that part of the server.  Vetoes must be accompanied by a convincing
<br />
explanation.
<br />
<br />The above describes our past and current (as of June 1997) guidelines,
<br />
which will probably change over time as the membership of the group
<br />
changes and our development/coordination tools improve.
<br />
<br />[...]
