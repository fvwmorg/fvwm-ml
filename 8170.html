Hello Provider, 
<br />
<br />I'm contacting you regarding FVWM, which is listed in the CNET Downloads database and available for download on Download.com and other sites affiliated with us around the world. You are listed in our database as the publisher contact of record for FVWM.
<br />
<br />As you may have heard, last year we implemented a new fee-based listing structure in the CNET download libraries: Download.com, ZDNet Downloads, and our affiliate partners. We are now requiring that all publishers purchase a listing package through Upload.com (<a href="http://www.upload.com/">http://www.upload.com/</a>), our publisher listing service. Product listings that are not purchased will be removed from our download sites. 
<br />
<br />Your product, FVWM, is currently slated for removal on March 21, 2003. Please purchase a listing package for your product by March 20  if you wish to remain listed in our directories. The basic one-time fee for listing in our library is $79.
<br />
<br />You might be interested to know that according to our logs, your product was downloaded 21 times during the past month (January 28th - February 26th) through our download sites. In addition to retaining and growing this distribution for your product, there are other benefits associated with purchasing a listing with CNET Downloads. In addition to our basic listing option, we also offer a tiered suite of services for publishers who update their products frequently, or who want to put more muscle behind their product promotion. Full details on our various listing packages are available on Upload.com.
<br />
<br />To purchase a listing package, simply visit Upload.com and edit or update your product. If you do not already have an Upload.com account, please take a few minutes to register and request access to your listing using the instructions on the Web site: <a href="http://www.upload.com/">http://www.upload.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />Full details on our listing packages are also available online in the Upload.com Help Center, located here: <a href="http://upload.com.com/1200-21-916200.html">http://upload.com.com/1200-21-916200.html</a>.
<br />
<br />If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at mailto:unpaidproducts_at_upload.com. 
<br />
<br />If you are not the appropriate contact for FVWM, our apologies! We ask that you please forward this e-mail to a more suitable contact at your company.
<br />
<br />Best wishes, 
<br />
<br />Hunter Hoffman
