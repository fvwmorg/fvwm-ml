On 16(?) Jan, raster_at_enlightenment.org answered:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! I read your html description. ewwwwwwwwwww! xwd and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; xwud? You're not serious? you do realise that closing a window now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. a read from the framebuffer across the bus to system memory - this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is already an order of 10 times slower than writes and should be avoided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all costs.
</em><br />
<br />You are right. Speed is a most basic concern in initiating and running any
<br />
process. However, this should not be an issue when it comes to end it,
<br />
since -by definition- we are no more interested in its speed.
<br />
<br />A different thing would be its impact on the speed of management of the
<br />
rest of the processes-windows:
<br />
Do you mean the consumption of bus bandwith would be important?
<br />
Keep in mind that -most probably- what the user is looking at that moment
<br />
is precisely at the window he-she is closing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. a write to disk of a reasonable chunk of data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. no ability to get the program back in an active state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 is basically impossible anyway (due to the way things work - when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;close&quot; a window the wm sends the app a message saying &quot;the user wants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to close you&quot; - the app now can respond any way it likes - either just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exit - thus the window vanishes one way or another, or it can put up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialogs saying &quot;are you sure&quot; etc. or not respond at all and stay up if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it doesn't want to quit. there are ways of &quot;killing&quot; the window - but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is rather nasty if the app is already advertising that it wants not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b asked to quit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 could be avoided and 1 could be minimised if the contents of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; window were held as a pixmap in the server - if you have spare video
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ram the pixmap may stay completely within video memory thus bypassing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having to read across the bus -  anfd we already bypass the write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to/read from disk. this of course means u need a program t maintain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pixmaps (probably the wm) so u can get them back too.
</em><br />
<br />2. A write to disk is the only way to free valuable RAM from data that
<br />
-hopefully- will rarely be needed again, so doesn't have to be kept at hand.
<br />
At this point we have to make a vote of confidence that the operating
<br />
system has optimized disk management, so reads and writes are done without
<br />
overall impact.
<br />
<br />Using xwd additionally ensures the size of the window will not surpass the
<br />
screen (&quot;desktop&quot;) size, securely limiting the chunk of data to some 1.5 MB
<br />
(for a fullscreen 1024x768x32 window).
<br />
<br />3. Popup dialogs do not interfere, as long as they are answered, not closed
<br />
(in which case THEY are the last window closed).
<br />
<br />Windows that refuse to close are neither a problem:
<br />
If they are still there, they obviously don't need to be recovered. :)
<br />
Anyway, if you prefer, just replace the title 'last X closed' by the more
<br />
correct 'last window ordered to close'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but still - i wonder how really useful it is to just get an image of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your last apps state and not have it active at all...?
</em><br />
<br />As you correctly pointed out, that is basically impossible (at least without
<br />
changing the kernel profoundly).
<br />
Although a similar window could be optionally started in the same position
<br />
running the same application (like Enlightenment does at restoring a user's
<br />
session) there is no need for any &quot;lastX&quot; in order to do that:
<br />
it would suffice to just re-invoke that specific application.
<br />
<br /><br />In other words: what you really want is the image of its last state,
<br />
and only secondarily the option to reinitiate the process.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------------- Codito, ergo sum - &quot;I code, therefore I am&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This one is much better:
<br />
--------------- Cogito, ergo sum.  &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;
<br />
<br />It is often easier to code things oneself than going through the mess of
<br />
information to see if there is already an application or library that
<br />
does the same thing.
<br />
<br />I however force myself to use already-made tools. A lot can be learned
<br />
in doing so. Additionally, it keeps me from reinventing the wheel.
<br />
<br />This led me, for instance, to get knowing fvwm2, a window manager so small
<br />
that not even the way of closing a window is written in its code.
<br />
<br />No, I am not recommending you to use fvwm2, but just give lastX a try to
<br />
see it in action: You can not imagine how spectacular it really is.
<br />
After all, think that you have already undergone the worst part:
<br />
understanding the instructions.
<br />
<br />Useful?
<br />
Many would question even wether a window system is.
<br />
<br />Thank you for the in-depth analysis.
<br />
<br />Juanjo.
