<br />
state of the art computer, doesn't have to be expensive. You can have a
<br />
NEW, powerful, Intel Pentium computer directly FROM US, built with ALL
<br />
quality components at the lowest possible prices in years. Unbelievable,
<br />
but true!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine, $1247 for a 233 MHz MMX Pentium Computer with MMX 
<br />
Technology! The perfect computer for home, school or business use.
<br />
But buckle up, because this computer absolutely flies! It features an Intel 
<br />
Pentium processor matched with the latest &quot;TX&quot; Intel chipset motherboard
<br />
for performance that is nothing short of spectacular.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note this computer is absolutely BRAND NEW (Not refurbished) 
<br />
and they feature Intel PENTIUM processors EXCLUSIVELY (Not cheap
<br />
substitutes like AMD or Cyrix).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Computers have MORE memory, MORE power, and MORE speed
<br />
for your money. They come LOADED with:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 20 Speed Cd-Rom
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 33.6 Fax/Modem for fast internet access
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* a large, fast 2.1 GB Hard drive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 16 MB of RAM
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 512 KB Pipeline Burst cache
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Top quality motherboard with Intel TX chipset (very important)       
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 64 Bit MPEG video with 2 MB RAM
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 3D Sound with 80 Watt speakers
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 104 Key Windows 95 Keyboard and Mouse
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Windows 95 CD Installed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want 32 MB RAM for intense demanding jobs? Add $49.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need a larger hard drive? Upgrade to a 4.3 GB for only $49
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want a 24 Speed CD-Rom?  Add $25
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrade to a 56K Fax/Modem for only $25
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Iomega 100MB Zip Drive for only $97
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A LOW PRICE without quality doesn't mean much!!! Does it? That's
<br />
why we design and manufacture our computers to LAST well into the
<br />
next century. We don't skimp on anything. We build our Computers for
<br />
you CAREFULLY, one at a time (a far cry from the assembly line mentality 
<br />
of: slap it together and hope it works). We TEST each and every computer
<br />
for at least 72 hours, so they work FLAWLESSLY right out of the box.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No large company can afford to do that. Nor are they willing to!
<br />
Consider a reader's survey by PC World Magazine in the June '97 issue. 
<br />
They found MORE THAN HALF of their readers experienced PROBLEMS with 
<br />
BRAND NAME computers they recently bought. They titled the article, 
<br />
&quot;When Bad PCs Happen to Good People.&quot; The conclusion is obvious: dealing 
<br />
with a large company doesn't assure you of getting a dependable computer.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not just a number to us. The technician who builds your
<br />
computer, custom configures it exactly how you want it - just right for
<br />
you. He even knows your name since it gets programmed into the computer
<br />
when he optimizes it for speed and performance. And you'll know his name
<br />
too, because he signs his name to your computer. This guarantees it has
<br />
been built to the best of his ability and ready for your computing
<br />
pleasure. There is nothing for you to do except plug it in and turn it
<br />
on. That's all!  Remember, our computers work FLAWLESSLY right out of the box.
<br />
<br />P.S. SPECIAL BONUS IF YOU ORDER NOW! BRAND NEW 15&quot; MONITOR FOR ONLY $197         OR A 17&quot; MONITER FOR ONLY $397, your choice with the purchase of any Computer. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selected these amazingly sharp and clear .28 SVGA monitors as the perfect 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;match for your new Computer. They have a full three year warranty.
<br />
<br />Let us build the best for you - for less.
