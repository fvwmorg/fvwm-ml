<br />
<br />LETH is thriving as an emerging world leader in the conversion of waste 
<br />
materials into electrical energy by utilizing their Biosphere Process System, 
<br />
making them the hottest undervalued stock at this price level where shares 
<br />
are ready to explode on huge investor attention.
<br />
<br />Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for LETH with no signs of 
<br />
slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as sales orders for the Biosphere 
<br />
exceed $150 Million over the past year while the stock price doesn't yet 
<br />
reflect the appearance of these impressive figures on an upcoming balance 
<br />
sheet. We are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the stock is under 
<br />
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed data.
<br />
<br />The unique proprietary technology of the Biosphere fills an urgent 
<br />
worldwide need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
<br />
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of 
<br />
waste. The Biosphere System provides the highest level of innovative 
<br />
technology while securing worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product 
<br />
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while 
<br />
simultaneously generating electricity. 
<br />
<br />The Biosphere System enables LETH to draw revenue from the disposal of 
<br />
various types of waste at 5 to 7 tons per hour including such materials as:
<br />
Municipal Solid Waste, refinery wastes, agricultural surpluses or effluents, 
<br />
medical waste, industrial waste, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge 
<br />
market of used tires are all converted in the Biosphere Process. LETH also
<br />
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a 
<br />
continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
<br />
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid. 
<br />
<br />LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
<br />
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and 
<br />
electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government 
<br />
with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate permitting, 
<br />
installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process 
<br />
System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department 
<br />
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of 
<br />
Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the 
<br />
floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel 
<br />
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement. 
<br />
<br />LETH has begun to catch the profit-making attention of investors by 
<br />
embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem while a major push 
<br />
for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
<br />
topic due to shortages and massive power failures. LETH contains all the 
<br />
ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas, 
<br />
waste and electrical energy, reaches unprecedented levels. We view this 
<br />
perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts 
<br />
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales records. We 
<br />
are seeing substantial gains for early investors in a ground floor opportunity 
<br />
that carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits.
