<br />Aharon&gt; Dear Chuck,
<br />
<br />Hello.
<br />
<br />Aharon&gt;         I hope you don't mind me writing to you directly. I sent this
<br />
Aharon&gt; problem to the mailing list, which I asssume you read, but got no
<br />
Aharon&gt; response.
<br />
<br />Yes, I do read it and I saw your notes the other day.  I've been
<br />
pretty busy lately, which delays responses (obviously).  Sometimes I'm
<br />
able to give near instantanious responses, sometimes it takes a few
<br />
days, and sometimes I may forget to respond altogether. :)
<br />
<br />I was also waiting to see if anyone else using fvwm under DEC Alphas
<br />
had anything to say about the problem.
<br />
<br />I do normally prefer people to go through the mailing list, but the
<br />
occasional note sent directly to me is ok (and for some notes, more
<br />
appropriate).
<br />
<br />Aharon&gt; The people I spoke to at Digital about this problem said they
<br />
Aharon&gt; had been in contact with you in the past,
<br />
<br />Hmm.  Perhaps, but it's not coming to me right now.  If so, I probably
<br />
have their notes saved.  I'll have to take a look when I get a chance
<br />
(I have a LOT of fvwm related mail in several folders right now).
<br />
Otherwise, they may have been in contact with Rob before he 'retired'.
<br />
<br />Aharon&gt; and suggested I write to you - so here goes.
<br />
<br />Aharon&gt;         To make a long story short, can you tell me if the
<br />
Aharon&gt; fvwm code relates to window and icon titles as compound text,
<br />
Aharon&gt; or as regular text ?  For details, please read the following,
<br />
Aharon&gt; and if that is not enough, I'll be happy to supply any other
<br />
Aharon&gt; information that I can.
<br />
<br />The quick response is that I believe fvwm is treating all text as just
<br />
normal ASCII strings right now.  There isn't any international text
<br />
support in there right now.
<br />
<br />I've been considering adding some support, but it hasn't been high on
<br />
my list.  Getting docs updated and taking care of performance issues &amp;
<br />
bugs has been has been more important, which I'm sure you'll agree.
<br />
<br />Then I'll get the first official release out the door so I can start
<br />
handling the bigger work items I have planned for fvwm.  This may fall
<br />
into that category, I'm not sure having not really investigated it
<br />
yet.
<br />
<br />Although this has been in the back of my mind, I never put it on the
<br />
TO-DO list as an investigation item, so I'll do so now.
<br />
<br />I believe that some of the folks on this list from Japan have done
<br />
some work in this area as well.  Perhaps they can also offer some
<br />
insight.
<br />
<br />Chuck
