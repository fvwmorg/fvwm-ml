.IP "Replace [ \fIAnim\fP ]"
Causes the current window's position to be re-computed using the initial
window placement logic.  Basically, the window is moved to where it would have
been if it were a new window that had just appeared.  Most useful with Smart
or Clever (ReallySmart) placement.  If the optional argument \fIAnim\fP is
specified, an animated move is used to place the window in its new position.
