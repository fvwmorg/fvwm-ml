# Configuration file for FVWM 2.xx originally by Lars Wirzenius

#
#
# This file can be used both as the system.fvwmrc and the per-user 
# ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
# It uses certain `hooks' (files stored in /etc/X11/fvwm or ~/.fvwm) to allow
# the system administrator and user to modify menus, colors, and so on without
# having to change this file.
#
# The defaults that this file sets up follow my own taste.  They attempt to set
# up a nice, easy, comfortable environment for the "ordinary" user.  However,
# using the hooks, it should be possible to change anything.
#
# Please read /usr/share/doc/fvwm/README.sysrc.gz for more information.
#
# Hopefully, you will never have to modify this file.
#

#
# Section: pre.hook
#
# Use pre.hook for things that need to be done before anything else.
# For example, various paths (IconPath, PixmapPath, ModulePath) might
# be defined here.
#


ImagePath /usr/local/share/icons:/usr/share/icons:/usr/share/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/share/icons:/usr/share/icons:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/X11R6/include/bitmaps:/usr/share/fvwm/images:/home/marc/.fvwm/images

#ModulePath /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.6 
#
# Section: Various global settings
#
# These settings are personal.
# If you need to modify them, do so in post.hook.
#

#
# DeskTopSize sets the size of the desktop in units of physical screen
# `pages'.  I prefer to use a single desktop with multiple pages,
# but many people like having multiple desktops.  I thinks its confusing.
#

DeskTopSize 2x2

#
# I like to be able to move between pages or desks simply by moving
# the mouse against the screen border.  I find it very useful.  The
# following command enables this behaviour.  To disable it, the
# command EdgeScroll 0 0 could be placed in the post.hook.
#

EdgeScroll 100 100

#
# When moving a window against the edge of the screen, it is
# nice to have a small resistance before the window is moved outside
# the screen.  This makes it easier to line windows against the
# edges.  I have also added some resistance to scrolling at the edges
# of the screen
#

EdgeResistance 250 100
OpaqueMoveSize 50

#
# Section: Styles, colors, fonts, and related things
#
# This section defines the looks, behavior, and other attributes of windows.
# These are also quite personal.  Modify them in post.hook.
#

#
# The following sets window colors.  This is highly personal,
# of course, and I (jdg) have changed it to something I like!!  Feel
# free to destroy my choices in your post.hook!!
#

# Put the defaults in a separate decor so decor users can ignore them

# Section: Mouse bindings
#
# This section defines the mouse bindings, that is, all the things that
# can be done with the mouse.
#

#
# Each button gives a different menu from the background (root window).
#

Mouse 1   R  A  Menu root-menu
Mouse 2   R  A  Menu Window-Ops 
Mouse 3   R  A  WindowList

#
# Moving and resizing, depending on which part of the window
# you grab (T=title bar, S=side/top/bottom, F=corner).
#

Mouse 0 T A move-and-raise-or-raiselower
#This caused problems with emacs selection (Bug #17668).
#Mouse 0 W M move-and-raise-or-raiselower
Mouse 0 W M   -
Mouse 0 F A resize-or-raiselower
Mouse 0 S A resize-or-raiselower

#
# Move or de-iconify an icon.
#

Mouse 0 I A move-or-winmenu-or-deiconify

#
# Buttons on the title bar (1,3,5,7,9 are on the left, 0,8,6,4,2 on
# the right side of the title bar).  Note that the bindings here
# make more sense if the ButtonStyle's defined earlier are retained.
#

Mouse 0 1 A Close

Mouse 0 5 A Iconify

#
# Section: Key bindings
#
# This section binds some actions to keys.  The bindings have been inspired
# by MWM, Windows, and nightmares.  Everything that these key bindings do,
# can be done without them.  Therefore they should not be too much of a
# burden on new users, but it definitely _can_ be confusing to press a
# key by accident and have it do something completely unexpected.

#
# Section: Functions
#
# This section defines various functions.  Not all of these are used by
# the default bindings, but they can be useful for a user who wants to
# customize things.
#
#
# The following functions operate on a window or menu.  The
# names are systematic: foo means "do foo"; foo-or-bar means
# "do foo, if mouse is moving, bar if click"; and foo-or-bar-or-baz
# adds "baz, if double-clicked".
