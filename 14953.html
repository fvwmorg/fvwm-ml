</em><br />
<br />Chad&gt; Hello Everyone (including Chuck),
<br />
<br />Howdy.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; After installing and using fvwm2 for about a week now, I have
<br />
Chad&gt; been very impressed with its performance.
<br />
<br />Glad to hear it.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; However, I have found a few of problems that appear to be bugs
<br />
Chad&gt; of some sort,
<br />
<br />Of course...
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; 1)  When I create an rlogin button, that is
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; *FvwmButtons Routh xterm-sun.xpm Exec &quot;routh&quot; xterm -geometry
<br />
Chad&gt; 80x40 -T routh -e rlogin -lfred routh &amp;
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; The button does not pop back up afterwards, but stays stuck down
<br />
Chad&gt; forever.  If I use rsh instead of creating an xterm locally,
<br />
Chad&gt; then the button pops back up right away.  However, it is not
<br />
Chad&gt; always possible to use csh due to security methods on some
<br />
Chad&gt; workstations.  I noticed this problem with Netscape as well.  I
<br />
Chad&gt; have a button for Netscape that always sticks.
<br />
<br />Odd.  The line looks ok.  Use FvwmIdent to find out the Name of the
<br />
xterm when it comes up, to make sure it's being set to &quot;routh&quot;.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; 2)  I installed fvwm2 to use on a SPARCstation 20 with SunOS
<br />
Chad&gt; 4.1.3, which acts as a server for several other machines.
<br />
Chad&gt; Everything works fine on the 20, and on our SPARCstation 1's,
<br />
Chad&gt; but on our SPARC IPC there is a problem with changing pages
<br />
Chad&gt; using the mouse.  When the mouse is moved vertically off the
<br />
Chad&gt; screen then it flips to the next screen (page) perfectly.  But,
<br />
Chad&gt; when the the mouse is moved horizontally off the screen then it
<br />
Chad&gt; does not flip to the next page unless the mouse is moved *VERY*
<br />
Chad&gt; slowly.  I have tried adjusting the EdgeResistance from 0 0
<br />
Chad&gt; through 350 100, and nothing fixed this behavior.  In my opinion
<br />
Chad&gt; this bug is the most serious that I have seen with fvwm2 because
<br />
Chad&gt; flipping pages by mouse motion is one of the *best* features of
<br />
Chad&gt; fvwm2.
<br />
<br />I've never seen this problem before.  I just played with it a little
<br />
right now, and my horizontal and vertical edge scrolling are both the
<br />
same speed, and react equally well to slow and fast mouse movement,
<br />
although an EdgeResistance w/ a low first param seemed better for fast
<br />
movement.  Not sure what to tell you here...
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; 3)  If the SaveDesk module is used, with a 'Read .fvwmdesk' at
<br />
Chad&gt; the end of the .fvwm2rc file, then FvwmForm no longer works,
<br />
Chad&gt; i.e. I have a QuitVerify module that uses FvwmForm as given in
<br />
Chad&gt; the FvwmForm man page and this works so long as the 'Read
<br />
Chad&gt; .fvwmdesk' is not used.  A strange bug!?
<br />
<br />This is probably because FvwmForm doesn't use the standard config
<br />
reading function, but rather reads the .fvwm2rc itself directly.  This
<br />
has been fixed for the next release.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; 4)  If FvwmBacker is used to set up some intial backgrounds with
<br />
Chad&gt; xpmroot or xv or xsetroot, the 'xv -root -quit -max
<br />
Chad&gt; filename.gif' is used from a menu to set a background on one
<br />
Chad&gt; desk, then all of the desks are changed to that image.  Flipping
<br />
Chad&gt; desks does not change back to the default background.  If
<br />
Chad&gt; xpmroot is used from a menu, then only the current desk is
<br />
Chad&gt; changed, but when flipping back to this desk, the default
<br />
Chad&gt; background is back.  This is because FvwmBacker has not been
<br />
Chad&gt; made aware of this change.  A proper cure for both of these
<br />
Chad&gt; problems is to provide a way for menu items to send commands
<br />
Chad&gt; directly to FvwmBacker or any other module for that matter.
<br />
Chad&gt; Todd Fries offered a nice solution to this problem by using a
<br />
Chad&gt; complex function and Read command with a separate file for each
<br />
Chad&gt; background, each file containing the command to be passed to the
<br />
Chad&gt; FvwmBacker module.
<br />
<br />I just played with these situations, and couldn't reproduce the xv
<br />
problem (I had the 'correct' behavior, explained next).  The xpmroot
<br />
'problem' is the correct behavior.  FvwmBacker gets new desk messages
<br />
from fvwm, and runs the specified commands.  So setting the background
<br />
manually, then changing desks should cause FvwmBacker to reset it to
<br />
what it should.
<br />
<br />If you want to manually set the backgrounds, then you should probably
<br />
kill FvwmBacker when you do (use a function that runs xv or xpmroot
<br />
and does a KillModule on FvwmBacker), and restart FvwmBacker when you
<br />
want it running again.  Or you could use the multiple config file
<br />
reread solution, which is useful for many things.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; 5)  When the FvwmConfig is used to to change the default Back
<br />
Chad&gt; and Fore colors of window borders, the FvwmButtons bar loses its
<br />
Chad&gt; Style ClickToFocus.
<br />
<br />I've never played with this module, but I'll look into this problem.
<br />
<br />Chad&gt; Has anyone else experienced these problems or does anyone have
<br />
Chad&gt; hacks or work-arounds for them?  In my opinion, these issued
<br />
Chad&gt; need to be addressed before an official non-beta version of
<br />
Chad&gt; fvwm2 can be released.
<br />
<br />When the first official release goes out, there are still going to be
<br />
several bugs.  And many people will find ones that no one else sees
<br />
and that others can't reproduce.  It (or any other program) will never
<br />
be completely bug free.  At some point (when it seems least harmful)
<br />
the bullet must be bitten and it gets officially released.
<br />
<br />My main concern is cleaning up the make and install process (for the
<br />
most part anyways) and any easy to fix, commonly encountered bugs that
<br />
are particularly annoying, then get it out there.  It's been in beta
<br />
for quite a while.  Then take care of the rest (and the million more
<br />
that will get reported) as I (we) can.  Especially since some fairly
<br />
big changes are going to be needed to take care of some things, and
<br />
any changes (to any program) potentially introduce or uncover more
<br />
bugs.
