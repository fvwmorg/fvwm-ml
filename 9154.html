LICENSING:
<br />
----------
<br />
For school purchases of five to ten (5-10) or more units, depending on the product, please call 800-679-7007 for even deeper discounts on license packs.   
<br />
----------
<br />
For hundreds of other software products available from CPE at similar discounts, call us at 800-679-7007. 
<br />
<br />Academic Edition software is exactly the same as the Full-Retail versions* except that it has been deeply discounted for Qualified Education Buyers.  
<br />
<br />No verification is required for purchases of Microsoft Office XP Standard.  
<br />
<br />For all other products, purchasers must provide fax-verification of status as being a current faculty, staff, or student.  After placing your order, you simply fax to CPE either: (a) a copy of a current picture School I.D. Card or, (b) a current paycheck stub with an alternative picture I.D. (drivers license, etc.).  Schools may purchase by faxing a valid school purchase order.  For more details, call us for our website address.
<br />
<br />All software sold by CPE is authentic original software from the manufacturer.  THESE ARE NOT PIRATED COPIES.  ALL SOFTWARE COMES IN ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER'S BOXES AND INCLUDES A VALID LICENSE.
<br />
<br />CPE is an Authorized Education Reseller for Microsoft, Adobe, Corel, Symantec and many other major software manufacturers. CPE is a national software distributor committed to providing the lowest prices possible to the Education community with the best customer service!!
<br />
<br />All prices and availability are subject to change without notice.  
<br />
<br />*Some Academic Edition boxes may not include supplemental materials, such as extra fonts, image libraries, or third-party(OEM) products, which are included in the Full-Retail versions.  However, the core-programs themselves are exactly the same.
