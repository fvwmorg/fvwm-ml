One thing doesn't seem to be clear from the docs/modules.tex file about
the new Send_ConfigInfo command: it doesn't indicate whether or not the
lines sent from fvwm are each supposed to end with a newline. 

I'm guessing that they are, based on the fact that using the line

    *FvwmButtons Restart eye2.xpm     Restart fvwm2

elicits this error message from fvwm, which is apparently trying to exec
"fvwm2\n" instead of "fvwm2":

    [FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2
    ' failed!!!!

...so either FvwmButtons should be stripping the newline, or fvwm
shouldn't be sending it.  (Right?)

Also: there are a few features I'd like to see in fvwm2 that aren't on
the TO-DO list as of PL42, in case anyone's interested...

- - there doesn't appear to be any way to move the pointer to an absolute
  position (e.g. centre of current viewport); CursorMove is relative to
  the current pointer position, and Focus is relative to some window...

- - Any plans for support routines for modules to be written in Tcl/Tk?

- - There should probably be a builtin configuration command to correspond
  to the (currently undocumented in the man page) '-blackout' option.
  It might not be useful during startup, but changing it for recaptures
  might be useful.  Likewise, it might be helpful to turn -debug on and
  off....

- - Using '#' as a comment character makes FvwmCpp rather difficult to
  use; one has to insert a space before each '#', and some cpp's will
  *still* complain in certain cases.  Could a secondary comment
  character be added, perhaps?  (Maybe '/', so that comment lines can be
  surrounded with /* ... */ -- which will also stop cpp from complaining
  about unterminated character constants whenever your comment contains
  an apostrophe....)

Cheers,
