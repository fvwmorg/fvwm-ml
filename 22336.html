<br />
I'd like to make a couple of queries and make a few observations -
<br />
<br />I basically use a setup with a taskbar (based on fvwmbuttons) - most of
<br />
it double decked ('Start menu',clock and launch bar upper, swallowed
<br />
Iconman lower,Swallowed double height pppload,xload,pager,exit and lock
<br />
buttons to the Right.frvwm 2.0.46 (1280x1024,16bpp)XF3.3.2.1
<br />
<br />Queries
<br />
<br />This setup, along with the popup menues use a large quantity of mini
<br />
icons - I find that if there's to many windows open, the mini icons in
<br />
the icon man, and the icons in the title bars do not appear - I assume
<br />
this is hitting some kind of resource limit but where? Is this an X
<br />
problem?, an fvvwm problem? is there an answer?
<br />
<br />2nd problem, I have the smart window placement on, I find windows
<br />
appear behind the taskbar (which being sticky/nohandles is a pain) - is
<br />
there anything that can be done to prevent this?
<br />
<br />Observations
<br />
<br />I have tried Afterstep, fvwm95, and have looked at several other
<br />
alternatives including Enlightenment (wince) and KDE - My setup as it
<br />
stands is very clean and unobtrusive, on screen, all that is normally
<br />
visible is the taskbar. Virtually all other window managers I've seen
<br />
(ok they're showing off the features) seen to waste acres of desk space
<br />
3d icons all over the place (which are always large, text titles,
<br />
ditto) - Am I in a minority of 1 in believing these people spend more
<br />
time admiring their desktops than doing anything useful with them ?
<br />
Unfashionable possibly but I see fvwm as 'serious' but without the
<br />
'heaviness' of motif or the rawness of some of the other older wms. 
<br />
<br />Wishlist
<br />
Firstly one of the things I did like about Afterstep was the pop-out
<br />
button bars, can't recall what it was called but definitely less
<br />
clutter, a good idea.
<br />
<br />Secondly I'd like to see Iconmanager have an option to do without the
<br />
titles - I'd rather just have icons, possibly with a 'bubble help' for
<br />
the text.
<br />
<br />Thirdly there does seem to be a shortage of good mini-icons, lots of 3d
<br />
ones which in the small format are totally incomprehensible, but few
<br />
clear simple ones (sounds easy but I've tried it, it ain't).
<br />
<br />Ideally I would like to be able to select alternative setups from a menu
<br />
(eg alternative button bar configs)
<br />
<br />Simple suggestion - In addition to the usual Window ops, I'd like a
<br />
'Centre' command ie regardless of where an app currently is, minimised
<br />
or otherwise, raise it to the top and centre it on the current screen.
<br />
<br />On the subject of Gnome,KDE and their ilk, (and indeed redhat and their
<br />
rpms and 'Another level' setup, I think that there are a lot of dangers
<br />
in going to mechanisms which abstract the users in the name of 'user
<br />
friendliness' - RPMs, user setup 'helpers' etc are fine, with one
<br />
proviso - namely one can turn the wretched things off, otherwise ones
<br />
going to simply reinvent Win95, fine if it works, if it doesn't, tough
<br />
noone can help because it's an inpenetrable morass. 
<br />
Fvwm is currently text file based, by Linux standards well documented
<br />
but possibly to a newbie a bit frightening - by all means add helpers,
<br />
but please make them output simple text files we can edit directly.
<br />
<br />As for earlier discussions on Gnome and KDE, I think there are benefits
<br />
worth having in associating with one of the 2, my personal preference
<br />
being Gnome (OK I'll come clean, I'm just sick and tired of KDE
<br />
activists recommending KDE appps for every other query in
<br />
comp.os.linux.x regardless of how suitable they are...
<br />
comp.os.linux.advocacy.kde anyone?)
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
Kim
