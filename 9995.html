<br />
Hello,
<br />
<br />I have been browsing through the man-page of fvwm for ages.
<br />
I searched in the Mailing-list but it did not help me out either.
<br />
<br />So the problem is the following:
<br />
<br />On my Mandrake 9.1 I have 3 XServers (all of them running fvwm 2.5.7 
<br />
WITHOUT Xinerama) at the same time.
<br />
But since the monitors attached to the XServers are not all running with 
<br />
the same resolutions, it would be fine, not all have the same resolution. 
<br />
I use more or less one page for each application. Therefore I want them to 
<br />
be maximized right from the start.
<br />
Is this possible via Styles? (Ok it would be possible to write a function 
<br />
for each application, and then by calling this function the application 
<br />
would get started and AFTERWARDS maximized by the function. But I do not 
<br />
like this, because of the mess of Functions to create on the one hand, and 
<br />
due to the fact, that sometimes I start them from a terminal (and there 
<br />
this fvwm-function is not directly accessible.)
<br />
<br />So what I was looking for was something like:
<br />
<br />Style XTerm StartMaximized
<br />
<br />but I could not find anything.
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />
This leads to the second question ... geometry. It is possible to set the 
<br />
geometry of application via several ways, but I cannot get the most usable 
<br />
(for my case) working at all.
<br />
Since I use FvwmButtons on my second display, I do not want the 
<br />
applications Maximized there. I want them a bit less than maximized. Just 
<br />
as big, such that I can see/use all buttons. But on the first display the 
<br />
application should be as large as the resolution is. Same for the third 
<br />
display.
<br />
Since fvwm allows different files for different displays, it would be fine 
<br />
to have the geometry in the Styles section of my config-files.
<br />
But I just cannot get this sorted out. I tried tons of things, but all 
<br />
sorts of different syntax for
<br />
<br />Style XTerm Geometry: 10x10+0+0
<br />
<br />did not work. How to write this correctly? (Meanwhile I have written a 
<br />
script for the applications I use more often, which checks the value of 
<br />
$DISPLAY an then sets the parameters correctly. But I'd prefer to have 
<br />
this in the fvwm configuration.)
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />
And finally the third question, which is probably not directly related to 
<br />
this: Moving applications. First of all, let me remind you, that I do NOT 
<br />
use Xinerama. On the one hand it slows down my system dramatically. (I was 
<br />
mean while told, that this is due to my second graphic card, which is 
<br />
probably too old and cheap in order to be useable with Xinerama.) On the 
<br />
other I recon it to be a more productive environment, when not having to 
<br />
fiddle around with Stickyness of Windows in order not to loose them when 
<br />
switching Pages on other displays.
<br />
But now for the question.
<br />
What I want to is to move an application from :0.0 COMPLETELY to :0.1
<br />
So I have running maple running on :0.0 . Then when pleased with the 
<br />
results I want them to write down in emacs. emacs also runs on :0.0 . So 
<br />
either make both applications fit on one page (or make the sticky, 
<br />
stayontop, whatever), or save the file in Maple. Start maple on :0.1 and 
<br />
load the saved file, in order to see both applications at the same time.
<br />
<br />I was told, that xmove (a pseudo XServer) should deal with such problems, 
<br />
but after compiling and setting up, it never showed any windows (not only 
<br />
in fvwm, but also in IceWM. And I got reports, that IceWM is capable of 
<br />
doing xmove-things. So it not a problem of fvwm -- its a problem of me 
<br />
getting xmove to run at all.)
<br />
<br />But as fvwm has SO many things included by itself, and since I want to 
<br />
move the application from an fvwm-managed XServer to another fvwm-managed 
<br />
XServer (notably both on the same machine) I thought, that there maybe 
<br />
something hidden somewhere in fvwm, that might assist me.
<br />
Probably not, but if I would not have asked, I'd propably hate myself for 
<br />
not asking, if there was something :-D
<br />
<br /><br />Of course I know that it is not good, to have three questions in one email 
<br />
to a list, but 2 of them are really closely connected -- and well the 
<br />
third just dropped in be, lets say by ... mistake.
<br />
<br /><br />Best regards and keep up the good work,
<br />
Christian Aistleitner
