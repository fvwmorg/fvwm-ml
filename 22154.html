<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; I agree with the points you have made.
<br />
<br />The problem is that the features you're alluding to often work across
<br />
application boundaries and areas of responsibility in UNIX and X
<br />
windows.  This, I think, is a Good Thing, but it can make the seems look
<br />
more rough.
<br />
<br />Things are really starting to come together with the advent of Gnome and
<br />
(although I don't like it on philosophical terms) KDE.  Spurred by Linux
<br />
development and groups like Debian and RedHat, I think you'll see a big
<br />
push towards full GUI configurability for many basic tools very soon.
<br />
<br />Heck, RedHat 5 already has many GUI tools for doing standard sysadmin
<br />
stuff; I configured my printer, including solving the infamous
<br />
&quot;stair-stepping output&quot; problem, with a very easy-to-use little GUI app
<br />
and a few mouse clicks.
<br />
<br />Someone posted a graphical tool for modifying window manager
<br />
configurations, that supported fvwm2.  You couldn't do everything, of
<br />
course, but you could do a reasonable amount of stuff.  I haven't used
<br />
it and I forget the name, but you might consider that.
<br />
<br />Also, you can go look at tkgoodstuff which is an alternative to
<br />
FvwmButtons writtine in tcl/tk that is completely GUI-configurable: you
<br />
create buttons and popup menus, etc. and move them with drag-n-drop,
<br />
etc. etc.  Pretty simple to use, although FvwmButtons is more powerful.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; b) the mnenu system is great.  I tried to mimick this with Fvwm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; I created a directory tree unfe rmy Fvwm configuration directory
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; called menu.  In their, Is tarted by making links to the programs
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; or scripts I would execute, or making simple sccript wwrappers in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; place.  I had an perl script that was read in through FvwmPipe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; that travereded this directory making a menu tree as it went.  It
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; worked fairly well until I wanted to add custom mini icons, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; created a small etxt foile for each one.  It last its cleanliness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bs&gt; then.
<br />
<br />You should go look at wmconfig, created by someone at RedHat.  This tool
<br />
reads config files and generates menu output for various window
<br />
managers.  The idea is that tools ship with a wmconfig file and install
<br />
it when you install them, then the tools automatically appear on your
<br />
popup window (if you configure your WM to invoke wmconfig).  It allows
<br />
for mini-icons, etc. and is pretty nice--the next version will be even
<br />
better :).
<br />
<br />Many of the RedHat RPM's come with these config files.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I don't think most of this is correctly discussed in the fvwm
<br />
mailing lists; the right place to solve them isn't by adding more code
<br />
to fvwm, but creating tools which more seemlessly integrate existing
<br />
apps--this is a &quot;desktop&quot; concept.  I think you should go look at Gnome
<br />
and/or KDE, and see what they're up to.
