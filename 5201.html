<br />
| &gt; an index or suchlike, making several windows, inevitably overlapping my
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
| Do you know you can get Mozilla to open new windows in tabs?
<br />
<br />Yes, but it's only useful to me about half the time (and my unconscious
<br />
keyboard habits know the &quot;open new window&quot; trick too well). For news
<br />
item windows the tabbed approach should work very nicely - I will be making
<br />
a conscious effort to use it more.
<br />
<br />For other windows I want to deal with as standalone entities, either
<br />
for positioning purposes (eg to put then side by side) or for putting on
<br />
other desktops etc, it doesn't cut it. I already have fast and convenient
<br />
methods of window placement and arrangement mediated by FVWM, and using
<br />
a separate Mozilla-internal method for them seems ... clunky.
<br />
<br />Also, Mozilla seems to want me to adopt a tabbed or new window approach
<br />
unilaterally. I would normally expect to use both. But I can't seem
<br />
to bind, say, middle-click to &quot;new window&quot; and something else equally
<br />
convenient such as &quot;shift middle click&quot; to &quot;new tab&quot;. I must pick one or
<br />
the other and dig tediously through a menu popup for the the converse.
<br />
Other tools (fvwm, mutt, screen(?)) whih have key bindings let you attach
<br />
functions to arbirary things fairly easily. I gather such a mechanism
<br />
exists for Mozilla, but it's either ill documented or opaque. I have
<br />
yet to find a clear description of where to put such configs or what
<br />
functions one might attach to keys or mouse buttons.
<br />
<br />Finally, I frequently create new Mozilla windows from the keyboard.
<br />
I have several tiny scripts which use netscape-remote to get mozilla
<br />
to open a window with a search result (&quot;fm&quot; for freshmeat, &quot;google&quot;
<br />
for google, etc) or more generally with an arbitrary URL. Of a morning I
<br />
routinely say &quot;hi comics&quot; which opens several comic pages at once and a
<br />
bit later &quot;hi nerd&quot; which opens some nerdly news channels like slashdot,
<br />
and so forth. In the current scheme I must wait for them all to pop up
<br />
(which is quite slow often) before I can do things. If they popped up
<br />
in the place I wanted (as my Netscape windows used to, for it does obey
<br />
its geometry settings) I could happily process email or something in my
<br />
shell window while it happened.
<br />
<br />| I don't normally like MIDI applications but in the case of the
<br />

<br />
<br />MIDI? I only know the electronic music acronym. What do you mean here?
<br />
<br />Now, Mozilla is merely the most painful offender in this regard.
<br />
While I have taken some care to place new windows, and new terminals
<br />
always pop up in exactly the same place for me (which is what I want)
<br />
it would be quite handy for random apps to use SmartPlacement, but to
<br />
avoid overlapping the focus window as a priority, or perhaps the mouse
<br />
alone (in focus follows mouse mode, which would suffice to keep that
<br />
window usable, though visible is also desirable). I rarely have much
<br />
root window showing, so new windows usually must overlap something.
<br />
<br />On reflection I suspect I should have taken this to fvwm-workers.
<br />
<br />I'll get Moz1.0rc3 this morning and see if its tabbedness is more
<br />
flexible. Thanks for the suggestion,
<br />
