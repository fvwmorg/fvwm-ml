[First, a note to non-US readers, or those who may not be as familiar with
<br />
slang phrases. The saying &quot;beating a dead horse&quot; means continuing to debate an
<br />
issue long after everything has been said-- in essence, repetition of the same
<br />
set of arguments over and over. It derives from a centuries-old practice of
<br />
using horses to pull loads, carriages, etc. To get more performance out of the
<br />
horse, the master would beat its flanks with a crop. But if you pushed too
<br />
hard, the poor beast would just up and die on you. To continue &quot;beating a dead
<br />
horse&quot; accomplishes nothing.]
<br />
<br />I was inclined to pipe in on the original thread, but it didn't take long for
<br />
it to turn into a circular repetition of the same arguments. Speaking as some-
<br />
one who has contributed patches and developed a Perl 5 extension for module
<br />
authoring, I have to say that the &quot;Rats from a ship&quot; thread is beating a dead
<br />
horse.
<br />
<br />Try to remember, you are using a package that is freely available, unlike
<br />
OpenView or Motif. Those products have development teams devoted to them,
<br />
because Sun and OSF (respectively) can budget some of the revenue into further
<br />
development. Fvwm is, at its core, the effort of one person. There are a lot
<br />
of engineering issues surrounding team development, and when the team is in
<br />
fact scattered across the globe, linked only by the Internet, those issues can
<br />
become amplified. Don't believe me? Ask anyone working on a GNU project.
<br />
<br />In recent weeks, the primary author of Fvwm has chimed in to offer explanation
<br />
as to *why* he has not bundled a new release recently. Fvwm is not his day job.
<br />
And since this isn't a vendor-supported project, there aren't others to carry
<br />
the torch while he attends to other priorities.
<br />
<br />In short, it can be said that while no one should complacently accept Fvwm's
<br />
not-optimal code as the end of the development line, the users should accept
<br />
the fact that Fvwm does work, works well, and that the current developer is not
<br />
sitting on his bum doing nothing, but will in fact continue to develop the
<br />
product.
<br />
<br />Now, if someone wanted to contribute to such an effort, I have no doubt that
<br />
such things as coverage analysis, memory usage/leakage analysis, code structure
<br />
etc. would be of use not only to Charles, but to anyone eager to volunteer to
<br />
assist him.
<br />
<br />Randy
