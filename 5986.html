<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situations. I have tried this with sloppy and follow-mouse focus, on 2.4.6,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2.4.8 and 2.5.2.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me it works as usual, but it always was always a bit random.

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe the last window created (e.g. Pager or buttons) gets the focus instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the one under the mouse after the restart has finished?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A possible conection: if I PipeRead from FvwmTalk something which destroys and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creates windows (e.g. Pager, Buttons) then after the PipeRead in 2.2 FvwmTalk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; still has the focus with sloppy and follows policy, whereas is loses it with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; click focus (as you would expect). However, in 2.4 and 2.5 FvwmTalk has lost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the focus regardless of policy. (Of course, FvwmTalk has changed so this could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be a red herring).
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I recommend to use FvwmConsole instead of FvwmTalk.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Or, if I select a menu item, which does a PipeRead that causes a new window to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be started (e.g. xbiff), the new window ends up with the focus even though the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mouse is left where it was when it selected the (sub-sub) menu, say now over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an xterm. In 2.2 the xterm would now get the focus (this is with follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mouse/sloppy focus of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have some PipeReads which are executed via InitFunction and RestartFunction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, if PipeRead has changed its behaviour in this way, then that could be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real cause of the start up / restart non-focus problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bottom line: has something like a ``recheck focus policy and current mouse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; position'' operation gone AWOL from the end of a PipeRead? :-) Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deliberately changed then -- is that really the best functionality?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It was not reliable in 2.2.x and screwed up some more advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions.  Therefore I rewrote the code keeping track of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; focus during function execution to be more reliable, at the cost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of some small changes in focus handling.  
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suggest a good principle: with follows mouse/sloppy focus, if the mouse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; over a window that can take focus then that window has the focus -- at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by the time Fvwm becomes `quiescent' again.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above.  It's almost always easy to restore the focus with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Focus&quot; command explicitly in your scripts.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for your clues -- mainly you stopped me looking in the wrong places. I
<br />
now realise that the lack of focus at start up and after restart was caused by
<br />
GrabFocus for certain windows being started which were click to focus (e.g.
<br />
xbiff, pager), even though most were sloppy focus. I just needed to add
<br />
GrabFocusOff to xbiff, pager etc..
<br />
<br />Having thought a little about this, I have a suggestion to make.
<br />
<br />The default GrabFocus for ClickToFocus and GrabFocusOff for MouseFocus are
<br />
sensible, only if all windows have the same focus policy. In a mixed policy
<br />
regime, perhaps the policy of the window which currently has focus should be
<br />
taken into account before giving focus to a newly created window. I am tempted
<br />
to suggest another pair of styles called, say, ReleaseFocus and
<br />
ReleaseFocusOff.
<br />
<br />ReleaseFocus would be default for ClickToFocus, and ReleaseFocusOff would be
<br />
default for MouseFocus (and SloppyFocus). A new window would get the focus if
<br />
and only if it has GrabFocus style, AND the current window has ReleaseFocus
<br />
style.
<br />
<br />What do you think?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bye
