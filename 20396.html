<br />
About all this rat discussion. I think people are being a bit harsh about
<br />
Chuck. I only have one nit about 2.0.45 (after I quit netscape I can't use my
<br />
number pad to switch pages like I usually do until I switch pages using
<br />
FvwmPager). Other than that, I certainly haven't been inconvienanced at all by
<br />
there not being a new fvwm version. I maintain a module for fvwm (FvwmIconMan)
<br />
and I've been happily releasing new versions of it over the last few months
<br />
that people can use without having to wait for a new fvwm. This is cool. It's
<br />
not something that the competitors can claim, since they don't have modules.
<br />
<br />Now, as for possible new directions for fvwm, or writing a new window manager,
<br />
here are my thoughts. I've been tinkering with this for the last few months,
<br />
and if I had the time it's something I would really like to do. But there's
<br />
that pesky matter of a thesis ...
<br />
<br />To me fvwm has two cool features: modules and ICCCM compliance. It's the only
<br />
viable window manager with the first, and it seems heads and shoulders above
<br />
most others in the second. 
<br />
<br />A better window manager (to me) would take the module idea to the logical
<br />
extreme:
<br />
<br />1. The current fvwm type modules could benefit from a more symmetrical,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tightly coupled interface. If modules had controlled access to fvwm state,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the window list or the window decorations, they could do cool stuff. 
<br />
<br />2. Other things could be modularized as well. I envision modules for every way
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that fvwm interacts with it's environment: a config module which handles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading the .fvw2rc (having configurability and choice here would make it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easy for someone to write a module which propogates configuration info from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one login session to the next, for example), a module which handles window
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decorations (would remove the whole reason for fvwm95's existance), a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;module which handles policy decisions (what's encoded in the Style
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands), a module which interacts with the underlying windowing system
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(boy it would be cool to use fvwm on windows, or you could have nested
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window managers like plan 9), etc.
<br />
<br />3. A major nit for me now is how the cool sexy pixmap code which handles the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new borderstyle stuff is not usable by modules (like FvwmIconMan and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FvwmButtons). My plan is to fix this after fvwm2 is officially released, as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it would require some major code rewriting. In an ideal world it would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nice if there was some module responsible for how everything looked, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else, fvwm and modules included, could rely on it for such
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things. 
<br />
<br />The obvious fear is &quot;Oh god, it's Mach!&quot; This obviously would be a concern,
<br />
but I suspect that's not necessarily the case. If it turns out that everybody
<br />
uses all the same modules, and having all these modules doesn't result in
<br />
meaningful choice, then it would suck because you pay the penaltly without
<br />
getting anything. If however, this supremo modularity allows for lots of
<br />
options, then it's a win. People could use what they want and not have to have
<br />
the rest. We wouldn't have people running off and creating fvwm95 just because
<br />
they want to have different titlebars and a few extra commands. I think the
<br />
Winlist/FvwmIconBox/FvwmWinList/FvwmIconMan situation is a good
<br />
example. People can use which one they want without the memory penalty of
<br />
having all three built in, and I can make changes at will to FvwmIconMan
<br />
without asking anybody's permission. BUT, when the pixmap button/titlebar
<br />
stuff was being added, it really gummed all sorts of things up trying to
<br />
shoehorn it into fvwm.
<br />
<br />I don't care about whether this hypothetical window manager looks as good as
<br />
Enlightenment. I only care that somebody else could write a few modules that
<br />
would make it look as good. 
<br />
<br />If this manager were to be written, whether as fvwm 3.0 or as a totally new
<br />
beast, it's probably unwise to use too much of the current fvwm code. It's
<br />
just not up to it. 
<br />
<br />If anybody sees potential here, and knows how to program and wants to help,
<br />
I'd be happy to talk about it more.
