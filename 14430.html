<br />Graeme&gt; I've just had a look at xcuckoo, and I think it would be a
<br />
Graeme&gt; great idea if fvwm could swallow applications in its title
<br />
Graeme&gt; bars, and generally allow more formatting of the title bars.
<br />
<br />I've got title justification on the TO-DO list.  Someone submitted a
<br />
patch for 1.24r that I've been saving to merge into 2.xx sometime.
<br />
<br />As for the idea of the title bar swallowing apps, I'm not sure about
<br />
the general usefulness of that.  Perhaps in this specific instance it
<br />
makes sense, but what else could it be used for?
<br />
<br />I assume that xcuckoo puts the time somewhere.  Perhaps just a simple
<br />
FvwmClock module that merges the time into the highlighted window's
<br />
title bar would be better (if possible currently).
<br />
<br />Graeme&gt; For instance, you could have formatting of the title, left,
<br />
Graeme&gt; centred and right justified. I currently use 2 Fvwmbutton
<br />
Graeme&gt; modules and I think that if the title button could do more,
<br />
Graeme&gt; then I could get rid of one of them.  Perhaps the title bar
<br />
Graeme&gt; could be controled by a module, however I am not an
<br />
Graeme&gt; experienced X programmer, so I don't have a clue as to how do
<br />
Graeme&gt; this.
<br />
<br />Graeme&gt; Does anyone else think that this would be a good idea?
<br />
<br />I think that the title bars really have to be controlled by fvwm, but
<br />
modules should be able to play with them a little.  If a module could
<br />
get the id for the titlebar window, it could do whatever it wanted to
<br />
the title bar I imagine (including making it swallow an application).
<br />
I'm not sure how 'safe' it would be to do though (i.e. conflicts with
<br />
what fvwm would be trying to do to the titlebar).
<br />
<br />And if a module could get the window id's for the titlebar and the
<br />
buttons, then it could do things like animate the buttons (ala ctwm).
<br />
An interesting feature that I'd much rather see in a module instead of
<br />
wasting space in fvwm, if it were to appear.  The modules don't
<br />
currently get the window ids for the titlebar or buttons, but that
<br />
could be added, I imagine.
<br />
<br />Graeme&gt; Also I think that the quit option should allow a yes/no
<br />
Graeme&gt; choice. I've used Quitverify for a while now(FvwmForm module)
<br />
Graeme&gt; but it seems painfully slow. I've seen olwm logout and it it
<br />
Graeme&gt; about 10 to 20 times faster than Fvwm's as it is almost
<br />
Graeme&gt; instantanious. I reckon that the quit proceedure is too
<br />
Graeme&gt; important to be put in a module and so it should be in the
<br />
Graeme&gt; main code, perhaps as an option to the quit command.
<br />
<br />Graeme&gt; Does anyone have opinions about this?
<br />
<br />As you can probably tell from my other comments (in this and other
<br />
notes), I'd really like to keep as much in modules as possible, so I
<br />
think that FvwmForm is better for doing that than adding the code to
<br />
fvwm to do so.
<br />
<br />Granted, for this example it probably wouldn't be a lot of code added
<br />
to fvwm, but that excuse could be used for a lot of things.  Modules
<br />
are an excellent way to avoid creeping featurism and turning fvwm into
<br />
a bloated evil entity like mwm and dtwm.
<br />
<br />FvwmForm is well suited for things like this, so I say let it do it's
<br />
job.  I just ran it, and it took a second or two to come up, which is
<br />
very noticeable but it wasn't unbearable.  On your machine, perhaps
<br />
it's longer.
