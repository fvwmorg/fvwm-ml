<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; PS: I've just discovered another interesting problem with fvwm that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just more evidence that most people using it are not using real GUI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; applications very much: it doesn't even enforce modal dialog behavior!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Both mwm and olwm have properties that an application sets to indicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that a window is a modal dialog (e.g., an error message) and the user
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must respond to that dialog before continuing to work with the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; window.  MetaCard sets both sets of properties, and fvwm is apparently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not honoring either of them...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I remember correctly, then FVWM allows you to enable/disable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (system) modal dialogs. This is a very good thing! I just hate modal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialogs! I cannot image any situation where they would really be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; required. This is especially true for system modal dialogs. In most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases, when applications sport modal dialogs, these have seriously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been getting in my way and they definitly decreased productivity.
</em><br />
<br />All I can find in the 2.0.43 source regarding this is the
<br />
&quot;MODALITY_IS_EVIL&quot; #define which just changes the properties a Motif
<br />
window (I'm not sure why, perhaps it is just to tell the Motif window
<br />
that modal enforcement is not supported).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion, modal dialogs show that the application programmer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mis-designed the application and that he does not understand how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program event-driven GUI interfaces. These are relicts from the past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that should have been removed long ago.
</em><br />
<br />While I'd agree with you that they should be used sparingly, you'll
<br />
have even less luck convincing UI designers that they're obsolete than
<br />
I've had convincing pointer-focus afficianados that *that's* obsolete
<br />
;-) The fact that nearly all apps on MS-Windows and the Mac use modal
<br />
dialogs is pretty clear evidence that you're way out on the fringe on
<br />
this one.
<br />
<br />And from arwild01_at_starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Alan Wild):

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you'll take a look at some &quot;real&quot; GUI applications, such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Netscape, most of the CDE tools, and MetaCard, you'll see that they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; use modal dialogs.  My hunch is that you can cause program crashes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm. . well, I'll admit that I am ignorant compared to many of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people who frequent this list when it comes X protocol.  However, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your own assertion, Netscape uses modal dialogs.  Now, given my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignorance, I am not sure that I have experienced a modal dialog, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would not the Popup that is activated when I selected Options-&gt;&quot;General
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Preferences&quot; from the pull-downs be a modal dialog?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is, then fvwm handles this correctly, because I have used fvwm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.24 and fvwm2 for about a year and a half and it has ALWAYS behaved the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same; When this dialog is active, I cannot interact whatsoever with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; main window.
</em><br />
<br />Well Netscape does seem to *partially* do the right thing.  Apparently
<br />
they added some internal event-dispatching protection to handle the
<br />
case where the window manager doesn't properly handle the modal
<br />
request.  Still, it's not totally the right thing because the main
<br />
window still gets the focus (the window border changes and the
<br />
insertion cursor resumes flashing) and no feedback (beep) is given to
<br />
the user to indicate that they can't use the main window when they try
<br />
to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, My knowledge is limited, but from my minimal understanding, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have not experienced any problems.  In fact, I use fvwm2 on Linux, AIX,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OSF/1 and HP-UX boxes and I have NEVER had the sorts of problems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you report.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, I think that fvwm2 is one of the greatest programs ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed.  Sure, the source is a bit sloppy and there are bugs, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fvwm lets me create attractive, functional desktop across any UN*X box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've used and always maintained an efficient level of memory usage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fvwm works the way I like it to, and has outperformed almost every other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; window managers I've demo-ed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But enough preaching. . . back to the point at hand.  Is the dialog box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mentioned a modal dialog, and if so, what behavior do you observe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is different from what I get?
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that apparently there is no support whatsoever for
<br />
modal dialogs in fvwm (that I can find, anyway).  The key issue as far
<br />
as Motif applications is concerned is that fvwm is not looking at the
<br />
&quot;input_mode&quot; member structure stored in the _MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom.
<br />
According to the standard include file MwmUtil.h, the _MOTIF_WM_HINTS
<br />
atom is a structure with five elements:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long	flags;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long	functions;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long	decorations;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int		input_mode;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long	status
<br />
<br />In decorations.c, fvwm looks at the &quot;decorations&quot; member, but the
<br />
input_mode member isn't used anywhere I can find.  The values of that
<br />
member are one of:
<br />
<br />/* values for MwmHints.input_mode */
<br />
#define MWM_INPUT_MODELESS          0
<br />
#define MWM_INPUT_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL 1
<br />
#define MWM_INPUT_SYSTEM_MODAL          2
<br />
#define MWM_INPUT_FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL    3
<br />
<br />If there is support for modal dialogs in fvwm someplace I missed, it
<br />
shouldn't be hard to add support for the Motif-standard way of
<br />
specifying it.  If there really is no support, things get a little
<br />
more complicated, since all places where the focus is assigned to a
<br />
window will have to be modified (mwm doesn't allow the focus to go to
<br />
a window at all if a modal transient-for window is open, preventing
<br />
the user from getting confused by a window getting the focus and yet
<br />
not responding to key or mouse presses).  Furthermore, all mouse
<br />
buttons need to be grabbed when the mouse is in the window pointed to
<br />
by the transient-for prop (mwm beeps when you try to use that window).
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a side-note:  FVWM is not just popular among it's developers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Linux users.  According to the X11 window manager homepage it is one THE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most popular window manager across UNIX platforms.  If you notice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to this page fvwm, fvwm95, and afterstep (all direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descendants of fvwm1.24r) are way more popular among voters than mwm and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ol(v)wm.
</em><br />
<br />There is obviously a *serious* survey bias problem here: I've never
<br />
even heard of &quot;afterstep&quot;, yet it is the most popular wm on that
<br />
list.  The &quot;real world&quot; usage pattern is probably more like 95% mwm
<br />
and olwm.  We've only recently started getting bug reports about these
<br />
MetaCard/fvwm compatibility problems, despite MetaCard having been
<br />
available since 1992.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can review the numbers yourself at:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.emptysky.com/xwinman/">http://www.emptysky.com/xwinman/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And although the voting was recently reset, the present results are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty consistent with the results of the list year and a half or so.
</em><br />
<br />I think fvwm is a fine tool, and believe that all the popularity it is
<br />
acquiring is a Good Thing.  But its growing presence makes it even
<br />
more important that it properly support modal dialogs without
<br />
requiring apps (or toolkits) to do keyboard or pointer grabs.
<br />
<br />There is one more point I should make: this is not just for us as an
<br />
application vendor: MetaCard is a GUI *development* tool, which means
<br />
that our *customers* are the ones deciding whether or not they need
<br />
modal dialogs, not us.  Unless you want to tell all of *them* and all
<br />
of *their* customers that it's OK that fvwm does not support modal
<br />
dialogs, then we should start figuring out how to implement this
<br />
functionality.  While we're willing and able to help fix the &quot;active
<br />
focus&quot; problems, I'm afraid that adding support for modal dialogs is
<br />
something that's going to require the attention of somebody that knows
<br />
fvwm internals very well.
