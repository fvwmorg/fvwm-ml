On Thu, 21 Nov 1996 you wrote:

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;These are the basic ideas. I would like to hear some opinions about that.

Well I am no expert on X-windows, but since you asked here is my two cents
<br />
worth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;the current architecture is not adequate to use in an object-oriented design. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So we decided to write the code of the new window manager from scratch.
</em><br />
Objects, sounds great ! If the wm is properly abstracted one could use it as
<br />
a model for other wm. But... what about the infamous C++ code bloat and
<br />
related performance issues ? Other GUI's which are object oriented seam to
<br />
suffer from such issues. N*xt for example, while Macrosoft's object OS has
<br />
been put on the back-burner and it is rumored that the only application MS
<br />
has written using object frameworks is w*rdpad. Personally I prefer object
<br />
methodologies has long as not to much performance is sacrificed. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;clients would have a way to determine some global settings, like color
</em><br />
sets, fonts, desktop size, etc. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Changing these items in the wm would notify the applications about the new
</em><br />
setting, so they could automatically 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take the appropiate decissions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Color management implemented as a color server, possibly compatible with
</em><br />
the Motif one.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Window style management implemented via X resource manager.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some kind of drag and drop support, Motif and/or OffiX compatible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Full (or as closest as possible) M*tif compliance.
</em><br />
Here is where things begin to get cloudy. There are differences between X
<br />
and win95, things such as frame buffers, messages and events methods, to
<br />
name a few. A good article relating to this can be found in the July/August
<br />
1994 issue of The X Journal. It's called Implementing the Windows API on
<br />
U*NIX/M*tif, and it describes the experiences from some one who worked on a
<br />
similar project, from the trenches point of view. 
<br />
Perhaps the best approach is a compromise and use the best features of win95
<br />
and M*tif. As long as the user can run M*tif applications using this vm,
<br />
M*tif compliance may become a secondary issue. 
<br />
Here are some features I would like to see:
<br />
-use of buffers to improve performance.
<br />
-use DLL's to implement controls (widgets) thus providing flexibility and
<br />
extendibility.
<br />
-create something akin to the registry, a policy database which can be
<br />
modified using a policy editor.
<br />
-A scripting language which could be used to write macros, such as MS VBA. A
<br />
good candidate would be Java.
<br />
-Some sort of printer support such as it is found in win95.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A new class library for developing applications is being written, with
</em><br />
win95 look and feel, and including as 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many as controls (widgets) as Win95 has. 
</em><br />
Will it include the new controls which MS uses in O*fice97 ?
<br />
What about an IDE for programmers ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A separate, generic wm-communication API library would be also available.
</em><br />
A scripting language which could be used to communicate with the vm. A good
<br />
candidate would be Java.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is not a fixed policy, or direction, in the fvwm development, except,
</em><br />
perhaps, making it infinitely configurable. 
<br />
I agree that it should be infinitely configurable. However global
<br />
configuration which can be overwritten by the application should be the
<br />
standard.
<br />
<br />If the above can be achieved then Linux, X95 vm, Xclass95 will provide the
<br />
functionality to compete head on with the evil Macrosoft empire, at a
<br />
fraction of the cost.  
<br />
<br />On a final note, has any consideration being given to legal issues such as
<br />
copyright and patent infringement ?
<br />
If company has the resources to engage in a legal battle with a US
<br />
government agency on trade practices ... enough said.  
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />David
