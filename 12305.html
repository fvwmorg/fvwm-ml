<br />
Hello,
<br />
<br />I've been messing with setting up my menu and am mainly courious
<br />
what sort of plans for more functaionality will be added to them.
<br />
<br />First let me explain what I'm trying to do, I'd like to have some script
<br />
similar to fvwm-menu-directory go though my mp3 dir and then add
<br />
two actions to each mp3 file, I'd like Mouse 1 to play the mp3 (or mp3
<br />
dir) and Mouse 2 to enque the mp3 into xmms. So I would like to bind
<br />
different actions in the Menu based upon the button hit.
<br />
<br />In looking to see if this is possible I found the following:
<br />
<br />1) From the mailing list archives for fvwm-workers_at_fvwm.org:
<br />
<a href="http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0203/msg00508.html">http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0203/msg00508.html</a>
<br />
<br />I really liked this idea of adding a new command to help
<br />
with customizing the menu, The basic idea was to keep the
<br />
format of 'AddToMenu' the same (for backwards compadibility)
<br />
but then add a new command 'AddMenuItems'. This command would
<br />
allow you to add (I)tems to the menu and then add (P)roperties
<br />
and (A)ctions to that item that could then be effected by the
<br />
mouse and or key pressed in the menu.
<br />
<br />I've talked to a few people in #fvwm on irc.freenode.net and they all
<br />
think the idea is good along with the above thread has mostly positive
<br />
comments about it, so I'm courious what ever happend to this idea
<br />
and would it be possible to put something like this in there
<br />
(or is there something different in the working)
<br />
<br /><br />2) Taviso (from #fvwm) said that there is an option in the works
<br />
to allow biddings to work inside of windows, (something like)
<br />
'Mouse 1 Menu A FvwmFunction'. Now this does look good, but I would
<br />
have to write up a little function for it based of the menu item
<br />
clicked on to get the desired effect, as it is more a global binding
<br />
instead of a binding per item (like above)
<br />
<br /><br />3) Another solution which would require the least work from my
<br />
point of view would be to extend the options in a standard function.
<br />
Right now all I see is '+ I', '+ D', '+ M' and '+ H' as the optoins.
<br />
If you added a few more of these say '+ mX' that would mean
<br />
do this action if 'mouse button X' was the event then I could
<br />
make a function for my purpose, say something like
<br />
<br />AddToFunc FvwmPlayXmms
<br />
+ m1 &lt;play $0 in xmms&gt;
<br />
+ m2 &lt;enque $0 in xmms&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />On another note there is one more issue I am having with my menu.
<br />
I have it set to 'Hiligh3DOff' which is what I want as I don't want
<br />
a hilighted border around my selction (just the text color to change)
<br />
This works well except that now if I have a big icon (say a thumbnail
<br />
for my wallpaper dir), the Hilight3DThickness was what gave a spacing of
<br />
X pixles between the icons (thumbnails), so for my Thumbnails they
<br />
all run into eachother (there is no spacing between them). The only
<br />
possible things I could find would be to add the MenuStyles
<br />
'VerticalItemSpacing X Y' and 'VerticalTitleSpacing X Y' which will add
<br />
some virtical spacing between my items (what I want), but from
<br />
experimenting with this, the numbers X Y are the spacing above and below
<br />
the item based off of the 'text size' and don't take the icon into
<br />
account, so to get this to work I have to make X and Y quite large so it
<br />
adds the right amount of space to above and below the icons, which makes
<br />
it so the places I have smaller icons are still spaced far apart.
<br />
My question is am I using this option wrong, or could another optoin be
<br />
added to the mix, say 'VirticalIconSpacing X Y' which would put spacing
<br />
above and below the icon size on the menu to allow for what I want.
<br />
<br /><br />Thank you for your time
<br />
jaimos
