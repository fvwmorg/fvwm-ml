<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: &lt;chuck_hines_at_VNET.IBM.COM&gt; (Charles Hines)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Todd&gt; So, if we could have the following controls over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Todd&gt; boarderstyles:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've had similar (but simpler) thoughts from time to time.  But it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always just seems to be a lot of overkill.  What I would perhaps like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to implement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   - control over 3d look of borders (like width of shadow)
</em><br />
<br />would this be 'left - right - top - bottom' independent of each other? Or
<br />
maybe just simply 'left -right' as one adjustment and 'top-bottom' as another?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   - separate control over border width and control handle width
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   - titlesytles like flat, sunk, raised, &amp; justification controls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   - Xpm/bitmaps for buttons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   - cursorstyle patch (perhaps modified for use in Style commands to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     make it per window?)
</em><br />
<br />could we add 'Xpm/bitmaps for menus' ? I have a feeling that if one were to
<br />
use a '1 column' xpm/bitmap it wouldn't cause that much (maybe I'm wrong)
<br />
overhead/code/memory to display...maybe I'm wrong...
<br />
<br />corners are a definite 'need' to be able to look like other wm's.  For
<br />
instance, the corners of olvwm, or the bottom two 'thingeys' at the corners
<br />
vs nothing at the corners at the top of the 'bowman' window manager...
<br />
imho, though..
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This should allow you to get relatively close to looking like pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much any window border look you want.  I don't feel that FVWM should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to be able to look exactly like any other window manager type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program down to the exact pixel.  If you can get close, that's good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach shouldn't bloat fvwm too badly, and a lot of that list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is already on my TO-DO list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comments?  Anyone think I'm way off base with that?
</em><br />
<br />Well, it all depends on where the functionality is placed.  If we add code
<br />
to fvwm itself to allow modules to control the styles/decorations of windows,
<br />
then we don't need most of this in the fvwm window manager itself, only
<br />
in the individual modules that implement it.  However, instead of having
<br />
a bunch of differnet modules, maybe what we need is to make a 'FvwmExtraStyle'
<br />
module that allows one to, once the module is invoked, specify extra things
<br />
for styles.
<br />
<br />I would definately use this approach..as to me, it is important to get things
<br />
to look 'pixel by pixel' exactly the same.  Maybe I'm picky, but it definately
<br />
would be impressive if we could specify 'Desk1 = UseStyle Win95'
<br />
'Desk2 = UseStyle Mac', 'Desk3 = UseStyle OS2', 'Desk4 = UseStyle Olvwm'.
<br />
<br />I know I&quot;m taking this to the extreme, but it's just one of those 'gee it
<br />
would be nice if..' kindof deals.
<br />
<br />I quote one of my sysadmin: &quot;If Fvwm were to implement styles to look like 
<br />
olvwm, I'll bet it would become the most popular window manager out there'.
<br />
Especially considering it's smaller memory footprint.
<br />
<br />Here's a question, though.  Are there any copyright problems if we make things
<br />
look 'pixel-by-pixel' just like another OS/window manager?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, just like above, I don't think that FVWM should have to have 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different menu styles to look like 10 different window managers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps some more generic controls though could be thought up to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it customizable though.  I haven't given as much thought to this as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the borders/titles &quot;problem&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, the menu styles is a side issue...but related...so I brought it up.
<br />
The idea I was hoping was that it would allow a flexible enough list of
<br />
style attributes so that it could be configured to look like different
<br />
window managers, not that it would have 10 differnet configurations
<br />
hard-coded.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A module that has it's own menuing system that sends the commands to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FVWM instead of asking FVWM to put up the menus is an excellent idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though.  Then you could make 10 different modules if you wanted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without bloating FVWM at all.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it is all fine and dandy that we can hard-code styles, but I was
<br />
hoping that 'style attributes' would be flexible enough, whether more
<br />
are added by a module, or they are all in fvwm, to encompass any
<br />
configuration we would possibly wish to have, all by specifying
<br />
things in the .fvwmrc file.  Maybe it's not possible, but boy would it
<br />
be nice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would make it even better is to make it so the module can stay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running instead of being reinvoked every time you want to pop the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; menus up.  Then there would be no more delay than popping up a normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; menu.  This will require some more thought though...
</em><br />
<br />Hrm, well, what currently determines when a module dies?  When it's window
<br />
is closed? FvwmAudio runs w/out opening a window, and it waits for wm events 
<br />
... so isn't this what you're looking for?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think so.  But (like I said above) I don't think that it has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match exactly.  Would the simpler approach I suggested be ok?
</em><br />
<br />Well, maybe initially.  But if it is close, hopefully one could 'tweak' things
<br />
so it would be exactly right.  Sorry, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so
<br />
I like things exact...and as I said earlier, I would rather make a module
<br />
if that is what it takes, than put an 'almost' implementation in fvwm
<br />
itself..
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Todd&gt; BTW, for those of you not following the 'wine' development
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At least they aren't taking the evil WABI approach of override
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; redirect windows...
</em><br />
<br />Actually, without the '-managed' option, that is exactly what it does.
<br />
Plus, with the '-managed' you get the joy of remembering how often windows
<br />
apps decide they need the focus....for every time they would, in windows,
<br />
pop to the 'top' and grab the focus, they also do this in X.  It is really
<br />
annoying, especially if you use '-privatemap' for its own colormap..so
<br />
for ill-behaved apps there is the '-desktop widthxheight' option that has
<br />
wine pop up a window in wich the app/apps will run, and that 'wine' window
<br />
behaves as a good X app should...
