Hi there...
<br />
Comments below, again:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gave gv as an example which always shows the problem.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately, the gv problem I saw had little to do with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flickering.  If other apps have this problem, I need more

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples.
</em><br />
<br />Well, there are other examples, like I noted, with GTK+ buttons,
<br />
Netscape toolbars, balloon titles in FvwmPager... And sometimes
<br />
windows being automatically raised (e.g. FvwmButtons) start
<br />
flickering - getting raised and lowered over and over again frequently
<br />
in a short time...
<br />
I do not have exact tests for those examples, though, as they do not
<br />
always happen - only once in a while... But if you use this setup for
<br />
a while, with some activity with automatically raised and lowered
<br />
windows, then you'll probably see it a few times.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I do not see why gv trying to grabbing the pointer should be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem, especially that other window managers (e.g. CTWM) have such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a feature (automatically raise and lower) which doesn't cause those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problems. I don't see exactly why FVWM should grab the pointer for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because fvwm is executing a complex function.
</em><br />
<br />I would ask now - why does this have to be a complex function?
<br />
Couldn't it be, instead of a complex function, just some
<br />
AutoRaise/AutoLower style?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The pointer is always grabbed during function execution (and has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be to prevent funny and hard to debug problems).  Don't forget we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not using well tested, documented features here.  After all, using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enter and leave events is a real hack (and *slow*).
</em><br />
<br />By enter and leave events, do you mean events of FVWM (FvwmEvent), or
<br />
events in the level of X? After all, FVWM does a lot of things on
<br />
enter and leave, including focus, changing window styles, etc etc.
<br />
<br />If we are talking about X events here... Then, well, I find it hard to
<br />
believe that it is not well tested and documented... As it is used a
<br />
lot and seems to have not principle problems...
<br />
<br />Also, why a real hack (and *slow*)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moving the pointer across the desktop can trigger dozens of enter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leave events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &lt;snip /&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This really sounds like a sub-optimal specific workaround for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me. Couldn't this problem be fixed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No.  Complex function = pointer grabbed.
</em><br />
<br />Again, why do automatically raising and lowering have to be
<br />
implemented using a complex function?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any application that is stupid enough to not retry grabbing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointer when it's needed and unlucky enough to try it at the wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time has a problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correct fix = fix gv.
</em><br />
<br />Well, might be... But, well... I still find this a bit weird,
<br />
considering that some other window managers handle that quite well,
<br />
also with gv... And, as I said, the problem is not only with gv... gv
<br />
is just a test that always shows the problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not enough of an expert in X11 to tell exactly... But since other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; window managers, like CTWM (I keep giving it as an example because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that's one I used lot beside and before FVWM) have this function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (auto-raise and auto-lower) working fine, without flickering, and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causing problems with pointer grabbing with gv, I suppose that could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be done with FVWM too...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure.  Use FvwmAuto.  Of course you'd have to switch to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SloppyFocus or MouseFocus and lose ability to enable the feature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only for selected windows.
</em><br />
<br />I tried FvwmAuto for that, and those were exactly my problems... I do
<br />
have my focus following the pointer, except windows which have the
<br />
ClickToFocus style enabled... And mostly, those are the windows I want
<br />
to automatically raise and lower...
<br />
That was what my first post on this subject (back near the end of
<br />
2001) was to say... That I need a bit more than FvwmAuto can do, at
<br />
that time...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Couldn't there just be added two styles - AutoRaise and AutoLower,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which would do that, and just that, and do it simple without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flickering and problems, needing scheduling and the like?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would just move the problem into the fvwm core.
</em><br />
<br />Why would it? If the problem is that FVWM grabs the pointer in a
<br />
complex function, than be it a simple style, and some of it is solved
<br />
already...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; CTWM might also have an auto-raise feature, but I bet it's based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *focus* changes too and not on the pointer entering or leaving the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; window.
</em><br />
<br />No, actually it is based on the pointer entering and leaving the
<br />
window... As I said, that was one thing that CTWM did just well, fine
<br />
without problems as I expect it...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's much easier to code, but it doesn't work with ClickToFocus.
</em><br />
<br />By the way, what is actually the big difference for that matter
<br />
between the mouse entering the window and the window getting focus?
<br />
Originally you said that it is a problem with the synchronization
<br />
between FVWM and X, so that while FVWM gets the event from X another
<br />
window has the pointer in it already... Can't FVWM just check that the
<br />
pointer is still in the window it got the event for from X before
<br />
applying such a function?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, I think it's possible to modify the lines I posted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disable and scheduling of commands while the pointer is outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the autoraise/lower windows.  Will take some time.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that will probably help a lot, but still, some of that problem
<br />
(&quot;flickering&quot;, etc.) happens also with windows that are automatically
<br />
raised and lowered... So this would still leave some of the
<br />
problem...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bye

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks again for the efforts in helping and the reply, I really hope
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that some-when I'll get it working as I expect...
