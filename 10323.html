FROM:KHIN M. LWIN
<br />
E-MAIL:lwinkm01_at_netscape.net
<br />
Dear Sir/Madam,
<br />
I apologize for the unexpected nature of this mail. I got your e-mail
<br />
address from the Thailand intercontinental peace group.
<br />
I am Khin Myint Lwin, 55, Chinese/Burmese, and the leader of the Myanmar
<br />
Kyone Yeom Group headquartered in Mong Yawn, Myanmar. We engage in Real
<br />
Estate, food processing and the transportation of Chinese, Thai and
<br />
Burmese migrant workers to destinations around the globe.
<br />
I am writing you from my Yangoon home where I await my appeal case
<br />
against a 37 years jail sentence I received for alleged human trafficking,
<br />
illegal
<br />
sale of gold and running a prostitution ring. I am currently under house
<br />
arrest. My appeal hearing is set for December 2003.
<br />
These are all trumped-up charges. One of my boats carrying migrant
<br />
workers to Singapore last year was hit by waves and sank killing 87
<br />
passengers they suspected me of funding the Karen National Liberation Army
<br />
(KNLA), a
<br />
rebel movement fighting for the rights of the Karen ethnic group in Myanmar.
<br />
The government has also seized most of my assets valued at nearly one
<br />
Billion dollars ($973,000,000.00) in Myanmar, Thailand and
<br />
China.
<br />
My wife and three daughters (8,12,14) are now staying with my mother
<br />
in-law in Mandalay. They now face a severe disruption in their livelihood
<br />
and
<br />
the education of my daughters is in jeopardy. This feels me with so much
<br />
pain. My wife and daughters are my main concern right now.
<br />
I have a cash account deposit I made in the Netherlands, which the
<br />
Burmese government didn't know about. When I liquidated my flower and
<br />
electronic
<br />
companies in the Netherlands in 2002, I deposited the proceeds of Eleven
<br />
million dollars ($11,000,000.00) in a securities firm in the Netherlands
<br />
while I was negotiating the take-over of a telecom company in Germany.
<br />
Right now, I need this money so I could get the best lawyer for my appeal
<br />
case coming up in December and most of all get my family out of Myanmar
<br />
to a safer country. They face constant harassment from government agents.
<br />
I need your assistance to get some of this money through to my wife and
<br />
daughters who are in Mandalay. Your responsibility will be to assume the
<br />
new ownership of the money. Transfer this money into your own account for
<br />
safety
<br />
first.
<br />
You will keep 20% for your efforts. You will then send my share in bits
<br />
as I family to leave Myanmar. I can also get the best lawyer and lobby power
<br />
and most possibly be free soonest.
<br />
ownership changed to yours. I can do this online and via email. Luckily, I
<br />
can monitor the status of my deposit via the Internet with my login info.
<br />
When all is done, the company will contact you about your new status. They
<br />
will tell you what to do. Most of their transactions can also be done
<br />
online. After that, you carry out the directives as explained above.
<br />
If you do this, I will be personally grateful to you in many ways. Not
<br />
only in the 20% of ($11M) reward you will get, but also when I am free, as I
<br />
know I will soon, I will show you what it means to do me a favor.
<br />
If you can't, or decide not to, I will understand. Thanks for your attention
<br />
anyhow.
<br />
Regards,
<br />
Khin Myint Lwin      
<br />
