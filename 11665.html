From: Mrs Serena Jones
<br />
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
<br />
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
<br />
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co ast for
<br />
nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven
<br />
years without a child. He died a fter a brief illness that lasted for
<br />
only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia
<br />
ns.Since his death I decided not to re- marry or get a child outside my
<br />
matrimonial home which the Bi ble is against.When my late husband was
<br />
alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred
<br />
thousand U.S. D
<br />
ollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Hollan d.
<br />
Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my
<br />
Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to
<br />
cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i s my stroke sickness.
<br />
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or
<br />
better still a christian individ ual that will utilize this money the
<br />
way I am going to instruc t here in. I want a church that will use this
<br />
fund to fund chu rches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of
<br />
God and t o ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
<br />
us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this
<br />
decision because I don?t have any child that wil l inherit this money
<br />
and my husband relatives are not Christi ans and I don?t want my
<br />
husband?s hard earned money to be misu sed by unbelievers. I don?t want
<br />
a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence
<br />
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence
<br />
I know whe re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of
<br />
th e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I
<br />
shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi cation in this
<br />
regard because of my health because of the pres ence of my husband?s
<br />
relatives around me always. I don?t want them to know about this
<br />
development. With God all things are p ossible. As soon as I receive
<br />
your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company
<br />
in Amsterderm Holland . I will also issue you a letter of authority that
<br />
will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and
<br />
the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
<br />
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoe ver that
<br />
wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please
<br />
always be prayerful all through your life. Any d elay in your reply will
<br />
give me room in sourcing for a chuch or christian individual for this
<br />
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
<br />
herein. Hoping to hearing from you.
<br />
N.B-
<br />
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL
<br />
IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE' S VERY
<br />
UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS
<br />
NAME, THE LAWYER'S NAME IS STEVEN PAULSON,PHONE NUMBER IS
<br />
00-31-626-348-637,. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in
<br />
Christ, Mrs Serena Jones
