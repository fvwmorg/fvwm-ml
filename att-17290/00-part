...an obvious enhancement to my previous solution:

To do the same thing without the temporary file:

Key	F1	A	SM	Nop
Mouse	0	5	N	Key F1 A SM Module FvwmWarpTo $w

The perl script becomes:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # this could use some error checking...
    $winid = hex($ARGV[5]);
    $fd = $ARGV[0];
    close(STDOUT);
    open(STDOUT, ">&$fd");
    print STDOUT pack("lla6l", $winid, 6, "Focus", 0);

Note: The 'Key F1...Nop' command is necessary because of a known
feature*.  Adding new key bindings seems to require that a Recapture
take place before they take effect; binding the key to a null action
initially works around that problem by ensuring a binding already exists
when fvwm2 begins.

*The behaviour is documented in the TO-DO file, not the BUGS file.
