<br />Hello.  :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you are right and a session manager is what I'm really looking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for. I don't know, because I haven't found out what's the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between a session manager and a display manager. Both words are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commonly used in the same context. For what kind of sophistication:
</em><br />
<br />If they're used in the same context, whomever is doing so is in grave
<br />
error.  Let me explain.  A session manager is a program which is
<br />
responsible for saving the running state of open programs so that in
<br />
theory [1] when one logs out, and logs in again, the programs are
<br />
restored in their last-saved state.  This ought to include geometry and
<br />
open programs, but this last point is a sore area for many session
<br />
managers.
<br />
<br />A display manager, however, simply provides a graphical means for users
<br />
to login.  At the most, this is all xdm does, but it can be customised
<br />
to do a whole lot of other things, that quite frankly, people don't
<br />
bother to look at, because they're unaware of the fact.  {K,G,W}DM
<br />
however, offer more flashier in-built functions such as selecting which
<br />
window manager/desktop environment to load, whether one is to restore
<br />
their previous session or not, whether the machine should be shutdown,
<br />
etc.  But that's all they do.  Nothing more.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; principially as much as possibly ;) - But when I wrote before, I meant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar capabilities as in WinXP. That's on the one hand a graphical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; login and a possibility to shutdown or restart the system without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logging in before. (As far as I understand that's the purpose of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; display manager) On the other hand I want to be able to simply switch
</em><br />
<br />Right.  Then you are referring to the concept of &quot;fast user switching&quot;.
<br />
Something that Linux doesn't have (but you can emulate it).
<br />
Essentially, you can start a known display manager on display(s) :0, :1,
<br />
:2, etc, and then have a locking mechanism available so that users can
<br />
switch between their displays.  In that instance, the VTs will most
<br />
likely be tty7 for :0, tty8 for :1, tty9 for :2, etc., and whenever the
<br />
user wants to access theirs, they switch to it, and if there is a
<br />
screensaver running, they can enter a password to resume their work.
<br />
Although I do have to stress the importance of resource usgae here.  It
<br />
may well be that you run out of system resources fast, if any one of you
<br />
is doing anything particularly intensive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the logged in user and then back again without disrupting any running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs. At least the newest version of kdm has this feature.
</em><br />
<br />I'd have said that was more a facet of the desktop environment, and
<br />
*not* the display manager.  But I don't use a display manager that
<br />
often...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; wdm sounds like a program, which is a step nearer the way I want it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll take a closer look at that. sdm is only for remote sessions not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for local ones
</em><br />
<br />I mentioned sdm, only because it exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; thanks for your answers
</em><br />
<br />You're welcome.

<br />
<br />[1]  I really do mean the &quot;in theory&quot; bit.  Session managers are very
<br />
hit and miss about such things.  :)
