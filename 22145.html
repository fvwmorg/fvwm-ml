</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complication out of the project?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely.  There are too many configuration languages as it stands.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creating a new one would be madness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, maybe we should re-focus on which language would be most suitable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scheme is already being implemented in the fvwm-derived ``scwm''.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since we don't want to re-invent any wheels, anybody wanting scheme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should look at contributing to scwm. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Questions: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What would we want to do with the configuration language?
</em><br />
<br />My configuration of fvwm consists of a number of M4 scripts that
<br />
generates menus and toolbars, and setup icons, color schemes and the
<br />
like (anybody familiar with TheNextStep should recognize this). There
<br />
are a number of problems with this concept, the most serious (for me)
<br />
being the fact that the translation of the M4 files into a new .fvwmrc
<br />
file takes 20-30 seconds on a fast machine. Also, any addition of a
<br />
new program or anything similar can take some time to configure.
<br />
<br />If only the m4 preprocessor was faster or my configuration was
<br />
interpreted directly by fvwm, then my setup would be very usefull
<br />
indeed. But, as it is, it's a pain!
<br />
<br />So I woul like a configuration language with full access to the file
<br />
system, so I can test for various executables and read various
<br />
configuration files (e.g. color schemes).
<br />
<br />I would also like to make an interactive configuration tool for fvwm,
<br />
much like the tools seen for Windows95 and other end-user focused
<br />
operating systems. (No flames please!!!! Much as I dislike the central
<br />
concepts of Window95, I must admit that Linux, and for the matter most
<br />
other UNIX look-alikes, are hopeless, when it comes to configuration.)
<br />
Making new menus, adding programs, setting the overall look-n-feel,
<br />
setting speaker volume, etc. should be easy as pie! All this could be
<br />
handled in a module, but then that module should have complete access
<br />
to the state of fvwm. IFAIK there are some limits on what you can do
<br />
through the existing fvwm module interface. If one could send
<br />
ambitrary scripts to be evaluated by the fvwm core, then we would have
<br />
complete freedom to divide functionality between the fvwm core and a
<br />
module.
<br />
<br />If the configuration language of choice has access to X11 in a manner
<br />
similar to the TK package (Tcl/tk, perl/tk, ...), then that would open
<br />
a completely new balliwagon of possibilities!!! Just imagine the type
<br />
of interaction one could have in the menus. Toolbars would also be a
<br />
natual part of the core just like menus. etc. etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. How often would we use it.
</em><br />
<br />More or less, all the time. Not directly, normally, but through the
<br />
different tools.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. What kind of language would people find most approachable? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (Especially if it's used only occasionally?)
</em><br />
<br />IMHO the primary goals for a new configuration language are:
<br />
<br />- we should *NOT* invent a new language, but an exiting (actively)
<br />
supported language (I know that is the title for this thread, but it
<br />
can not be said often enough :-)).
<br />
<br />- the language should have all the modern programming constructs like
<br />
lexical variables, conditions, while, for, procedures and
<br />
packages/modules/namespaces.
<br />
<br />- complete access to the file system (test, read and write).
<br />
<br />- an easy API for add-on functionality (TCL is a nice example,
<br />
whereas in perl it is somewhat harder to add new functionality)
<br />
<br />- nice-to-have are closures and threads (though especially the later
<br />
can limit the number of platforms, for which the language is avaiable,
<br />
I suppose).
<br />
<br />- if possible the language should be compiled to byte-code (or
<br />
something similar) when read by the interpreter, both for speed and to
<br />
perform complete syntax and semantics checks. Also if possible, the
<br />
byte-code should be savable for fast re-read of the configuration.
<br />
<br />- the language should havee a basic widget set ß la tk (as in Tcl/tk)
<br />
either in the base language or (better) and an extention.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comments?  Other questions to ask?
</em><br />
<br />What are the possible candidates??
<br />
<br />My current list consists of TCL and perl, both of which are actively
<br />
supported by a lot of people.
<br />
<br />TCL
<br />
<pre>
---
pro's:
- very small kernel
- TCL/tk exists
- well documented in several books
con's:
- only one complex datatype
- no complete syntax and semantics checks at load time
- many people dislike the somewhat peculiar syntax
- no byte-code compiler.
Perl
----
pro's:
- multi-threaded
- perl/tk
- complete operating system access
- well documented in several books
con's:
- no byte-code compiler (is this true anymore?).
- complex add-on API
