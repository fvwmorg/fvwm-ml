|&gt;Hello,
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;It's my perception that the mouse-triggered actions behave
<br />
|&gt;inconsistently with what the manual says.
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;Specifically, actions don't seem to be triggered until a click is
<br />
|&gt;completed - not on mouse-down - which is what is suggested by the manual.
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;Take for example this quote from the fvwm man page:
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;&quot;The name must not contain embedded whitespace. No guarantees are made
<br />
|&gt;whether function names with embedded whitespace work or not. This
<br />
|&gt;behavior may also change in the future without further notice. The
<br />
|&gt;letter before the action tells what kind of action triggers the command
<br />
|&gt;which follows it. 'I' stands for &quot;Immediate&quot;, and is executed as soon as
<br />
|&gt;the function is invoked. 'M' stands for &quot;Motion&quot;, i.e. if the user
<br />
|&gt;starts moving the mouse. 'C' stands for &quot;Click&quot;, i.e., if the user
<br />
|&gt;presses and releases the mouse. 'H' stands for &quot;Hold&quot;, i.e. if the user
<br />
|&gt;presses a mouse button and holds it down for more than ClickTime
<br />
|&gt;milliseconds. 'D' stands for &quot;Double-click&quot;. The action 'I' causes an
<br />
|&gt;action to be performed on the button-press, if the function is invoked
<br />
|&gt;with prior knowledge of which window to act on.&quot;
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|&gt;This suggests that &quot;Immediate&quot; commands are executed on mouse-down,
<br />
|&gt;while &quot;Click&quot; type is for press-and-release.
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
| And it is exactly what fvwm does.  With
<br />
|
<br />
|   AddToFunc immediate I echo immediate
<br />
|   mouse 3 r n function immediate
<br />
|
<br />
| the &quot;echo immediate&quot; is executed as soon the button is pressed,
<br />
| and with
<br />
|
<br />
|   AddToFunc click C echo click
<br />
|   mouse 3 r n function click
<br />
|
<br />
| There are a couple of exception, though:
<br />
|
<br />
|  - If an application is started that tries to grab control of the
<br />
|    pointer, it will succeed only after the function is completed.
<br />
|  - Commands that change the window focus do change the foucs
<br />
|    immediately, but the window decorations are redrawn only after
<br />
|    the function completes.  Fvwm tracks the focused window by the
<br />
|    corresponding X event, and events are not handled during
<br />
|    function execution.  Hence the delay.
<br />
|  - To suppress excessive redrawing, changes in window styles are
<br />
|    activated only after the function completes and fvwm is idle
<br />
|    (i.e. not receiving events or module input).
<br />
|  - If a command needs a window to operate on, and no window has
<br />
|    been selected yet, you have to release the button first and
<br />
|    then click on a window.
<br />
|
<br />
| Note that the function itself only completes when the last mouse
<br />
| button is released.
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|&gt;I've noticed that Immediate commands are only exceuted after release or
<br />
|&gt;I press and move the pointer a bit. This is certainly not &quot;Immediate&quot; -
<br />
|&gt;and there is a definite need for commands to be executed on mousedown.
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;In fact, for all mouse-bindings, actions are excuted on
<br />
|&gt;click-and-release instead of mousedown. Key binding actions are executed
<br />
|&gt;on mouse-down.
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|&gt;And also - there is this entry in the FvwmButtons manpage:
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;&quot;ActionOnPress
<br />
|&gt;~~    Usually the action is executed on the button release except for the
<br />
|&gt;Popup action. This option changes this behavior, the action is executed
<br />
|&gt;on the button press. This may be good, for example, with Menu or
<br />
|&gt;SendToModule that generates popups, or when Frame is 0 and the button
<br />
|&gt;would look unresponsive otherwise.&quot;
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
| Works as advertised for me.
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
|&gt;This suggests that popup actions are executed on mousedown. This is not
<br />
|&gt;the case with buttons. They behave like &quot;Immediate&quot; commands - executing
<br />
|&gt;only on mousedown+movement or mousedown+release.
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;If I add ActionOnPress, actions behave like &quot;Immediate&quot; commands again -
<br />
|&gt;that is - not immediately!
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;Incidentally, popup menus only behave correctly in keybindings and
<br />
|&gt;mousebindings on the Root Desktop.
<br />
|&gt;
<br />
|&gt;Can anyone shed some light on this issue? It's a major annoyance.
<br />
|
<br />
|
<br />
| Is there any chance your mouse or your X server is broken?  When
<br />
| fvwm receives a ButtonPress event it acts immediately.

<br />Nope - I still get my old behavior. And I don't think I have anything wrong with
<br />
my X-server.
<br />
<br />I use x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r2
