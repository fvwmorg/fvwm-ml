All,
<br />
<br />I think I may have found the problem, although I can't confirm it.  When 
<br />
poking around inside my PC case to install a drive, I noticed that the power 
<br />
cable to the motherboard wasn't plugged in completely.  I slight jostle would 
<br />
(and did) disconnect it.  I fixed this a week ago, and the lockup hasn't 
<br />
happened since.
<br />
<br />I'll try Dominik's suggestions if the lockup occurs again.
<br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />

&gt; &gt; I don't know if this is an FVWM problem, or somewhere else.  But since it
&gt; &gt; only seems to impact the GUI, I thought I'd try here first.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My system: AMD64FX51, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB HD, NVIDIA video card, Mandrake 9.2
&gt; &gt; (official) for AMD64, fvwm 2.5.9.  fvwm 2.5.9 was re-compiled for 64 bit.
&gt;
&gt; Note that I don't have access to a 64 bit machine.  Therefore it
&gt; is very difficult for me to identify and fix bugs that occur on
&gt; such machines.  Some 64 bit bugs are fixed in 2.5.12, but there is
&gt; at least one report that there are still problems.  In general,
&gt; such problems affect the communication between fvwm, its modules
&gt; and the X server.
&gt;
&gt; First of all you should upgrade to 2.5.12 and check if the problem
&gt; persists.  If it does, read on.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The symptom:  Everything seems to be humming along fine, when suddenly my
&gt; &gt; interaction with Mozilla stops working.  At this point, the only thing
&gt; &gt; that responds is the mouse and the &quot;Num Lock&quot; key (causes the LED to
&gt; &gt; toggle).  The Caps Lock key does not cause the LED to toggle.  I am
&gt; &gt; unable to activate any window or pulldown menu.  I am unable to affect
&gt; &gt; any window in any way.  There is no window selected as the active window,
&gt; &gt; and I am unable to select any window as the active window (I use
&gt; &gt; &quot;FocusFollowsMouse&quot;).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am able to telnet into this machine.  A &quot;top&quot; indicates 98.9% idle, and
&gt; &gt; only &quot;X&quot; is using the CPU.
&gt;
&gt; This looks as if some application took control of the pointer or
&gt; the whole X server (in the latter case, no application would be
&gt; able to produce any output).  Try killing all applications from
&gt; the console (&quot;pstree&quot; for a list).  If the problem still does not
&gt; go away, it must be either fvwm or the X server.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am able to kill off applications (Mozilla, kmail),
&gt; &gt; but there is no change in the &quot;X&quot; display.  No errors or messages are
&gt; &gt; present in /var/log/messages that are out of the normal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On my one attempt to issue a &quot;reboot&quot; command from the telnet session,
&gt; &gt; the command did not complete.  I issued a second command, which caused
&gt; &gt; the PC to reset immediately (i.e. unclean shutdown).
&gt;
&gt; I can not think of any way how the X server or fvwm could prevent
&gt; a reboot.  That sounds like a much more severe problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This has just started happening in the last few weeks, but I don't think
&gt; &gt; anything I messed with caused this (could be wrong though).  The fourth
&gt; &gt; occurrence was today.  I mucked around with a bunch of DVD player stuff
&gt; &gt; two weeks ago, but I don't -think- I overwrote anything that would cause
&gt; &gt; this. If I did, I would expect to seem something in /var/log/messages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions or pointers anyone?  Or advice on what to dig for next
&gt; &gt; time it happens?
&gt;
&gt; Another cause might be the graphics driver.  Do you use the
&gt; drivers written by NVIDIA?  They are known to cause lock-ups and
&gt; crashes.  Try the latest drivers or the drivers built into the X
&gt; server.  On the other hand, if it's the video card, the pointer
&gt; should not be moving.
&gt;
&gt; Ciao
&gt;
&gt; Dominik ^_^  ^_^
