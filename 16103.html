<br />DK&gt; Hello?
<br />
DK&gt; Anyone here? Its all gone quiet(ish).
<br />
<br />I'm still here, physically if not mentally.
<br />
<br />DK&gt; Seriously, what happened to the promised flurry of activity on
<br />
DK&gt; pushing out the next fvwm2 beta?
<br />
<br />Answered below.
<br />
<br />DK&gt; I seem to have been waiting for bated breath for a week or two
<br />
DK&gt; now, unless of course our mail went non-linear again. If I have
<br />
DK&gt; missed a batch or two or mail I'm sorry.
<br />
<br />It has been real quiet, actually, unless I'm missing mail too.
<br />
<br />DK&gt; So, Chuck, did things go 'Horribly Wrong (tm)'?
<br />
<br />Actually, yes.  Which is why things have been delayed.  I had a list
<br />
of about 30 items that I was trying to get into this next release, and
<br />
I have about 15 of them done and a few partially done.  They all would
<br />
have been ready, but I was hit with a coredump that resulted from
<br />
trying to merge in too many patches at once (all of which had to be
<br />
done by hand).  I just figured out the problem this past Wednesday.
<br />
<br />So, I think I'm going to release it later today (provided my final
<br />
tests go ok) minus the stuff I didn't finish, since it's taken much
<br />
longer than anticipated.  I'll just move those others into the next
<br />
beta release.
<br />
<br />DK&gt; And is Jarl still about or have the men in green dragged him away
<br />
DK&gt; yet?
<br />
<br />Haven't a clue on that one.  I haven't heard from him since I
<br />
contacted him about some problems w/ FvwmButtons under AIX.
<br />
<br />DK&gt; And if he is here have you/are you working on/can you do proper
<br />
DK&gt; rotated text for the titlebar-down patch before you leave?  (I
<br />
DK&gt; don't want it but another couple of fvwm users here love it.)
<br />
<br />I guess that was meant for Jarl to answer...
<br />
<br />DK&gt; While I'm talking about new releases is there any sign of progress
<br />
DK&gt; on that popular wish list feature which I am also awaiting -
<br />
DK&gt; StartsOnPage?
<br />
<br />Nope.  That one won't happen until after the first official release
<br />
and the infamous Great Style Flag Rewrite.
<br />
<br />And speaking of the first official release, that's going to happen
<br />
soon.  Probably after 2 more betas (this next one, and one more to
<br />
finish up what I didn't finish for this one).  It's been put off for
<br />
far too long.
<br />
<br />Chuck
