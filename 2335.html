<br />
SEEN ON NATIONAL TV&quot; Thank you for your time and Interest. This is the letter you've been reading 
<br />
about in the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major nightly 
<br />
news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below, 
<br />
to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program 
<br />
was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are, absolutely no laws prohibiting 
<br />
the participation in the program. This has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless 
<br />
and fun way to make some extra money at home. The results of this show has been truly remarkable. 
<br />
So many people are participating that those involved are doing, much better than ever before. 
<br />
Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of 
<br />
lately. You will understand once you experience it. &quot;HERE IT IS BELOW&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Future Reference *** The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a 
<br />
look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!! 
<br />
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $46,000 
<br />
in less than 90 days! Please read the enclosed program...THEN READ IT AGAIN!!! 
<br />
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING 
<br />
OPPORTUNITY. It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best 
<br />
of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail. If you believe that someday 
<br />
you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, THIS IS IT! Simply follow the 
<br />
instructions, and your dreams will come true. This multi-level e-mail order marketing program 
<br />
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME. Email is the sales tool of the future. Take advantage of this 
<br />
non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!! The longer you wait, the more people will be 
<br />
doing business using e-mail. Get your piece of this action!!! MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has 
<br />
finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both 
<br />
Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods 
<br />
and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's. This is a 
<br />
Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000 millionaires in the WORLD, 20% ( 700,000) made 
<br />
their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people 
<br />
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You may have heard this story before, 
<br />
but over the summer Donald Trump (A MULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) 
<br />
made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost 
<br />
everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a 
<br />
good network marketing company and get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He 
<br />
looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response &quot;That's why I'm sitting up here and you 
<br />
are all sitting out there!&quot; With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct 
<br />
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce 
<br />
to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time or money 
<br />
once and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid 
<br />
for the work of others. This program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different 
<br />
countries across the world. The enclosed INF0RMATION is something I almost let slip through my 
<br />
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it. 
<br />
My name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years 
<br />
down-sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open 
<br />
my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my 
<br />
family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I 
<br />
just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my 
<br />
family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am 
<br />
writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! 
<br />
In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program 
<br />
I had been sending away for INF0RMATION on various business opportunities. All of the programs I 
<br />
received, in my opinion, were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to 
<br />
comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or 
<br />
not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year...it didn't tell me I'd have to 
<br />
write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I 
<br />
didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR 
<br />
THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't 
<br />
believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, 
<br />
without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would 
<br />
at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little 
<br />
worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the US Post Office 
<br />
(1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program 
<br />
was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided &quot;WHY NOT.&quot; Initially I sent out 100,000 e-mails. It 
<br />
cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any 
<br />
money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are fulfilled via 
<br />
e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you off, 
<br />
but I promised myself that I would not &quot;rip-off&quot; anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. In 
<br />
less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By January 13, I had received 
<br />
26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to &quot;RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 
<br />
WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!&quot; My first step in making $46,000 in 90 
<br />
days was done. By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to &quot;RECEIVE 
<br />
AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 
<br />
ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $46,000 GOAL.&quot; Well, I had 
<br />
196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my 
<br />
e-mailing of 100,000, I received $42,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts 
<br />
and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE 
<br />
YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you 
<br />
must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different 
<br />
place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work, you 
<br />
must meet your goal of 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make 
<br />
$46,000 or more in 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate 
<br />
in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If 
<br />
you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. 
<br />
If you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like I was, or you want to start 
<br />
your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! Sincerely, Johnathon Rourke 
<br />

<br />
------A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read the enclosed 
<br />
program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could 
<br />
not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable 
<br />
business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things 
<br />
that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It 
<br />
wasn't me, it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had 
<br />
been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate... 
<br />
because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies 
<br />
than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested 
<br />
wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who never had anything to save or invest, 
<br />
were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, &quot;THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE 
<br />
POOR GET POORER.&quot; The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to &quot;move up&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;get rich&quot;, inflation will see to that. You have just received INF0RMATION that can give you 
<br />
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with &quot;NO RISK&quot; and &quot;JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.&quot; 
<br />
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. I should also point 
<br />
out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for 
<br />
this program. I have already made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS! I have retired from the program after 
<br />
sending out over 1,600,000 programs. Now I have several offices that make this and several other 
<br />
programs here and over seas. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any 
<br />
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to 
<br />
everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more...and 
<br />
your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential 
<br />
customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials and 
<br />
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! &quot;THINK ABOUT IT&quot; Before you 
<br />
delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY 
<br />
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out 
<br />
the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of 
<br />
money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your 
<br />
first orders come in. IT WORKS! Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL 
<br />
MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ INSTRUCTIONS: This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% 
<br />
EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $46,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you 
<br />
say &quot;BULL... &quot;, please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly 
<br />
legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multi-level 
<br />
businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Because of 
<br />
the global nature of the internet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business partners 
<br />
from all over the world, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL 
<br />
AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in 
<br />
your own home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere. 
<br />
This is what you MUST do: 1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below(you can't sell them if 
<br />
you don't order them). a. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU 
<br />
ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &amp; RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the 
<br />
person whose name appears on the list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
<br />
YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! b. When you place your order, make sure you order 
<br />
each of the five reports. You will need all five reports so that you can save them on your 
<br />
computer and resell them. c. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five 
<br />
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of 
<br />
people who will order them from you. 2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are 
<br />
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed 
<br />
below in steps &quot;a&quot; through &quot;g&quot; or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you 
<br />
understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, 
<br />
this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing 
<br />
of available reports. b. After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and 
<br />
REM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no 
<br />
doubt counting their $46,000! Also, change the name of the company, the address, and the REM0VE 
<br />
e-mail address on the top of this document to your own. c. Move the name and address under REPORT 
<br />
#4 down to REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e. Move the 
<br />
name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 
<br />
down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you 
<br />
copy every name and address ACCURATELY! 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list 
<br />
of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this 
<br />
letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You 
<br />
obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing 
<br />
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable 
<br />
marketing INF0RMATION which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free 
<br />
classified ads and much, much more. In addition you will be provided with INF0RMATION on Internet 
<br />
Marketing Clubs such as INTERNET MARKETING RESOURCES(IMR): This is one the premiere internet 
<br />
marketing clubs on the INTERNET. This club provides a forum where internet marketers from all 
<br />
over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on Internet Marketing. In addition, members of this 
<br />
club are provided free internet marketing tools and services for the 
<br />
Do-Yourself-Internet-Marketer. They will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 
<br />
1,000,000 fresh e-mail addresses each week. This club will provide you with hundreds of free 
<br />
resources which include: How to obtain free web sites, how to obtain top rankings in search 
<br />
engines for your web-site, how to send bulk e-mail into AOL and CompuServe, how to market your 
<br />
products on newsgroups, free classified ads, electronic malls, bulletin boards, banner ads and 
<br />
much more. There are two primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK 
<br />
E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you 
<br />
and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing 
<br />
receives a 0.3% response. Using a good list the response could be much better. Also, many people 
<br />
will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this 
<br />
example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.3% response, that is only 6 orders for REPORT 
<br />
#1. Those 6 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 12,000. Out of those 
<br />
0.3%, 36 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 
<br />
72,000. The 0.3% response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3. Those 216 send out 2,000 programs 
<br />
each for a 432,000 total. The 0.3% response to that is 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. Those 1,296 
<br />
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,592,000 total. The 0.3% response to that is 7,776 orders for 
<br />
REPORT #5. That's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this example is$30 + $180 
<br />
+ $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT 
<br />
OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK 
<br />
FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. 
<br />
Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to participate in this 
<br />
is practically nothing. You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! 
<br />
REPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing, tell you where to obtain free 
<br />
bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists and show you how to send out 1,000,000 
<br />
e-mails for free. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 1. Advertising on the 'Net is 
<br />
very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide 
<br />
to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 6 people to 
<br />
participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a 
<br />
larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline 
<br />
members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below. 1st level--your 6 members 
<br />
with $5 ($5 x 6).......................$30 2nd level--6 members from those 6 ($5 x 
<br />
36)...................$180 3rd level--6 members from those 36 ($5 x 216)............ $1,080 4th 
<br />
level--6 members from those 216 ($5 x 1,296)........ $6,480 5th level-6 members from those 1,296 
<br />
($5 x 7,776)... .$38,880 
<br />
.....................................................................................$46,650 
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________ Remember friends, this 
<br />
assumes that the people who participate only recruit 6 people each. Think for a moment what would 
<br />
happen if they got 20 people to participate! Many people will get 100's of participants! THINK 
<br />
ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. 
<br />
THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail 
<br />
THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise 
<br />
until they receive the report! 
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________ AVAILABLE REPORTS

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * 
<br />
Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in 
<br />
because: When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. * ALWAYS 
<br />
PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. * Be patient and persistent with this 
<br />
program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! * ABOVE ALL, 
<br />
HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow 
<br />
these guidelines to guarantee your success: If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within 
<br />
two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later 
<br />
you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or 
<br />
sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN 
<br />
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS 
<br />
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
<br />
of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are 
<br />
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue 
<br />
placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate 
<br />
from this business! Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this 
<br />

<br />
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! ******* T E S T I M O 
<br />
N I A L S ******* This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of 
<br />
not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
<br />
potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make 
<br />
relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the 
<br />
program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New 
<br />
Zealand My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant 
<br />
with a major US Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled 
<br />
to Jody about receiving &quot;junk mail.&quot; I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the 
<br />
population and percentages involved. I &quot;knew&quot; it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed 
<br />
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the 
<br />
old &quot;I told you so&quot; on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two 
<br />
weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 
<br />
bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a 
<br />
believer now. I have joined Jody in her &quot;hobby.&quot; I did have seven more years until retirement, 
<br />
but I think of the &quot;rat race&quot; and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. Mitchell Wolf MD., 
<br />
Chicago, IL The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, 
<br />
lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was 
<br />
approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in 
<br />
return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in 
<br />
the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. Sincerely yours, Pam Hedland Halmstad, Sweden Not 
<br />
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. 
<br />
But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was 
<br />
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I surprised when I 
<br />
found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I 
<br />
had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years 
<br />
of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. 
<br />
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada I had 
<br />
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a 
<br />
try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was 
<br />
e-mailed another program, ..11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made 
<br />
more than $41,000 on the first try!! Mohamed, Cairo, Egypt This is my third time to participate 
<br />
in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the 
<br />
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. 
<br />
For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and 
<br />
happy spending! Sam Lee Suva, Fiji Islands ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD
