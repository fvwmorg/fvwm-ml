Hi,
<br />
I am a developer at Goldman Sachs, NY city. Ever since our applications were
<br />
migrated for running on the fvwm2 window managers, we find the following
<br />
peculiar problem with the time-taken for the hiding of the popup windows:
<br />
Our traders use the etManual application for manual outright and swaps
<br />
trades. It takes an unusually long time to dismiss all manual trades. There
<br />
is a 'dismiss' button on our manual popup which when clicked would free the
<br />
resources associated with the current trade and just hide the current manual
<br />
popup (only to bring it up to the foreground later with a new trade). This
<br />
hiding of the manual popup is not taking place immediately. This looks to
<br />
have been around from the time fvwm2 managers were commissioned, but most of
<br />
the traders didn't make any fuss about this until one of our traders came up
<br />
two weeks back with this issue of the delayed hiding. I looked through the
<br />
program code and tested it for the time intervals amidst the time the
<br />
'dismiss' button had been clicked to the time the popup is actually hidden.
<br />
However, it doesn't show me any clue as regards times, since the hiding
<br />
seems to be an asynchronous function. However, I noticed that the window
<br />
gets hidden quickly with terminals using pmwm window managers, just the way
<br />
the traders want. On the other hand, on my solaris workstation terminal
<br />
using fvwm2 window manager I find that it indeed takes considerable time to
<br />
have the same popup hidden.
<br />
<br />I would be grateful, if you could either point me to a web-page which
<br />
discusses why such a thing happens or on how I would need to proceed to
<br />
resolve this.
<br />
<br />Merci Beaucoup,
<br />
Karthik Ramaswamy
