<br />Andy&gt; Hi Chuck,
<br />
<br />Hi Andy.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; either you didn't get my mails &quot;Bugs, problems, wishes and
<br />
Andy&gt; praises&quot; and &quot;Slow reading of Menus with mini icons&quot; to the list
<br />
Andy&gt; this time, or I didn't get your reply.  The third possibility
<br />
Andy&gt; would be that you didn't respond (yet) to it.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; Last time you said you would respond to all comments, questions,
<br />
Andy&gt; etc. and especially bug reports.  And as far as I can see you
<br />
Andy&gt; always did to other people's mails.
<br />
<br />I did read your note when it came in and started to look into some of
<br />
the problems (like the coredump on $9), and I remember someone else
<br />
responding to some of the other ones.  I thought I had responded to
<br />
it, but apparently not.
<br />
<br />I beg your forgiveness, as I have been terribly busy lately.  If a
<br />
note takes only a few seconds to investigate and respond to, I try and
<br />
respond right away, but if it takes a little while then my real work
<br />
obviously takes precedence and sometimes I forget to return to looking
<br />
into the problems.  Since your note was so long and covered some non
<br />
obvious problems, it fell into the latter category.
<br />
<br />I'm sure I've unintentionally slighted a few people this way, and I
<br />
apologize to you (especially since this is like the 2nd or third time
<br />
I've lost track of one of your's) and to anyone else who thinks I'm
<br />
just discarding or ignoring their notes.
<br />
<br />I came back from lunch early, so I'll respond right now:
<br />

<br />Andy&gt; Hi Chuck,
<br />
Andy&gt; a few weeks ago you wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I usually save the notes that come in for a while though - I'll look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; back over them and see if I have any of yours that I haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; addressed.
</em><br />
<br />Andy&gt; I responded:
<br />
Andy&gt;&gt; Thanks.  I understand that you are busy (so am i :-).  If you don't
<br />
Andy&gt;&gt; find the reports/questions I sent to the list, ie. if you don't
<br />
Andy&gt;&gt; respond to them, I'll just repost them to the list.  Okay?
<br />
<br />Yes, if I ever forget to respond, please give me a gentle nudge after
<br />
a few weeks by resending any reports...
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; So, here is a recompilation of my reports/requests:
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 1.) .fvwm2rc:
<br />
Andy&gt;     I get a coredump right after fvwm2 starts, when I ask for this:
<br />
Andy&gt;  AddToFunc XSETROOT_b &quot;I&quot; exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     But it works fine when I ask for this:
<br />
Andy&gt;  AddToFunc XSETROOT_b &quot;I&quot; exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     I checked the man page for fvwm2 and it says $0 - $9 is fine, though.
<br />
<br />I started looking into this problem.  The 'expand' routine which
<br />
handles these looks for 0-9 as being valid, but it's referencing a
<br />
passed in value by this.  If that passed in value isn't allocated as
<br />
10 char *'s, there could be trouble.  I'm looking through the code
<br />
again right now...  Oooh.  I think I found the problem.  In
<br />
functions.c in ExecuteFunction, it resets the 'arguments' array so all
<br />
of it's members are NULL, sort of:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;char *arguments[10];
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;for(j=0;j&lt;9;j++)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguments[j] = NULL;
<br />
<br />It's forgetting to reset the last one ([9])...  If you try changing
<br />
this to:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;char *arguments[10];
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;for(j=0;j&lt;10;j++)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguments[j] = NULL;
<br />
<br />Your coredump should go away, I believe.  Not every system will have
<br />
this problem, as some of them will automatically set those values to
<br />
be NULL.  Your system probably isn't one of these...  I've fixed this
<br />
for the next release.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 2.) FvwmWinList:
<br />
Andy&gt;     *truncateleft doesn't work.  It still truncates right.
<br />
<br />I recall the author of FvwmWinList responding to this himself.  I
<br />
believe his response was that it should be *FvwmWinListTruncateLeft,
<br />
and that it worked for him locally.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 3.) FvwmTalk:
<br />
Andy&gt;     It doesn't accept module specifications like &quot;*FvwmWinListUseIconNames&quot;
<br />
Andy&gt;     The error message is:
<br />
Andy&gt;       &quot;No such module /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2 *FvwmWinListUseIconNames&quot;
<br />
<br />This has been on the TO-DO list for a while, I believe, in the
<br />
Bugfixes section:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Increase FvwmTalk capabilities (like module config options)
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 4.) Okay, here is a tricky one:
<br />
Andy&gt;     In my .fvwm2rc I got:
<br />
Andy&gt;  Key Up          A       SC      CursorMove  0 -1
<br />
Andy&gt;  Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove  0 +1
<br />
Andy&gt;  Key Up          A       SM      CursorMove  0  -10
<br />
Andy&gt;  Key Down        A       SM      CursorMove  0  +10
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     This works beautifully, unless a (popup) menu is open.  In that
<br />
Andy&gt;     case Shift-Control-&lt;cursor&gt; (and even Shift-&lt;cursor&gt;) acts just
<br />
Andy&gt;     like Shift-Meta-&lt;cursor&gt;.  Apparently the Meta-Flag is set while
<br />
Andy&gt;     a menu is open.  Strange.
<br />
Andy&gt;     Control-&lt;cursor&gt; also moves the cursor, but it seems like in
<br />
Andy&gt;     tenths of a step.
<br />
<br />When menus are poped up, they intercept arrow keys and (interestingly
<br />
enough) Emacs like key sequences for cursor movement.  I don't know if
<br />
this is documented anywhere though.  I'll have to check.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 5.) This is not a bug, but two questions:
<br />
Andy&gt;     a) Did fvwm1's 'Cursor' command disappear completely, or is it
<br />
Andy&gt;        just hidden somewhere?  If it's gone, why?
<br />
<br />Yes it's gone.  The TO-DO list has plans to ressurect it.  Don't know
<br />
why it dissappeared.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     b) What about fvwm1's commands &quot;AppsBackingStore&quot; and &quot;BackingStore&quot;?
<br />
Andy&gt;        Are they gone, too?  Why?
<br />
<br />Again, not sure why.  My first guess would be the lack of Style flags
<br />
available, so some stuff had to be sacrificed.  There isn't a lot of
<br />
code associated with these, so they could probably be brought back
<br />
after the seemingly mythical Style flags code rewrite that I keep
<br />
mentioning...
<br />
<br />Also, using BackingStore does eat a lot of extra memory, I believe.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 6.) Another question, but more tricky I am afraid:
<br />
Andy&gt;     How can I specify that an iconified FvwmPager always opens up
<br />
Andy&gt;     at -1+1 ?  In order to simulate the old builtin pager, I got this:
<br />
Andy&gt;  AddToFunc InitFunction    &quot;I&quot; Module FvwmPager 0 1
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerHilight lightsteelblue
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerLabel 0 Standard
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Extended
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35
<br />
Andy&gt;  *FvwmPagerStartIconic
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     It starts up iconic, just like I want to have it, but of course
<br />
Andy&gt;     it always shows up where all the other icons are, too.  But I
<br />
Andy&gt;     want to have it at the upper right corner.  Is that possible?
<br />
<br />Use the Style command to give it it's own IconBox to place it there,
<br />
would be the easiest way.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 7.) I would like to second the wish for &quot;OpaqueResize&quot; and for
<br />
Andy&gt;     &quot;TogglePage&quot; and my personal wish would be a window-specific
<br />
Andy&gt;     AutoRaise command/module, like a style-command or so.
<br />
<br />All basically on the TO-DO list already.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 8.) Still playing around with fvwm 2.0.38 I found that the behavior
<br />
Andy&gt;     of complex functions is a little different than what I was used
<br />
Andy&gt;     to from fvwm 1.24r.  I have the following function defined:
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;  AddToFunc WindowOps-or-Kill      &quot;M&quot; Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
<br />
Andy&gt;  +                                &quot;C&quot; Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
<br />
Andy&gt;  +                                &quot;D&quot; Delete
<br />
Andy&gt;  +                                &quot;D&quot; Close
<br />
Andy&gt;  +                                &quot;D&quot; Destroy
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     What I thought this would do when I double click is this:
<br />
Andy&gt;      1.) try to Delete the window
<br />
Andy&gt;      2.) if 1.) failed try to Close the window
<br />
Andy&gt;      3.) if 2.) failed also, Destroy the window.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     But what happens is that the window always gets destroyed.
<br />
Andy&gt;     Is this a bug or a feature?  If it's a feature would it be
<br />
Andy&gt;     possible to make this behavior optional?
<br />
<br />I'll have to look into this a little further.  It sounds like a
<br />
reasonable request, but I don't know how easy it'll be.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 9.) There is a DestroyMenu for re-defining Menus and Functions, which
<br />
Andy&gt;     is a very nice feature.  Now I was wondering whether something
<br />
Andy&gt;     similar can be done with module options?  Something like
<br />
Andy&gt;     DestroyModule, to get back to the default behavior of the module?
<br />
Andy&gt;     (I am not talking about KillModule)
<br />
<br />This might be possible.  I'll add it to the TO-DO list.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt;     Since it's not possible to supply module options in FvwmTalk, it's
<br />
Andy&gt;     necessary to restart fvwm2 whenever I changed something in my
<br />
Andy&gt;     FvwmButtons.  That's too bad, since I can redefine everything
<br />
Andy&gt;     else, like menus, funcs, etc.
<br />
<br />See my response to #3 above.
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; 10) In a recent posting, Makoto 'MAR_kun' MATSUSHITA wrote that there are
<br />
Andy&gt;     a few FVWM modules out there which are not part of the standard
<br />
Andy&gt;     distribution (FvwmAdlLog, FvwmIconMan-0.2, FvwmWish-0.8,
<br />
Andy&gt;     fvwish-1.0, and tkfvwm0.5 and maybe more).  Could you possibly
<br />
Andy&gt;     put those into the distribution, let's say in a (unsupported)
<br />
Andy&gt;     contrib directory?  I bet many people are interested in them.
<br />
<br />I don't have all of these, but I do have some.  I don't plan on
<br />
putting them into the distribution just yet, but I would like to put
<br />
pointers to all of them in the FAQ until I decide to put some of them
<br />
into the distribution.  If someone knows where any or all of these
<br />
reside, please mail me the locations!
<br />
<br />Andy&gt; Finally I have to mention (as always):
<br />
Andy&gt; --&gt; FVWM is a *fabulous* vwm!  &lt;--
<br />
<br />I'm glad you still like it, even with all the above items. :)
