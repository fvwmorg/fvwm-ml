To put pixmaps in the title bar, you use ButtonStyle, which is documented in 
the fvwm2 manpage:


     ButtonStyle button# [Full]Pixmap pixmap-up [pixmap-down]

          Defines a pixmap to be displayed on a title-bar button.  button# is

          the title-bar button, and is between 0 and 9.  One or two pixmaps

          can be specified.  The first pixmap is shown as the "up" button

          position and the second as the "down" position.  If the second pix-

          map is not specified, the first one is used for both positions.

          One might define the following definitions:


               ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap pixmap_both.xpm

               ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap pixmap_up.xpm pixmap_down.xpm


          The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative

          pathname (see PixmapPath).  If any of the pixmaps cannot be found,

          the entire button reverts to a simple rectangle with no pixmaps.

          If the word Full is prefixed to Pixmap, then the pixmap can use the

          entire height of the title-bar (i.e. the relief border around the

          button is not drawn).


I have played around with this and have created some pixmaps to use in my 
title bars that give it a very win95-ish look and feel...my .fvwm2rc, a couple 
of screen shots, and the pixmaps i created can be found at:
