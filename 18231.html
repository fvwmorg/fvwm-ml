</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Good guess.  I don't plan to change the default, although for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's worth I actually use ClickToFocus as my focus policy so changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the default wouldn't bother me in the least.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I see no compelling arguement to change this default at this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point.  It has been in there since the dawn of fvwm (and into it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ancestor twm as well, if I remember correctly).  If people don't like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it, they can change it individually.
</em><br />
<br />SR&gt; But only if they spend a lot of time wading around in config files
<br />
SR&gt; (which new users especially are loath to do).
<br />
<br />I'd say that depends on the person, but is probably generally true for
<br />
people who tend to be non &quot;power users&quot; of their tools.  But what is
<br />
the biggest response to newbie questions?  RTFM.  They may be loath to
<br />
do it, but must learn sometime...
<br />
<br />SR&gt; I recommend adding a button in the default root menu to change the
<br />
SR&gt; focus model
<br />
<br />I think this is a good idea.  It shouldn't be too bad to create a
<br />
simple menu to configure some simple things like that.  I'll see about
<br />
putting one in the next beta.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; (CDE and HP's Vue both come with preferences dialogs that allow
<br />
SR&gt; you do make this change without reading a manual).
<br />
<br />Just as a side note, FvwmConfig (in the extras dir) and The Dotfile
<br />
Generator can both be used to configure aspects of fvwm in an
<br />
interactive way, although I have to admit that I haven't really even
<br />
looked at either. :)  The latter supports fvwm 1.xx as well.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; The &quot;sample.fvwmrc&quot; that comes with fvwm2, already assumes a
<br />
Dan&gt; default focus policy and supplies overrides of clicktofocus for:
<br />
Dan&gt; FvwmButtons, xbiff, Maker, Appointment, xcalc, xman, xvgr,
<br />
Dan&gt; matlab, xmag, xgraph, sppeed6, and xmosaic.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; Sounds like apps that work best with explicit focus are actually very
<br />
SR&gt; common.  This is evidence that explicit should be the default, and
<br />
SR&gt; xterm should have a pointer focus override...
<br />
<br />Actually, I believe that the reason Rob put (most of) those in there
<br />
is because he never really wanted the focus to go to those while he
<br />
was moving the cursor about, particularily with sloppy focus, which I
<br />
believe he used.  I think that was also the motivator behind per
<br />
window focus policies to begin with.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Any change to the default would break every .fvwm2rc file around.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Probably a safe bet.
</em><br />
<br />SR&gt; Maybe for fvwm 3 ;-)
<br />
<br />Perhaps, but isn't that thinking a bit far ahead since I haven't even
<br />
managed to get an official version of 2.xx out? ;^)
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; My guess is that a POLITE request from the metacard people for
<br />
Dan&gt; metacard to be added to the the clicktofocus list in the
<br />
Dan&gt; &quot;sample.fvwmrc&quot;, might be granted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Certainly.  Just need to know the window classes/resources to use in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the style lines.  And it would be easy for MetaCard to provide this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; info as well in the README that Scott said they already supply telling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; how to put other window managers into ClickToFocus mode.
</em><br />
<br />SR&gt; The window class name is &quot;MetaCard&quot;, but when I tried using the
<br />
SR&gt; override it doesn't seem to make things much better.
<br />
<br />Hm.  Well, I'll put that in the list anyways.  Do all of your
<br />
subwindows have that same class name as well?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But, on a related note and partly what Scott's original note dealt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with, I do need to verify that fvwm is handling the 4 input handling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; policies correctly according to the ICCCM, which I'm not 100% certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that it does.
</em><br />
<br />SR&gt; It doesn't, and when using the default configuration (&quot;sloppy
<br />
SR&gt; focus&quot;?)  MetaCard is basically unusable with fvwm2.  Changing the
<br />
SR&gt; default to clickToFocus improves things somewhat, but there are
<br />
SR&gt; still serious problems.
<br />
<br />Well, according to what you said your app is Globally Active, which is
<br />
the one input policy that I was really thinking might not be being
<br />
handled correctly.  But I would not have imagined that it could make
<br />
any application unusable...
<br />
<br />SR&gt; The latest release of fvwm2 actually seems worse in general than
<br />
SR&gt; 1.X was.
<br />
<br />I assume you mean with respect to MetaCard.  If not, I'd like to know
<br />
what you feel the other problems are with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, if anyone out there has observed any violations of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conventions that seem to need to be fixed in fvwm, please let me know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the details.
</em><br />
<br />SR&gt; I would be happy to help you work through these, and the problem about
<br />
SR&gt; the missing configure notify message when an app raises its menu bar
<br />
SR&gt; window.  Here is my original report agains 1.24r, and all of these
<br />
SR&gt; problems also exist in 2.0.43:
<br />
<br />I do have your original note, but didn't get a chance to reply before
<br />
my mailbox got flooded and finding the time to reply to long notes is
<br />
difficult sometimes...  I guess I'll reply now.
<br />
<br />....
<br />
SR&gt; 1) In the explict/click-to-type focus model, clicking in a window
<br />
SR&gt; incorrectly automatically moves the keyboard focus to that window.
<br />
SR&gt; The focus should remain in the source window until the application
<br />
SR&gt; specifically requests it with XSetInputFocus.
<br />
<br />Actually, this is true only for Locally &amp; Globally Active windows
<br />
(those that have WM_TAKE_FOCUS defined) such as your application.
<br />
This is basically the situation that I thought fvwm might not be
<br />
handling correctly, although I haven't really investigated it yet.
<br />
<br />I'll look the code over before the next beta and see if I can find any
<br />
holes.
<br />
<br />....
<br />
SR&gt; 2) In the pointer focus model, moving the mouse to a window doesn't
<br />
SR&gt; always focus that window.  Reproduce by opening the MetaCard
<br />
SR&gt; Message Box and moving the mouse back and forth between it an the
<br />
SR&gt; Home stack.  Sometimes MetaCard thinks it has the focus (the
<br />
SR&gt; cursor flashes in the Message Box) even when it doesn't,
<br />
SR&gt; indicating either a missing FocusOut event, or the WM dropping (or
<br />
SR&gt; getting confused by) MetaCard's XSetInputFocus call.
<br />
<br />This seems a bit odd.  I guess I may actually have to download
<br />
MetaCard to check this out, which I was hoping to avoid.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; 3) Calling XRaiseWindow does not cause a configureNotify event to be
<br />
SR&gt; sent to the application like it does with mwm.
<br />
<br />Hm.  Are you sure this is supposed to happen?  I just used xev to
<br />
watch the events being sent to a window that I was manually raising
<br />
and lowering, and under both fvwm and mwm NEITHER actually showed a
<br />
ConfigureNotify event happening (basically just visibiltynotify
<br />
events).  Now, I was doing this under xmx, perhaps if I run them
<br />
normally...nope - same behavior that way.  I did see ConfigureNotify
<br />
events if I moved them though, but not when I raised them.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; PS: I had some trouble getting fvwm2 set up and working, due
<br />
SR&gt; primarily to the fact that the installation program doesn't
<br />
SR&gt; install a system.fvwm2rc file, the fact that you changed the name
<br />
SR&gt; of the file yet supply only samples without the &quot;2&quot; in them,
<br />
<br />Whoops - forgot to make that symbolic link, like I did with the man
<br />
page.  That'll be corrected for the next beta.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; the fact that the sample &quot;system.fvwmrc&quot; has &quot;restart&quot; wrong for
<br />
SR&gt; fvwm2,
<br />
<br />Another thing that slipped by - also will be corrected for the next
<br />
beta.  A side note, I'd like to enhance (clean up) Restart so if there
<br />
are no parms (or if it's say just a '-') that it will restart using
<br />
argv[0], so you don't need to know if it was named fvwm or fvwm2.
<br />
I'll try and get this into the next beta as well.
<br />
<br />SR&gt; and the fact that both the samples start up a bunch of things that
<br />
SR&gt; don't work on the system I installed it on (a Linux 1.2.13 system
<br />
SR&gt; (Caldera's)).
<br />
<br />That I'd believe.  But they are samples after all and should probably
<br />
be customized before being installed at the end site.  Perhaps I
<br />
should make a &quot;bare bones&quot; version as well and make that the default,
<br />
and spell out what I just said explicitly in the INSTALL file.
<br />
<br />Damn, this took way too long to type.  Gotta run!
