Olly Stephens:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's easy to see what benefit this would have to people adopting this style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of layout.
</em><br />
<br />That's what I think as well.  I tried it for a day or two, and it can
<br />
be nice, but, personally, I use too many windows of varying sizes
<br />
(xterms, xcalc, exmh, editors, file managers, xconsole, xv, games;
<br />
I've all these open at this moment) for it to be comfortable.  In
<br />
my experience, this style was suitable best when there were a lot of
<br />
independently used windows (i.e., there is no need to have many visible
<br />
at the same time).
<br />
<br />My own solution is to use several virtual desktops (I have six: one for
<br />
system administration, one for mail/news/other comms, three for my three
<br />
most important projects, and one extra), and a per-desktop FvwmIconMan
<br />
(which I wish was included in the standard distribution).  The FvwmIconMan
<br />
is really nice for finding a window among many.  That and automatic
<br />
raising of the focused window are about the most important work boosters 
<br />
from Fvwm (fiddling around with my .fvwm2rc is not :-).  Oh, the built-in
<br />
window list is also nice, since it allows me to go directly to a window
<br />
on another desktop.
<br />
<br />I'm not really a power user (I prefer &quot;wannabe hacker&quot;), so at the moment,
<br />
after two nights of using mostly e-mail, I only have 22 windows spread
<br />
on my desktops (one of them is completely empty).  I can easily have more
<br />
than three times that, but usually I avoid it since the built-in window
<br />
list no longer fits on my screen (I usually close all editor windows
<br />
for one project when I stop working it for the day).
<br />
<br />My work habits tend to encourage many windows -- I have xfm configured so
<br />
that it starts an editor when a file is double clicked, and a typical
<br />
project has a dozen or two files, most of which are edited or viewed
<br />
at the same time.  Also my editor (my own; one of my projects :-) makes
<br />
it trivial to `clone' a window, i.e., to open a new window with the same
<br />
file and the same location as the old one (the cloning is done by a single
<br />
click -- no menus or anything).  After trying many alternatives, this is
<br />
what I've landed on.
<br />
<br />It could be improved.  I'd like a Windows-like Alt-Tab and Alt-Shift-Tab
<br />
that circulate among windows, but re-order the list (or stack) so that the 
<br />
new window is always brought to the top.  This'd make it easier to
<br />
navigate without a mouse.  Oh, and an optional status window would
<br />
probably be preferable than directly jumping to the window; I don't know.
<br />
<br />(I don't like Windows as a whole, but it has some nice points in its
<br />
user interface.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   2. Don't you think it may look a little silly with fvwm's mwm-style 3d
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      borders.  
</em><br />
<br />Personally, I prefer
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Style &quot;*&quot;           BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 2, NoHandles
<br />
<br />I used the borders only when resizing, and that's not common enough an
<br />
operation for me that I can't go select it from a menu.
