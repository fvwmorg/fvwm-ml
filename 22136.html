OK, these are good points (I'm leaving the followup gunk at the bottom of my
<br />
post for those who don't have threading mailreaders). 
<br />
<br />I see three main choices:
<br />
1. Keep the current architecture.
<br />
2. Add an SOL (some other language) to FIL (fvwm's internal language).
<br />
3. Replace FIL with SOL.
<br />
<br />I personally would prefer #3. (thanks to Manfred and tonny for pointing out
<br />
the costs of my attempt at compromise). But my desire for compromise remains,
<br />
since there are many people who use fvwm that don't need a fat interpreter in
<br />
the executable. As for #2, I don't like that at all due to the need to
<br />
partition functionality between FIL and SOL(s).
<br />
<br />The logical reply to that is to use swig, so people can use whichever
<br />
interpreter they wish. It probably is a simple matter to implement FIL (or
<br />
something like it), as a swigable thing for those who prefer the status quo.
<br />
I immediately see two hurdles:
<br />
<br />1. Currently modules tell fvwm what to do by sending FIL strings to fvwm. This 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;won't work anymore, since the module writer can't know beforehand which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language fvwm is going to be using. The solution to this is to probably
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give the modules the swig interface to fvwm as well. 
<br />
2. Once we have an interpreter running inside of fvwm, it will probably have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's own share of state. It's likely modules will want to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read/write/execute those (note that this is the modules talking to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpreter, not fvwm as in #1). I don't see any way to prevent modules
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from developing dependencies on the SOL here, but as long as we have a good 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough mechanism to support #1, modules should only talk to the SOL when
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then absolutely have to, so that's OK. 
<br />
<br />Then there is the problem that I currently have plenty of people sending me
<br />
bug reports which include there .fvwm2rc files. It's hard enough getting these 
<br />
.fvwm2rc's to work right now. I'll probably go mad if people start sending me
<br />
.fvwm2rc's which require me to install tcl version x.y to fix their bug.
<br />
<br />So, if we support:
<br />
a. FIL only, we frustrate people who want to do things in a real language (if
<br />
only I could write a function to do ...)
<br />
b. 1 SOL, then we better make sure we don't pick something which many people
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hate. 
<br />
c. 2 or more SOL's, then I don't see any way to avoid doing lots of work and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dealing with logistical headaches.
<br />
<br />So, proposing that we choose #b, replacing FIL with one SOL, we're looking at
<br />
Manfred's questions:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comments?  Other questions to ask?
</em><br />
<br />I see two other questions:
<br />
<br />4. How many resources are we willing to use, both in code bloat and requiring
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people to install whichever files language X needs to operate.
<br />
<br />5. How nicely does language X lend itself to embedding.
<br />
<br />My answers:
<br />
1. I want to be able to set the usual fvwm options (a=b type statements),
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain state about windows (so I can write functions to do things like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SmartPlacement), and have real functions. I'd like to have it support a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;module interface, and multiple namespaces (ala python) so that I can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write modules in that language which won't have namespace collisions with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each other. Multithreading is probably a reasonably requirement.
<br />
<br />2. I would probably do a LOT of programming in such a language, some of it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released as modules.
<br />
<br />3. guile or python
<br />
<br />4. Either guile or python could be made to work with a minimal installation of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff, but the simplest thing for people to do is install the whole damn
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing. Probably true for any interpreted language.
<br />
<br />5. Both guile and python were designed from the beginning to be embedded. It's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably fairly easy to map the window manager data structures onto python
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objects and vice versa. Guile might be more of a stretch.
