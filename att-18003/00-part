Does anyone know how to capture a screen-shot under X-Windows ?

I am using FVWM (under Linux).  Is there a way to ask the X server
(in this case XFree86) or the window manager (fvwm) to take a snapshot
of the screen and save it as an image ? I looked at the manual of FVWM
but couldn't find the answer.

Please copy the answer to my email address! Thanks!
