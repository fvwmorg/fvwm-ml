Not sure quite how you want it to work, but here's one approach...

This will set things up so that clicking on the third button on the left
in the titlebar of a window will make <Alt><Shift>F1 a shortcut for that
window; generalizing it is left as an exercise :-)

1) Put the following perl script into your ModulePath under the name
FvwmWarpTo:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    open(WINID,"/tmp/shortcut");
    $winid = hex(<WINID>);
    close(WINID);
    $fd = $ARGV[0];
    close(STDOUT);
    open(STDOUT, ">&$fd");
    print STDOUT pack("lla6l", $winid, 6, "Focus", 0);

2) Add the following lines to your .fvwm2rc file:
    Mouse	0	5	N	Exec	echo $w > /tmp/shortcut
    Key		F1	A	SM	Module	FvwmWarpTo

The way it works is:
    - the titlebar button is bound to the action of writing the window
	id ($w) to a temporary file;
    - the shortcut key calls the perl script, which reads the window ID
	from the temporary file and spits a Focus command for the window
	back to fvwm2.

Note: this is only intended as a rough example.  With a little work,
this could probably be turned into a much smoother mechanism; if anyone
thinks it would be a worthwhile addition to the distribution, say so and
I'll whip it into shape....

HTH,
