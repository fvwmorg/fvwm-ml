<br />
We've discovered a couple of problems with fvwm 1.24r that make it
<br />
difficult to use with our application MetaCard.  The first two are
<br />
caused by the fact that MetaCard unusual in that it is an &quot;active
<br />
focus&quot; application that *requests* the keyboard focus when it needs it
<br />
(the XWMHints.input field is False, and the WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom is
<br />
set).  These are all with maximum mwm compatibility specified in the
<br />
config files, yet aren't a problem with mwm or olwm.
<br />
<br />You can verify all of these problems by getting MetaCard 2.0.1 from
<br />
<a href="ftp://ftp.metacard.com/MetaCard">ftp://ftp.metacard.com/MetaCard</a>.  You'll need an engine (precompiled
<br />
binary) for whichever platform you're using (e.g., SPARC.gz, Linux.gz,
<br />
etc.), the Home stack (mchome.mc.gz) and the tools stack
<br />
&quot;mctools.mc.gz&quot;.  Gunzip all three parts, chmod +x the engine, then
<br />
run it.
<br />
<br />1) In the explict/click-to-type focus model, clicking in a window
<br />
incorrectly automatically moves the keyboard focus to that window.
<br />
The focus should remain in the source window until the application
<br />
specifically requests it with XSetInputFocus.  Reproduce by clicking
<br />
in a window other than the MetaCard Home stack, then clicking back in
<br />
the MetaCard window.  It should only set the focus to the window if
<br />
you click on one of the icons in that window.
<br />
<br />2) In the pointer focuse model, moving the mouse to a window doesn't
<br />
always focus that window.  Reproduce by opening the MetaCard Message
<br />
Box and moving the mouse back and forth between it an the Home stack.
<br />
<br />3) Calling XRaiseWindow does not cause a configureNotify event to be
<br />
sent to the application like it does with mwm.  Our application raises
<br />
the menu bar window when the user clicks on a menu button, and needs
<br />
the configureNotify message to confirm that the menu has been raised
<br />
before opening the menu panel (otherwise, the menu bar can be raised
<br />
*after* the panel is opened if the window manager is slow to respond).
<br />
MetaCard has a 500 msec timeout for the wait for the message, but this
<br />
problem makes opening menus with fvwm very tedious.  Reproduce by
<br />
opening the MetaCard menu bar and clicking on a menu: there is a delay
<br />
between the click and the panel opening (this isn't a problem with
<br />
mwm).
<br />
<br />======================================================================
<br />
And now for a plea for a change of default focus policy in fvwm from
<br />
pointer to explicit focus.  The current default of pointer focus is
<br />
provably inferior to explicit focus, and really puts Linux in
<br />
particular at a major disadvantage to Micro$oft products in the
<br />
marketplace because it is user-hostile and industry non-standard.  All
<br />
other workstations and/or operating systems ship with explicit (click
<br />
to type) focus by default, including Sun, HP, IBM, all vendors that
<br />
ship the COSE Desktop, Apple, NeXT, and Microsoft.  This industry
<br />
standard is the mode that 99.9% of current computer users are familiar
<br />
with, and has been shown to be easier for novice computer users to
<br />
grasp.
<br />
<br />As for the provably inferior part, here are a few scenarios using our
<br />
product MetaCard, among the commercial X products that is most like
<br />
applications found on MS-Windows and the Mac:
<br />
<br />A) Like many Mac and Windows applications, when the user opens or
<br />
traverses to editable text fields in MetaCard dialogs, the text in the
<br />
field is automatically selected to make it more efficient to change
<br />
the value (since you just type in the new value instead of having to
<br />
delete the old value first).  This doesn't work very well with pointer
<br />
focus, because every time you move the mouse out of the window, it
<br />
selects the text in some other window.  Not only is the flashing very
<br />
annoying, but it also makes it impossible to use the menu bar to
<br />
cut/copy/paste selections, since the selection changes when you move
<br />
the mouse up to the menu bar (which is in another window).  There is
<br />
no workaround for this problem other than using explicit focus.
<br />
<br />B) Like many Mac and Windows applications, MetaCard relies heavily on
<br />
floating palettes and other modeless dialogs.  To facilitate this,
<br />
MetaCard is an &quot;active focus&quot; application, which means that the
<br />
keyboard focus doesn't necessarily go to these windows when the user
<br />
clicks in them (to select a tool, choose a menu, or run a layout
<br />
script).  This allows the user to designate the window to which the
<br />
operation should be applied by making it the focused window.  This
<br />
technique doesn't work with pointer focus, because the mere act of
<br />
moving to a tool palette focuses that palette, a useless operation
<br />
with potentially devistating consequences as the user may then lose
<br />
track of which window the operation will be applied to.
<br />
<br />Continued use of pointer focus as the default will just demonstrate a
<br />
total lack of respect for industry standards by the fvwm developers,
<br />
prevents many advanced applications (such as MetaCard) from working
<br />
well on many Linux systems, annoys and confuses novice users, and is
<br />
generally detrimental to the success of products such as Linux that
<br />
deserve all the help they can get.
<br />
