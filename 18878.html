<br />
Here's a patch to the fvwm2.man page fixing some spelling and other
<br />
errors.
<br />
<br />Note in particular the fix in the Mouse definition section; without this
<br />
the formatted man page is missing an entire line and the docs are
<br />
incorrect.
<br />
<br />Also, I think some examples are absolutely critical.  Especially because
<br />
the strictly alphabetical ordering of the sections in the man page can
<br />
be quite confusing: you come to AddButtonStyle before you find
<br />
ButtonStyle, for example.  It can be really hard to figure out what's
<br />
going on... I'm still not clear on the difference--is it just that
<br />
AddButtonStyle adds to the existing style, while ButtonStyle deletes the
<br />
existing style, if any, first?  If so, it seems to me that this syntax
<br />
is a bit confusing.  Can't ButtonStyle incorporate both of these?
<br />
<br />Also, the new syntax of (), --, and ! for styles should be explained,
<br />
perhaps, in its own section.
<br />
<br />And some examples of good uses of decors, title styles, etc. is
<br />
imperative.  I'm not necessarily saying all these should go in the man
<br />
page, of course, but some comments somewhere to help one wade through
<br />
the myriad features is mandatory.  I'm lost!
