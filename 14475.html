</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; When I was thinking about writing a Start bar for fvwm (a la
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; Win95's start bar), I thought: `this has got to be a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; module'.  But then I realized that it would primarily be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; using (a) Pixmaps from the icons, and (b) Menus.  Using its
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; own menu code would be wasteful, since 99% of it would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; identical with fvwm's menus, and I would hate for it to have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; its own pixmaps, when they are in common with fvwm's (unless
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; somehow, fvwm told the module about the pixmaps).
<br />
<br />The code in fvwm/menu.c can be divided between
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1/ code that generates and destroys menus in memory;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2/ code to display menus.
<br />
<br />Obviously, only (a part of) 2/ has to be rewritten. If it is possible
<br />
for fvwm to pass a complete menu data structure to a module when it is
<br />
modified, then 1/ could be kept in fvwm/, along with some additionnal
<br />
communication code. If this is not possible, 1/ could be at least
<br />
moved to fvwmlib to avoid source duplication, if not code bloat (which
<br />
could be avoided with a shared library, but since libfvwm is so
<br />
small...)
<br />
<br />Then the code of 2/ could be duplicated from fvwm/menus.c. The same
<br />
holds for drawing windows, since positionning the title and using
<br />
xpm's is not enough to emulate the look and feel of a window manager. 
<br />
<br />Now, if we can come up with a relatively simple definition of menu
<br />
appearance that can be parameterized (for example, in terms of color
<br />
and shadow thickness for menus themselves, selected item, separators,
<br />
submenu arrows, etc.), then some general code could be written and an
<br />
UI would just be a set of parameters (Just have to do 'Read Win95Menus'
<br />
to enable it). Thus, no specific code would be hardcoded in fvwm for
<br />
these menus.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; I still think it should be a module, but I also think the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; issues remain.  The counter argument is that the start bar
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; is simply a type of menu just like the pop-ups that exist in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; fvwm today.
<br />
<br />The start bar is also, if I am not mistaken, an icon manager that
<br />
shows all (iconified ?) applications. It could be programmed as such
<br />
(perhaps derived from FvwmIconBox) and call fvwm do displays
<br />
menus. Then, if you have a module that can display win95-like menus,
<br />
they will be shown as such. Of course, the same module could be both
<br />
an icon manager and an UI module.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; As far as Menu styles, the MenuStyle Win95 was simply based
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; on the existing MenuStyle Motif, MenuStyle Fvwm.  I think
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; that once a core amount of functionality has been agreed on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; for fvwm (e.g. title bar &amp; title buttons, borders, pop-up
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; menus, etc.), then these should be customizable via Style
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; directives.  If the code were written in an OO programming
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; language, this would be probably easier than it is today,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; and it would allow for a cleaner separation of these styles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; (i.e. class MacTitleBar : public TitleBar) (but this is just
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elan&gt; my opinion :)
<br />
<br />Yes, but not every one want a large fvwm binary that can handle 45
<br />
different user interfaces. You like win95 look, but assume that
<br />
someone wants to add windows 2.0 or even twm ; the code will shortly
<br />
become very difficult to maintain. I think that the mwm style has some
<br />
reasons to be in the core, since mwm is typically a unix window
<br />
manager (except for Geos on PC, but this is a different
<br />
problem...). Moreover, fvwm tries to emulate mwm for Motif programs
<br />
that expect it to be there. The win95 style is more like an aesthetic
<br />
add-on (which I'd really like to see, in fact :-).
<br />
<br />The example of Geos is not really innocent. In this OS, all the UI
<br />
stuff is located in a module (a geode, in geospeak). If you change this
<br />
module, the whole user interface is changed (not only the menus or
<br />
window decorations, but all dialogs, scrollbars, etc.). I have not
<br />
seen it myself, but a MacIntosh interface and a windows 2.0 interface
<br />
have been demonstrated for various versions of Geos.
<br />
<br />If this is not too difficult in terms of coding and/or to slow, I'd
<br />
like to see fvwm take this direction. But, well, I don't really know C
<br />
or Xlib, so I won't do the coding myself. So I guess that people that
<br />
do the *real* work should be free to choose what they want to do :-)
<br />
<br />Jean-Marc.
