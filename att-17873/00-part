Yes it can be done with m4 and probably with cpp.  I have a setup where
I have defined in my .Xdefaults different xterm configurations for
different machines.  I then have ported my fvwm setup between four
different accounts with different architectures.  I have a single
generic xterm button but if I am on the machine wakko this button brings
up an xterm with the configuration named wakko, etc.

All of this is accomplished by:

	#1 Parsing the .fvwm2rc file with FvwmM4
	#2 passing the CLIENTHOST M4 macro to the -name command for
		xterm.

Likewise, you can simply use CLIENTHOST for your menus.  To parse your
files with m4, FvwmM4 must be compiled and installed on your system.
Then for fvwm2.0.43 the command:

	fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm2rc'

Will parse your files with m4 and replace any references to CLIENTHOST
with the machines name.  For more information please check out the man
page on FvwmM4.

Also note, for version previous to 2.0.43 the command was:

	fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm2rc'
