<br />Dan&gt; First I have a question and then I'll get on with the bug report.
<br />
Dan&gt; It's not in the FAQ so - what exactly is the purpose of libfvwm2.a?
<br />
Dan&gt; Is it only for those who wish to write modules or what?
<br />
<br />Basically (it's used to link fvwm itself too).  It really doesn't need
<br />
to be installed, although I believe it currently is installed.

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'd like to make this the last beta before the first official
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; release (2.1.0).  So let me know what other problems you find with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it so I can clean it up (especially build and doc problems).  Bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in mind that I can't fix ALL of it's bugs, especially the one's I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can't reproduce...
</em><br />
<br />Dan&gt; Background info:
<br />
Dan&gt; I'm running Digital UNIX 3.2c on an AlphaStation and 3.0 on a DEC
<br />
Dan&gt; 3000/300LX Alpha.  Both systems have X11R5 and the XPM libs.  Fvwm was
<br />
Dan&gt; compiled &quot;out of the box&quot; with xmkmf;make Makefiles;make;make install;
<br />
Dan&gt; make install.man - all I changed in Fvwm.tmpl were the destination
<br />
Dan&gt; directories for the install.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Bug 1:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; This had appeared on the DEC 3000 since 2.0.42 but didn't show up on
<br />
Dan&gt; the AlphaStation 'til 2.0.43.  Often, edgescroll won't work.  I'll
<br />
Dan&gt; drag and drag and it won't switch pages.  If I then hit Control-right,
<br />
Dan&gt; it works fine, and thereafter edgescroll works normally.  I'm not sure
<br />
Dan&gt; if the problem stays fixed 'til I next log out and back in again
<br />
Dan&gt; though.  The relevant lines from my .fvwm2rc file are:
<br />
....
<br />
<br />I've seen some reports about this, but cannot reproduce it myself.  I
<br />
think I need to put a remark in the BUGS file about it.
<br />
<br />Just out of curiousity, is everyone else who is seeing it running on
<br />
DEC machines as well?
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Bug 2:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; xlock -mode flame has started dying after a few minutes of running.
<br />
Dan&gt; The error is:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt;    /bin/sh: 1416 Floating exception
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; where the number is the PID of:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt;    /bin/sh -c xlock -nolock -mode flame
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Previously the only mode I'd ever had trouble with was &quot;galaxy&quot;.  I
<br />
Dan&gt; don't know which of the last few versions this might have appeared in
<br />
Dan&gt; because I don't run XLock that often.  I can't really say for certain
<br />
Dan&gt; that it's fvwm but I haven't changed anything else that would affect
<br />
Dan&gt; it.
<br />
....
<br />
<br />Actually, I think this is a bug with xlock.  Do you see the same
<br />
problems if you run xlock by hand?  I've seen problems like this with
<br />
xlock in various modes core dumping (or locking up the machine
<br />
entirely) on PowerPC based machines, but haven't had a chance to
<br />
investigate yet.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Bug 3:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; The bug I mentioned in another message in which one of my xterms
<br />
Dan&gt; wasn't getting the Styles hasn't been fixed and may be worse.
<br />
Dan&gt; I'm not sure it was supposed to have been fixed but &quot;Simple patch
<br />
Dan&gt; to help take care of some timing bugs&quot; might be referring to it.
<br />
Dan&gt; To reiterate, the first xterm I run in my .xsession often,
<br />
Dan&gt; especially on the slower machine, does not get any Styles (not *,
<br />
Dan&gt; not xterm, nothing) even though the other xterms (also run from
<br />
Dan&gt; the .xsession after a short &quot;sleep&quot; delay...probably not starting
<br />
Dan&gt; until after fvwm2 is already running) do get the Styles.
<br />
Dan&gt; Restarting fvwm2 fixes this problem but, if I do it before some
<br />
Dan&gt; of the other delayed jobs in the .xsession finish, some of them
<br />
Dan&gt; will never finish and I end up with no xclock or xpostit+ or
<br />
Dan&gt; something.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; The reason I say this may be worse is that it's now happening more
<br />
Dan&gt; often on the AlphaStation, which is faster and hardly ever needs to
<br />
Dan&gt; swap.  In 2.0.42, it usually happened on the slower, lower RAM,
<br />
Dan&gt; machine and only occasionally on the fast machine.
<br />
<br />The &quot;Simple patch...&quot; does not address this problem.  As I said in a
<br />
note a few days ago (I believe), I know what is causing this problem
<br />
and have a good idea how to fix it.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, fvwm isn't Grabbing the server soon enough and new
<br />
windows are popping up after the list of windows to traverse has been
<br />
made (which is why they don't get updated).  The least destructive fix
<br />
that I can think of is to move the initial XGrabServer call up a
<br />
little, but some of the functions that are called below it make calls
<br />
to XGrabServer and XUngrabServer, which don't keep track of the total
<br />
grab request count (ie the first XUngrabServer could mess things up
<br />
again), so I'm creating my own wrappers around XGrab/UngrabServer to
<br />
keep track of the count and only ungrab after all corresponding grabs
<br />
&amp; ungrabs are done which should fix the problem.  It'll be in 2.1.0,
<br />
although I may mail out a patch for people to try early.
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Request for 2.1.0:
<br />
<br />Dan&gt; Not a bug report and I know the TO-DO list mentions resurrecting
<br />
Dan&gt; StubbornPlacement but, in case it's not implicitly grouped with
<br />
Dan&gt; StubbornPlacement, the return of StubbornIconPlacement would also be
<br />
Dan&gt; very nice - especially the feature that caused icons to reposition
<br />
Dan&gt; themselves to avoid windows when the Scroll function was called.  I
<br />
Dan&gt; had gotten used to not having to search for icons under windows.
<br />
<br />Neither of them will be in 2.1.0, but I have had the latter in mind
<br />
for part of the &quot;better icon handling needed?&quot; entry.
<br />
