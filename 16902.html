</em><br />
<br />Hi Randall - I was wondering if you might speak up about this.  :)
<br />
<br />I've waited for it to die down a bit before doing so myself.  Now
<br />
looks like a good time.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; I think autoconf is a nice thing to work towards.
<br />
<br />So do I.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; I have used it is house and it is invaluable once the effort has
<br />
RSW&gt; been put in to convert a large application to use configure. Its'
<br />
RSW&gt; primary author, David J. MacKenzie, worked for me while a student
<br />
RSW&gt; at the University of Maryland, so I would gladly see his work in
<br />
RSW&gt; wider use. However every time you muck with the build procedure
<br />
RSW&gt; you will interject bugs or problems that will take several
<br />
RSW&gt; release cycles to clean up. Look at what has happened to FVWM the
<br />
RSW&gt; last many months.
<br />
<br />Very true.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; Besides trying to clean up things for the release, the Imake
<br />
RSW&gt; configureation has gone through a couple good sized changes. Each
<br />
RSW&gt; time things that were fixed before were broke. This will happen
<br />
RSW&gt; with autoconf also. This has also slowed down the releses of FVWM
<br />
RSW&gt; ( In my opinion ),
<br />
<br />Yup, sure has.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; as constant build bugs that are reported with each beta tend to
<br />
RSW&gt; keep people from pulling the newest release once they have
<br />
RSW&gt; something installed and mostly working. This needs to get fixed.
<br />
<br />True.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; Maybe if Chuck had a few &quot;elves&quot; that he could have grab and try
<br />
RSW&gt; his releases on several platforms before he publicly announced a
<br />
RSW&gt; release we could clean up clean up the obvious bugaboos before it
<br />
RSW&gt; was announced.  A number of other lists that I am on do this with
<br />
RSW&gt; good success and there products look much cleaner as a result of
<br />
RSW&gt; this. Typical there is something like an &quot;fvwm-workers&quot; list,
<br />
RSW&gt; where those commited to supporting the product can quickly
<br />
RSW&gt; prepare things for release. I do like the open forum of the fvwm
<br />
RSW&gt; list though, but think something is in order.
<br />
<br />This is probably a good idea.  That is more or less what the mailing
<br />
list started as, but now there are probably more 'user' types than
<br />
'tester' types on the list, and it could probably be split up.
<br />
<br />Jason - how do you feel about adding a third mailing list (not
<br />
publically announced or not easily subscribed to perhaps) called
<br />
'fvwm-workers' or 'fvwm-beta-testers' or something like that?  Does
<br />
this sound like a good idea to you?  I don't really want to impose
<br />
upon your hospitality though, so if you don't want the additional
<br />
burden, just say so and we'll figure out something else.  I could just
<br />
make a mail alias w/ those people who would like to be these testers
<br />
and just do it by hand.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; I will personally volunteer to test early releases. I have HPUX,
<br />
RSW&gt; Solaris, SunOS, IRIX, NetBSD, DU (OSF/1), and Ultrix systems I
<br />
RSW&gt; can test both vendor and X11R6 builds against.
<br />
<br />Wow.  That's quite a number of OS'es.  I cover AIX (IBM's X11R5) &amp;
<br />
Linux myself.
<br />
<br />If I win the lotto this weekend, I'll buy some workstations for home
<br />
and test a few more of them myself.  :) Until then, I may just take
<br />
you up on your offer.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; If we had a couple/few volunteers for the major OS's and X11's,
<br />
RSW&gt; then one of us for each or most OS's and X11's could get back to
<br />
RSW&gt; chuck in a sort about of time so as not to slow up his releases
<br />
RSW&gt; by more then 1 or 2 days at the most.
<br />
<br />Which isn't bad considering it usually takes a month or 2 for me to
<br />
get them out anyways. :)
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; The result will be better quality control for FVWM.
<br />
<br />Most likely.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; There are many nuances with buiding things under X11. There are a
<br />
RSW&gt; number of changes from R4, to R5, to R6 and between vendors that
<br />
RSW&gt; make it hard to get things right if you do not test them on a
<br />
RSW&gt; number of platforms. Autoconf will have to deal with some of
<br />
RSW&gt; these same problems. When I started contributing my changes to
<br />
RSW&gt; the fvwm configuration, I at first only tested my changes on a
<br />
RSW&gt; couple OS's and under X11R6 only. A number of bugs were reported
<br />
RSW&gt; then by people who had differnet configurations then I tested
<br />
RSW&gt; under. Later I started testing under more platforms and using
<br />
RSW&gt; various xmkmf and X11 versions, and the bugs dropped way
<br />
RSW&gt; down. One more iteration would probably have stabilized this. The
<br />
RSW&gt; decisions was made to make the build more Imake-ish at this time,
<br />
RSW&gt; and the changes broke a number of things. Now a couple iterations
<br />
RSW&gt; later and we still have one or two cycles go before the build
<br />
RSW&gt; process will be release ready.
<br />
<br />I'm hoping that this next one will take care of it (basically, that
<br />
last patch I just sent out should do it, I think).  BTW - I plan to do
<br />
a fair amount of work on the next beta this weekend (since I have
<br />
Monday off too) so perhaps I can get it out soon.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; Lets not do this again right now, as there are alot more
<br />
RSW&gt; important FVWM things to work on. The current setup will work
<br />
RSW&gt; fine for most of us with a couple more turns of the crank.
<br />
<br />Definitely.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; Again, I would like to see further beta releases address changes
<br />
RSW&gt; to the FVWM code itself, and see the configuration/build process
<br />
RSW&gt; stabilized until after FVWM-2.1 is released.
<br />
<br />I fully agree with this and have NO intention on changing the build
<br />
process again until after 2.1.0 is released.  As you noted, twice was
<br />
already too much.
<br />
<br />But after that, I'd definitely like to start experimenting with
<br />
Autoconf, although other changes (particularly fixes) will obviously
<br />
take precidence.  I won't remove Imake at first (perhaps never
<br />
depending on how things go) but rather introduce it slowly and try to
<br />
make it work both ways if possible.
<br />
<br />But I don't see any reason why Autoconf can't be made to work just
<br />
fine to configure fvwm.  It may be tricky, but I think in the end
<br />
it'll work out much better than Imake has.
<br />
<br />RSW&gt; (my 2 cents worth)
<br />
<br />Mine too.
<br />
<br />Whoops - I'm running late - gotta go!
<br />
Chuck
