Hi Bruce,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular, its ability to hide itself and reappear when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointer goes near is a nice way of conserving screen space.  I want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like an icon box which should be easily available
</em><br />
<br />This is the only &quot;good&quot; idea to come from Win95 (IMHO) :-) - I've also
<br />
tried to create an application which shrinks itself when the focus
<br />
leaves the window, and pops itself up automatically as soon as the
<br />
focus enters the mini-window, however with fvwm2 it doesn't work (and
<br />
there's a few good, but &quot;technical&quot; technical reasons :-( ).
<br />
<br />Of course this would also be possible if the mouse events could be
<br />
extended, so that not just things like button events, but also enter
<br />
and leave events could be mapped. Then you could have something like:
<br />
<br />Mouse	Enter	I	A	Deiconify
<br />
Mouse	Leave	F	A	Iconify
<br />
<br />all that's missing then is to be able to bind this functionality to a
<br />
specific application.
<br />
<br />The &quot;technical&quot; difficulty that I spoke of above is simply that if you
<br />
try to move or resize a window, during the move or resize operation,
<br />
the focus is taken away from the app, and the app gets a focus event
<br />
(actually it gets 4!). Also, for some reason the geometry returned by
<br />
fvwm is not exactly the same as the geometry given by the application,
<br />
so having the application know where it is tends to go a little awry,
<br />
for me, the window wanders to the top left of the screen.
<br />
<br />The other difficulty was that I didn't actually want to iconify the
<br />
window, rather, show a minimizes version of the window, with some key
<br />
information. Some uses for this sort of thing that come to mind would
<br />
be:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mail program, which when minimised shows subjects of a few
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the newest waiting e-mails. Move the focus (with the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyboard or mouse) onto this mini window, and your full blown
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailer pops up.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A task tracking program (similar to xtimex) where the current
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activity and time would be shown in the mini window, and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full selection of activities when it gets the focus.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple clock, in the mini form you see the time and date,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the full size form, you get a scheduler, alarm clock etc.
<br />
<br />There are tons of ways in which this idea can be put to good use,
<br />
there are just a few things which need to be worked out:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- how to &quot;SIMPLY&quot; adjust the size and position of the full
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sized window, and the same for the mini-window (at least as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far as positioning goes)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- how to combine this idea with the ButtonBar (mini window in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the button bar, full size window somewhere on the screen)
<br />
<br />Perhaps this could be solved with a library (libminimizer?), at the
<br />
moment I don't know if X11 needs some slightly different events
<br />
(InMotion, Resizing?) or if the way the window manager communicates
<br />
with the windows needs to be cleared up a bit, it could also be that
<br />
something like this already exists, and I'm just showing my ignorance,
<br />
but I am yet to see ANY application which does this sort of thing.
<br />
<br />By the way, the mini-windows here are NOT to be confused with icons,
<br />
icons are little more than a button saying: &quot;I am an application,
<br />
click on me to see what I am&quot;, a mini window is a proper application
<br />
window, displaying information, but not accepting it (when focus
<br />
enters the mini window, the full size window for the application pop's
<br />
up, taking the focus with it).
<br />
<br />I would be most glad to hear ideas and suggestions about this sort of
<br />
thing, and would dearly love to see a working example, maybe you guys
<br />
are the ones to pull it off?
<br />
<br />PS: this has NOTHING to do with my employer, all comments, brilliant
<br />
ideas and errors in this e-mail are mine and mine alone, except of
<br />
course the idea of a self hiding application which I gladly borrowed
<br />
from M$ (and they've never stolen ideas either - nooooooo ;-)
<br />
<br />Steve
