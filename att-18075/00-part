I also use ddd, but I'm afraid I have no such problems.  What version of
Fvwm are you using?  What operating system?  Can you show us some sample
code from youe .fvwmrc (.fvwm2rc) file that may be of use?

I use ddd-2.0beta1 (haven't had time to grab the new source) under Linux
kernel 2.0.21, X11R6.1, and fvwm2-2.0.43.
