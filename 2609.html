WOW!! READ THIS: If you need to make a few thousand dollars 
<br />
REALLY FAST, then please take a moment to read this simple 
<br />
program I am sharing with you.
<br />
<br />You DO NOT have to send $5 to five people, buy their reports or 
<br />
recipes
<br />
or anything like that. Nor will you have to invest more money 
<br />
later to
<br />
get things going.
<br />
<br />THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO. Complete 
<br />
it in one hour and you will never forget the day you first 
<br />
received it.
<br />
<br />The following is a plan to benefit you and your future. BE 
<br />
PREPARED TO GET EXCITED...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Read the 
<br />
following and you will agree this is a very exciting opportunity. 
<br />
Only invest a little bit of time, and your reward could mean 
<br />
thousands of dollars! Good luck!
<br />
<br />IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!!! With two hours of work I have made over 
<br />
US$11,000 in the last three weeks..and my investment was just 
<br />
$5!!! I LOVE IT!
<br />
Thank you 11,000 x's! Julie M. St. Louis
<br />
<br />ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW? HOW DOES $10,000 IN TWO
<br />
WEEKS SOUND? Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait 
<br />
for the
<br />
others to start working. One hour of work to get started and no 
<br />
mailing
<br />
lists!

<br />
<br />Here's How It Works Unlike many other programs, this three level 
<br />
program is more realistic and much, much faster. Because it is so 
<br />
easy, the response rate for this program is VERY HIGH AND VERY 
<br />
FAST, and you will see results in two weeks or less! Just in time 
<br />
for next month's bills! You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or 
<br />
more as in other programs). You should also send them to people 
<br />
who send you their programs because they know these programs work 
<br />
and they are already believers in the system! Besides,this 
<br />
program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even 
<br />
if you are already in a program, stay with it, but do yourself a 
<br />
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and 
<br />
takes a very small investment. It will pay off long before other 
<br />
letters even begin to trickle in! Just give ONE person a $5 gift. 
<br />
That's all! Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you 
<br />
will have US$10,000 in your bank account!
<br />
<br />Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, 
<br />
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE!  Just one (1) US$5 
<br />
bill. That's your investment!!!
<br />
*****************************************************************
<br />
*******
<br />
Follow These Simple Instructions:
<br />
<br />1) On a blank sheet of paper write &quot;Please add me to your mailing 
<br />
list.&quot; 
<br />
Write your name and address clearly and include your email 
<br />
address for future mailings and courtesy follow ups. Fold it 
<br />
around a US$5 and send
<br />
it to the FIRST name on the list (#1). Only the first person on 
<br />
the list gets your name and a five dollar gift.
<br />
<br />2) Retype only the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE 
<br />
LIST. Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list 
<br />
in the THIR(#3)position.
<br />
<br />3) Send out 20 copies of this letter. NOTE: by sending this 
<br />
letter via EMAIL, the response time is much faster, and you save 
<br />
the expenses of
<br />
envelopes, stamps, and copying services. Consider this, MILLIONS 
<br />
of people surf the internet everyday, all day, all over the 
<br />
world! Fifty thousand new people get on the internet every month! 
<br />
An excellent source of names is the people who send you other 
<br />
programs and the names listed on the letter they send you. Your 
<br />
contact source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to think of all 
<br />
the possibilities! Mail, or should I say Email, your letter 
<br />
TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of your time. THAT'S IT!
<br />
<br />To send your newsletter by Email:
<br />
1) Go to &quot;edit&quot; and select all
<br />
2) Go to &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;copy&quot;
<br />
3) Start (compose) a new Email message
<br />
4) Address your Email and Subject blocks
<br />
5) Go to &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;paste&quot;
<br />
<br />After you have pasted this article to your new Email, delete the 
<br />
old header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Ect.) Now you can 
<br />
edit the
<br />
names and addresses with ease. I recommend deleting the top name, 
<br />
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then 
<br />
simply changing the numbers.
<br />
*****************************************************************
<br />
*******
<br />
<br />THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name reaches the first 
<br />
position in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your 
<br />
gifts. The gifts
<br />
will be sent to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who 
<br />
are willing to invest US$5 and one hour to receive US$10,000 in 
<br />
cash. That's all! There will be a total of US$10,000 in US$5 
<br />
bills in your mailbox in two weeks. US$10,000 for one hours work! 
<br />
I think it's WORTH IT, don't you? GO AHEAD--TRY IT. IT'S US$5! 
<br />
EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF 
<br />
YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!
<br />
<br />TRUE STORY -- Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift summation four 
<br />
times lastyear. The first time I received over $7,000 in cash in 
<br />
less than two weeks and over $10,000 in cash in the next three 
<br />
times I ran it. I can't begin to tell you how great it feels not 
<br />
to have to worry about money anymore! I thank God for the day I 
<br />
received this letter! It has truly changed my life! Don't be 
<br />
afraid to make gifts to strangers they'll come back to you in 
<br />
ten-fold. So, let's keep it going and help each other out in 
<br />
these tough and uncertain times.
<br />
<br />CAN I DO IT AGAIN?
<br />
OF COURSE YOU CAN--this plan is structured for everyone to send 
<br />
only 20 letters each. However, you are certainly not limited to 
<br />
20. Mail out
<br />
as many as you can.  Every 20 letters you send has a return of 
<br />
$10,000 or more. If you can mail forty, sixty, eighty, or 
<br />
whatever, GO FOR IT!
<br />
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT. Each time 
<br />
you run this program, just follow steps 1 thru 3 and everyone on 
<br />
your gift list benefits! Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, 
<br />
there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to 
<br />
the printer or copier, and you can do it again and again with 
<br />
your regular groups or gifters, or start up a new group.  Why 
<br />
not? It beats working! Each time you receive an MLM offer, 
<br />
respond with this letter! Your name will climb to the number one 
<br />
position at dizzying rates.  Follow the simple instructions, and 
<br />
above all,PLEASE PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this programs 
<br />
success. Your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
<br />
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list WILL 
<br />
NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats the other 
<br />
people who have worked hard and have earned the right to be 
<br />
there.  So please, play by the rules and the $$$ will come to 
<br />
you!
<br />
<br />MAIL YOUR LETTERS TODAY
<br />
$$$ Together we will prosper! $$$ GOOD LUCK!!!

Wishing you the best in all you do! You probably don't believe

this will
<br />
work, but if you don't try it you will never know. That's the way

I felt.
<br />
Try it. You won't be sorry.
