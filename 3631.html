Hi Dominik Vogt,
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for your reply to my question about 
<br />
the desktop and the current viewport. I appreciate it.
<br />
<br />I am running fvwm-2.4.3: apparently I shouldn't be having
<br />
the problem but I definitely still do. It is particularly
<br />
aggravating because when I hit the &quot;Restart fvwm&quot; menu entry,
<br />
it always comes up in a different window and if I didn't 
<br />
know better, I would think I had lost all my windows when they 
<br />
are simply in a different viewport.
<br />
<br />I just tried adding:
<br />
<br />AddToFunc ExitFunction  I  GotoPage 0 0
<br />
<br />It doesn't help on the Restart fvwm menu entry. Also, I just killed
<br />
fvwm using the &quot;X&quot; in the upper right corner of teh cygwin/xfree86 border
<br />
and restarted it and it didn't help there either.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that fvwm's selection of the current 
<br />
viewport is random.
<br />
<br />I notice a section 
<br />
<br />AddToFunc &quot;StartFunction&quot; I Module FvwmButtons
<br />
I Module FvwmPager 0 0 
<br />
<br />What do you think about trying to add it there?
<br />
<br />I also tried putting this in startxwin.sh
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fvwm2 Restart --dont-preserve-state &amp;
<br />
<br />It had no affect as it made the fvwm2 command
<br />
unintelligible, and I added it as the last line in the .fvwm2rc
<br />
file also without any change in behavior.
<br />
<br />*Restart --dont-preserve-state
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help with the terminology. I think I had the
<br />
term desktop but wasn't confident you used Current Viewport
<br />
consistently.
<br />
<br />THE REAL PROBLEM - isn't there always one under the presenting
<br />
problem - is that while in telnet probably after hitting a combination
<br />
of keystrokes I can't reconstruct THE WINDOW MANAGER WILL CONVERT
<br />
ALL MY KEYBOARD ENTRY TO UPPER CASE. This means that if I am
<br />
editing a file in vi, I can't quit the file because vi won't
<br />
accept :WQ.
<br />
<br />The cure for this is to click on &quot;Restart Fvwm&quot; in the desktop
<br />
menu and then it will go back to lower case - which is why I 
<br />
think this is a bug in fvwm.
<br />
<br />The presenting problem is my concern that if the help desk gets
<br />
a call for all caps, and then they tell the user to restart the
<br />
fvwm, that the user will go nuts because they will think they
<br />
have lost all their work when in fact only the current 
<br />
viewport will have changed.
<br />
<br />I really appreciate your time and effort: fvwm is a good
<br />
product and has a lot of excellent virtues. I think if 
<br />
these couple of items could be cured, it might gain a much
<br />
wider audience.
<br />
<br />Also, there is one other point. I have ported some sun xwindows
<br />
motif programs to XFree86 and lesstif. I am now running on a
<br />
pc with its display set to 1162 x 864  rather than the default
<br />
640x480.
<br />
<br />This way every pc program comes up slightly smaller but 
<br />
unfortunately all the motif programs come up full size.
<br />
<br />I think it would be wonderful if I could tell fvwm to 
<br />
scale all the motif or lesstif pixels to a different size or if fvwm
<br />
could just read this off the current pcwindows setting.
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Just to point out the terminology:

<br />
<br />The whole work area is called a &quot;Desktop&quot;, and is divided into
<br />
&quot;Pages&quot; (3x3 in your case).  The visible portion of the desktop is
<br />
called &quot;Current Viewport&quot;.  This usually - but not necessarily -
<br />
matches one of the pages.
