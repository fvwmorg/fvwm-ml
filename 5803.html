<br />
After start up, the mouse pointer is always resting over an xterm in my set
<br />
up. Often, but not always, this xterm does not have the focus and I have to
<br />
move the pointer out of it and back in again. This also happens every time
<br />
after a restart when the mouse pointer is resting over a window. In 2.2 and
<br />
previous, the window under the mouse would always get the focus in both these
<br />
situations. I have tried this with sloppy and follow-mouse focus, on 2.4.6,
<br />
2.4.8 and 2.5.2.
<br />
<br />Maybe the last window created (e.g. Pager or buttons) gets the focus instead
<br />
of the one under the mouse after the restart has finished?
<br />
<br />A possible conection: if I PipeRead from FvwmTalk something which destroys and
<br />
creates windows (e.g. Pager, Buttons) then after the PipeRead in 2.2 FvwmTalk
<br />
still has the focus with sloppy and follows policy, whereas is loses it with
<br />
click focus (as you would expect). However, in 2.4 and 2.5 FvwmTalk has lost
<br />
the focus regardless of policy. (Of course, FvwmTalk has changed so this could
<br />
be a red herring).
<br />
<br />Or, if I select a menu item, which does a PipeRead that causes a new window to
<br />
be started (e.g. xbiff), the new window ends up with the focus even though the
<br />
mouse is left where it was when it selected the (sub-sub) menu, say now over
<br />
an xterm. In 2.2 the xterm would now get the focus (this is with follow
<br />
mouse/sloppy focus of course).
<br />
<br />I have some PipeReads which are executed via InitFunction and RestartFunction.
<br />
So, if PipeRead has changed its behaviour in this way, then that could be the
<br />
real cause of the start up / restart non-focus problem.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: has something like a ``recheck focus policy and current mouse
<br />
position'' operation gone AWOL from the end of a PipeRead? :-) Perhaps
<br />
deliberately changed then -- is that really the best functionality? I would
<br />
suggest a good principle: with follows mouse/sloppy focus, if the mouse is
<br />
over a window that can take focus then that window has the focus -- at least
<br />
by the time Fvwm becomes `quiescent' again.
<br />
<br />Best wishes, John Latham
