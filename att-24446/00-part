Hi there,

We haven't spoken in some time, but I wanted you to know 
about an opportunity that might perhaps make sense to you, 
or maybe even someone in your sphere of influence.

A very major financial institution is looking for the best 
of the best to join their Unix Server Admin staff.

Check this out;  375 servers and looking to grow.  If you 
are currently a heavy UNIX person (or know one) who has:

* 5+ years of experience

* One or more of the following:  DEC, HP, AIX, SUN

* Prefers Business Casual dress, Great Benefits

* Would consider a full relocation package to a very sunny 
state not too far from sandy beaches on a major ocean

Get back to me (email) to discuss the details of this 
project, and let me know what your career direction is.

(we are looking for 12 people, and the $$money is top 
shelf)

Ping me back and please include an up-to-date resume file 
(MSWord). If this opportunity isn't exactly on the mark 
for you, include in your note a description of your 
current career objectives, availability and an update of 
your salary requirements...

Talk to you soon,

Bill Thomas
CSAM

Not Interested?  Forward this to a friend or colleague.  
Perhaps they'll do the same for you someday...

PS: These positions are in the US, and unfortunately we 
are not able to sponsor those not authorized to work in 
the United States
