<br />
Phew, so much traffic, so much misinformation, so much real work to
<br />
do, so many hunger pangs.  Well, I'll just dig in and try to remain
<br />
calm... :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; A reasonable thing to do, but only if you ask the tens of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; millions of Windows and Mac users and billions of non computer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; users to vote too.
<br />
<br />Ah, but do Mac and Windows users have a choice?  You can't even ask
<br />
such a question if they don't.  Here's one, of all the Windows users
<br />
that have tried Xmouse, how many like it and how many don't?  It's
<br />
still probably a useless point to argue, unless you really don't care
<br />
about selling product to pointer-focus users.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Actually, early research at Apple clearly showed that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; opposite was more likely to be a problem, usually because a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; dialog opened.  For example, the naive user's first reaction
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; when a file selection dialog opens should be to attempt to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; type in a file name.  This only works if the dialog gets the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; focus when it's opened.
<br />
<br />I agree so far.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Unless you want to head down the slippery slope of pointer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; warping, this means explicit focus.
<br />
<br />Here's where I disagree (details to follow).  And I think this
<br />
assertion is the crux of the current flamewar.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Your confusion was undoubtedly due to the situation where
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; you've got multiple xterm windows open, since the opposite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; problem occurs when you've got a modern GUI application (and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; by that I mean one that uses dialogs and palettes).
<br />
<br />This is a red herring.  Let's instead talk about multiple disjoint
<br />
applications, by which I mean separate processes in the Unix sense
<br />
each with their own window, and a single process that can display
<br />
multiple windows.  So now we have two situations:
<br />
<br />- Switching focus between processes requires the help of the window
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;manager.  You can't solve this problem by advocating either focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;model without focus grabs, pointer warpage, complex IPC's or other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nasty things.  I don't really see how explicit focus could make
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;anybody's life easier (or harder) in this situation.
<br />
<br />- Switching focus between windows in a single, multi-window process.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done under X with pointer-focus policy and no pointer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;warpage or focus grabs.  I have two existance proofs: 1. In XEmacs,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can by way of keystrokes, create a bunch of new top-level window
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. ones whose parent is the FVWM root window).  By another couple
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of keystrokes I can switch focus back and forth between any of these
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;windows.  2. In Grail, I can by way of keystrokes, pop up the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookmarks dialog.  By another few keystrokes I can traverse around
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the bookmarks tree, opening and closing nodes, even triggering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grail to visit a URL.  I can popup further top-level windows which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;allow me to change bookmark entries via a little form dialog.  When
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hit return in the form dialog, my edits are applied and focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;returns to the bookmark dialog.  I hit return again, my bookmarks
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;get saved, the dialog gets withdrawn, and focus returns to my main
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;browser window.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NEITHER CASE IS THE POINTER WARPING ONE MILLIMETER!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; It's still amazing to me that people who work primarily with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; the &quot;stone age&quot; version of GUI technology (xterms) have the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; nerve to stand up and say that pointer focus is superior and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; should be the default.
<br />
<br />Oh, please.  Come on, admit it, you're trolling!  I'm going to ignore
<br />
those snide remarks from now on.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Well, in *true* pointer focus there is no keyboard traversal
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; at all, you have to move the mouse into each field in turn to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; fill out a form. I don't see too many people advocating we go
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; back to *that*.  Its about time we take the next step, or at
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; least reduce the incidence of corruption of new users by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; making the default explicit focus.
<br />
<br />How do you go from your &quot;*true* pointer focus&quot; to default explicit
<br />
focus?  You're completely ignoring the model where pointer location
<br />
designates the application that receives keyboard events, and the
<br />
application is free to redirect window focus to any top level window
<br />
under its control.  This is what XEmacs does.  This is inherent in Tk,
<br />
and thus Grail gets it for free (I take no claim for doing anything
<br />
more than reading the manpage and playing with some Python code to
<br />
understand what's possible :-).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; No, you click on a button (or choose from a menu, or activate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; a menu item with a mnemonic or accelerator) and it opens a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; dialog that gets the focus.  You then type whatever you want
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; and then close it by pressing return, upon which the dialog
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; closes and focus returns to the application window that had it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; before.
<br />
<br />Sounds cool to me.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; This is the most standard operating method of modern GUI
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; applications, and it just doesn't work very well with pointer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; focus.
<br />
<br />I must really be misunderstanding you, because I have no problem with
<br />
this in properly written applications using pointer focus.  I really
<br />
would like more detail on exactly what you think is the problem.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; and even as separate top level windows pop up and down
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; (e.g. to interact with the Bookmarks, History, or File
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; dialogs), focus is managed correctly to the subwindows without
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; ever having to move the mouse (as long as its one of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; application's top level windows), even with pointer-focus.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; How, by warping the mouse?
<br />
<br />Nope.  Tk has a number of focus management commands and it imposes its
<br />
own rational focus management policy on the toolkit.  I won't
<br />
reproduce the entire Tk focus.n manpage here, since its free software
<br />
and you can get it and read it yourself.  Suffice to say that if I
<br />
have a window `.w' I can redirect focus to it with `focus .w' (well I
<br />
think I've accurately translated the Python equivalent into Tcl :-).
<br />
In Python, if `frame' is a Tkinter.Toplevel instance, then
<br />
frame.focus_set() redirects focus into the window.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; XEmacs is a pretty poor example of good UI design IMHO.  It's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; very efficient to work with (we use it here), but if you tried
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; to sell it to a Mac or Windows user they'd laugh you right out
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; of town.
<br />
<br />First, we're not talking about overall UI design, and besides I think
<br />
XEmacs is well designed given what the application is.  It (more so
<br />
than FSF's Emacs IMHO) is one of the few applications that works
<br />
pretty well for novices but adapts to users as they gain their power
<br />
through experience.  And second, it sure is funny how many Mac and
<br />
Windows users I've heard, who need a such a powerful integrated
<br />
programming environment ask for Emacs on their platforms.  Oh well,
<br />
that's all tangential to the discussion at hand.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; Nope, its just that not all applications manage active focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; correctly.  Its one of the main reasons why I can't stand
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; Netscape on I hit Meta-O and the dialog that pops up doesn't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; get focus.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; I see, let's take the only decent UI that the vast majority of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; X users have ever used and ruin it because it doesn't work
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; well with the environment that works well with xterm windows.
<br />
<br />Netscape or MSIE are probably the applications that most inexperienced
<br />
computer users are familar with.  I might argue about their decency,
<br />
but the specific problem I describe above is not inherent in the focus
<br />
policy.  It's either present because the toolkit they use is buggy, or
<br />
the application doesn't manage focus properly, or it was an explicit
<br />
design decision not to support this, or they just haven't gotten
<br />
around to ironing out its use for power users (or all their internal
<br />
power users really use Grail instead, but won't tell anybody :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Your argument goes *exactly* to my point: users new to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; computers are much more likely to use Netscape than they are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; to use xterms.  Fvwm should come with the defaults set to take
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; this into consideration.
<br />
<br />Fvwm has nothing to do with it.  If, when the Open Location dialog was
<br />
popped up, Netscape redirected its application's focus to that window,
<br />
the problem would be solved.  It *can* be done with pointer-focus
<br />
policy, no pointer warping, no server grabs, and no need to pop the
<br />
window up under the cursor.  Your application, or toolkit, just has to
<br />
provide the right kind of focus management policy.  Maybe that's hard,
<br />
but that's an engineering problem, not made impossible by the design
<br />
of pointer-focus policy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; It was nearly trivial for me to add this to Grail, *and* to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; move focus back to the original window when finished
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&gt; interacting with the dialog.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; How?
<br />
<br />See the explanation above.  Read the Tk manpages.  Read the Tk source
<br />
or the XEmacs focus management source.  I encourage you to download
<br />
Python, install and Tk and play with it, and see for yourself.  As I
<br />
say, I'm not an Xpert so I can't tell you what's happening under the
<br />
hood.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; So you're saying that application vendors have no right to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; expect any sort of standardization of desktop environments?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Hope you like hand building all your applications...
<br />
<br />So are you saying users have no right to customize their desktops to
<br />
increase their productivity?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">    &gt; This is commonly done using an application-modal keyboard grab
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">    &gt; so that you don't have to move the pointer to type in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">    &gt; window.  It can also be done via warping the mouse or popping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">    &gt; the dialog box up underneath the pointer.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Neither of these are practical, the first because warping the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; pointer violates all GUI style guides (other than the finally
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; obsolete OpenLook), and the second because it could result in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; the window opening partially off screen.
<br />
<br />Agreed on both points.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; I wasn't trashing his app, in fact it sounds very well
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; implemented. But I found it strange for him to be citing an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; app as an example of how things should be done when it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; obviously took considerable effort to make it work like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Windows and OS/2 and Motif applications are *required* to, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; have been for years.  If he didn't have to spend so much time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; fighting with pointer focus, he could have implemented some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; really cool new features instead.
<br />
<br />Funny.  All I had to do was read the Tk manpages. :-)  Ousterhout did
<br />
the fighting for me.  Which is great because I (and the rest of the
<br />
Grail team) could implement lots of really cool new features.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; And I certainly wouldn't claim that Netscape is perfect, but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; it *is* Motif compliant which can't be said for xterm or most
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; other apps (including most Tk apps) that X users end up using.
<br />
<br />All I can say here is that if the Motif toolkit doesn't allow you to
<br />
manage focus as flexibly and rationally as the Tk toolkit does, then
<br />
either the Motif toolkit implementation is buggy, or the Motif
<br />
specification is broken.  I suspect neither is the case, but I have
<br />
never written a Motif-toolkit based application so I wouldn't know.
<br />
It certainly isn't an inherent property of X, or other X-compatible
<br />
toolkits.
<br />
<br />Not to say Tk is perfect, but at least for focus management it
<br />
provides exactly the abstration you need.
<br />
<br />Time to go home.  I'm hungry. :-)
