<br />
<br />My  name is Tony Hedrick, and my company is called A+ActionLeads.  I
<br />
would appreciate the chance of doing business with your company.  I can
<br />
provide you great mortgage leads. I can provide email blasts , direct
<br />
mail  , bankruptcy  , debt , and tons of other information. My service
<br />
will be great and personable.  I will value and need great clients like
<br />
you.     Below  are some of the leads that I provide ,  and the price.
<br />
All states are avail. and more qty the better the price.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;***SPECIAL*** : 7th Day Exclusive: This lead is sold to Ameriquest  and
<br />
another company as a exclusive . After the 7th day it is up for
<br />
grabs..They are cost effective and great for training and keeping your
<br />
LOS  busy all of the time. The quanties and states you want will affect
<br />
your pricing.
<br />
&nbsp;It's better price wise ,if you can go multiple states..  We can set
<br />
perimeters .   I will even let you directly to my  rep at the marketing
<br />
company that I use  and he will handle the contract/guarantees/ and I
<br />
will get a commission from him.  A couple of very large Mortgage
<br />
Company's are currently using these leads with their staff of 100 plus
<br />
L/O's and happy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$7 and can go down as low as $4 per lead.
<br />
****Special***14-60 Day Exclusives      Same as above, except the leads
<br />
are older . Very good to close deals because a lot of L/O's have stopped
<br />
calling the borrower by now and is ripe for the taking.  And at this
<br />
price its a steal...Depending on states and perimeters and quantity
<br />
.This lead starts out at the nice cheap price of ..
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3.00 and can easily go down to $1.00 per lead
<br />
Internet Leads  :  $20-$16  semi  exclusive  -Like the ones above except
<br />
sold twice as exclusives  and then to you only, that same day.
<br />
Internet leads :    $45-$35 exclusive   ****Not sold to anyone else and
<br />
thats a promise..
<br />
Fresh Internet Leads
<br />
Contain 24 fields of data and are guaranteed to have been initiated by
<br />
the interested consumer within the last 24 hours! Semi-Exclusive sales
<br />
maximum 3 mortgage clients per lead. Also sold exclusively. Minimum
<br />
order 50 leads.
<br />
Double Verified Leads
<br />
Produced by interested consumer&#x2019;s initiating contact, we verify these
<br />
leads via phone, then have our in house quality control team re-verify
<br />
the leads. Exclusive or Semi-Exclusive, either way you won&#x2019;t find a
<br />
better traditional mortgage lead.
<br />
Single Verified Leads
<br />
These leads are the same high quality leads as the double verified
<br />
leads, but they are sent to you right after being generated in an effort
<br />
to save you money on your marketing efforts.
<br />
****  NEW  ***** NEW *** $36.00each Exclusive Voice Broadcast Leads &#x2013;
<br />
Pay internet lead prices for INBOUND Live Transfer Leads! For only
<br />
$36/call, our new system puts your loan officers in direct contact with
<br />
live borrowers! New automated Voice Broadcast technology allows our
<br />
company to bring this revolutionary process to you for a fraction of
<br />
what other companies are charging for Live Transfer&#x2019;s.
<br />
In addition, all calls are recorded for your records. You will have
<br />
access to your &quot;Call Library.&quot; Increase closing ratio&#x2019;s by listening to
<br />
the recordings and improving your staff&#x2019;s sales skills.
<br />
Filter who the calls are made to by State, Loan Amount, Current Interest
<br />
Rate, LTV, and Prospect Credit Rating. For example: If you want calls
<br />
from borrower&#x2019;s in your state, with loan amount&#x2019;s above 150k, interest
<br />
rate above 7%, LTV below 80%, with Excellent Credit, you can have only
<br />
those borrowers calling your loan officers.
<br />
Have inbound calls during business hours only, and transfer calls to
<br />
cell phones if you want! All Voice Broadcast Transfers are 100%
<br />
Exclusive. Contact me at the number below for more detailed information!
<br />
<br />With good L/O's there getting more than 40% apps.
<br />
<br />We're  now able to automatically generate inbound phone calls to your
<br />
loan officers. Consumers calling your office will be pre-filtered to
<br />
your exact specifications. You will have an excellent idea of who will
<br />
be calling before they call.
<br />
<br />Using newly developed technology, our Voice Broadcast lead generation
<br />
program utilizes our vast 25 million record database. Once your list has
<br />
been checked against the national &#x201c;Do Not Call&#x201d; list, we record an
<br />
automated message for your company.
<br />
<br />After your approval, we broadcast this message for you during hours you
<br />
choose. If the consumer is interested, they press one and are
<br />
immediately connected to your loan officer. By pressing two, they are
<br />
removed from our lists.
<br />
<br />All calls are recorded and stored for you in an accessible &#x201c;Call
<br />
Library.&#x201d; We encourage the continued use of this one of a kind training
<br />
tool. Loan officers with useful resources at their finger tips close
<br />
more loans. It&#x2019;s time for you to have a reliable connection to consumers
<br />
that NEED your services.
