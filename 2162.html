<a href="http://fvwm.themes.org">http://fvwm.themes.org</a> progress report 25th Feb 2001
<br />
Project Leader - Alex Wallis &lt;awol_at_dove.net.au&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />Progress is slow at this stage as VA Linux are still waiting on the
<br />
finalisation of their upgrading. Certain key personel are either
<br />
unavailable or too busy to speed up the process. However all should be
<br />
operational by April.
<br />
<br />In the meantime the temporary site will have to do, but can still be
<br />
easily modified before then.
<br />
<br />The new site will look much the same as the other window managers, but
<br />
we all want it to look better than the others don't we?!  ;)
<br />
So if anybody wishes to contribute please feel free to email me asap!
<br />
Graphics skills especially are in short supply.
<br />
<br />At recent themes.org meetings on irc.linux.com #themes.org it has been
<br />
suggested to post interviews with the fvwm developers. I would like to
<br />
begin with an interview with either Mikhael or Olivier (or both),
<br />
explaining the history and philosophy behind fvwm-themes and the
<br />
directions they hope it will take. The interview can be by pre-arranged
<br />
irc session or via email. (Olivier, I have an ircbot that speaks very
<br />
bad francaise ;-P )
<br />
Other readers however may be more interested in something or someone
<br />
else, so I ask for suggestions and or volunteers. I for one would like
<br />
to learn more about Sir Boris II's feline ancestry.
<br />
Subject to approval from those concerned, if anyone has a question or
<br />
two they would like to ask, please submit them to me so they can be
<br />
included. The eventual series of interviews(?) will be posted as
<br />
themes.org special feature articles perhaps even before the new site is
<br />
operational. Details to come later.
<br />
<br />I also would like to include material from other themes projects than
<br />
just fvwm-themes alone. I feel this is necessary/advisable because of
<br />
the larger numbers of fvwm users than the much smaller number of
<br />
fvwm-themes users. However some polls might be required to more
<br />
accurately reflect the percentages of either category. Contributions,
<br />
comments and/or suggestions on this approach also appreciated.
<br />
<br />Other material required for the fvwm.themes.org site are some new themes
<br />
and screenshots. Please feel free to mail your favourite new theme or
<br />
screenshot to fvwm_at_themes.org, however all such submissions are subject
<br />
to approval of course.
<br />
<br />At this point I would like to comment on a previous correspondance.....

<br />IMHO
<br />
The whole concept of desktop theming implies the user is willing to
<br />
download as many packages as required to achieve the appearance and
<br />
versatility that brings the desired result. In comparison to installing
<br />
elightenment on a stock standard unix system, fvwm-themes is a breeze
<br />
and far less dependent on other packages.
<br />
KDE even takes this comparison much further in their suite of apps. I do
<br />
not think requiring wm-icons is excessive and may actually help in
<br />
developing that project also. Eventually it is conceivable that a great
<br />
many individual themes for fvwm will become available, so having to
<br />
download &quot;extras&quot; should be seen as no big deal. (Comments anyone?)
<br />
<br />Which brings me to my next point....
<br />
I applaud Mikhael and Olivier on the sophistication of the theme engine
<br />
and the very high standard quality work they do. However all their
<br />
efforts and hard work are in vain if people simply choose not to use
<br />
fvwm-themes.
<br />
Currently, the development of fvwm-themes progresses swiftly, through
<br />
the customary tools like cvs, so occasional package releases with latest
<br />
bugfixes and new features are mandatory just like they are for fvwm.
<br />
Such releases should also be announced on freshmeat as that is what
<br />
freshmeat's intended purpose is! If people see an active development
<br />
project frequently on the newletter list they can have more confidence
<br />
in getting support when using that software. So regular incremental
<br />
announcements on freshmeat will only increase and enhance the interest
<br />
of users as new features are added and announced.
<br />
<br />However, many fvwm users will tell you they use fvwm because it's
<br />
simple, yet powerful. It has built-in sensible defaults so that minimal
<br />
configuration is required. I would estimate a large percentage of fvwm
<br />
users have .fvwm2rc configuration files of less than 100 lines. And it
<br />
is the fear of complexity that prevents many from even taking
<br />
fvwm-themes for a test drive.
<br />
<br />At present fvwm-themes as a package contains only 12 themes with the
<br />
flexibility to provide hundreds of possible combinations. But I as
<br />
project leader of fvwm.themes.org have to devise a way of not only
<br />
publicising fvwm-themes as a viable transportable theme package for
<br />
fvwm, but also to stimulate the interest of users who would otherwise
<br />
choose to avoid such a lavish extravagance of precious computer
<br />
resources.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, it is also hoped that eventually a great many new
<br />
themes can be added or uninstalled at will, so that users can choose
<br />
what they like. But the level of complexity within each theme's
<br />
configuration files allow for an enormous amount of variation of
<br />
components within the theme design. It can be easily demonstrated a
<br />
simple syntax error in just one branch of the package can waste a lot of
<br />
valuable time. Just designing or even copying any given theme can be a
<br />
daunting task for many users. It therefore is simply not viable for a
<br />
very small team of core developers to maintain anything else but a small
<br />
group of original designs. New themes must therefore be added by users
<br />
themselves, and most likely would only contain the most elementary
<br />
components like background or sound effects. This most likely is
<br />
detrimental to stimulating fvwm-themes popularity as a viable
<br />
alternative configuration tool of choice.
<br />
<br />I suggest that fvwm-themes could evolve into something much more than a
<br />
simple theme engine. It could become a core project of a great many
<br />
complete desktop designs all available by cvs or package release. New
<br />
branches to the cvs tree can be added for new themes. Each theme
<br />
designer can thus become responsible for his branch of the tree with of
<br />
course generous assistance from other mailing list members. Thus more
<br />
and more themes can not only be added to the project, but also allowed
<br />
to evolve and grow and to take advantage of new features within fvwm
<br />
itself as they become implemented.
<br />
<br />What is necessary for this to happen? Well first of all a way to
<br />
separate the themes from the main engine. As previously stated the core
<br />
developer's simply cannot be expected to maintain support for every
<br />
theme designed by home users. A possible solution to this is by using 2
<br />
cvs sources trees. One for the core developer's themselves currently
<br />
housed at sourceforge.net, and another for users to experiment with
<br />
their own theme designs. The second tree can contain the core and be
<br />
regularly updated, but also extra themes that users themselves create as
<br />
separate branches of the themes repository.
<br />
<br />VA Linux which hosts both themes.org and sourceforge.net allocates
<br />
resources for cvs repositories of certain projects, and I believe that
<br />
this idea would be acceptable within the site guidelines. Which brings
<br />
me to another suggestion at a staff_at_themes.org meeting of meta-themes,
<br />
which simply put is the co-ordination of all desktop elements like gnome
<br />
and gtk themes and xmms skins etc... with the window manager theme
<br />
design, as the corresponding resources to integrate all these elements
<br />
would be housed in one site with access for theme creators to assistance
<br />
from other application designers.
<br />
<br />To assist the user in updating their fvwm-themes code as changes and
<br />
bugfixes are announced, a simple perl script could be constructed to
<br />
access key parameters via input or file. The script could then use those
<br />
parameters to update the local cvs source tree from the themes.org
<br />
fvwm-themes cvs repository, and recompile and install if necessary,
<br />
requiring only a message window to notify the user to restart the window
<br />
manager when convenient. This perl script could be highly modifiable and
<br />
allow updating of certain theme branches as specified or all. In this
<br />
manner much of the fear of working with cutting edge software
<br />
technologies can be greatly alleviated. A simple menu click or button
<br />
push may be all that is required to run or work with the most current
<br />
versions of fvwm and fvwm-themes with the additional benefit of only
<br />
installing/upgrading the themes or metathemes that one is interested in.
<br />
<br />The widest possible methods of installation are then readily available,
<br />
and the whole user end installation is easy to maintain and upgrade.
<br />
The difficulties that I see, are mostly in the cvs management but of
<br />
course the entire conceptual designs for the project, at this stage, are
<br />
merely the above ideas.
<br />
<br />I am left wondering how many readers would be willing to participate in
<br />
such a project?
