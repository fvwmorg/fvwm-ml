</em><br />
<br />ch&gt; Also, I'm contemplating pulling out a lot of the icons into a separate
<br />
ch&gt; tar file, and leaving just some &quot;essential&quot; ones (which would be the
<br />
ch&gt; only ones that the sample rc file would use).  I might do the same
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think that it's worth the effort.  A zipped tar file of 600
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; kB is not very large nowadays.  Many other freeware packages suffer
</em><br />
<br />eli&gt;    This brings up several points I wanted to discuss. First of all,
<br />
eli&gt; the icons subdirectory is a real mish-mash of pixmaps. k.xpm and k2.xpm
<br />
eli&gt; are two PICTURES of somebody's kid. Not exactly useful as icons.
<br />
<br />Those are pictures of Rob Nation's child.  One (k2) used to be used
<br />
for FvwmBanner.  They are not useful as icons, no, but I haven't had
<br />
the heart to remove them.  Perhaps now is the time.
<br />
<br />eli&gt; Also, there are a number of duplicate icons (rbomb, bomb; rterm,
<br />
eli&gt; xterm) and xpms that I don't think should be in there
<br />
eli&gt; (doom*,xboing,xjewel,etc).
<br />
<br />The dups should probably be cleaned up, yes, and some of those others
<br />
removed.  I've been thinking about doing this for some time, just
<br />
haven't bothered yet.
<br />
<br />eli&gt;    I'm in the midst of integrating all of the semi-useful icons from
<br />
eli&gt; the fvwm distribution with my own collection, which is currently broken up
<br />
eli&gt; into 5 directories: mini, small, medium, large, and misc. mini has all the
<br />
eli&gt; 14x14 xpms, small has the 32x32s, medium has 48x48, and large has 64x64.
<br />
eli&gt; misc gets all of the leftovers, mostly 32x48 (?!).
<br />
eli&gt;    Does anyone want to argue for saving the 16x16 xpms? My thought
<br />
eli&gt; is that 14x14 works for menus and buttons, 32x32 works in FvwmButtons,
<br />
eli&gt; and the larger xpms are suitable for icons.
<br />
<br />The 16x16 might also be useful as titlebar buttons, depending on the
<br />
size of the font you use in the titlebar.
<br />
<br />eli&gt;    Chuck -- if I do this, do you want to replace the current icons
<br />
eli&gt; directory with it? It looks as though the result will still be smaller
<br />
eli&gt; than the existing icons distribution.
<br />
<br />I would certainly like to see the result and I might perhaps replace
<br />
the current icons directory with it, yes.
<br />
<br />eli&gt;    Also, I took a look at the mini.* pixmaps last night. README.mini
<br />
eli&gt; says they use a total of 14 colors. This is no longer the case, but it
<br />
eli&gt; could easily be.
<br />
<br />The README.mini is from the initial mini xpms contributed, which some
<br />
others have been contributed since then by other people.
<br />
<br />eli&gt; I looked through them all, and there are 10 common colors: blue,
<br />
eli&gt; cyan, magenta, red, orange, yellow, green, black, gray, and white
<br />
eli&gt; and 17 uncommon colors. I can EASILY fix the files to use the
<br />
eli&gt; same set of colors, but I'd like to add a FEW more to the set of
<br />
eli&gt; 10 common colors.  What I need to know is how many.
<br />
eli&gt;    Is 14 colors good? Should that INCLUDE black and white? Do people
<br />
eli&gt; care what I do? :-) I definatly want to add 2 more shades of
<br />
eli&gt; gray, but I haven't decided which. I'd also like gold (between
<br />
eli&gt; yellow and orange), a darker green, a better shade of red, and
<br />
eli&gt; another blue.
<br />
eli&gt;    Adding those brings the total color set to 16, 14 w/o black &amp; white.
<br />
eli&gt; I think this would bring the mini pixmaps back into line with the
<br />
eli&gt; original intention of a unified colorset. And, at least 11 of the
<br />
eli&gt; colors (maybe more) match colors mentioned in colormap.xpm
<br />
<br />I've been meaning to reduce the colors of all the xpms to a limited
<br />
amount.  I was thinking that 32 might not be bad.  It's not too large
<br />
a number, but should be able to contain enough of the standard colors
<br />
to enable the xpms to still look good.
<br />
<br />I have two programs contributed by list members to reduce the number
<br />
of colors, and have had discussions of this type before.  An idea for
<br />
a reduced colormap is in the file utils/xpm-reduced-rgb.txt,
<br />
contributed by Dan Espen.  His xpm color reduce program is in there as
<br />
well.  I know he spoke with Romano Giannetti who wrote another color
<br />
reduction program 'pixy' which I have here.  I meant to put it (or at
<br />
least a reference to it) in the last release, but forgot.  I believe
<br />
it can be found at:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy3.2.tar.gz">ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy3.2.tar.gz</a>
<br />
<br />He includes some sample colormaps as well in his distribution,
<br />
both 16 and 32 colors.  I imagine that they'll be pretty close to what
<br />
would be good...
<br />
<br />So, I was going to get to this eventually, but if you're feeling
<br />
ambitious, go ahead.
<br />
<br />eli&gt;    And finally, I plan to clean up some of the uglier pictures in
<br />
eli&gt; an effort to make them look nicer.
<br />
<br />This might be subjective, but lets see what you come up with.
<br />
<br />eli&gt; Originally, I thought that pixmaps in menus and buttons would be
<br />
eli&gt; silly, but they have the potential to look really good, if the
<br />
eli&gt; pixmaps themselves look good.
<br />
eli&gt;    I guess that what I want to know is whether there is any sort of
<br />
eli&gt; legacy associated with the pixmaps in the icons directory that says they
<br />
eli&gt; shouldn't change?
<br />
<br />The only thing I would like is for them to use actual named colors
<br />
instead of #rrggbb type specifications.
