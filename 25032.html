</em><br />
<br />I had a look at it Dan, and it's almost exactly how I've setup my config,
<br />
except all the functions relating to a decor I've grouped into separate files.
<br />
In fact I started out with one of Mr. gensch's earlier examples and progressed
<br />
from there. I just decided after my config grew over 2000 lines long that many
<br />
little files were easier to wade through than one BIG file. To start with I put
<br />
a symlink from ~/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my directory structure looks like this....
<br />
<br />~/.fvwm2rc                    # a symlink to ~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc
<br />
~/.fvwm2/.decor-rc        # a file to tell fvwm2 where to find each decor
<br />
~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc         # a file to set $PATH's and InitFunction's
<br />
~/.fvwm2/.module-rc      # a file to tell fvwm2 about the module configs
<br />
~/.fvwm2/.style-rc          # a file to set global styles (lots work needed)   
<br />
~/.fvwm2/backgrounds    # a folder to keep background pics
<br />
~/.fvwm2/decors             # a folder to keep my decor files tidy
<br />
~/.fvwm2/icons	            # I added this directory to IconPath or ImagePath
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# and keep my customised icons here.
<br />
~/.fvwm2/menus              # at the moment I keep separate menus for each   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#decor (needs work) in this folder
<br />
~/.fvwm2/modules           # here each module can have several configs to be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# loaded by the decors whenever called for.
<br />
&nbsp;~/.fvwm2/scripts             # a folder for FvwmScript files 
<br />
~/.fvwm2/sounds             # I put separate folders for each decor FvwmEvent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# sounds here and add them to rplay.conf
<br />
<br />Thus all of my decors, (currently only Win95,Mwm,AfterStep, a DrWho theme, and
<br />
my personal customised decor) are each in a separate file along the lines of the
<br />
cited above example. But each file is only 2 or 3k in size. I also have a
<br />
symlink to the &quot;default&quot; decor that fvwm2 starts/restarts with. And a menu to
<br />
select same. (yup.... needs more work) Each theme has it's own FvwmEvent
<br />
config, and each Event config is selectable via an FvwmForm module. Even
<br />
individual sounds/commands can be set/reset. There's many more features I've
<br />
added but probably too long a list to include here. If anyone wants to &quot;try
<br />
out&quot; a copy of my config, please email me off list. 
<br />
<br />Using this setup I'm able to read-in any part of the config via FvwmConsole or
<br />
Talk/CommandS whatever.... for testing etc.... I can also temporarily rm the
<br />
symlink ~/.fvwm2rc and point it at any .rc file I want. so I can try out other
<br />
configs. Using ModulePath allows symlinks to the modules as well as their
<br />
configs to be placed in the ~/.fvwm2/modules directory. As I add decors they
<br />
also need to be added into the .decor-rc and at the moment also the individual
<br />
menus. 
<br />
So to answer Fabien's question, &quot;what exactly is a theme?&quot;, in my setup
<br />
a theme is a decor that calls it's own set of modules, styles, configs, sounds
<br />
etc, and is easily switched to another without restarting fvwm. Even individual
<br />
windows can switch decors/themes. But it's a work very much in progress. Even if
<br />
it's only progressing slowly. 24 hrs is never enough in a day. I have a 'life'
<br />
too. (well almost)
<br />
<br />It's proven to be a very versatile arrangement, but requires a lot of minor
<br />
adjustments to many files, as features evolve and change with the current rapid
<br />
development Fvwm2 is going through. No doubt I'll need to make many more
<br />
changes by the time vers 2.4. comes out! C'est la unix.....Thus any proposed
<br />
theme needs qualification (as implied by Paul D.Smith), as to the version syntax
<br />
it complies with. A good time to pre-select standards if 2.4 is not far off.
<br />
<br />At the moment I'm trying to make my config into an easy-install package when I
<br />
can find enough time, but it will also need some extensive pruning and editing
<br />
as I've got a lot of experimental stuff that either nearly/almost/or_never_will
<br />
werks kind of stuff in there too. I'm also sure that M4 preprocessing could
<br />
reduce the bulkiness of my config and speedup loading if I can ever find the
<br />
time to learn how to do that as well. 
<br />
I still think that the &quot;default user&quot; (whoever that may be) will have enough
<br />
man pages to read, without needing an M4 instruction page to add to it.
<br />
Maybe others could suggest better ways to add all these features.
<br />
No doubt they will.....
<br />
<br />awol
<br />
<br />&quot;If all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail!&quot;
