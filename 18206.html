<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it was a bit strong, but we've been pointing out the inherent

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and insurmountable problems of using pointer focus with real GUI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applications (as opposed to xterms) for years now, and have sent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requests in to the fvwm developers before with no effect.  And the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is true: explicit focus is the de facto industry standard,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and although having a contrarian streak is a stereotypical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristic of Linux users (and probably of fvwm users on other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platforms), there are times when playing nice with the other children
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the right thing to do.
</em><br />
<br />Well coming from the standpoint of a person that *started* windows-type
<br />
GUI interface use on Win3.1 (*blech*) and was migrated to olwm, the very
<br />
first thing I did in my search to customize olwm to my liking was find out
<br />
what the whole mouse focus thing was.  I instantly fell in love with mouse
<br />
focus, and have used it ever since (ol(v)wm, fvwm, win95, NT4).  As for
<br />
'de facto' standards, they just *happened* to pick click-to-focus as the
<br />
default back in the beginning (posibly influenced by MS, or who knows what
<br />
else) and it's stuck like that.  But that's not the point.  Whether or not
<br />
fvwm has click-to-focus as default, any software that expects to compete
<br />
on the market should *gracefully* handle the possibilities.  Whether or
<br />
not these problems are 'insurmountable' there are ways of at least dealing
<br />
with them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not arguing against choice, only that the *default* setting should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be the one that will benefit the most users.  It just seems unfair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and unwise) to me that those who are least able to make the changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (new users) are the ones who are stuck with the task.  *You* know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to set up fvwm and will probably be changing the configuration anyway
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to suit your needs, so why not just make the default the one that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best for the X and UNIX community as a whole?
</em><br />
<br />What I'd like to know is:  what 'new user' is going to be installing their
<br />
own copy of fvwm?  It's up to the site system admin to determine what he
<br />
wants as default for all his users.  I don't even know what the defaults
<br />
are for any of my software as I read the documentation and decide then
<br />
what behaviour I want.  It's the job of the admin to make the environment
<br />
suit those people he's maintaining systems for, not necessarily the
<br />
software developers responsibility.  It'd be nice if they supply a decent
<br />
set of defaults, and in the realm of fvwm I see that being what the
<br />
majority of users wants (not 'de facto' standard) which just happens to be
<br />
mouse-focus from what I've heard.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The MetaCard installation instructions include details about how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change the focus model for mwm and olwm (which together account for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 98% of our installed base).  But these two both come configured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with explicit focus from the vendors, so there's no need to change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them in most cases.  And although you're correct that this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; site/distribution decision, I think you underestimate the importance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the recommendations (in the form of default settings) made by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developers of the individual packages.
</em><br />
<br />What if the user doesn't *want* the focus to be click-to-focus?  And as
<br />
for the recommendations, obviously those are for the developers of each
<br />
individual package to make.  Maybe fvwm suggests mouse-focus because all
<br />
the development people like it more?  So be it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even though you're not selling fvwm, it is certainly in all of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bests interest that the largest number of people find it easy to learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and easy to use (especially on most Linux systems, where fvwm is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default window manager).  Unless you care to dispute the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most people are familiar with explicit focus, or that explicit focus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is easier to learn for novices, the correct default setting seems clear.
</em><br />
<br />Whether or not the correct default setting is clear, you should be
<br />
allowing for the obvious fact that many people prefer mouse-focus, and
<br />
will continue doing so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I actually find it confusing, unless these Windows users are former
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; workstation users.  Windows is exactly the kind of environment that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was refering to that doesn't work very well with pointer focus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually the problems aren't as bad in Windows applications as they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are with X applications because Windows has floating palettes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stay on top even when they lose the focus, and because there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to do &quot;active focus&quot; applications in Windows (clicking in a window
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always activates that window in Windows).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's also confusing because pointer focus really only has advantages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you're dealing primarily with xterm-type windows (as I invariably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discover is the standard tool of pointer focus afficianados).  When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your rarely or never use them, pointer focus is just a pain in the ass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you're constantly having to move the mouse before you can type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in dialogs and such.
</em><br />
<br />Whether or not pointer(mouse)-focus is confusing is up to the individual
<br />
user.  I can't stand click-focus, it's bothersome.  Instead of moving my
<br />
mouse to within a windows constraints, I get to move it to any of the
<br />
handles (which I make miniscule as they get in my way) and with sheer luck
<br />
click on the handle to bring it to focus.  As you may have noticed,
<br />
pointer focus has it's main advantage with xterm (or single window input)
<br />
applications.  These are the realm of the developer.  Editors (whether
<br />
true X-editors or vi in an xterm) are my mainstay.  WordPerfect,
<br />
FrameMaker, and vi in an xterm.  So face it - fvwm started as a developers
<br />
choice, so obviously it's going to have remnants of that past even as it
<br />
becomes a favorite in mainstream useage.
<br />
<br />As for having to move to the dialog box to type things in, I rather
<br />
appreciated the method olwm used.  If you explicitly activated the dialog,
<br />
warp the pointer and grab focus.  If not, map the window and don't grab
<br />
focus or warp the pointer.  The real beauty would be warping the pointer
<br />
to a dialog box, and then unwarping it back to its original position.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is really putting the cart before the horse: you buy a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to run applications, not a window manager.  If your applications work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with other window managers but not fvwm, it's fvwm that's broken, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the applications.  We'd like to support Linux as best we can, and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support choice in window managers on other workstations.  But to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this we need better compatibility between fvwm and either mwm or olwm.
</em><br />
<br />I buy my computer to run apps, and get fvwm to have a window manager I
<br />
like, (with mouse-focus).  If my app doesn't work with my window manager
<br />
the way *I* want my window manager to work, it's the app that's broken.
