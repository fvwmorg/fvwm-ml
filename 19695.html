<br />
<br />Version 0.2 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
<br />
CPAN servers over the next few days.
<br />
<br />Information, including downloading links, can be found at:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm">http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm</a>
<br />
<br />Please note that the download links may take a day or two for CPAN sites to
<br />
receive the package from PAUSE.
<br />
<br />This is the second alpha release. Not all planned features are in, not all
<br />
data packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
<br />
style and overall functionality are still subject to drastic change before
<br />
this moves into beta. Changes in this version are list below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the README file for 0.2:
</em><br />
<br />X11::Fvwm version 0.2 (alpha 2)
<br />
<br />WHAT IS IT?
<br />
<br />This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
<br />
only in Perl 5, but with the Tk extension as your GUI library!
<br />
<br />This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is very
<br />
highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk (which is
<br />
Tk400.202 as of this writing), also available from CPAN.
<br />
<br />WHAT DOES IT DO?
<br />
<br />Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
<br />
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
<br />
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
<br />
developing these modules.
<br />
<br />When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
<br />
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
<br />
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
<br />
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
<br />
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.
<br />
<br />PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS
<br />
<br />Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy_at_byz.org. I wouldn't
<br />
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
<br />
continued development :-).

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the Changes file for 0.2:
</em><br />
<br />* Changed the invocation of handlers to include a reference to the X11::Fvwm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;object as the first parameter. Otherwise, handlers have no access to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;object unless the object is global or the handler is created as a closure.
<br />
<br />* Removed the Tk references in Fvwm.pm, so that X11::Fvwm acts as a base
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;class for the API. Fvwm/Tk.pm (X11::Fvwm::Tk) now is a subclass of X11::Fvwm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the new() and eventLoop() methods overloaded. Also adds one new
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;instance variable and a method to access it by. This should simplify adding
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other GUI widget sets, such as Xforms.
<br />
<br />* Put in some simple default handlers in Fvwm/Defaults.pm (package
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;X11::Fvwm::Defaults), that can be used if they meet the developer's needs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, only M_ERROR seems to lend itself to such a default handling.
<br />
<br />* X11::Fvwm, X11::Fvwm::Tk, X11::Fvwm::Defaults and PerlTkWL are all -w and -T
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;clean.
<br />
<br />* Makefile.PL now handles the demos as *.PL files, which allows them to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;extracted by perl itself, which results in an invocation line based on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the user's configuration of perl.  Also checks for a usable version of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Tk extension.
<br />
