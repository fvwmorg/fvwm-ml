size=2>=================================================================================</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>Knowing the right people can often times prove quite 
beneficial in the world of business. We continually receive phone calls, emails, 
&amp; faxes from people we know on just about every new product &amp; company 
before it hits the public airwaves. Every so often, of the hundreds we see, ONE 
jumps out at you. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>Below is such an example. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>A NEW Worldwide Financial card (not Vivarebates) will be 
released in the coming weeks that has some very serious implications. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>There is nothing like it anywhere, AND 90% OF PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD NEED IT NOW! It is a universal card with unmatched services, no 
competition and massive demand. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>It is simple to market by anyone, anywhere on the planet 
and pays huge residual income like no other product can. Finally you can count 
on a product with the extreme ability to "lock in" millions of long-term, 
faithful customers, at high speed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>The financial platform it's built on was valued by a top 
ten &amp; leading international accounting firm (you'll see the name) at 
$25,000,000! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>Fact: Fourty million Americans are *unbankable* (can't 
get a checking account), and over 90% of people worldwide fall into this same 
category. This is only the tip of iceberg of what this card will do. The 
implications in the International market are unparalled. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=굴림 size=2>It was developed in collaboration with a merchant 
aggregating company, a former Senior Vice President of VISATM International and 
A WORLDWIDE, MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. With these names 
printed on the card, insuring all monies deposited into it, your customers will 
feel safe and you will feel the power and the credibility it offers. </FONT></P>
