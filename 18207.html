<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Perhaps it was a bit strong, but we've been pointing out the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; inherent and insurmountable problems of using pointer focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; with real GUI applications
<br />
<br />I've never seen such a list posted to this forum.  Why don't you post
<br />
your list of problems and let us debate them point by point?  I'd
<br />
especially like to know what it is about your application that doesn't
<br />
work with pointer-focus.  I really don't buy the argument that
<br />
pointer-focus is inherently flawed.  And what is your definition of a
<br />
`real GUI application'?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; And the statement is true: explicit focus is the de facto
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; industry standard
<br />
<br />Hmm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; *You* know how to set up fvwm and will probably be changing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; the configuration anyway to suit your needs, so why not just
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; make the default the one that's best for the X and UNIX
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; community as a whole?
<br />
<br />Double hmm.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; The MetaCard installation instructions include details about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; how to change the focus model for mwm and olwm (which together
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; account for about 98% of our installed base).
<br />
<br />Are you saying that if I wanted to use MetaCard I'd have to buy into
<br />
click-to-focus for my entire desktop?!  I have no idea what MetaCard
<br />
is or does, but not cooperating with pointer-focus would a huge
<br />
disincentive for me ever using a product -- especially if it were GUI
<br />
product!  (or at least I'd complain loudly and often on the bug list
<br />
:-) I'm sorry but that just seems very arrogant for an application to
<br />
force this global change on its users.  I certainly don't begrudge
<br />
those who like click-to-focus since its inherently a religious issue,
<br />
but remember, the key initial in GUI is `U'!  :-)
<br />
<br />But maybe I'm jumping to conclusions about the interoperability
<br />
problems of MetaCard and pointer-focus.  Please clarify!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Unless you care to dispute the fact that most people are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; familiar with explicit focus, or that explicit focus is easier
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; to learn for novices, the correct default setting seems clear.
<br />
<br />Do you have statistics.  I'd really like to know how many of users
<br />
that are aware of having a choice between the two models, actually do
<br />
prefer to use click-to-focus, as opposed to just having no idea they
<br />
had a choice and using whatever mwm or dtwm gives them as a default.
<br />
You might be right, but I'd still like to see the results of a study.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is encouraging, as I think it shows signs of independent thinking on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the part of Microsoft users (;^)
</em><br />
<br />Thank goodness I found Xmouse on Microsoft's web pages.  Win95
<br />
suddenly because moderately useful for me.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; I actually find it confusing, unless these Windows users are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; former workstation users.
<br />
<br />As I (unashamedly) admit I am.  And anyway, since I've begun using
<br />
Xmouse, I haven't had any problems with any of the Win95 applications
<br />
I use.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Windows is exactly the kind of environment that I was refering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; to that doesn't work very well with pointer focus. Actually
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; the problems aren't as bad in Windows applications as they are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; with X applications because Windows has floating palettes that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; stay on top even when they lose the focus, and because there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; is no way to do &quot;active focus&quot; applications in Windows
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; (clicking in a window always activates that window in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; Windows).
<br />
<br />Well, I'm still unconvinced that point-focus can't work just fine,
<br />
even for applications with lots of windows.  Take Grail
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://monty.cnri.reston.va.us/grail/">http://monty.cnri.reston.va.us/grail/</a>&gt;, a free web browser we've
<br />
written that's implemented in Python/Tk.  In the next release, you'll
<br />
be able to drive the thing almost entirely from the keyboard, and even
<br />
as separate top level windows pop up and down (e.g. to interact with
<br />
the Bookmarks, History, or File dialogs), focus is managed correctly
<br />
to the subwindows without ever having to move the mouse (as long as
<br />
its one of the application's top level windows), even with
<br />
pointer-focus.  Okay, I'm not an Xpert so maybe there's some inherent
<br />
design flaw in X I'm not aware of.  I've just never seen it as a real,
<br />
unsurmountable problem with all the apps I've used over the years.
<br />
Even XEmacs (although it has some bugs) handles focus management in
<br />
subordinate top-level windows that do not contain the pointer.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; It's also confusing because pointer focus really only has
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; advantages when you're dealing primarily with xterm-type
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; windows (as I invariably discover is the standard tool of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; pointer focus afficianados).  When your rarely or never use
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; them, pointer focus is just a pain in the ass because you're
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; constantly having to move the mouse before you can type in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; dialogs and such.
<br />
<br />Nope, its just that not all applications manage active focus
<br />
correctly.  Its one of the main reasons why I can't stand Netscape on
<br />
X.  I hit Meta-O and the dialog that pops up doesn't get focus.  It
<br />
was nearly trivial for me to add this to Grail, *and* to move focus
<br />
back to the original window when finished interacting with the dialog.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">    &gt;&gt; Which only goes to show that the problem is MetaCard not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">    &gt;&gt; supporting fvwm, and not fvwm's lack of support for MetaCard.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; This is really putting the cart before the horse: you buy a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; computer to run applications, not a window manager.  If your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; applications work with other window managers but not fvwm,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SR&gt; it's fvwm that's broken, not the applications.
<br />
<br />Sorry, but this is backwards, unless I bought my computer to only run
<br />
MetaCard.  My applications should honor my environmental preferences.
<br />
They should not dictate to me what's for my own good especially for
<br />
such fundamentally religious issues as focus policy.
