<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;No, you click on a button (or choose from a menu, or activate a menu
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;item with a mnemonic or accelerator) and it opens a dialog that gets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the focus.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the application can ask the window manager to change the focus to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another window?  Someone else has indicated that they built an app that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did this while the window manager was using pointer-focus policy.
</em><br />
<br />By warping the pointer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You then type whatever you want and then close it by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;pressing return, upon which the dialog closes and focus returns to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;application window that had it before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is commonly done using an application-modal keyboard grab so that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have to move the pointer to type in the window.  It can also be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done via warping the mouse or popping the dialog box up underneath the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointer.
</em><br />
<br />Neither of these are practical, the first because warping the pointer
<br />
violates all GUI style guides (other than the finally obsolete
<br />
OpenLook), and the second because it could result in the window
<br />
opening partially off screen.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; In the next release, you'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be able to drive the thing almost entirely from the keyboard,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Gee, and to think you could do this with Windows and OS/2 applications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;5 years ago...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I see, let's take the only decent UI that the vast majority of X users
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have ever used and ruin it because it doesn't work well with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;environment that works well with xterm windows.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lame.  First trash _HIS_ app and then say that Netscape is the only decent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UI?  (As if Netscape were and has always been a perfect app.  Sheesh.)
</em><br />
<br />I wasn't trashing his app, in fact it sounds very well implemented.
<br />
But I found it strange for him to be citing an app as an example of
<br />
how things should be done when it obviously took considerable effort
<br />
to make it work like Windows and OS/2 and Motif applications are
<br />
*required* to, and have been for years.  If he didn't have to spend so
<br />
much time fighting with pointer focus, he could have implemented some
<br />
really cool new features instead.
<br />
<br />And I certainly wouldn't claim that Netscape is perfect, but it *is*
<br />
Motif compliant which can't be said for xterm or most other apps
<br />
(including most Tk apps) that X users end up using.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;users new to computers are much more likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;use Netscape than they are to use xterms.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what?  Are you just trying to get fvwm to change the default to reduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your customer support costs for new users?  Give me a break. 
</em><br />
<br />So your position is that all new users should suffer until they become
<br />
as experienced as you?  I recommend instead that we make it as easy
<br />
for them as possible, and that means making explicit focus the
<br />
default.  The fact that it would reduce our (and Netscape's) technical
<br />
support demands, while good, is not the primary reason for doing it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fvwm should come with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;So you're saying that application vendors have no right to expect any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sort of standardization of desktop environments?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think a specific focus policy belongs in the standard even if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could agree on one.  
</em><br />
<br />And again, my goal is not to reduce choice, but just to make sure that
<br />
the defaults are set such that systems are as easy to use by the most
<br />
number of people.  I realize that this would mean that long-term fvwm
<br />
users would be getting dragged along by the masses, but it's better
<br />
than the masses dumping X-based systems and giving them bad reviews
<br />
because they behave unpredictably.  Unless you're perfectly happy with
<br />
fvwm's (and X's) very small niche, you should look at the big picture.
<br />
All changing the default would mean would be that you'll have to make
<br />
one more tweak to the config files to change the focus policy to the
<br />
way you like it if you don't like explicit focus.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you're using Win95 as an example, why did they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even bother publishing Xmouse if they felt it was a standard that needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be enforced?
</em><br />
<br />xmouse is is the &quot;powertoys&quot; package that the Win95 shell team
<br />
released.  It's not supported by Microsoft, and there are big
<br />
disclaimers all over the README about how you're on your own if you
<br />
install it.  Furthermore, a search of Microsoft's site turns up
<br />
several bug reports about things that don't work right when you use
<br />
it.
