I think autoconf is a nice thing to work towards. I have used it is house
<br />
and it is invaluable once the effort has been put in to convert a large
<br />
application to use configure. Its' primary author, David J. MacKenzie,
<br />
worked for me while a student at the University of Maryland, so I would
<br />
gladly see his work in wider use. However every time you muck with the build
<br />
procedure you will interject bugs or problems that will take several release
<br />
cycles to clean up. Look at what has happened to FVWM the last many months.
<br />
<br />Besides trying to clean up things for the release, the Imake configureation
<br />
has gone through a couple good sized changes. Each time things that were
<br />
fixed before were broke. This will happen with autoconf also. This has also
<br />
slowed down the releses of FVWM ( In my opinion ), as constant build bugs
<br />
that are reported with each beta tend to keep people from pulling the newest
<br />
release once they  have something installed and mostly working. This needs
<br />
to get fixed.
<br />
<br />Maybe if Chuck had a few &quot;elves&quot; that he could have grab and try his
<br />
releases on several platforms before he publicly announced a release we
<br />
could clean up clean up the obvious bugaboos before it was announced.
<br />
A number of other lists that I am on do this with good success and there
<br />
products look much cleaner as a result of this. Typical there is something
<br />
like an &quot;fvwm-workers&quot; list, where those commited to supporting the product
<br />
can quickly prepare things for release. I do like the open forum of the
<br />
fvwm list though, but think something is in order.
<br />
<br />I will personally volunteer to test early releases. I have HPUX, Solaris,
<br />
SunOS, IRIX, NetBSD, DU (OSF/1), and Ultrix systems I can test both vendor
<br />
and X11R6 builds against. If we had a couple/few volunteers for the major
<br />
OS's and X11's, then one of us for each or most OS's and X11's could get
<br />
back to chuck in a sort about of time so as not to slow up his releases by
<br />
more then 1 or 2 days at the most. The result will be better quality control
<br />
for FVWM. 
<br />
<br />There are many nuances with buiding things under X11. There are a number of
<br />
changes from R4, to R5, to R6 and between vendors that make it hard to get
<br />
things right if you do not  test them on a number of platforms. Autoconf
<br />
will have to deal with some of these same problems. When I started
<br />
contributing my changes to the fvwm configuration, I at first only tested my
<br />
changes on a couple OS's and under X11R6 only. A number of bugs were
<br />
reported then by people who had differnet configurations then I tested
<br />
under. Later I started testing under more platforms and using various xmkmf
<br />
and X11 versions, and the bugs dropped way down. One more iteration would
<br />
probably have stabilized this. The decisions was made to make the build more
<br />
Imake-ish at this time, and the changes broke a number of things. Now a
<br />
couple iterations later and we still have one or two cycles go before the
<br />
build process will be release ready. Lets not do this again right now, as
<br />
there are alot more important FVWM things to work on. The current setup will
<br />
work fine for most of us with a couple more turns of the crank.
<br />
<br />Again, I would like to see further beta releases address changes to the FVWM
<br />
code itself, and see the configuration/build process stabilized until after
<br />
FVWM-2.1 is released.
<br />
<br /><br />(my 2 cents worth)
<br />
Randall
