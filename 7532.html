<br />
Somewhere between the FVWM versions in Debian GNU/Linux versions slink and woody, FVWM developed the annoying habit of lowering and raising
<br />
windows beyond the one I requested it to lower or raise.
<br />
<br />For example, in PilotManager, when I start a synchronization operation,
<br />
PilotManager pops up a small status window.  I want to lower the main
<br />
window but leave the small status window visible (i.e., not lower it).
<br />
I used to be able to do that just fine, but now when I try to lower the 
<br />
main window, FVWM apparently lowers the small status window also.
<br />
<br />(I don't know for sure that this is FVWM, but several different
<br />
applications' windows seem to have changed this behavior when I upgraded
<br />
from Debian slink to Debian woody, so it seems to be FVWM.)
<br />
<br />How do I turn off this excessive lowering (and similar raising)?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(By the way, why was this changed?  The point of having separate windows
<br />
is (well, sometimes) to be able to treat them separately.  
<br />
<br />I can understand the use of raising a modal windows associated with a
<br />
main window when that main window is raised.  (You need to know about
<br />
the modal window to finish with it to be able to do anything with the
<br />
main window.)  But unless a window manager can know whether a transient
<br />
window is modal or not, it seems that its the windowing toolkit that
<br />
should be doing that raising.
<br />
<br />Similarly, I can understand the use of raising a non-modal transient
<br />
window (if that's the correct use of &quot;transient&quot;) when raising the main
<br />
window.  (In Netscape, when you raise a main window, any Find (find in
<br />
page) window associated with that main window gets raised too, and that
<br />
seems to work pretty logically.  However, I think Netscape already
<br />
implements that logic, since it has worked that way for a while.)
<br />
<br />However, I don't see the logic behind lowering windows beyond the
<br />
requested window.  If you lower a main window, there's no need to
<br />
lower associated windows; if you lower the associated windows, there's
<br />
no need to lower the main window.  Therefore, if the user lowers a
<br />
window, the window manager probably shouldn't decide to start lowering
<br />
others.  
<br />
<br />Well, I'm pretty sure my favorite window manager is configurable enough
<br />
for me to have my preferred behavior and everyone else to have theirs,
<br />
but I am curious about the logic for the change (and wonder if it 
<br />
should be the default (assuming it's not the Debian packager who changed
<br />
the behavior--that has happened before).)
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks,
<br />
Daniel
