<br />Oh that's _absolute_ BULLSHIT!
<br />
<br />An awful lot of top-notch software is written or started &quot;by simple college
<br />
students.&quot;  I'll bet that most colleges are much better &quot;work environments&quot;
<br />
than your office, and please knock it off with the ad hominem attacks.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Great!  Let them at it!  But they could be considerate of those locked

<br />You have to carry your own weight.  You've &quot;written one module that nobody
<br />
even uses&quot; and you're the most vehement supporter of fvwm2?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So quite trying to destroy Fvwm2 because you have a chip on your shoulder.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Give constructive critisim and when possible, help out!  Whining because

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things are not progressing as fast as you like is not helpful.  [...]
</em><br />
<br />There isn't a chip on my shoulder and I think that my input is constructive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chuck has done a superb job considering he has to work a 40 hour job to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintian his family.
</em><br />
<br />HAS DONE.  Perhaps WILL DO.  But right now he's too busy BooleDozing at his
<br />
job.  It's nothing personal and I like Chuck, but fact is fact.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe support the author financially so that he could work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on it more!
</em><br />
<br />Sounds like a fine idea!  Let him who is without hypocrisy send the first
<br />
check!  I see an opportunity for you to make a difference.  When Chuck
<br />
deposits his check for N-thousand dollars from you, I'll see what I can
<br />
scrape together.
<br />
<br />(I've been taking a non-commercial approach to life for a while...  Being
<br />
&nbsp;young and intentionally single, I'm entirely happy with this approach.
<br />
&nbsp;It's nice to have sex in the middle of the day in the middle of the week,
<br />
&nbsp;and my cat makes for a more peaceful work environment than the bozo on the
<br />
&nbsp;phone in the next cubicle.  When I'm contracting again, I'll be generous
<br />
&nbsp;again.)
<br />
<br />But this is getting entirely too personal, Richard, don't you think?
