Richard&gt; &lt;jacco_at_nlr.nl&gt; wrote concerning 'FVWM: New guy':
<br />
....
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why are the Color and HilightColor commands so different? The syntax is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different (&quot;color1 color2&quot; vs. &quot;color1/color2&quot;), the places where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be used (in a Style vs. at the top-level), the one doesn't accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an &quot;rgb:rr/gg/bb&quot; color spec and the other does, the one can be split
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into a BackColor and a ForeColor and the other can't. I end up having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to specify normal and hilighted colors in different places and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different ways, which looks really awkward.
</em><br />
<br />Richard&gt; I think this is historical. The HilightColor command existed long
<br />
Richard&gt; before Style &quot;*&quot; Color was created. I agree with you that it is
<br />
Richard&gt; not very intuitive. Now we have the new decors it is possible to
<br />
Richard&gt; get some strange and counterintuitive interactions between
<br />
Richard&gt; BorderStyle, Color and HilightColor.
<br />
<br />Correct.
<br />
<br />Richard&gt; In my opinion this should all be rewritten as part of the
<br />
Richard&gt; Great Style Flag rewrite. And so I come to a proposal I'd like
<br />
Richard&gt; to put to Chuck and the others.
<br />
<br />Yes I agree that a fair amount of the rc syntax needs cleaning up...
<br />
<br />Richard&gt; I think fvwm-2.0.45 is pretty stable (more stable than a lot
<br />
Richard&gt; of software I use!). How about freezing the features and
<br />
Richard&gt; releasing it as 2.1, then having parallel releases: 2.x will
<br />
Richard&gt; just be bug fixes for the current feature set, while 3.x (or
<br />
Richard&gt; whatever) will have all the code rewrites people have been
<br />
Richard&gt; planning for so long. People adding features will be
<br />
Richard&gt; encouraged to add them to the cleaner code of the 3.x betas.
<br />
<br />Whether the next beta after 2.1 is 2.2 or 3.0 depends on the scope of
<br />
the changes - what you are mentioning above perhaps falls about
<br />
halfway between what I imagine would be a 2.2 and a 3.0 version (which
<br />
path to take I've been oscillating on).  I'll explain more below
<br />
(briefly).
<br />
<br />Richard&gt; It strikes me that Chuck spends a lot of time adding and debugging
<br />
Richard&gt; all the great new features that people keep writing, and we'll
<br />
Richard&gt; never get to 2.1 and begin the GSFR at this rate.
<br />
<br />More or less correct...  I've been trying to limit features to help
<br />
get 2.1 out easier, but incorporating patches is always a pain because
<br />
my development level usually changes shortly after I release a beta
<br />
version and patches often overlap files &amp; throw off lines (sometimes
<br />
overlap lines too).  Plus as some people have noticed, I like to
<br />
reimplement things sometimes...
<br />
<br />Richard&gt; Just my 2c. Comments?
<br />
<br />My thoughts - I would like to get at least one more beta out before
<br />
2.1.  Then what to do for the next beta after that?
<br />
<br />(This is all breifly written, because I have to get back to work and
<br />
typing this note between working on things is becoming distracting)
<br />
<br />I've toyed with the idea of the next one being a big rewrite, beyond
<br />
just what I had in mind for the GSFR (this would be 3.x).  Clean more
<br />
stuff up, change rc syntax again (built in language, but add ways to
<br />
change to other scripting languages for the folks who would like
<br />
that), change module stuff (dynamic loading instead of or in addition
<br />
to a cleaned up socket communications protocol), etc.  Essentially
<br />
redesign it.  Scary thought, no?
<br />
<br />What I had in mind initially for 2.2.x was the GSFR and various
<br />
associated cleanups, maintaining essentially the same rc syntax but
<br />
clean up parts of it (mostly for consistency between commands), add
<br />
some new features &amp; bugfixes that are currently needed (eventually
<br />
including some of those that would be for 3.x).  Then 2.3 official
<br />
could be releases, and then probably move on to 3.x...
<br />
<br />What does everyone else think?  The latter is probably safer, but I
<br />
find the former more appealing...
<br />
<br />Most important for me to do in the immediate future is to actually
<br />
finish up the next beta... :) Sorry it's taking so long (again).

</em><br />
<br />David&gt; I disagree with the statement that fvwm-2.0.45 is pretty
<br />
David&gt; stable. I'm still using fvwm 1.x because of a bug in the
<br />
David&gt; FvwmButtons module. I've written to the list before about this,
<br />
David&gt; and got no response, other than from other people with the same
<br />
David&gt; problem. The problem is that I can't get FvwmButtons to appear,
<br />
David&gt; quite a fundamental problem with fvwm I would say. The only
<br />
David&gt; advice I've been able to get is use the FvwmButtons module from
<br />
David&gt; 2.0.41. Unfortunately, this didn't work for me, so I'm still
<br />
David&gt; using fvwm 1.x.
<br />
<br />Hm...  I have to say that I think fvwm itself is relatively stable and
<br />
usable (am I biased?), but there will always be bugs and there will
<br />
often times be ones that some people see that others don't (and if one
<br />
of those others happens to be me, as it often is, then debugging some
<br />
problems is difficult).
<br />
<br />Various people have had different problems with FvwmButtons,
<br />
especially since I accepted Jarl's rewrite - it doesn't handle the
<br />
older syntax well sometimes and this is often the problem.
<br />
<br />Can you get a *simple* FvwmButtons example to work?  Something like a
<br />
single button (no pixmap) that beeps?  Just copy these two into
<br />
FvwmTalk and see if it works:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;*SimpleButtons(Title beep Action Beep)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;FvwmButtons SimpleButtons
<br />
<br />If it does work ok, then work your way up through more complex
<br />
examples.  Perhaps this will help you figure out what's wrong.  Or
<br />
perhaps you can post to the list what your rc file was trying to do
<br />
and some kind soul who has some time might be able help.
<br />
<br />Other alternatives - try FvwmGoodStuff (which is the pre-rewritten
<br />
FvwmButtons), FvwmScript, or tkgoodstuff.  The first two are in the
<br />
extras dir in the 2.0.45 distribution.
<br />
<br />[On a side note, eventually (3.x?) I'd like to combine features of
<br />
FvwmButtons, FvwmForm, &amp; FvwmScript to make one super usable module
<br />
(FvwmGUI or something like that)...]
<br />
<br />Ok, this has all taken way too long to type - gotta go.  Hopefully
<br />
everything I've written here is coherent and actually what I meant. :)
