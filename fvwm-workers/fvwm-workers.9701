  I found a silly bug in the Fvwm.tmpl file in the latest patch (tbsp9d I
think):  OPTION_DEFINES is defined like this 

OPTION_DEFINES  = -DSHAPE
OPTION_DEFINES  = -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS -DINACTIVE_BTNS
OPTION_DEFINES += -DVECTOR_BUTTONS -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS

instead of 

OPTION_DEFINES  = -DSHAPE
OPTION_DEFINES += -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS -DINACTIVE_BTNS
OPTION_DEFINES += -DVECTOR_BUTTONS -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS

Shaped icons didn't work anymore without the '+' ;).

Happy New Year, and 
May the Bug be few, Andy.

Hi,

I'd like to make an addition to the wish list:  An enhanced
StaysOnTop/StaysPut style option that had more than two independent
window stacks; at least three, but preferably N.  This could be used to
implement the StaysOnBottom command, for one thing, and probably could
lead to further extensions for grouping windows and applying actions to
particular stacks.  You could have syntax like

Stacks 3
Style "*" Stack 2
Style "FvwmButtons" Stack 3
Style "xosview" Stack 3
Style "xbiff" Stack 3
Style "Reminder" Stack 1
Style "Notification" Stack 1

"Stacks" would default to 2, and the parser would translate
StaysOnTop/StaysPut to "Stack 1"/"Stack 2".  Commands could be added to
raise/lower windows from one stack to another.  Etc.

Is anybody doing this or has plans to do this?  I'll look and see if I
can do it, but I'm no Fvwm internals expert.  Does anyone have any
additional ideas or comments?  Should I wait for the Semi-mythical Great
Style Flag Rewrite?

Please STOP using those old development patches!  THOSE ARE OLD BUGS AND
HAVE BEEN FIXED AGES AGO.  I have NOT distributed those patches for quite
some time now.  Wait for 2.0.44-almost for the bug reports. 

Happy new year!

Howdy all.

Ok, at long last I finally have 2.0.44-almost ready for you guys to
try out.  It's in the usual place:

   ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/.test/fvwm-2.0.44-almost.tar.gz

Looks like:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      655429 Jan  6 12:04 fvwm-2.0.44-almost.tar.gz

It does not contain all of the fixes and stuff that I wanted to get in
there, but it's close enough for now (check out the ChangeLog entry).

Let me & the rest of the list know how it goes for each of your
platforms, and if all goes well I'll get 2.0.44 out to everyone else
in a few days.

Thanks,
Chuck

ps - I'm looking for a few good examples of various things to put in
the sample rc files for 2.1.0, if anyone would like to provide them:

  * Motif like keybinding examples
  * Various cool Borderstyle/TitleStyle/UseDecor examples (and more
    xpm's of course)
  * More good FvwmForm & FvwmButtons examples (like a simpler version
    of the Copy Desktop Environment version of the COSE toolbar)

Seems to build and run OK on Solaris 2.5.

-DLEFT_MENUS is still required to get the "Left Menus" functionality.

The documentation for this is buried in the change log.  I can see no
reason why this isn't built in without the ability to turn it off.

One bug that seems to have been missed:  

        When you have icons with no images.  When they are moved, they     
        disappear. (they come back by toggling screens)

        Chuck, I thought someone had a fix for this.


And also werent we going to get rid of(make option) cursor warping with menus(
ex: at bottom of screen)?

Compiling went smooth on SunOS 4.1.13, gcc. Had to link stdarg.h to vararg.h.


All else is good so far. Good work.

Wonderful work, Chuck!

chuck_hines> Ok, at long last I finally have 2.0.44-almost ready for
chuck_hines> you guys to try out.

In some environments, function is*() is ONLY implemented as a macro
(not in libc), so we'd better include <ctype.h>. Here is a patch.

 #include "fvwmlib.h"
 
 /*

With this patch, I successfully compile (sorry does not execute yet to
report this as quick as possible) fvwm-2.0.44-almost with NEWS-OS 4.x.

I have an outstanding bug report related to this.  It is against
1.24r, but I've verified that it happens on 2.0.43 as well.  I will
try and get a fix for it, time permitting.

Compiling ok out of the box on Red Hat 4 linux 2.0.21.  I haven't had
a chance to run the produced binary, however.  I get a few warnings
due to assignments to "const" variables, which I might try to track
down if I get the time.

I will be making the Debian fvwm-2.0.44 package as soon as you release
the final version :)

Pretty cool, folks!

Actually, several were "missed", and I fessed up to that:

I was taking WAY too long and I wanted to get the fixes that I had
ready out there to keep from getting the same bug reports over and
over...

Bassically, here's the rest of what I wanted to look into for this
release, but didn't (I should have put this in the original note):

        -  Menu cursor warping now optional

        -  Fixes for Dec Alpha (OSF & Linux) compiles

        -  Added setenv function

        -  Brought back 1.xx CursorStyle command (based on old patch
           from Kit Smithers)

        -  FvwmM4/Cpp fixes/updates based on patches from Greg Badros
           and Daniel Henninger

        -  Added ability to invoke any module with an alternate name

        -  Focus now moves window onto desktop, if it's off the desktop
           completely?

        -  Fixed prob w/ moving icons that don't have pixmaps if
           opaquemovesize set too low?

        -  Fixed UseStyle to allow "" for styles with spaces

        -  FvwmDebug was missing some stuff

        -  Patches to multi head code, from Barry Warsaw?

        -  Fixes for Restart
        -  Fixes for certain ICCCM focus policies?

        -  Reintroduced BackingStore options from 1.xx (global)?

        -  FvwmPager now resizes based on scale, can show only specific
           desk (like current), plus dynamic adding of desks via
           sendtomodule?

Don>         When you have icons with no images.  When they are moved,
Don>         they disappear. (they come back by toggling screens)

Don>         Chuck, I thought someone had a fix for this.

If someone did, I don't remember seeing it.  As noted above, I had
planned to look into that...  I'll search the archive later for any
patch for it, but if someone out there knows about one, let me know.

Don> And also werent we going to get rid of(make option) cursor
Don> warping with menus( ex: at bottom of screen)?

Again, planned, but not implemented yet.  It'll be done for 2.1.0
definitely though.

Really?  That doesn't seem right.  SunOS doesn't have it, but stdarg.h
should be in your gcc distribution.

Cool.

Thanks,

It is an "undocumented feature" right now until I get a chance to go
over it some more.  Actually, I left it in there in ifdef's primarily
so I wouldn't lose the idea in the reams of email that I have...

It currently only really works correctly for mwm menu functionality
(which I don't use) and I think it should work for both types of menus
with behavior appropriate to each.  Plus I hit some other bugs with it
when I played with it when it was submitted originally (don't recall
exactly what they were now).

This is a summary patch I've made, to compile 2.0.44-almost properly
(CAUTION: My patches posted before is also included).

This patch fixes:

	* libs/Parse.c needs <ctype.h>, because it uses is*() macro.
	  is*() macro may be ONLY defined by macro (i.e. not in libc).
	* Portability fix of FvwmAudio, for Solaris. This is already
	  reported to fvwm@hpc.uh.edu (by the Author of FvwmAudio:),
	  Message-Id: <x0ohlpe7dj.fsf@doctor.sdsu.edu>.
	* FvwmAudio doesn't know new module command 'mini_icon'.
	* Manual typo in FvwmForm, '.B' macro takes maximum 6 argument
	  but manual uses 7. This is already reported to fvwm@hpc.uh.edu,
	  Message-Id: <9604171933.AA09656@lemming.engeast>.
	* FvwmIconMan forces to use sysconf(). Use GetFdWidth()
	  defined in fvwm library (libs/System.c).

I hope it'll be included to 2.0.44...

Right again.

I've been using "mwm" style and I didn't see any problems (while using
mwm style).

I just tried it with "fvwm" style menus and it seemed inconsistent and
a little weird.  Sometimes the menus pop to  the right and overlap the
menu, and sometimes they  pop to the  left.

I  also now see with both  styles, that there  are times when there is
plenty of room to pop up a  menu, but if the  menu is popped up thru a
keypress, the mouse pointer warps to 0,0 and the menu pops up there.

Sorry  to see that that  left_menus are not in  such  good shape after
all.   I thought this was  a closed problem.   I don't see anything in
the TODO list.

I don't  know if this will  ever get fixed, but  I can't help but feel
that supporting 2 menu types with the same code is  one of the reasons
this has  been so hard  to get right.   I know it blew  my mind when I
made my feeble attempt.

I guess we would have a  menu war if we tried  to eliminate one of the
types...

Tried it on Linux 2.1.17 (Slackware); worked fine w/patch below.
Tried it on BSDi 2.0.1; also needed below patch.

Unfortunately, the BSDi binary didn't want to work right; I haven't
the time to look into it right now, but I should be able to get to it
within a day or so.  Probably a problem on my end.


The patch is for FvwmPager; it wouldn't link because SendInfo wasn't
defined for x_pager.c.

Hi,

[This has been sent to f-cord96@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr (FvwmScript
 maintainer) too]

To make FvwmScript (in the extras dir) compile I needed to change the name
of the function 'send_clientmessage' in Widgets/Swallow.c. This worked,
but I guess it would be better to integrate Swallow.c with the conflicting
definition.

Otherwise a module with *great* potential (haven't seen it before now).

Regards,

Chuck may have an altogether different solution, but just in case
you'd like to use quoted strings with UseStyle or UseDecor here
is a patch for that.

ChangeLog in 2.0.44-almost says:

       9. Added FlipFocus function from Dan Niles, to toggle between
          two windows easily

however, no 'FlipFocus' description exists in the fvwm manual. Is it

Hi Chuck and all workers,

Hang in there, I hope you're not getting drowned in patches there :-).

There are some things regarding TitleStyle Height/WindowFont I came
across a few days ago.  Here are the culmination of those findings and
some fixes.

The problems in 2.0.44-almost are described:

	- TitleStyle Height is not per-decor

	- Changing the WindowFont compensates the window size of
	windows without title bars, which it shouldn't
	
	(i.e., changing window fonts of different sizes would change
	the size of your pager -- this is problematic since the size
	difference can accumulate)

Changes this patch for 2.0.44-almost makes:

	CHANGE - TitleStyle Height is made per-decor
	
	CHANGE - WindowFont affects the size of titled windows only

	CHANGE - title bar height changes affect WindowShaded windows
	better

	CHANGE - the effect of TitleStyle Height is immediate (no
	Recapture necessary)
	
	CHANGE - AddToDecor function size reduction

	NEW - WindowFont is made per-decor (this is kind of nifty
	since could, for instance, have your terms a small window
	font or something)

The attatched context diff against the fvwm-2.0.44-almost tree (you
might get a line offset or two) makes the necessary changes (including
the man page).

Best regards,
Andrew

Well, I've just built fvwm-2.0.44-almost on an HP712 running HP-UX 10.2,
and it seems to have built okay. That is, there were no errors, though
there were several warnings (noted below). I used the native cc
compiler, and not gcc. I compiled with "the works" option defines, but
no vector buttons, and without RPLAY. I haven't had a chance to try
running it yet. Later today I'll try running it with my existing
.fvwm2rc, however, since I haven't been applying patches, any new stuff
since 2.0.43 will not be tested until I play with my .fvwm2rc file.

In the meantime, thanks for all the hard work, it is very much
appreciated.

Here is a patch from "Markus Gutschke <gutschk@uni-muenster.de>" which will
allow clicking in a window to raise the window as fvwm-2 already does in
clicktofocus mode.

This patch has been extremely well recieved by our user base. I hope this
will make it into the release. 

Thanks,
Randall

    Great stuff, Chuck! Hope you're feeling well again.

    Compiles & runs without a hitch on my Linux 2.0.0 (just call me
old-fashioned) sorta Slackwarish system.

    Special congrats to Andrew & Brady. I've only just begun to play
with your new decor options, but, well, um... Wow!

    This is indeed a great way to start the New Year!

        Cheers!

Chuck simply removed the

from the fvwmlib.h, I sent to him.
Put it back in there, it's used in more places:

We all know Santa as a fat, jolly old man. Well, he may be fat and he
may be old, but he ain't always jolly. There was this one year when
Mrs. Claus decided she wanted to be a feminist, the reindeer went on
strike, and the elves sued because they wanted to be called
"vertically challenged toy manufacturers".
So Santa retreated to his office to rest, when an angel entered and
said, "Santa..."
"What do you want?" was the reply.
"Well," the angel answered,"The Christmas Tree arrived today."
"So?" Santa said.
"Well, I was wondering where you wanted me to put it."
And that, my friends, is why Angels sit on top of trees.

I had a fix for this in my monster patch (as a menu-style option)
- didn't make it to 2.0.44-almost. 
Maybe it should be a global option instead ?

As soon, as I start fvwm-2.0.44-almost, all windows get frames, but lose
their contents.

There's just a grey (background) pane with decoration.

I can start up menus, move the panes around, but they stay empty.

Just as if they never get a redraw event.

I renamed my .fvwm2rc to sth else, so it's not the cause of the trouble.

Same for normal start or restart from 2.0.43

HW/SW: 	sun IPC 
	sunos 4.1.3   
	XTECH X11R4 server & libraries
	gcc 2.5.7

I'll try on a sun4 with X11R5 next.

any other suggestions?

a "make install" doesn't make the lib.
I think it should, shouldn't it?

I always have to do a 'make' in 'libs' then 'make install'

It's still there. :(.

       8. Hopefully fixed long standing startup timing bug in which
          some windows didn't get Style attributes or borders (by
          fixing when server was grabbed and making sure it didn't get
          ungrabbed to early accidentally)

It doesn't appear to be fixed. I got rid of the sleep 1 in front of my
rxvt window, but the window still:

1. Comes up in the default gray
2. Has _no_ buttons
3. Does change to my HiLightColor when it is focused.
4. I have some alt-mouse bindings for windows, borders, and titlebars
(Alt-Left = Iconify, Alt-Middle = Move, etc.) In this weridified window,
the binding is not recognized.
5. The window _does_ use the WindowFont it is supposed to.
6. It does not recognize any of its Style attributes or the "*"
attributes. (SloppyFocus, IconBox, etc.)

As always, my FvwmCpp-interpreted fvwm2rc is at:

http://dosa.ini.cmu.edu/~manojk/fvwm2rc

I've also placed my .xsession up for perusal:

I have confirmed this under fvwm-2..0.44-almost with just about all the
bug-fix patches posted to this list, under Linux 2.0.27. I haven't tried
2.0.44 under HP-UX yet, but the bug appeared on it under 2.0.42 and
2.0.43.

Sorry if this has already been reported, it seems vaguely familiar...

I added this to a menu:

+ "Stone title bar" TitleStyle TiledPixmap /public/pixmap/stone.xpm

and the words "Stone title  bar" are centered   and underlined in  the
menu as if they were a title.  Apparently the parsing of the addtomenu
line  sees  the characters  "Title" in   "TitleStyle" and thinks thats
close enough.

I just had a look at this, and apparently the culprit is in 
functions.c:find_func_type.  It only matches the first few letters which 
can cause incorrect matches (this is generally a problem with the entire 
mystrncasecmp stuff as I think someone else pointed out).  The following 
is a work-around that matches token length in addition to the first few 
letters.

There was a minor bug in the height.diff patch I posted a few days ago
which caused a [harmless] "Permission denied" message which shouldn't
have been there.  This patch also makes DestroyDecor use ChangeDecor
which makes the decor changing consistent when killing decors.  It's a
small but important change.

These fixes go right on top of height.diff.

My full diff to fvwm-2.0.44-almost which contains all the changes
I've posted earlier (including this one) is at
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/private/andrew.diff.gz .

Andrew

I thought the following simple stuff is neat to experiment or start
out with if you've not tried using the decor stuff yet.

Given that you have some sort of customized window setup, type the
following in FvwmTalk [preferably]:

addtodecor test
changedecor test

Then click on a window -- doing so will change the current decor to a
standard Fvwm decor (named "test," but it starts out that way).  Then,
do this:

changedecor default

And click on the window you just did, and it will go back to normal.
With ChangeDecor you could add a menu to the window which even has
some sort of tagging so if you have a number of uniform windows and
want to mark one as important.

I've found it nifty (with my height.diff patch) to give the XTerms on
my TP760 a very small font so that the screen looks larger when I am
working mostly on many terminals on a screen, so I use something like
the following in my rc file:

AddToDecor "XTerm" WindowFont 5x7
+ BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles

Style "XTerm" UseDecor "XTerm"

Having these small title bars is reminiscent of those seen in M$, but
of course much better since they look like Motif :-).

I became restless this morning, so I decided to code up another button
style which I had thought about for a while but never got around to
doing.  It is a test of course, and it is not meant for 2.0.44 or
anything.  It is the Color button style and allows you to alter not only
the button background color, but used as the initial button style it
also uses hilight and shadow colors for the button.  In effect, you can
say something like:

ButtonStyle Left Color darkblue
ButtonStyle Left Inactive Color darkred
AddButtonStyle Left Default

...and you will end up with the default button set but with a much more
beveled appearance which matches your background colors.  Works fine for
the extended titlestyle as well.

Let me know if it works (it works here at least :-).

It is at http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/private/av.color.btns.diff.gz
and should patch to 2.0.44-almost, but the context diff was made off of
the
2.0.44-almost + andrew.diff.gz in the same directory there.

Enjoy,
Andrew

However, one thing that drove me nuts was that any complex function
incurred a delay for the ClickTime, which made making a ToggleWindow
Complex function kind of annoying (this has nothing to do with FlipFocus).  

I've written a patch which lets you give the Function command an argument
causing it to only execute "I" (Immediate) parameters to the function. 
This makes complex functions such as the following ToggleWindow *much*
more responsive (especially with larger ClickTime settings). 

Here is the extracted parts of my rc that uses FlipFocus (with the new
Function -I option, which makes it only run the Immedate functions):

Key Tab		A	C	Function -I ToggleWindow

AddToFunc FocusWindow
+				"I" Focus
+				"I" WarpToWindow 10 10

AddToFunc ToggleWindow
+				"I" FlipFocus
+				"I" Prev [!iconic] Function -I FocusWindow

If you don't use the following patch, take out the -I option (make
ClickTime like 500 to see what I mean).

Patch for the -I option to Function (ComplexFunction in complex.c) to
make it only execute the Immediate portions of a function and return,
speeding it up for some situations.  If there is a way to obtain this
speedup without this patch, I'd love to hear it!

Forget the last patch message if you don't want the -I Function
argument.  After a slightly closer examination, I realized that if you
give AddToFunc a command on the first instance than it will work fine
since Persist will not be set to true (it wasn't really obvious
though, but anyway :).  However, there may be a use or two for the -I 
argument, just not in this case :-).

The following works just as well without the patch I posted previous
to this:

Key Tab		A	C	ToggleWindow

AddToFunc FocusWindow		"I" Focus
+				"I" WarpToWindow 10 10

AddToFunc ToggleWindow		"I" FlipFocus
+				"I" Prev [!iconic] FocusWindow

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.

Regards,
Andrew

Hello everyone.

Here are some examples (actually at this point it's all I got :-).
Please post some examples if you have any.  I think some of these are
possible sample rc candidates for Chuck, but, of course they must be
posted before being considered (hint, hint :-).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what I use for WindowShade (double-click the title-bar):

Mouse 1	T	A	Move-Raise-Shade

AddToFunc Move-Raise-Shade	"I" Raise
+				"M" Move
+  				"D" WindowShade


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some CUA similar bindings I use:

Key F4		A	M	Close
Key F4		A	SM	Destroy
Key space	W	M	Popup SomeWindowOpsMenu

Then in SomeWindowOpsMenu of course a tab (must be tab) should be
placed after the &Close option and then Alt-F4 (or Meta) or something.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what I use for FvwmCascade/FvwmTile:

AddToMenu TileMenu
+	"&Horizontally"		FvwmTile -h -mn 3 2 2 90 85
+	"&Vertically"		FvwmTile -mn 3 2 2 90 85

AddToMenu [I actually put this on root menu :-]
+	"&Cascade"		FvwmCascade -resize 2 2 80 60
+	"&Tile"			Popup TileMenu



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a pitiful rc example for UseDecor, however it requires
andrew.diff.gz (in http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/private) to change the
title bar height.  It is a variation of the standard rc look but with
small title bars for xterms.  {SMALL,BIG}WINDOWFONT should replaced
(unless you use FvmwM4 or FvwmCpp).

# Default decor
WindowFont BIGWINDOWFONT
ButtonStyle 3 13 26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1 79x29@1 \
63x48@0 79x65@1 70x75@0 50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0

#  Default title bar for mini-windows decor
AddToDecor "Mini Window"
+ WindowFont SMALLWINDOWFONT
+ ButtonStyle 3 13 26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1 79x29@1 \
63x48@0 79x65@1 70x75@0 50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0

Style "*"		BorderWidth 10,HandleWidth 8

Style "XTerm"	UseDecor "Mini Window",BorderWidth 6,HandleWidth 3


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For window navigation I use these:

Key Tab		A	C	Function ToggleWindow
Key Right	A	SCM	NextWindow
Key Left		A	SCM	PrevWindow

AddToFunc FocusWindow		"I" Focus
+				"I" WarpToWindow 10 10

AddToFunc NextWindow		"I" Next [!iconic] Function FocusWindow

AddToFunc PrevWindow		"I" Prev [!iconic] Function FocusWindow

AddToFunc ToggleWindow		"I" FlipFocus
+				"I" Prev [!iconic] Function FocusWindow

Later,
Andrew

Yeah, I had wanted to put those corrections in, but had lost the
original message pertaining to it.  Now that I have it again, I'll put
them in 2.0.44.

Thanks,
Chuck

Ok, at long last 2.0.44 is ready and available from the official ftp
site:

      ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.0.44.tar.gz

and looks like:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      657705 Jan 15 15:24 fvwm-2.0.44.tar.gz

I think I got all the patches that the workers list sent me from their
preliminary testing of it (I hope I got them all) so it should compile
and run under all the platforms nicely.

There are a lot of changes in this beta release, as you'll see from
the ChangeLog entry below:

======================================================================
2.0.44
       1. More man page and FAQ updates
       2. More minor Imake fixes
       3. Patch for IconGeometry placement problems and probs running
          on multiple displays from Graham Barr
       4. Changed Next/Prev 'CurrentScreen' to be 'CurrentPage' and
          added 'CurrentPageAnyDesk', based on patch by Dan Niles
       5. Updated FvwmIconMan from Brady Montz
       6. Fix so FvwmGoodStuff in extras would compile ok
       7. Added Perl routines (fvwmperl in extras dir) for aid in
          making modules written in Perl, from Dan Astoorian
       8. Hopefully fixed long standing startup timing bug in which
          some windows didn't get Style attributes or borders (by
          fixing when server was grabbed and making sure it didn't get
          ungrabbed to early accidentally)
       9. Added FlipFocus function from Dan Niles, to toggle between
          two windows easily
       10. Patch for EdgeResistance timer problem from Mike Blatchley
       11. Patch to FvwmAudio so it works again (new module message
           type M_STRING wasn't recognized) plus other minor fixes and
           enhancements (like being able to use the rplay 'say'
           command and have arbitrary strings instead of sound file
           names), from Albrecht Kadlec
       12. Fixes to FvwmConsole from Toshi Isogai, plus added his
           FvwmCommand to the extras directory (for sending fvwm
           commands from a shell script).
       13. Patch for dynamic icon title recalculation from Ric Lister.
       14. Updates to fvwmrc_convert from Bill Oswald, with some more
           minor mods from me to make it easier to customize for your
           site.
       15. Added 'Echo' function.
       16. Patch to FvwmForm to handle TrueColor from Chris Laas
       17. Changed fcntl in module.c to use O_NONBLOCK (POSIX) instead
           of O_NDELAY (early SYSV) due to differences in behavior on
           some systems (Pyramid SYSV for instance, pointed out by
           Mark Wedel)
       18. Added Python routines (fvwmpython in extras dir) for aid in
           making moduules written in Python, from Barry Warsaw
       19. FvwmBacker now sets root window when it's invoked as well
           as on desk changes
       20. CatchFatal no longer makes XLib calls (to prevent some
           infinite looping under Digital Unix & Solaris), patch from
           Grant McDorman.
       21. Added Andrew Veliath's TitleBar pixmap patch (optional at
           compile time)
       22. Added patch for timing bug in pager when dragging windows
           across desktops under Solaris from Grant McDorman
       23. Added RefreshWindow function, at the request of Mike Kazda.
       24. Changed default XORValue to 1
       25. Changed SmartPlacement behavior to be "stubborn" (like 1.xx
           StubbornPlacement option) and not place over icons (if you
           don't want this you can compile with NO_STUBBORN_PLACEMENT).
       26. Added extras/FvwmScript (which replaces extras/FvwmForm2)
           from Frederic Cordier (although I think it should be
           renamed to something like FvwmFormScript).  It can now
           swallow programs like FvwmButtons.
       27. Sample .fvwm2rc updates, default system.fvwm2rc file now
           minimal to encourange site customization, added more sample
           files to go with it.
       28. Added info to FvwmIdent
       29. Added MiniIcon patch from Brady Montz (optional at compile
           time)
       30. Added BorderStyle border textures (+ TitleStyle, UseDecor,
           etc) patch from Andrew Veliath, part of which was inspired
           by the idea from 'The Rasterman' Carsten Haitzler (optional
           at compile time)
       31. Consolidated Recapture and CaptureAllWindows
       32. Fixes for unmapping problems (patch from Grant McDorman)
       33. Removed redundancy in module.c in Broadcast* funcs.
       34. Multiple -f & -cmd parms now allowed (10 max)
       35. Merged fvwmlib code into some common files, and moved some
           functions out of fvwm proper into them.
       36. Added GlobalOpts builtin (for various options that should
           become Style options later) - this is temporary.  I know
           it's ugly, but I didn't feel like adding 6 (or more)
           temporary functions (lazy, I know...)
       37. Added (GlobalOpts) global option
           SmartPlacementIsReallySmart (may become parm to
           SmartPlacement, or whole new CleverPlacement style after
           the Great Style Flag Rewrite) which uses clever placement
           code from Anthony Martin
       38. Started adding new parsing code based on ideas in patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec, for more consistent parsing.  More
           and more code in fvwm will be converted to use these...
       39. Added WindowListFunc and made built in window list use it
           by default (instead of RAISE_IT), to allow for various
           actions to be controlled by the builtin window list (like
           to warp the pointer or not warp the pointer when giving it
           the focus, or perhaps do something like run FvwmIdent on
           it).  It is interpreted, so you can destroy it and write
           your own version of this default WindowList function.
       40. WindowList now takes reasonable optional parameters instead
           of those cryptic numbers (including an optional function to
           use instead of the default WindowListFunc), based on patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec.
       41. Added WindowId function, sort of like Next & Prev, to force
           a function to happen on a specified WindowID.
       42. Updated FvwmAuto from Albrecht Kadlec (now takes parameters
           for functions to be run on focus in & focus out).
       41. Read funcs now output what they are going to execute if
           -debug parameter was passed in.
       42. Should now be sending synthetic ConfigureNotify on stacking
           changes (for potential motif menubar problems).
       43. Added WindowShade function from Andrew Veliath
       44. Added (GlobalOpts) global options to modify ClickToFocus
           selections: ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/PassesClick,
           ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/Raises (may become parms to
           ClickToFocus after the Great Style Flag Rewrite)
       45. UseStyle should now parse quoted Style refs correctly,
           courtesy of Andrew Veliath.
       46. Added Randall Winchester's CLICKTORAISE compile time option patch
       47. Patch from Greg Badros for FvwmButtons font coredump
       48. Patch from Greg Badros so FvwmM4 passes opts not recognized
           directly to M4 (so -m4opt not needed) and -outfile option.
           Added these to FvwmCpp as well.
       49. Fixes for compiling under Linux for DEC Alpha from Ilkka E
           T Tuohela
======================================================================

And this is NOT all of the stuff I wanted to get in there, but the
rest can wait until the next release, so don't complain too loudly if
your favorite fix didn't make it this time.  It was taking way too
long to get 2.0.44 out the door.

I won't give my usual commentary on these changes as there are way too
many and I have little time right now.  But the most visible ones are
probably the optional BorderStyle/TitleStyle/UseDecor stuff from
Andrew Veliath.  BTW - I'd like to get some examples of usage from
people who make interesting looking setups for inclusion in 2.1.0.

I'd like to make this the last beta before 2.1.0 (have we heard this
before?) if I could.  So if anyone has any suggestions on what they
feel absolutely needs or should be done before 2.1.0 (I do have a few
things in mind already), let me know (preferably via the mailing
lists).

Ideally I'd like to get 2.1.0 out in a few weeks, but as always
that'll probably have to be pushed farther out due the frequent
scarcity of my free time in which to work on fvwm...

As always, I'd like to say thanks to all patch/idea contributors, the
folks on the workers list, and of course, all you users too. :)

Chuck

ps - I've finially gotten around to putting html-ized versions of the
man pages on the web server.  I'll try to keep them updated with each
release as well.  Unfortunately the converter I used (man2html)
doesn't do internal hyperlinks, but it looked much better than any of
the other converters I found (although RossettaMan was close, as I
recall).

Hi everyone (and happily we are A LOT!)

Even I still didn't sleep this week and even still I have waaay long to 
work on some annoying urgent projects, I was REALLY excited to receive 
this evening the announce of 2.0.44 from Chuck.

Well, I'm enchanted and enlightened :-). Quite a BIG job, so well done 
by all of you bussy fwvm-workers. A heartly THANKS for Chuck Hines.

So, I compiled and installed the new version without any hick-ups. I had 
already all the beautiful/useful patches about styles and 
functionalities which are so carefully mentionned by Chuck in the 
announcement. I am pleased to say that the new binary restarted with my 
old .fvwm2rc without any major error.

The only misfunction I was able to detect so far is that the FvwmAuto 
module fails silently to keep along with the imposed timeout.

More precisely, when one starts or restarts fvwm2, the autoraise occurs 
AFTER the indicated timeout only for the first window which gains the 
focus. After that the autoraise takes place instantly at the focus 
change.

I tried to impose Nop for LeaveCommand, but unsuccessfully. So, until 
new (upgrade :-) events I put back the old FvwmAuto.

Now a little thing. It will be too hard to put a compile time selectable 
functionality in FvwmButtons which to provide ... tooltips on buttons 
according to the Action's Titles? I once begun myself to look at the 
code but meanwhile my time begun very (physically :-) transparent ... I 
would like this because I use some 17 20x20 buttons with SouthEast 
gravity in which I have calls for all my most useful applications and 
also a very little (and cute) swallowed pager. Such little buttons can't 
have titles on them. But almost each button has actions on all three 
mouse click events and so it happens that sometimes I have to remember 
what is where.

So, this very long and quite annoying post finishes here. Thanks again 
to all of you that spent time on this excellent WM. I really like it.

"See" you later

				Cristian

Hi,
	Whenever I run FVWM and have it use a mini-icon X crashes and 
gives the message:

waiting for X server to shut down xterm:  fatal IO error 2 (Broken pipe) 
or KillClient on X server ":0.0"
.

This crash is generated when I do (for example):
AddToDecor ian
        + ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap buttons/w95_min.xpm

However if I use buttons/w95_min.xpm as an application's icon it works, 
so the pixmap file is good. Fvwm95 fails in the same way with mini-icons.

Related, perhaps, is the fact that FvwmButtons doesn't work. It runs, 
spawns its children and quits, leaving the child processes all over the 
place.

I am not sure what is up, everything else on my system works fine.

it is linux 2.0.27 with XF86_S3 3.2. 

Ian

Hi Chuck and workers,

Great work!  It is running fine here.

Here are two real small changes which were in the patches I sent to
the workers list that got overlooked.  The first one is evident when
you shade a window (the second one is a non-problem in typical usage).

I am happy to discover that you were able to integrate all of the
workers-list patches as nicely as you did.

Again, great work!!

And, if you do NOT define 'MINI_ICONS', FvwmAudio plays 'shutdown'
sound when startup (i.e., it's broken). FvwmAudio handles 'MINI_ICONS'
definiton properly, but fvwm does not (check fvwm/module.h for more detail).

I don't know which (FvwmAudio or fvwm) should be fixed, so no patches
are available, sorry. IMHO, FvwmAudio does not handle 'MINI_ICON'
definition is a better solution (FvwmAudio works with whether fvwm
does handle mini_icons or not).

There seems to be a bug in menus that only shows up on solaris.

Some of the menus repeat the menu items twice, and some show the items in other
menus.  Its like the end of the menu is missed and over-run.

But it compiled and ran fine in SunOS, and Linux.
And 2.0.44 did not have this problem.

Anyone else seen it?

I just figured out why the UseStyle doesn't work -- it is pretty clear
actually.  UseStyle finds the first occurance in the name list and then
uses only those values.  It ignores further, identical entries in the list
(new entries are created even for identical names), which is precisely why
it only uses the values from the first Style command. 

This means UseStyle is a bit broken, but the workaround as described
before is to place the entire Style definition on a single line, or to use
the \ to continue on next lines.

The problem:

	- UseStyle only uses the first instance of a Style command

	For instance,
	Style "Boo" ClickToFocus
	Style "Boo" Icon test.xpm

	Style "Boo2" UseStyle "Boo"
	
	Then Boo2 will only get ClickToFocus.  Clearly it should have
	everything defined in Boo.

The patch:

	- Change UseStyle to accumulate all of the same Style
	definitions. The method of style accumulation is the same as in
	LookInList. With this patch, the above will work as expected.

WindowShade may confuse users in that if you accidently try to resize it
it may give you a zero size window (depending on size hints, etc.), and/or
some apps get messed up with variations of Maximize, which might lead a
user to inadvertently mess up a window or become confused.

At first this behavior was intended, but consequently, I now think it is
best to avoid these problems by inhibiting Maximize and Resize in the
shaded state (giving you a nice beep instead).

The change is trivial; here is the patch.

All of the changes to fvwm 2.0.44 I've made are now in the file: 

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/andrew.2.0.44.diff.gz

Changes include:

	- WindowShade fix (Resize/Maximize inhibited for reliability and
	consistency, and that top edge fix I posted previously)

	- UseStyle fix (should fix the inconsistency problem)

Please try it and post your results.

It's probably best as you say that FvwmAudio remove the ifdef so that it
is always assumed to be there, since fvwm2 definately keeps the message
numbering no matter what is defined.

This patch adds a module output message for the WindowShade
function.  Maybe the FvwmAudio maintainer could add this message (only
thing is that it requires interpretation of the message body)?

Since I don't normally use icons, I hadn't noticed CleverPlacement's poor
handling of icons.  I have now modified CleverPlacement to place windows
around icons properly.  It also tries to avoid StaysOnTop windows and you
can make it avoid Sticky windows if you want (compile-time option).

To use CleverPlacement in 2.0.44, put the following line in your .fvwm2rc
file:
GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

The patch also fixes a bug in the placement code that causes windows to be
misplaced by one pixel if the RandomPlacement flag is set.  This fix seems
to have missed 2.0.44.

The patch is attached, but if you prefer, you can get the entire
placement.c file from:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c
Just replace the original placement.c and recompile.

Let me know if you have any problems.

Tony.

Yup, just tried it and saw it :-).  I failed to heed the synthetic
ConfigureNotify, but I changed it to do so by sending a ConfigureNotify
when it is unshaded, which corrects the problem.  Thanks for noting this. 

The fix is in a new all changes patch:

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

--------------59E21CFB3F54
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This patch was provided by somebody else (not I) for fvwm-2.0.43, but
was not included in the fvwm-2.0.44 distribution.  It provides a
"Replace" function, which uses CleverPlacement to reposition an existing
window on the screen.

A useful example:

	AddToFunc	"MaximizeVert"
	+	"I"	Maximize 0 92
	+	"I"	Replace

My setup has a button bar on the top of the screen, and the tkgoodstuff
task bar on the bottom of the screen.  If I execute the "Maximize 0 92"
function, it will move the window to the top of the screen, partially
obscuring the button bar.  The "Replace" function will call
CleverPlacement to find a more suitable location to put the window (if
possible).

I've MIME-attached the patch to this message.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Enclosed are some patches for extras/FvwmConsole.  I've been trying to
find the best version of these; FvwmTalk is nice in that it doesn't need
an xterm, but I can't paste multiple lines correctly for some reason (it
puts them all as one line and doesn't parse them correctly).  Plus the
code is a bit impenetrable to an X programming novice like myself :)

FvwmPipe looks quite promising and I have a cool idea or two for that.

But FvwmConsole seems to be the most complete, plus it has the option of
using readline which I like.

But I think it needed some tweaks, esp. the readline support.  Here's
what I did:

  - The Imakefile sets ADD_INCLUDE if you enable Readline but, at least
    in my X config (X11R6.3), that variable isn't used anywhere.  I
    changed it to EXTRA_INCLUDES.

  - Reworked the man page a bit.

  - Accept the command "exit" to make FvwmConsole quit.  The docs say
    C-d is bound to delete-char in Readline, but really it sends an
    EOF.  But, if someone did rebind it then we'd need another way to
    exit FvwmConsole gracefully; hence "exit".

  - Reworked the GNU readline support quite a bit:
      * Disable TAB-completion.  You can't cut/paste commands containing
        TABs into FvwmConsole when completion is enabled, plus why would
        you need filename completion in FvwmConsole?

      * Handle backslashed command lines, so you can paste directly from
        your .fvwm2rc more easily; stuff like this works verbatim:

          ButtonStyle 1 (Pixmap fvwm95/mini.destroy.xpm) \
                        ActiveDown (Pixmap fvwm95/mini-exp.xpm)

      * Defined PS1 and PS2 prompts for the GNU readline support.  PS2
        is used if the previous line ended in a backslash.

      * Allow "infinitely" large buffers for commands--I'm not sure if
        fvwm itself can handle single lines of larger than 255 chars,
        but FvwmConsole can build 'em as big as you like.

Probably some of the readline extras (esp. backslash support) should be
migrated into the "vanilla gets" interface as well.

 .SH SYNOPSIS
 FvwmConsole is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
-From within the .fvwm2rc file or from a menu, FvwmConsole takes any
-options xterm will take, except -name, and -title.
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm configuration commands
+interactively, and have them executed immediately.  This tool is
+particularly useful for testing new configuration ideas, or for
+implementing temporary changes to your environment.

+FvwmConsole must be spawned as a module by fvwm.  FvwmConsole takes all
+\fIxterm\fP(1) options, except -name and -title.

+FvwmConsole can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmConsole' in
+the .fvwm2rc file.  This can be placed on a line by itself, if
+FvwmConsole is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can be
+bound to a menu or mouse button or keystroke to invoke it later.  Fvwm
+will search directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
+to attempt to locate FvwmConsole.
+
+.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
+FvwmConsole uses \fIxterm\fP(1).  All resources set for xterm are
+inherited unless overridden by command line options.

 If Perl5 is installed, FvwmConsoleC.pl can be used as a command editor.
 This can be accomplished by either copying FvwmConsoleC.pl 
 to fvwmlib directory as FvwmConsoleC or
 invoking FvwmConsole with -e option.
 For example:
 
-.br

I've made andrew4.2.0.44.diff.gz available under

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/ .

The file andrew3-andrew4.2.0.44.diff.gz in there is the change from
andrew3 (mainly for Chuck, very small).

I think this will fix Larry's problem with DestroyDecor and shrinking
windows, but have not tested it (however, it should be changed anyway).

If anyone cares, here's a mini-gnu pixmap I created by rescaling the
gnu-animal.xpm that comes with fvwm2, then tweaking a little by hand.

Feel free to tweak it yourself, if you like; it's certainly not
perfect.

better: just use MatchToken() or TokenCmp() and fix the library functions
to be aware of word ends ( =='\0' || isspace() || isdelim())

I wrote this patch after someone suggested it in an email today.  After he
mentioned it, it did seem to be a missing thing.

Here is a simple patch which does a few replacements of XBell with MyBell,
adds a MyBell function to fvwm.c (and proto in misc.h), and puts a
ServerBellIsOn global option in ScreenInfo which can be changed with
GlobalOpts. 

The main meat is that you can turn the server bell off (optionally) and
have FvwmAudio play an error bell.

It is pretty straightforward, and I hope Chuck might consider it for
inclusion.  Albrecht would be required to modify FvwmAudio slightly to add
the "bell" message if this gets included. 

It is in the following directory (bellmsg):

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/

(the diff is unified and off of andrew4 diff... the only place where I
suspect may be trouble in patching is module.h)

Regards,
Andrew

done:

	"default_icon",
	"string",
#ifdef M_BELL
	"beep",		/* BEEP function or internal error */
#endif
        "mini_icon",
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
	"windowshade",
	"dewindowshade",
#endif
/* add builtins here */
	"startup",
	"shutdown",
	"unknown"
};

I called the event 'BEEP' to go with the 'BEEP' fvwm internal function.

the dependence of M_BELL (module.h #define) is necessary for everybody who
hasn't yet applied all patches in the correct order.
(if the patches keep appearing every odd hour, we'll need a 2.0.45 before
next friday to sync up again.)

The two #ifdefs will probably disappear for 2.1.0.

cheers,

       28. Added info to FvwmIdent

fine, but ident windows don't go away anymore, if focus ever leaves them.

try:
Ident on any window, click in ident window.

ident on any window, move mouse to root window (sloppyfocus), clicking on
the ident window doesn't remove it anymore. stays put. :-(

I just spent a while trying to decipher the new stuff, including Decor.

I think one of the reasons it's confusing is that it's not clear at all
what the distinction between a Decor and a Style is, when you should use
one or the other, and basically why they are two different things and
what each is good for.

Also, it seems that everything _except_ Style has gone to the new
"AddTo" format (with the "+" lines), which is inconsistent.

And why is there only one AddToFunc, AddToMenu, AddToDecor, but there's
a distinction between ButtonStyle and AddButtonStyle?  I don't get that.

And, as I said before, some of the syntax uses this new (), --, !
notation and some doesn't (like Style doesn't use !, it has multiple
values for the opposite "flag" types).  That's also confusing.

Why do you define the colors to HilightColor as <c1> <c2>, but the
colors to the Style Color option as <c1>/<c2>?  There's just a lot of
inconsistency and even some redundancy, I think, in the config file
language now.

I think that somewhere there needs to be a very short overview: "Use
ButtonStyle to define buttons on the window frame border; use
AddButtonStyle to modify attributes of an existing ButtonStyle; use
AddToDecor to make a new Decor; use UseDecor to apply a Decor to a
Style; use UseStyle to `duplicate' a style", etc.

Also, someone should to rewrite the system.fvwmrc file to maybe use
Decor and/or Style "correctly" as an example; here's how I changed my
~/.fvwm2rc (obviously, comments more than welcome :) after I (think I)
figured out Decor and UseStyle:

  ### Standard Window Configuration

  Style "Emacs"	      Icon g/gnu.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.gnu.xpm

This, obviously, is not my whole config, but it's all the decor/style
part.

Basically I create a "Standard" Decor and a "Standard" Style (that uses
the Standard decor), then I define all windows to use the Standard Style.

Then I have another Style, Naked, that I use for apps that have no
border (button bars, CD player, XFaces, etc.)

The idea, I guess, is I could make other Styles and/or Decors and switch
them pretty easily.

Well, anyway, FWIW.

because the AddButtonStyle part was added by Andrew (minimal change

features, but Chuck simply didn't include it. - lots of parsing bugs
could simply be fixed by modifying MatchToken and CmpToken)

chuck is working on it. I hope he'll use the ! instead of the
unreadable "NoNormal", "Normal", "OnlyNormal", for WindowList again.

I did it like this originally (my WindowList rewrite)
	+ or & means: this option is required,
	- or ! means: this option is rejected (required to be off)
	     . means: don't care for this option
it was "too unreadable" :-)

anyway. Chuck should make his decision and stay with it throughout all
of .fvwm2rc.

e.g: you can say

I was always wondering about that one :-)

so what exactly is the difference between a decor & a style, as they
both affect appearance of a window ?

decor seems to be the complex options (with parameters or lots of data),
	while
styles are mostly binary options (small parameters)

Why not UseStyle & CopyStyle ?

I don't see them as orthogonal concepts, anyway.


But besides all these inconsistencies & deficiencies:
fvwm2.0.44 is a lot more consistent than the previous versions.
Many changes have taken place which didn't even touch the surface.
Yet they were even more important than some of the bug fixes and added
features. Chuck has done a very good job in keeping the project running.

The reason that some things have gone global is because there aren't any
more style flags (yet).  There is a slight confusion between Style and
ButtonStyle, for example, but this is due to the flag limitation, which is
to be addressed by Chuck after version 2.1.

Many of the things you've mentioned I've been forced to think about at one
time or another during implementation, but factors which caused me to make
certain decisions include backwards compatibility, practicality, and being
able to _not_ use any of the options (most important).

> And why is there only one AddToFunc, AddToMenu, AddToDecor, but there's

Functions, menus and decors do not belong to anything.  They are only
assigned or called from other things.  In this respect, they are global.
Button/title/border styles belong to decors.

It's not entirely consisitent, but once you get the hang of it it's not
bad.  I did this since it made code a bit smaller and more convienent.
Might be something too look into after 2.1.x though -- more consolidation
of parsing.

HilightColor has always been like that, unless someone changes it.  There
has always been a lot of inconsistency and redundancy, and it won't go
:-).  Part of the problem is retaining some sense of backward
compatibility for fvwm2. 

You can't expect perfection -- no one works on this stuff full-time (also
it would take much longer :-).  These things are meant to be practical,
i.e., you write something in the RC and it operates in a particular
manner.  If you want more you could always go with gwm or something.  If I
wrote a window manager from scratch I'd probably include something close
to a Turing-complete language written in lex/yacc.

The main reason that for example ButtonStyle has become somewhat complex
is simple:  it still works with original button definitions.

> I think that somewhere there needs to be a very short overview: "Use

This is reasonable, and I think would probably be most effective.  Let me
see if I can come up with a man page section for that.  If you can, I'll
send it to you for comments.

I really didn't think there would be as much interest in this Decor stuff
when I wrote it.  It is just a feature, and you can use it or ditch it.
However, since do seem to be interested, the future is wide open.

The idea behind UseDecor is that you can make sets of window
title/button/border/windowfont/hilightcolors and assign them to any
window.  That's it.  It's a lot of stuff which does take some time getting
used to. 

I wouldn't expect anyone to understand everything in one day about decors
any more than I'd expect anyone learning everything about Emacs in 1 year. 
I wrote the Decor stuff and even I haven't learned everything about it;
I've seen examples which I've never thought of being posted recently.

Let me see if I can explain the AddButtonStyle to you a bit more.  Imagine
a stack of styles, each painted on top of one another.  If I give a
ButtonStyle command with a style in there, than it clears the stack; i.e.:

ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue

This would give me a solid blue button.  Say I wanted a pixmap over that
blue button.  Then I can say: 

AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm

And say I wanted a second left justified pixmap over that, yielding a
stack which holds three styles: 

AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left

Then, a fourth style say is added, which is the default vector button of
button 3:

AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3

Resulting in the full definition (this does the same thing for all button
states since no state is specified for any definition):

ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left
AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3

That's it.  The same is possible with TitleStyle if EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is
enabled. 

Say I wanted to use the TitleStyle for button 1 without clearing the
abutton stack:

ButtonStyle 1 -- UseTitleStyle

To get rid of UseTitleStyle

ButtonStyle 1 -- !UseTitleStyle

True, some examples are needed.  But the problem is that these things are
quite flexible, and I could give you a pretty simple example as above or a
very complex one.  I guess the key would be to get as many examples as
possible.  But someone has to make an example repository. 

It would be nice if someone could setup some sort of fvwm2 example
repository with a http inteface (seriously!). 

The main thing right now is to fix bugs; this is the only the first beta
release of the decor stuff in fvwm2 :-).

Andrew

I'm not talking about global vs. non-global things; I absolutely
understand the issues surrounding the Great Style Flag Rewrite.

I'm coming from a purely syntactic area: creating functions, menus,
etc. uses the "AddToXXX", with "+ line", while creating Styles uses a
completely different syntax of comma-separated elements.  I'm not sure I
see a reason for the distinction.

Also, I understand there's a backwards-compatibility issue: if that's
all it is perhaps we can address it that way.

Yes, but you can declare them outside of decors, too, making them global
at least in that sense.

No, I know.  I'm simply offering observations, from a "fresh"
perspective and from someone who's written a lot of little languages and
compilers (and some not so little), on things that could be improved or
currently seem inconsistent.  No blame, just commentary.

I think there's an interest in constructing RC files which adhere to
object-oriented principles, in order to make them (the RC files) more
modifiable, readable, and usable.

It seems to me that Decors and "anonymous" Styles (styles which don't
necessarily apply to a window, but are used for UseStyle operations),
together, go a long way in that direction: you create window
border/functionality "classes", then assign them to various instances of
windows.  People understand and like that idea (at least I do).

No problem Paul.  This is exactly what I was/am aiming for.  I come from
an OO background, and this is why I recently made that fix to UseStyle
so it worked :-).

At this stage however, I'm not going to have much time for anything but
bug fixes for the stuff I've contributed to fvwm2 (I need to devote much
more time to my eng. degree now -- however, sometimes you know how it is
if you suddenly think of a 'that would be cool' feature it just has to
be done :-).  If you have some time (you definately seem interested,
which is good :-), you might consider working up some solutions for
those aforementioned deficiencies and posting them to the workers list.

Later,
Andrew

	My friend has done a little perl script, which reads directories
and generates fvwm menus from them. I think you should test it too, it
could make adding programs to fvwm menus easier for installation
scripts, although debian seems already have something like this.

Also, for each file in given directory, put its name in menu and
contents as command: for example file Xterm, with a row like
exec xterm -ls & in it, will be added like
+ "Xterm"	xterm -ls &
to our menu. If file length is 0 bytes, it will be a Nop entry, also
+ ""	Nop

For each directory script first writes 
DestroyMenu dirname
AddToMenu dirname
and if there are any subdirecrories, they are traversed too, forming
a hierarchy of directories. If you want a working example, download
http://www.iki.fi/hile/fvwm2-resources/Programs.tgz, unpack it and test.

The script generates a file which some of you think is badly formed fvwm2
script, also AddtoSomething s is not on the same line with first entry.
This syntax has always worked and is cleaner & easier to read, and 
manuals don't state it were not allowed..

Script has some caveats.
  o First, it doesn't understand directories with a slash like Test/
    but leaves their name out from AddToMennu & DestroyMenu. This should
    be fixed.
  o Neither it understands directories if you give them with a dot. It
    really should try to find a name for directory instead of using dot.
  o Maybe it should look if directory entry is an executable and if it
    is, add it straight to menu without trying to read it. So we could
    say makemenus.pl /usr/local/bin and would do something sensible. 
    Thus 'normal' directory entries shouldn't be executable for anyone.
  o Ordering of directory entries is missing. My friend is a beginner with
    perl and couldn't say in which order his script handles these files.
  o Putting Nop or Title in a menu is hard.
  o Maybe we should have a syntax for dot-files in menu directory, for
    example adding .title for menu title, .sort for sorting order. These
    could go with switches too.
  
Anyway, I find it pretty useful already now and will give it for your
free testing and fixing. It's in 
http://www.iki.fi/hile/fvwm2-resources/makemenus.pl

and it is written by Viljo Viitanen <3v@iki.fi>, who gives all rights
to use, fix etc. it.

'Wait' built-in function is broken in 2.0.44 when it is used as in a
'InitFunction' or 'RestartFunction', i.e., fvwm startup. I've hacked
the fvwm soruce code, and found it is a timing problem of grabbing server.

In a patch of <9607251806.AA47041@cold.fishkill.ibm.com>, XGrabServer()
timing in main() function is changed. However, I move MyXGrabServer()
line, 'Wait' built-in function works well.

Anyway, this is a patch.

Yes, Lars Wirzenius wrote the first version of the Debian script in a
mixture of sh and awk.  I recoded it in perl.

Lars has a little documentation on the web, at:

  http://www.cs.Helsinki.FI/~wirzeniu/debian/fvwm2menu/

It's part of the standard Debian fvwm2 package, but anyone else is
most welcome to use it.  I'll post the script later, if there's a
demand.

(The change of "PrevActiveMenuX" to static is not necessary to fix the
problems, but the variable is not globally used.)

If I remember correctly, I moved that further up between 2.0.43 and
2.0.44 thinking that it might help with the startup problem (with
missing the style stuff, etc), but looking at it again right now it
probably makes little difference (since the recapture function is also
grabbing the server and that is probably where it really makes a
difference).

So, I think your patch is correct (removes my blunder).

I'll look it over some more, and I'd like to hear back from people
about whether or not this patch works for them and doesn't break
anything else.

Howdy all.

Ok, I have most of the fixes posted for 2.0.44 merged into my
development level:

       1. Patches to WindowShade stuff, from Andrew Veliath
       2. Man page corrections & updates
       3. UseStyle fixes from Andrew
       4. CleverPlacement and RandomPlacement fixes from Anthony Martin
       5. Added (De)WindowShade module msgs
       6. FvwmAudio fix (for MINI_ICON & (DE)WINDOWSHADE)
       7. FvwmAuto fixes from Albrecht
       8. DestroyDecor window shrinkage fix, from Andrew
       9. Fix to Wait command lockup (from Makoto Matushita)
       10. Fix to undocumented LEFT_MENUS stuff (from Dan Espen)
       11. Updated FvwmIconMan to Brady's latest

Should I just put out a 2.0.45 right now (i.e. without worker list
testing) to hopefully stop the FLOOD of email that will continue to
come in just about #1 and #9 alone?

Or do you want a 2.0.45-almost first?

I say let us at least test it overnight first.  Too many people think that
these are real releases.  Once 2.1.0 comes out, we can be more careless,
but if 2.0.45 doesn't compile on some bizarre system we're just going to
lose confidence.

BTW, 1200+ downloads of 2.0.44 so far.

not so ridiculous, but I'd like sth more general, or we'll soon have
hundreds of special reserved style names.


a programmer suggestion: 
implement an "if" function like the prev/next/none

or perhaps you can use sth like 

AddToFunction MyStickFunction	Stick
+	Next [windowid $w, sticky] ChangeDecor "Sticky"
+	Next [windowid $w, !sticky] ChangeDecor "Default"
	
(Chuck: this was in my 2.0.43 monster patch at some time - remember ?)

PS: I'm working on making the event mask for FvwmAuto configurable.
    This makes FvwmAuto a general hook function:

	FvwmAuto Mask timeout Enterfn LeaveFn

normal auto-raise is:
	FvwmAuto focus 300 Raise Nop

other uses:
	FvwmAuto "Iconify|Destroy|AddWindow" 0 "FvwmTile -h 10 10 90 90"
 	( re-tile, if window-layout changed )

	FvwmAuto "Raise|Lower" 0 "FvwmCascade -h 10 10 90 90"
 	( re-cascade, if stacking-order changed )
	
only problem: the event mask doesn't offer much more options.
Where do I get a "Stick Event" from ? - Do I have to parse the
ConfigureWindow Event ?  (guess so, but please confirm)

If ConfigureWindow is State-information, this wouldn't be worth the effort
- I'd have to keep the old state for every window, which is sth I really
don't like to.

Here's a bit reworked version of my patch to WindowsDesk builtin. In
addition to supporting old format (one argument), it allows specifying
new desk similarly to Desk builtin.

I prefer to use multiple desktops instead of virtual display (it
confuses some applications, and geometry specifications are more
complex). So I have:

DeskTopSize 1x1
FvwmPager 0 15
*FvwmPagerRows 4

Key Left	A	4	Desk -1 0
Key Right	A	4	Desk  1 0
Key Up		A	4	Desk -4 0
Key Down	A	4	Desk  4 0

Key Left	WSTFI	24	WindowsDesk -1 0
Key Right	WSTFI	24	WindowsDesk  1 0
Key Up		WSTFI	24	WindowsDesk -4 0
Key Down	WSTFI	24	WindowsDesk  4 0

(Modifier 4 is right control (Hyper_R), and mod2 is right alt.)


This patch is to unpatched 2.0.44.

Howdy, all.

Managed to find a (very) little time to throw together 2.0.45.
Decided to go with a quick test of 2.0.45 before sending it out.
2.0.45-almost is now at the usual place:

            ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/.test/

Just has those patches I mentioned yesterday:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.45-almost
       1. Patches to WindowShade stuff, from Andrew Veliath
       2. Man page corrections & updates
       3. UseStyle fixes from Andrew
       4. CleverPlacement and RandomPlacement fixes from Anthony Martin
       5. Added (De)WindowShade module msgs
       6. FvwmAudio fix (for MINI_ICON & (DE)WINDOWSHADE)
       7. FvwmAuto fixes from Albrecht
       8. DestroyDecor window shrinkage fix, from Andrew
       9. Fix to Wait command lockup (from Makoto Matushita)
       10. Fix to undocumented LEFT_MENUS stuff (from Dan Espen)
       11. Updated FvwmIconMan to Brady's latest
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After I get a few good reports back (and no real bad ones) I'll
release 2.0.45 and see if we can't quell a few bug reports...

I'll probably post a patch for it too, since it's small enough.  In
fact, I'll do it for y'all right now, included below (gzipped &
uuencoded), if you don't want to download the whole tar.

Thanks,
Chuck

It IS a magic number in function  HandleModuleInput. When I found this,
I just didn't think 255 was too short. Now, I see it, like you and others
mentioned.

I don't use readline but I know TAB is a problem. I thought I should
leave it to each user to configure key assignment. I agree it is better
off to change this now.

The CLICKTORAISE option effects "MouseFocus" VS "ClickToFocus".

However the difference in selection is understandably confusing and the
GlobalOpts are more appealing. I am including a patch against
"fvwm-2.0.45-almost" that changes the -DCLICKTORAISE compiletime option to
the GlobalOpts pair, MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise/MouseFocusClickRaises.

I set "MouseFocusClickRaises = False" so that the default is the old
behavior.  I updated tha fvwm2.man also.

This is indeed a problem with CC=cc. It is also true with some versions of
gcc. I have just upgraded from gcc 2.7.0 which did not have this problem to
2.7.2 which does as well as older gcc 2.6.*. In the gcc case it is not
LD_LIBRARY_PATH that gets set but rather LD_RUN_PATH, but the end result is
the same. Either of thses are supposed to get set to $(USRLIBDIR). In my
case this would be USRLIBDIR = /usr/local/X11R6/lib. Imake of corse thakes
care of this part.

The following command shows the problem with out the fix; 

ldd fvwm/fvwm2
        libXpm.so.4.3 =>   (unknown)
        libXext.so.6.0 =>  (unknown)
        libX11.so.6.0 =>   (unknown)
        libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
        libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
        libdl.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
        libintl.so.1 =>  /usr/lib/libintl.so.1
        libmp.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.1


I looked at the source to xdm and the builds on my various platforms, and
that all use a line like;
 $(CCLINK) -o $@ $(LDOPTIONS).......
with;
 CCLINK = $(CC)
automaticaly by imake for the non trivial case. 

Thus I believe the following patch to Fvwm.tmpl should be in fvwm-2.0.45.
Would the fvwm-workers please try this on their platforms, if they are not
using X11R6.

I install fvwm2 under my home dir.

I need the following diffs to Fvwm.tmpl:

This is not, I guess.
Make tries to install the man pages to obscure locations, but not to the
one I specified.

cause:
The man pages are installed under MANDIR (see last line of above patch from
Randall S. Winchester)

so _this_ should be changed instead of MANPATH (which is the search path,
with different directories, not the man-page install directory)

I swallow a xterm (actually started before fvwm) in FvwmButtons, and
that works correctly. If I quit FvwmButtons (with Close), xterm is
unswallowed, but when I kill fvwm, xterm window disapperars altogether
(but is still in process list). I have following line in .fvwmrc
(actually .fvwm/modules):

*FvwmButtons(11x2, Swallow(NoClose, NoRespawn, UseOld) "console" Nop, \
     Action "Exec xterm -C -g 80x9-0+0 -name console -n console &")

Couldn't fvwm send Close events to modules, when it exits?

Well I had not noticed this before, but playing around a bit, it looks like
the window is getting a resize sent to it which should not be happening as
an 80x24 window with one font is still an 80x24 window with another font.
The problem is also only seen when the font size increases.

If you do an ls -l in a window to fill up the screen then manualy make the
window thinner, then manualy put it back you will see similar behaviour.

If however you are in emacs or vi which understands the resize signal, every
thing gets restored after reexpanding.

I hope this provides a further hint. 

Randall

Howdy again all.

Ok, since there were some nasty bugs in 2.0.44, version 2.0.45 is now
ready to replace it, found in the usual spot:

               ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/

It is essentially just a quick bugfix version.  The rather small
ChangeLog entry:

2.0.45
       1. Patches to WindowShade stuff, from Andrew Veliath
       2. Man page corrections & updates
       3. UseStyle fixes from Andrew
       4. CleverPlacement and RandomPlacement fixes from Anthony Martin
       5. Added (De)WindowShade module msgs
       6. FvwmAudio fix (for MINI_ICON & (DE)WINDOWSHADE)
       7. FvwmAuto fixes from Albrecht
       8. DestroyDecor window shrinkage fix, from Andrew
       9. Fix to Wait command lockup (from Makoto Matushita)
       10. Fix to undocumented LEFT_MENUS stuff (from Dan Espen)
       11. Updated FvwmIconMan to Brady's latest, and made it use
           GetFdWidth instead of sysconf for portability (patch from
           Makoto Matushita)
       12. Patch to make CLICKTORAISE define be GlobalOpts
           MouseFocusClickRaises option, from Randal Winchester
       13. Fixes for problems w/ B&W visuals with new
           EXTENED_TITLESTYLE stuff, patch from Andrew
       14. WindowsDesk patch from Pekka Marjola to be able to move
           relative to current desk (now matches Desk builtin, plus
           handles old behavior)
       15. Added decor_examples in sample.fvwmrc dir, which contains a
           few examples of the new Decor/BorderStyle/TitleStyle stuff
           (from lar3ry gensch, Martin Cartwright, Paul Smith)

I would like some more stuff for the decor_examples as well, as people
come up with more.

Chuck

ps - here's gzipped uuencoded patch to go from 2.0.44 to 2.0.45, if
you don't want to download it all.  I won't always do this, but this
one is pretty small, and it might relieve some of the burden on
ftp.hpc.uh.edu.

I have to apologize for not catching this. I neglected to send in a patch to
add_window.c for:
       12. Patch to make CLICKTORAISE define be GlobalOpts
           MouseFocusClickRaises option, from Randal Winchester

****Also the credit for this should not go to me. It should be given to;
Markus Gutschke <gutschk@uni-muenster.de>

I just tried to make it easier for Chuck to put in the release...

Below is a simple patch to remove the extra new-line character when
using the "Echo" builtin function:

(I don't like the extra space in my .FVWM2-errors file:

[FVWM][Echo]:  Including file showdefs...

[FVWM][Echo]:  Including file buttons...

Okay,

The only response I got from my query was that it couldn't be done and
was a minor annoyance.  So I patched it.  I of course did not do
it in a way that is 100% proper.  I think the right way to do it would be
to make a setting in style, so you could set a type of window to remember
where the icon was placed.  But that looked complicated, so I didn't bother.

What I did was add a new compile-time flag ICONHISTORY that uses
the behavior associated with moving an icon to remember where it was
placed after it was iconified.  Also I patched the auto-find part of the code
to not place a new icon if a previous icon had been moved to that spot (even
if it was iconified).

Let me know what you think.  If this isn't the right way to do it, I appoligize
and are willing to be instructed in the proper procedures.  If this 
causes more problems then its worth, let me know that too, I have a fairly
simple setup with fvwm. (I'd love to see Andrew's setup...Considering
the number of patches and features he's added I gotta believe its the kitchen
sink desktop :-)

This patch is for fvwm-2.0.45-almost on file fvwm/icons.c  I doubt anything
changed in that file between the almost & the release.  Did it??

I see LD_RUN_PATH set as well. I always explicitly unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

This (use of CCLINK instead of CC) is a nice trick -- do older xmkmf's
generate this CCLINK as well?

Previously I was building with 

    make EXTRA_LDOPTIONS=-R/usr/local/X11R6/lib

which also works (but is more typing).

Thanks.

No.  At least my AIX X11R5 stuff doesn't, which is why I never changed
it the other times it was suggested.

Which I don't see in my X11R5 imake stuff either - I have
EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS.

I could probably try and put more stuff in the Fvwm.tmpl to handle
these under both situations though, and make generic vars
(FvwmLinkFlags or FvwmExtraLinkFlags) to deal with it.

I am the author of tkgoodstuff, which works as an fvwm2 module.  I'm thinking
about how I might get the user's mini-icons into tkgoodstuff's WindowList.  I
have not programmed Xlib stuff before.  Can anyone supply broad hints as to
what I can do (in C) with the information that the MINI_ICON packet contains?
Ultimately, I would want to end up with a tk "image"---so if you know about the
tk end of things that's what I'm really after.  But as a start it would be
useful to know what I'm getting from fvwm2.

Alternately, I could set things up so that tkgoodstuff handles the mini-icon
configuration, sending fvwm2 the "Style ... MiniIcon ..." lines.  But unless I
want to make a general on-line fvwm2 configuration tool (for which I don't have
nearly the time), it seems better to get the mini-icons from fvwm2 where 
possible. 

I've looked a bit at what FvwmIconMan does with MINI_ICON packets, but since
I can't get FvwmIconMan even to show mini-icons (despite compiling with mini-
icon support and including *FvwmIconMan*drawicons 1" in my .fvwm2rc) I don't
know if that's my best strategy.

Thanks for any advice,
Mark

I guess the title sums it up well. This is a patch to fvwm that makes the 
icons have the shaded look that is typical to NextStep. I acteded without 
shame and took most of the code from AfterStep. As with Afterstep all the 
icons need to have atleast one pixel that is of color "None". I have been 
using this patch agenst fvwm 2.0.43 for 5 months with no problems. My 
goal is to make this yet another style; I.E. shaded icons, but for now it is 
an all or nothing deal. 

If there are any questions or problems please address me and not the 
mantaner(s) of FVWM. They have enough work. 

This patch is posted on my webpage along with a screen shot.

I have just finished writing a patch to FvwmIconBox that does much the 
same as my last patch does; it makes the icons is the box the NextStep 
shaded style. In addition it moves the shading functions into the /libs/ 
area so that other functions and modules can use them. If there is any 
interest to this patch I will post it to my home page. In truth I will 
post it no matter what, but interest will speed up the process.

Second, while looking at FvwmIconBox I observed that it was using a 
structure that was similear to FvwmWindow, and it seems that if I changes 
the structure to that I could move all of the icon code out of 
/fvwm/icon.* and put it into the /lib/ area too, seeing as the code is 
otherwise identical. Just a though. Is seems that FvwmGoodstuff and 
FvwmButtons all use nearly identical code to the fvwm/icon.c code, so why 
have three nearly idencial hunks of code when we can have one piece of 
code. This is good for more than asthetics, becuase linux is sufficently 
smart to share this code (if we make a shared lib that is).

Just my thoughts,
	Ian

Looking at your Web page I saw that you also patched FvwmButtons (or
do you use Warf?) to get the AfterStep (NextStep) look. Is this patch
available anywhere?
I patched FvwmButton to put get the same look as enligtment (a pixmap 
background, or a transparant background) and I'd be very interested in
your version. Note that the need of the 'None' color in AfterStep
icons (or at least Warf) is because they ALWAYS use the Shape
extension even if it isn't needed, and Shapes functions WANT a None
color.

Hi,
	As it turnes out, I am using wharf. When you use wharf in FVWM 
there is a change is syntax. I'll just paste the relevent part of my 
.fvwm2rc file here for inspection. I am using a plain un-patched wharf. 
There is exactaly one problem (that I don't care about): you need to 
patch wharf alittle bit to make it swallow things under FVWM. Becuase I 
think swallowing things can waste memory, I don't.

Ian

Does anyone have trouble moving undecorated transient windows?

I can't seem to move my little transient windows, but can with 2.0.43 with
the same rc setup.

If you open some windows and iconify them, clever placement still avoids 
their (non-iconified) positions. This is bothersome, if the whole reason 
they were iconified was the free up space for a new application.

Ideas?

I can't duplicate this behavior.  Once I iconify a window, the next window
pops right up in its place as it should.  It seems that for some reason in
your case, the ICONIFIED flag isn't getting set.  Could you or anyone else
who sees this behavior send me your .fvwm2rc file?

Thanks.

Tony.

First a description of the problem, then a patch:

Here is wish (tcl/tk) code that behaves differently in mwm and fvwm2:

 grid [button .a -text hello]
 wm minsize . [winfo screenwidth .] 1
 wm geometry . +0+0
 update
 grid [button .c -text hello]

To translate: we open a window with a small requested width, but a big
requested minimum width.  We then add to the requested height without
changing the requested minimum width (or width for that matter).  Both
mvm and fvwm2 start by giving the window the full requested minimum
width.  What mwm does (which seems right, but I don't know the protocol)
is not to change the window's on-screen width when the requested height 
changes.  Fvwm2, however, reverts to the requested width, which is smaller
than the requested minimum.

I think the bug, if it is one, can be fixed simply by calling 
ConstrainSize in HandleConfigureRequest, as follows:

diff -u events.c~ events.c
--- events.c~   Wed Jan 22 08:37:39 1997

+  ConstrainSize(Tmp_win, &width, &height);
   SetupFrame (Tmp_win, x, y, width, height,sendEvent);
   KeepOnTop();

Thanks for any advice,
Mark

I've looked over ICCCM 2 (http://tronche.lri.fr:8000/gui/x/icccm/),
and to me it looks like there is no basis for honoring minimum sizes
in WM_NORMAL_HINTS only at initial mapping.  Cf. section 4.1.5:

  Client configure requests are interpreted by the window manager in
  the same manner as the initial window geometry mapped from the
  Withdrawn state, as described in section 4.1.2.3.

This sounds like we should honor minimum size hints in
HandleConfigureRequest.  (I think the patch I sent earlier does this.)

OK, I think I found the problem.  You were using FvwmIconBox and the
NoIcon style (although you had this commented out in the .fvwm2rc file
that you sent me, which threw me off for awhile). Whey you "iconify" a
window with this option, it doesn't really get iconified, it just gets
unmapped.  The following patch should fix it.  Let me know if you have any
problems.

how about chopping off the \n just after reading the line -
not in 1000 position where it's possibly parsed.
(also we should probably test, if it's \n, if we don't remove it right
after readln()) 

albrecht - just trying to keep the code smaller & simpler.

how about a 'distclean' or 'clobber' target, which removes the
imake-generated Makefiles ?

and 'make install' should do a make in the libs directory, since it's a
pain to always type 'make; make install'

Howdy all.

Remember that bug that was being discussed last week about the XTerm
changing fonts problem (loosing some of the screen when it resizes)?
Figured it out finially, I think.  Give the following patch a try, if

Well, tkgoodstuff depended on the min_width and min_height hints
being respected when sent to the wm.  But actually this was a hack
to get around the problem which my patch fixes.

Okay okay ;-), here is a solution to the problem with MWM button function
hints. What it does is remove the MWMButton button flag, and adds the
following, from the changed man page entries:

...  
These flags are usually used to tell fvwm which buttons should be affected
by MWM function hints. This is not done automatically since you might have
buttons bound to complex functions, for instance.

"MWMDecorMenu" should be assigned to title bar buttons which display a
menu.  The default assignment is the leftmost button.  When a window
with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this button,
it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMin" should be assigned to title bar buttons which minimize
or iconify the window.  The default assignment is the second button
over from the rightmost button.  When a window with the MWMFunctions
Style option requests not to show this button, it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMax" should be assigned to title bar buttons which maximize
the window.  The default assignment is the rightmost button.  When a
window with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this
button, it will be hidden.
...

The default setup is defined automatically for each decor as (this does
not need to be specified):
ButtonStyle 1 - MWMDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMin
ButtonStyle 2 - MWMDecorMax

But, for instance, I had two maximize buttons, 6 and 4, one minimize
button, 2, and a title menu button, 3.  I could specify the following: 

ButtonStyle All - Clear
ButtonStyle 3 - MWMDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 2 - MWMDecorMin
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax
ButtonStyle 6 - MWMDecorMax

The "Clear" special flag clears any old flags first to be safe.

The patch is named mwmbtnfuncs.diff and is located in:

I have received a request for CleverPlacement to allow for window
"avoidance factors" < 1 to use for windows that you really don't mind if
they are covered up.  In CleverPlacement there is an int variable
"avoidance_factor" that represents the avoidance factor.  The obvious
solution is to just make this variable a float.  But looking through all
of the FVWM source, I couldn't find any floats.  Is this by design or
coincidence?

If there is some reason to avoid floats, then I can just make the
avoidance factor a percentage, with normal windows = 100 and other windows
could be bigger or smaller than that.

Tony.

Hi! I hope this is an ok place to ask -- if not, I apologise in advance.

Are there still any FVWM95 developers out there anywhere? I'd like to
volunteer some time to work on/with the FVWM95 widget set thats shown on
the home page. So if anyone knows who I would talk to about that and how to
contact them, I'd really apperciate knowing that.

Thanks!

Forget the patch to CleverPlacement that I made a few days ago.  It fixes
one thing but breaks another.

It seems that some of the iconifying functions in fvwm don't set the flags
properly, and there is no way for SmartPlacement or CleverPlacement to
determine whether an icon is mapped or not.  It looks to me like the
ICON_UNMAPPED flag should be set for windows that are "iconicized" but
there is actually no visible icon.  This occurs when the NoIcon style is
used.  However, the ICON_UNMAPPED is not getting set.

I don't think that there is any way for SmartPlacement or CleverPlacement
to behave properly until this is fixed.

Could someone familiar with the iconicizing code take a look at it?

Thanks.

Tony.

I wanted to fix ugly keyboard handling with menus, almost made it but
my code was so bad that I didn't like it and began thinking of rewriting 
menus.c ... There are some changes to menus.h too. I think struct 
MenuRoot should have some additions, MenuRoot *parent and
MenuItem *selected, with which keyboard movement could be made cleanly. 
I would also like to add new functions NextItem/PrevItem etc. and change
menu redraw routine to just check where selected is pointing, thus
making int state in struct MenuItem obsolete. 

What is wrong with keyboard handling? We should only be able to move
inside menus, jump over Titles and Nops etc. This isn't easy to write
cleanly with current structure. Also I think focus should go to first
or last used entry when opening a menu. Opinions about that? Should
it be an new configuration option, maybe JumpToFirst/UseLastSelected?

I'm working with it right now, but if we don't get still a couple of betas
more before 2.1.0, it will not get ready before that.  

If someone is working with this, tell me so I don't duplicate your
work..
