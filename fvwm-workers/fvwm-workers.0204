I tried to hack that into the code, but it's totally unusable
with the pager:

 Button 1:

   To select a new viewport you have to press the button anyway.

 Button 2:

   To drag a window you have to release the button first to select
   a window or you have to push and multiple buttons.  Very
   undesirable.  Simply pushing the button on a window only raises
   it.  That's not a very useful thing to do on a different page
   or desk, and on the current viewports there are better methods
   to do that.

 Button 3:

   This is the only binding that could profit, but since the
   desktop follows the motion of the pointer, the desktop just
   jumps around to funny places.

In my eyes, it's useless for the pager.  FvwmIconMan in transient
mode could benefit, though.  But then you might be better off
using the built in WindowList.

Bye

Finally tracked down the FvwmConsole problem: The mangled input
comes from the getline() function (readline library).  Filed a bug
report there.  Other apps using readline have the same problem
(e.g. zsh).

In the directory with example scripts for FvwmScript
the example FvwmScript-buttons contains a widget
that is supposed to swallow the pager. This does not 
happen though, the pager just appears in a separate window.

problems w/ this snapshot:
(previous release used was fvwm20020326 on solaris 2.5.1)

I still see border/titlebar discrepancies sometimes.

fvwm pager, which was heavily changed between fvwm20020326 and fvwm20020401
now has the top and left edges bordered by FvwmPagerColorset foreground.

showstopper: hangs - and when hung, have seen app, fvwm or x-server being
the one using cpu.

*Please* be more detailed in you bug reports. Pretty pretty
please!  This is not helpful at all.  If there is a problem,
please describe exactly what happened and what you did when it
happened.  Screenshots might help too.  Providing a config file
won't hurt either.

I don't understand what than means.

Um, so what is hanging?  If it's the application or the X server
I don't see a relation to fvwm.  If fvwm hangs, please try to
attach a debugger to it and see where it's looping.  To do this,
either escape to the console without killing the X server or log
in from a different machine, then find out the process id with ps
and run

  $ gdb fvwm2 <process id>

Bye

In the function above the window is coming back so I want it to keep the 
focus. It wouldn't be a problem to add a FlipFocus though so changing 
the focus when the windows goeas to another desk would be OK.

I think it depends on what you want the one window list to do. For some 
purposes the most-recently-focused order is best (e.g. Alt-tab), for 
others the order of creation is best (e.g. Key F11 above). It may be 
that two lists are appropriate (same list, different linkages to get 
different order) but I like the way it is possible to order the 
windowlist with the mouse and then cycle around in a fixed order with 
the keyboard.

Does FvwmWinList still match the WindowList menu?

I think it might be better to make FlipFocus work on already focused 
windows rather than invent a new command, is this possible?

Tim.

I think this might be a bit_gravity problem. I can't get FvwmWinList to 
have a gravity of anything other than NorthWest. Does fvwm2 force this?

Yes, it's essential to reduce redraws with opaque resize.  I could
restore the bit_gravity if that helps.  But for me, the problem
begins earlier:  The FvwmWinList window does not resize at all.

< I don't see a relation to fvwm.

The 3 times i saw it hang, logging in from outside,..

the 1st time, the app (Internet Explorer) was the cpu hog.
Killing it stopped the hang.

The 2nd time, again related to IE, this time fvwm was the cpu hog.
Killing IE didnt help.

The 3rd time,  was a different app (dont remember which),
but this time X was the cpu hog.

There were window creation/dewtruction activities going on at the time of
the hangs.

The top and left inside edge of the pager borders display a line in
"FvwmPagerColorset foreground" color....something i havent seen previous
versions display. No biggie, just something i noticed. I have the color set
to yellow, so it stands out.

In IE, go to http://weather.about.com/library/blcurrnt.htm?once=true&
Page creates spam popups which FvwmEvent closes.
You may have to use the weather links a few times to trigger a popup that will hang.

Description:
	The test of items is drawn with the ActiveColorset even though
	some parts of the text are outside the active area defined by the
	ItemFormat. This means the coordinate part of the windowlist
	is unreadable for the active item.

Repeat-By:

Set colorset 0 to be black on gray
Set colorset 1 to be gray on black

I think there might be something wrong with the triangles too, the solid
active triangle is drawn in what looks like the hilight color of the
MenuColorset

Hi All,

I'm trying to compile the latest code, and am getting an EILSEQ
undefined in Ficons.c. This was in ewmh_names.c in the 3/17 snapshot.

I'm using cygwin, and don't see this define in sys/errno.h. Can someone
explain what this error code represents? Perhaps configure can check for
this in /usr/include/sys/errno and set a flag to include it if it
exists, or perhaps there is a more common error code that can be
checked?

Cheers
Dave

This is in bits/errno.h on Linux:

#if !defined _ERRNO_H && defined __need_Emath
/* This is ugly but the kernel header is not clean enough.  We must
   define only the values EDOM and ERANGE in case __need_Emath is
   defined.  The value is the same for all Linux ports.  */
# define EDOM	33	/* Math argument out of domain of function.  */
# define EILSEQ	84	/* Illegal byte sequence.  */
# define ERANGE	34	/* Math result not representable.  */
#endif /* !_ERRNO_H && __need_Emath */

Hi Dave,

Nope, its not Linux specific, I see the definitions on Solaris, HPUX,

I'm sorry, I just noticed you asked about the "bits" directory.

That value in defined in 2 subdirectories to /usr/include
on my Linux machine, bits and asm.  On each system I checked
it was in a different location, but I believe all the definitions
occurred if you included errno.h.

Yep.  If you had been on this list for a while you'd have seen
dozens of posts about xmms.

I think the bottom line is, if you grab a more current version
of xmms, it should run without complaint.

Log message:
* Added PNG support and Dominikisation of the XPM support
* PNG support and now ewmh icons use ColorLimit
* These is achieved with new libs stuff and segmentation of libs/Picture
* Use the libs to load image everywhere: no more real XPM ifdef in fvwm code
* Added XBM (and of course PNG) support to FvwmBanner and xpmroot, there
are now compiled and installed even if !XPM
* Fixed FvwmScript icon loading, compile and install it even if !XPM
* Some include clean up and links the modules against Xpm and png only
if needed, hum...
* fvwm-menus-desktop allows png image in fvwm menu
* TODO: doc, maybe ColorLimit works, alpha rendering: need discussion and
probably colorlimit works, maybe some cleanup , may be some renaming :o(

I have a problem when resizing Aviplay movie window. It looks like Aviplay
tries to resize the window itself, and then fvwm resizes it back to the
original. This goes on and on and I have to kill the window to stop it.

Moving  XMMS (1.2.5)  window is very slow. For example, when I try to drag
it two inches,  the window starts moving slowly and it takes maybe three
soconds to get where the cursor is. 
  There is also another minor problem. Those three windows, that XMMS
consists of(Main, playlist, EQ), are allways sticked when the program is
launched.

I have encountered theses problems only with fvwm2. XMMS works really
nicely with KDE.

Hi !

I have PNG installed on my RH7.2 Linux box, but configure fails checking 
png.h, with the error (from config.log):

configure:3308: checking for png.h
configure:3318: gcc -E   -lz -lm conftest.c >/dev/null 2>conftest.out
gcc: -lz: linker input file unused since linking not done
gcc: -lm: linker input file unused since linking not done
configure: failed program was:
#line 3313 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <png.h>

The problem seems to be around line 3301 of configure:
    CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -lz -lm"
Changing it to
    CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"
fixes it (but I don't know how to propagate the fix to the right place in 
configure.in, sorry ....).

I've also noticed in FvwmForm.c a double debug statement (around line 1840):

    myfprintf((stderr, "Final command[%d]: [%s]\n", k, parsed_command));
    fprintf(stderr, "Final command[%d]: [%s]\n", k, parsed_command);

I guess the second one can be safely removed.

Thanks a lot !!

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi !

from time to time (yes ... this is one of those non-easily-reproducible 
things !!), the FvwmForm panel I use to restart fvwm shows a strange 
behaviour when I click on the 'Restart' button: as usual, when I move on 
the button the pointer changes to 'hand2', and as usual, when I click on 
the button the 'hand' colors are reversed, but then nothing happens (fvwm 
is not restarted), the 'hand' colors stay reversed and I have to click on 
the button once again.

I can just guess that the click is 'eaten' somewhere between the change of 
the pointer colors and the Command in the FvwmForm panel ...

I'm using the following config for FvwmForm:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmForm-Restart: *
*FvwmForm-Restart: GrabServer
*FvwmForm-Restart: WarpPointer
*FvwmForm-Restart: Colorset 1
*FvwmForm-Restart: ItemColorset 1
*FvwmForm-Restart: Font       -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmForm-Restart: ButtonFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-11-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmForm-Restart: InputFont  -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
# begin items
*FvwmForm-Restart: Line       center
*FvwmForm-Restart: Text       "Do you really want to restart FVWM?"
*FvwmForm-Restart: Line       expand
*FvwmForm-Restart: Button     quit "Restart" ^M
*FvwmForm-Restart: Command    Restart
*FvwmForm-Restart: Button     quit "Cancel"
*FvwmForm-Restart: Command    Nop
*FvwmForm-Restart: Timeout    10 Restart "Automatic restart will occur in %% seconds."

I'm using the CVS version. I'll be happy to do tests and provide more 
informations if needed. Please CC for a faster feedback, since I'm not 
subscribed.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Could do, if desired. I wouldn't want to step on Michael Goikhman's feet,
though :-) I think he wants to maintain it now?

I don't think its the change in pointer colors,
I believe the problem was there before that.

The problem won't occur if you use "Activate on Press".

I'm not sure what causes it.

I think this is fixed now I've inverted two parameters of smr_CHECK_LIB
(defined in acinclude.m4).

Suzanne, I like your idea and may commit patches, but why I would want to
maintain it if the author may do this better? :)

It would be very nice if you may adapt it to the new decoration code.

Here my plan: fist I think that it will be cool to have alpha rendering
now that we have basic PNG support. I make a few test with the XFree XRender
extension and I think that it is the more easy way to take (and the most
fast too). So, if there is no objection I will see if it is possible
to add new libs stuff "FRenderPicture" to render image/icons all around
fvwm code (partially done with FvwmTheme).
After that if one wish it will be possible to write by hands some
replacement for the magic XRender function.

Hello,

I've a few (re)naming problems.

1 - As fvwm, XRender use Picture as its main "picture" structure.
This is currently solved by the following lines in Fft.h

#ifdef HAVE_XFT
#define Picture XRenderPicture
#include <X11/Xft/Xft.h>
#undef Picture
#define Picture Picture
#endif

Not terrible ... specially if we use XRender for alpha rendering.
So I suggest to rename the fvwm Picture structure by FvwmPicture.
And so also rename libs/Picture.{c,h}: FvwmPicture.{c,h} or
FPicture.{c,h}. Any better idea?

2 - When I split Picture into Picture and InitPicture I was not very
inspired for the name of "InitPicture" and I have still no good idea.
InitPicture contains the visual stuff init (Pvisual, Pdepth, Pcmap)
and the image path stuff and the fvwm Picture structure  (as picture
contains picture manipulation). Any suggestions for a better
name for InitPicture?

3 - Now that xpmroot support PNG (and XBM) should we rename it (with a
symbolic link from xpmroot to the new name)? If yes one may think
that fvwm-root is a good name, but I do not think so because in fvwm
"-" separated names are scripts. FvwmRoot is obviously bad, but what
about "fvwmroot" ?

If you ask me, I think every executable we install except for fvwm itself
(current fvwm2) should be prefixed with "fvwm-".  fvwm-bug, fvwm-root,
fvwm-convert-2.4. fvwm-convert-2.6, fvwm-config.

Mikhael.

The old syntax that uses asterisks is still supported.
So currently all 4 syntaxes below work:

  *FvwmIconMan: Resolution page
  *FvwmIconMan: 1 Font 7x13
  *FvwmIconMan:   transient   Resolution   global

  *FvwmIconMan: *Resolution page
  *FvwmIconMan: *1*Font 7x13
  *FvwmIconMan: *transient*Resolution   global

  *FvwmIconMan Resolution page
  *FvwmIconMan 1 Font 7x13
  *FvwmIconMan   transient   Resolution   global

  *FvwmIconMan*Resolution page
  *FvwmIconMan*1*Font 7x13
  *FvwmIconMan*transient*Resolution   global

But please use the syntax documented in the man page, the first one.

I hope I didn't break anything. I tested it, but please test too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

FPicture.{c,h} is good.

Name it after its externs, PPicture.c.

fvwm-root, I don't see why the fvwm- rule can't be used for binaries.

The original idea was to replace the 'X' with an 'F' where
appropriate (Xft -> Fft, XShape -> FShape).  If there is no chance
that we need FPicture for something different the name is good.

I agree.  Especially since there's some other tool named xpmroot
on the net.

Hi there,

I have been writing a small patch for fvwm2, which provides a build-in
command called EdgeCommand. It binds a given command to one or all pan
frames. The command is executed when the mouse enters the  pan  frame.
So  for  example one can bind the command "Raise (FvwmTaskbar)" to one
edge. What I have tested so far was quite stable. (No crashes  or  seg
faults.) 

Before I submit the  patch  I  want  to  make  sure  that  the  memory
management  is done correctly, since I am not sure if allocated memory
must be freed in case of a restart. For the  EdgeCommands  I  allocate
memory dynamically to store the command strings which will be executed
when the mouse enters the pan frame. Do I need to free this memory  in
case of a restart? If so, which function is normally used to do that? 

Thanks,

Uwe

Hi there,

I wrote a small patch which provides a  new  build-in  command  called
EdgeCommand.  Here  is  the  new  paragraph from the patched fvwm2 man
page. 

EdgeCommand [all|top|bottom|left|right [Function]]
              Binds  a  specified fvwm built-in function Function
              to an edge of the screen.  If Function  is  omitted
              the  binding  for this edge is removed. If EdgeCom
              mand is called without any argument all edge  bind
              ings are removed.

              The  binding gets active means Function is executed
              when the mouse pointer hits the specified edge. The
              binding  works  only  if  EdgeThickness is set to a
              value greater than 0. If a function is bound to  an
              edge  scrolling specified by EdgeScroll is disabled
              for this edge. It is possible to  bind  a  function
              only  to  some  edges  and  use the other edges for
              scrolling. The command  is  intended  to  raise  or
              lower  certain  windows if the mouse pointer hits a
              certain edge.  FvwmAuto can be  used  get  a  delay
              when  raising  or  lowering  windows.

Entries in ChangeLog are provided.

If someone were to read this, I think they'd be left with the
impression that these edges are on all 4 edges of the display.

These edges are only on the screen edges that are next to virtual
pages.

If this was used for raising and lowering windows, I think the
missing edges might cause a problem.

I think we own exclusive rights on xpmroot (well, Rob Nation). :)
So we may continue with it, symlinked.

It was xselection that there is on the net. But I removed it from
installation a year ago.

I adapted the checkPanFrames() function that if a command is bound  to
a  pan frame window it is always on the screen. If there is no command
bound to an edge, the virtual desk behaviour is done for this edge. So
if  one  uses  the  EdgeCommand  to bind a function to an edge the pan
frame window of this edge is always on the screen  an  will  never  be
hidden. 
 
If there is an event in one of the pan  frame  windows,  first  it  is
checked  if  a  command  is bound to this window. If so the command is
executed - if  not  the  HandlePaging()  function  which  handles  the
edge-scrolling is called. 

I did it in that way since the  patch  sould  not  touch  the  current
behaviour of the edges if EdgeCommand is not used.

OK, good.

I think safestrdup does what the new duplicateString does.

The east/west stuff and the 1 letter abbreviations aren't
documented.  You could removed the east/west stuff, I don't
think its needed.

I think there should be some mention of the additional frames
when the commands are used.

The FvwmAuto man page refers to an example in the fvwm2 man
page, but I couldn't find an example.

The function StrEquals can be used for doing compares without
worring about case.

I haven't applied the patch, I just reviewed it.

Done. I have duplicateString removed and use safestrdup instead.

This has been taken from the new function  
direction_type ParseDirectionArgument(..) 
from libs/gravity.c. Where the directions are "N", "North", "Top",
"Up", ...

What additional frames? The existing  pan  frame  windows  were  used.
Normally  without the EdgeCommand the pan frames which are on the egde
of the virtual desk were hidden. If  an  EgdeCommand  is  active  this
hidding is just avoided.

I haven't included it in my first posting but it should be in the man
page.  

> The function StrEquals can be used for doing compares without
> worring about case.

I have rewritten the function void CMD_EdgeCommand(F_CMD_ARGS) so that
the  new  function ParseDirectionArgument(..) is used. So I don't need
to worry about cases or left, west, w, .... The  "all"  direction  has
been  removed.  First I thought it might be a good idea but I think it
is not neccessary. Man page and ChangeLog has been adapted.

I second this opinion. It shouldn't matter whther something's implementation
is a script or not.

I still have to document the possible values of the direction
options.  It's just code from the ParseDirectionArgument()
function.

If you think the patch is good, please apply it.  I've a backlog
of 150 mails, so it could take some time before I get to do it.

I think it is a good time (the sooner we do this the better) to rename
our executable to fvwm. A symlink from fvwm2 to fvwm on the systems that
have symlinks will be supported for some time.

The similar thing should be done to the man page - fvwm.1. On some
uncommon systems symlinking man pages does not work, they expect the same
file name and .SH NAME, but people with such systems will use "man fvwm".

So the only presence of "2" will be in the .fvwm2rc name. This is a
subject for another thread. I want first to finish with the executable.

Any objections to move to "fvwm" executable now and not wait for 2.9.x?
This way we may remove support for fvwm2 link in 3.0.0, and people have
enough time to change their environments until then.

Regards,
Mikhael.

After the reply from Dan I did some changes on the patch.  I  use  now
the  safestrdup()  function  and  ParseDirectionArgument(). So the new
patch will be smaller and clearer (maybe faster as well).  

After this has done I had some problems while updating my  cvs  copie.
The  command  "cvs  update"  simply stopped or hung up. So I could not
create a new patch. 

Today I am going to try it again. If successful I will  send  the  new
patch to this mailing list.

Full_Name: Edward Welbourne
Version: fvwm2/2.3, fvwm/2.4.6-1

OS: Linux 2.2.19pre17; Debian 3.0
X_Server: XFree86
Submission from: (NULL) (193.69.113.22)


In the man page for fvwm2(1): 
final paragraph of DESCRIPTION, just before OPTIONS: <pre><quote>

       Other noteworthy differences between Fvwm  and  other  X11
       window  managers  are  the introduction of the SloppyFocus
       and per-window focus methods.  SloppyFocus  is  focus-fol-
       lows-mouse, but focus is not removed from windows when the
       mouse leaves a window and enters the  root  window.   When
       SloppyFocus is used as the default focus style, it is nice
       to make windows in which you do not  typically  type  into
       (xmag, xman, xgraph, xclock, xbiff, etc.).  NeverFocus, so
       that your terminal window doesn't lose  focus  unnecessar-
       ily.

</quote></pre>

Should include NeverFocus with SloppyFocus in initial summary sentence.
Uses `windows in which you ... not type into' repeating `in' usage.
Last two `sentences' aren't sentences.  Suggestion: <suggest>

Fvwm introduces some focus idioms improving greatly on other X11 
window managers.  Focus policy can be specified for individual
windows.  Windows using SloppyFocus acquire focus when the pointer
moves into them and retain focus until some other window acquires it.
The NeverFocus policy is provided for use with windows into which
one never types (e.g. [xo]clock, xbiff, xeyes, tuxeyes) - for example, if
a SloppyFocus terminal window has focus, moving the cursor over a
NeverFocus decoration window won't deprive the terminal of focus.

</suggest>

SloppyFocus rocks ;^)
Once experienced, all other focus policies <em>hurt</em>.
I've yet to try NeverFocus (new to me) but it sounds the perfect
accompaniment.

Thanks for a WM that's a pleasure to use, rather than sucking like all the
rest.
More reports when I've logged out and back in ...

      Eddy.

Hi,

here is the modified patch of EdgeCommand. As written before I changed
the  implementation  of  the function CMD_EdgeCommand and the man page
entry. The function duplicateString  has  been  removed  the  existing
function  safestrdup  is used instead. In the CMD_EdgeCommand function
there   is   no   parsing   done.   The   new   introduced    function
ParseDirectionArgument(..)  is used. This function can distinguish the
following directions strings:

...
char *optlist[] = {
                "N",  "North",     "Top",         "Up",
                "E",  "East",      "Right",       "Right",
                "S",  "South",     "Bottom",      "Down",
                "W",  "West",      "Left",        "Left",
                "NE", "NorthEast", "TopRight",    "UpRight",
                "SE", "SouthEast", "BottomRight", "DownRight",
                "SW", "SouthWest", "BottomLeft",  "DownLeft",
                "NW", "NorthWest", "TopLeft",     "UpLeft",
                NULL
        };
...

In the man page I have only documented the directions "North",  "Top",
"West",  "Left",  "South",  "Bottom",  "Right" and "East" but not "N",
"E", "S", "W", "Up", and "Down". The  later  are  not  documented  but
could  be  used. I did not want to produce to much overhead that's why
it is not documented. Maybe later there will be a section in  the  man
page  about  directions  in  general. Any other command which used the
ParseDirectionArgument(..) function could just refer to this section.

I have tested the reimplemented function again -  no  crashes  or  seg
faults.

The following patch removes the bit_gravity setting that fvwm does and 
it fixes the problem with FvwmWinList. I don't think we should be 
changing a clients bit gravity since I don't think there is a way to 
tell the client we have done so. I don't know what the ICCCM has to say 
about it.

The problem only occurs when FvwmWinList resizes itself. Is it possible 
to only force the bit gravity when fvwm is doing the resizing?

Cheers,
Tim.

Thanks for the pointer.  I have applied this change with a little
modification.

In the mean time, many other window managers have implemented
SloppyFocus too.

Hi folk,

Things have calmed down again so... I'm looking into the menu code thing
again.  I'm going to start working on separating out functions so they're
a bit cleaner and so it's easier to change the menu layout whenever we're
ready, if everyone is cool with that.

Daniel

With some minor adjustments I've applied your patch.

I noticed a coding style I never saw before:

+			if ( Scr.PanFrameTop.command != NULL ) 
+				free( Scr.PanFrameTop.command ) ;
+			Scr.PanFrameTop.command = command ; 

(the space before the semi-colon)

I removed the spaces.

A lot of the lines in the patch had trailing spaces
including the lines above.   I removed the trailing spaces.

That's a good place to start.  I already begun to split menus.c
into several files with a more limited scope, but it's hard to
accomplish cleanly.  If you have any ideas to improve the
situation your work is very welcome.

Before the actual implementation of the new menu syntax start we
have to look back at the ideas and think about the right solution.

I take this as everyone is agree or does not worry.

So I do this renaming today together with other utils/fvwm- renamings
that we agreed in the other thread.

Speak now if you have, before I change a lot of documentation, mainly
replacing fvwm2 with fvwm. :)

Since I invoke fvwm2 with a shell named fvwm2, I don't feel this
has any impact on me.

I wonder what the various distros will do, they've been distributing
fvwm1 as fvwm for a long time now.

I suppose they'll just continue, only this time fvwm2 will be the old
one.

I'm curious, what do you intend to do with the .fvwm2rc?

Perhaps they could be accomodated with:

	./configure --package-name=fvwm2
	./configure --package-name=fvwm
	./configure --package-name=SuperFvwmWithSteroidsAndCatWhiskers
	.

It is trivial to patch an ancient fvwm to produce fvwm1 executable.
But I don't really think we should encourage distributions to continue
to distribute fvwm-1.24r version.

> I'm curious, what do you intend to do with the .fvwm2rc?

To discuss this first.

My point is this. If we want others to think we have only one evolving
project, we should not use number suffixes.

I think:

1) Executable name should always be fvwm, regardless of a version.

2) The initial configuration file name should not be changed as well.

This is because version numbers have nothing magical. My guess is that
2.5.1 is much more different from 2.0.1, than 3.0.0 will be from 2.6.0.

I do think that ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc name is bad.
But it should be supported for some time, of course.

It is bad, because this is a main file, it should not be hidden.
~/.fvwm directory (or /use/share/fvwm for this purpose) is for fvwm files
only, so having .fvwm prefix is redudant. And "2".

Something like ~/.fvwm/config or ~/.fvwm/main would be ok.

I am not against (although I think it is not needed) if we introduce an
extention for fvwmrc files. I.e.: ~/.fvwm/main.fvwm or ~/.fvwm/main.fc.

Any of the suggested names above (or similar) would be good for me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

For many years now I've placed my config in .fvwm/ and invoked fvwm2
with "-f $HOME/.fvwm/main". This always made better sense to me.

Heh, look at the random quote my .sig monster found!

And I've always had a fairly simple single file ~/.fvwm2rc (and ~/.fvwmrc
before that), it makes more sense to me and I like it that way because it's
just like the rc files for my shell, XEmacs (although they are trying to
change that as well), etc.  Just my personal prefence, and I'd be a little
saddened if that method for holding the config info were no longer supported
(of course, I'd get over it pretty quickly).

I'd argue against the removing of the '2' from the names of the executable and
config files since there may be some sites that still have the "ancient"
version still lying around and I feel that it helps distinguish it for them,
but I guess it's been long enough now that those kinds of situations should be
few and far between. :)

There are several independent things.

1) ~/.fvwm directory is required. We need a search directory for fvwm
itself, FvwmM4, FvwmCpp, FvwmForm and just everything else. There are at
least 10 scripts and modules wanting to write to the home directory, they
all should write to ~/.fvwm, like FvwmAnimate, FvwmConsole, FvwmForm etc.
FvwmConsole is a current violator and should be prosecuted.

2) It is not technically rc anymore, we have a full dynamism, when there
is no separation between static rc and dynamical commands.

3) A solution for you is simple: ln -s ~/.fvwm2rc ~/.fvwm/main
Or whatever name we choose.

Removing of the '2' from everything except for executable and fvwm2rc was
decided in 1999. It is only a question of time when to complete the task.

I am not sure whether you said "yes" or "no", but it is too late. :)
I already changed "fvwm2" in your AUTHORS description to fvwm-2.0.x. :)

It was an interesting quest to find a replacement for fvwm2 (if at all)
in every single place. But it seems like a nightmare to do the same for
fvwm2rc, it is in 90 files. No way, somewhen we should do this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm unaware if it's my setup since both the functions are called the
same.  However if I click my titlebar to move a window I get snap
attraction like I'm supposed to.  But if I use my alt-click window to
move a window the snap attraction doesn't function, either to the screen
or to other windows.  I was just wondering if this is a feature or a
bug.

It is a feature, release Alt to enable snap again.

It seems that choosing Alt for this (the only unused modifier) confuses
some people, since they have Move bound to Alt-Mouse2 or similar.

I would use Shift for disabling snap, but it is used in case of keyboard.

A question to people who move and resize windows using keyboard arrows.
Do you use Shift and arrows? Can I replace the meaning of Shift and Alt?

Regards,
Mikhael.

It's a feature that is going to cause a lot of question like this as
soon as it gets included in a major release.

To get snap attraction just release the alt key while holding down the
mouse button. You can press and release the alt key to switch on/off the
snap attraction as many times as you like during a move.

I think it might be better if snap attraction were only toggled when the
alt key is toggled during a move. What I mean is that a move invoked
with the alt key down should have snap attraction on until the alt key
is released and then pressed again. That would make it more backward
compatible and still allow the feature.

Cheers,
Tim.

Oh, I understand the reasoning for it, as fvwm is not quite as simple as it
once was (another thing that saddens me slightly).  But I still use it in a
simple manner (my only module is the pager really) so I have no need for whole
directory structure initialization just yet.

Or invoke via a shell script called fvwm2 that calls 'fvwm -f ~/.fvwm2rc', or
simply give in and go to the new setup or not upgrade my installation (won't
happen, just a "for instance").  As I said, I'd get over it pretty quickly. :)

Mikhael> I am not sure whether you said "yes" or "no", but it is too late. :)

Honestly, I don't have any strong feelings on the renaming or using multiple
config files in a directory instead of a single rc file, as I'm adaptable (and
my rather simple setup probably won't be affected much)...I was just in a
wierd mood yesterday and decided to pipe up on this subject. :)

And since I believe most of the major Linux distributions have dropped fvwm
entirely to make room for more KDE and Gnome stuff (which does more than
sadden me), I doubt that they'll be affected by the name change either.

Mikhael> I already changed "fvwm2" in your AUTHORS description to

Ah, it's definitely too late then! :)

Later,

Maybe, although this is not the logic used for other modifiers + arrows.

Feel free to change it.

Hello,

my friend ( yeti@physics.muni.cz ) made a patch for fixing the bad
behaviour of czech keyboard in fvwm. He cannot write to you himself,
because he must have gone to military service :-(((
This is what ho wrote about the patch:


The patch
  + solves our problem
  + shouldn't break other things more than they are now
  - is not particularly clean
  - doesn't solve the modifier problem generally

* Czech (Slovak...) keyboard has traditionally two modes: Czech and English,
  with LShift-RShift or NumLock or something like that switching between
  them.  This introduces another modifier, ``keyoard mode'', which actually
  gets its own bit in the `state' field assigned (on our machines it happens
  to be 0x2000, but I don't know how deterministic is it).  This modifier
  doesn't really modify anything and should be completely ignored.

* Generally, it doesn't make sense to keep any modifiers which are not in
  ALL_MODIFIERS (fvwm-2.2 did it approximately this way), however, fvwm-2.4
  keeps them all and ignores only explicitely specified (known) modifiers
  (why?).

* Originally I thought mere adding `|~ALL_MODIFIERS' to `mods_unused' (i.e.
  setting all bits corresponding to should-be-ignored modifiers) would
  solve the problem, but it generated a HUGE number of following errors:

    [FVWM][<<ERROR>>]: FvwmErrorHandler *** internal error ***
    [FVWM][<<ERROR>>]: FvwmErrorHandler Request 33, Error 2, EventType: 20

  I don't understand why, but I didn't tried very hard to.

* At last, I modified CheckBinding() because it works, though it's probably
  quite dirty.  The fact I can't just modify `mods_unused' means either I'm
  completely wrong, or I don't understand all its uses, or there something
  broken in fvwm.

  I kept MatchBindingExactly() intact because it's never used (and maybe
could
  be completely removed).

* I can't check whether it breaks something with other strange national
  keyboards because I don't use them.

As usual after adding a directory, manually rerun automake (to create
bin/Makefile.in) and ./configure (to create bin/Makefile).

I also suggest to clean up utils/ from old auto-generated files:

  % cd utils
  % find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name Makefile -exec rm {} \;
  % cvs update

Mikhael.

Yep, but so the F is not really needed? So I think that:

PictureCommon (the depth, visual, ..., the FvwmPicture structure, path stuff,
               it is at present time InitPicture)
Picture       (elementary FvwmPicture manimulation)
PictureImageLoader (image loading, at the present time FImageLoader)
PictureGraphics    (rendering Picture or set of Pixmaps: a set of warpers
                    for XCopyArea, XFillRectangle and XRenderComposite;
                    on my machine  only :o), 

or the same with a F as prefix?

Because accoridung to the spec there are no other modifiers than
Lock, Shift, Meta and 1 to 5.

Don't fiddle with the unused modifiers.  Fvwm tries to grab each
combination of unused modifiers.  E.g. if Caps-Lock and Num-Lock
are ignored and you issue

  key f1 a n bla

fvwm grabs (no modifiers), (caps-lock), (num-lock) and (num-lock +
caps-lock).  If you add another 24 bits to the unused modifiers,
fvwm tries to grab 2^26 combinations of modifiers.  Most of them
do not exist, hence the error messages.

No, that is a good solution, but it may be incomplete.  It is
never wrong to 'and' with ALL_MODIFIERS anywhere.  There may be
more places that should have a similar patch applied.

Actually the name of the package is not changed, it is set to "fvwm" in
configure since cvs was started in 2.1.0, so we have fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz.

I think what you suggest is a good idea, but first we should give some
time for people to update their setups. For example, I choose all 37 man
pages from a menu (well, this is in fvwm-themes); FvwmScript-Setup95 does
the same thing, it is patched to use "man fvwm", but existing users would
stay without the man page unless it is symlinked.

Another idea is to copy a man page, but add a WARNING at the top of the
copied version saying "to get rid of this warning, use the real man page".
I may do either thing for 2.6.0.

Hi All,
	Is it time to move the colorset handling from FvwmTheme to fvwm? What I'm 
thinking of is:

*) copy most of modules/FvwmTheme/FvwmTheme.c to fvwm/colorset.c
*) new command Colorset that calls fvwm/colorset.c
*) new command ReadWriteColors to replace *FvwmThemeReadWriteColors
*) a very simple replacement for FvwmTheme that just turns config lines
    into Colorset commands and prints a warning.
*) strip out every color type command from fvwm and all the modules

Advantages:
*) Much less code in the modules for color handling so less bugs
*) Smaller man pages for the modules
*) Initializing colorset 0 to black/white with a stipled pixmap
    background will enable monochrome monitors to have a 3d look and we
    can lose all the "if (Pdepth < 2)" code
*) by default fvwm and the modules won't alloc any color cells

Disadvantages:
*) lots of configs would break but the result would just be that
    everything uses colorset 0 so it would just look a bit boring.

Cheers,
Tim.

Actually moving the FvwmTheme code and replacing it with a pass-through
module was on my todo list, near the top. But if you may do it, fine.
I didn't plan to break any existing configs at this stage though.

We should also add DeleteColorset somewhen to emulate DestroyModuleConfig.

I don't know. I think this is 2 independent tasks.

FvwmTheme may be obsoleted now without anyone noticing, but maybe removing
non colorset color functionality may be done after 2.6.x, i.e. in 2.9.x?

The main problem here is still TitleStyle, ButtonStyle, BorderStyle.

I am not sure about the last 2 advantages, maybe I don't understand it,
but monochrome monitors don't really need to dictate the (ugly) default.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There are problems with deleting colorsets that modules may be using 
since they share the resources rather than copy them. Would it be 
acceptable for DeleteColorset to reset the colorset to a simple default 
rather than really delete it?

OK, I just thought that now might be a good time since we've just 
changed fvwm2 to fvwm.

Yes, I don't know what to do about these. I think these things are too 
complex at the moment what with add..style and decors.

>I am not sure about the last 2 advantages, maybe I don't understand it,

There are lots of instances of code that only get used on monochrome 
monitors, do a grep for Pdepth and count the number of "if (Pdepth < 
2)"s. If fvwm's default colorset worked well on monochrome monitors we 
could remove all this code.

The other point about not alloc'ing any color cells will only help users 
on PseudoColor displays. It means that fvwm would by default only alloc 
black and white. These are always there on PseudoColor displays so fvwm 
would not reduce the number of color cells available.

Cheers,
Tim.

What else could be done?  The few bytes of wasted memory for the
structure are irrelevant if the pixmaps are freed.

I'd rather leave the big changes for 3.0.  Maybe we should make
the 2.6 release in about half a year (I mean the release date, not
the feature freeze).

Yes, that would be a big step in the right direction.

Of course, this is a good thing, my point is that it may be better.
I don't like to have stippled black-white background on color monitors.

Why not to have one "if (Pdepth < 2)" when defining colorset 0 or any
unused/deleted colorset? The default for normal depths could be as it is
now, 4 colors: black on rgb:be/be/be and its shadow/hilight.

Mikhael.

OK here's a patch that does the following:

    * Replaces FvwmTheme with a dummy module that just sends the
      Colorset and ReadWriteColors commands to fvwm
    * Adds the new commands Colorset and ReadWriteColors to fvwm
    * Initializes colorsets to black on gray for color screens and black
      on white for mono

There's two files attached as well that need to go in the fvwm 
directory. I haven't updated any man pages, could someone else do this 
please?

Cheers,
Tim.

Ok, I will apply this patch, but will replace FVWMTHEME_PRIVATE with
FVWM_COLORSET_PRIVATE and use the TAB-based indentation for new files.

I will do this later. First I should document perllib and FvwmPerl.

There seems to be a error in the configure script regarding its checks
for perl (snap-20020416) - I'm attaching a patch (so that the lines
don't get wrapped) that corrects that error and realigns that code
fragment for better readability.

It seems that you removed "!" and didn't change anything else.
Please never patch configure. :) Patch configure.in instead.

You are right about "!", I will apply this fix (a bit improved):

-if test ! -z "$PERL";
+if test -z "$PERL" -o ! -e "$PERL"; then

I hope this is portable, I am not sure -x is portable regarding symlinks.

Mikhael.

Everything seems to work ok, except for this problem.

Gradients when Colorset is defined for the first time look a bit like
transparent, but when defined more and more produce random colors and
there is an error message:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 56, Error 13, EventType: 0
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 13, EventType: 0

(EventType may be 19.)

Tim, can you please take a look at this?

Regards,
Mikhael.

tempnam() may use $TMPDIR.  If that directory is writable by other users,
a temporary file may be created insecurely.  I'm attaching a simple patch
that also uses getpwuid() more carefully, and looks at $HOME as the
fvwm2.1
man page describes.

Note 1:  The patch compiles, but I haven't tested it because I don't use
session management.

Note 2:  The man page doesn't mention TMPDIR, maybe this should be fixed
as well.

Note 3:  FvwmCpp.c and FvwmM4.c also create temporary files, but with mode
0644.  I think this should be changed to 0600.

Szenario: netscape uses a private colormap.  A transient window is opened
(e.g. the "Find" dialog with Alt+F), also with a private colormap.  This
new window gets the focus even if the pointer (FocusFollowsMouse) is not
inside it.  Esc is pressed to close the transient window.

Case 1: Pointer is in the transient window: no problem.

Case 2: Pointer is outside the transient window, but inside the main
netscape
window: The colormap of the main window won't be restored properly, even
though it gets the focus and the pointer is inside it.

Wasn't it planned to make the new code complatible with the old

Yes, I don't know what's gone wrong. The differences between FvwmTheme.c 
and colorset.c are fairly minor and I didn't have a problem with a 
TrueColor display. I've switched to a PseudoColor and things are going 
wrong. Things that have changed are:

    * The error handler, it used to core dump on just a few and was
      silent on the rest, now it prints a message
    * The cleanup routine that is used after a colorset pixmap is
      changed, it used to wait for a period of inactivity before
      deleting it, now it just waits 3 seconds for the change.

Neither of these should have broken things badly, is it possible to get 
an equivalnce check between the current colorset.c and the one I sent 
in? I don't think the reformatting could have broken anything.

Cheers,
Tim.

I just replaced the colorset.c in cvs with the one you sent (changing
s/FVWMTHEME_PRIVATE/FVWM_COLORSET_PRIVATE/) and I get exectly the same
results as mentioned in my other message with my depth 24, 16 and even 8.

Everything works for me except for gradients. Well, this means most of
fvwm-themes colors@ work except for colors@luthien that uses VGradient.

I may suggest to temporarily comment out all *FvwmTheme ... VGradient.
Or you say anything else except for gradients are broken too?

Regards,
Mikhael.

No, that's not my problem.  I fell for the renamed executable.  I
still started fvwm2 in my .xinitrc.  Once I changed that,
everything works fine here.

This problem can't happen if a user uses "make install". The old fvwm2
is replaced with a symlink pointed to fvwm, so running fvwm2 is safe.

No, with the correct executable, everything works fine, even the
gradients you mentioned.

I think these are being caused by parse_colorset() using a GC that has 
not been created. I just assumed that Scr.MonoGC would be OK. Here's a 
patch that makes parse_colorset() create it's own mono GC. It also 
includes a debug message that you should see excatly once

There is a problem with ReadWriteColors on a PseudoColor display, 
attached is a patch. I could not get the above errors to appear and I 
get no errors unless I run out of colors. Even then things work OK.

I'll try to get mono to have a pixmap tomorrow.

Cheers,
Tim.

Unfortunately this patch does not change anything for me, so I suppose
it should not be applied.

I can't reproduce this problem with any simple config, including the
original Dominik's one. However, the problem is fully reproducible
using fvwm-themes.

I even got core dump when changed one Plain colorset to gradient.
This happens when I change colorset 10 in colors@migo to this:

  Colorset 10 DGradient 100 2 yellow 1 green 1 navy

But I can't get a core dump trace (I don't know why it is empty).

I tried to debug this problem, but something strange happens.
The depth (8, 16, 24) does not matter. Simple configs seem to work ok.

Please someone confirm or deny these 2 problems with fvwm-themes:

  1) gradients do not work (they produce 4 error lines above)
  2) core dump when changing one line in colors@migo

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, I am applying both patches, you will decide whether the first one is
needed. I leave a debug message for now.

Mikhael/Olivier, I downloaded a recent snapshot (20020416) to test
out the Bidi code that was recently added.  I compiled with fribidi;
everything went smoothly - configure noted,

  With Bi-directional text support?   yes

yet I'm not sure how to go about displaying a window title in Arabic.
I tried the following,

  Using a 10646 font (its used successful in many other applications),
  I defined the following entries in my fvwm2rc file,

  Style * Font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-full10x20-1

  AddToMenu arabic-test
  + "Arabic" Title 
  + "ar-test"    Exec exec xterm -title ? -e rsh otho &
  + "?"  Exec exec xterm -title test -e rsh otho &

  In my .xinitrc prior to starting fvwm2, I 'xset fp+ my_10646_font_file',
  I then start fvwm2; I invoke that "ar-test" entry, the xterm appears,
  but the title is NOT displayed in arabic.  The menu entry is not noted
  in Arabic either.  Do note that the environment is set so that I can use
  other applications that require the Bidi library and the 10646 font (so
  they're very much loaded - I hope I don't need to muck with locales and
  such :-)

What am I missing (and/or doing wrong).  The documentation (fvwm.1)
along the lines of usage are somewhat lacking and so I'm wondering
if you could give me some snippets of things that have worked for ya
(ie. some guidance).

Regards,

 - Nadim

I don't know how to tell fvwm that the encoding is utf8; using *-10646-1
font is not enough. Setting $LC_CTYPE to, say, ar_JO.utf8 does not work.
I suppose Olivier knows.

I only tested 8-bit encodings, iso8859-6 and iso8859-8.

Do the following. Install iso8859-6.8x fonts from:

  http://www.langbox.com/bidimozilla/fontXFE/

Do the same with iso8859-6 fonts in old/ subdirectory.
Run xmessage from a script (if 8-bit chars can't be typed in your shell):

  xmessage -name "a)  - ,  " "this message is not really important, just long enough"

I don't know what the string means, I copied it from some web site.
Do the following:

  Style Xmessage Font *-iso8859-6     # Bidi applied, visual Arabic
  Style Xmessage Font *-iso8859-6.8x  # Bidi not applied, logical Arabic

The same with Hebrew:

  xmessage -name "a)  " "this message is not really important"
  Style Xmessage Font *-iso8859-8     # Bidi applied, visual Hebrew

I tried to add now iso8859-6.8x as bidi-enabled in libs/FlocaleCharset.h,
but it failed. I tried all cases including "iso8859-6.8x" (what fonts.dir
says), "iso8859-6.8X" (what pcf says), "iso-8859-6.8X" (what url says),
nothing works. Olivier, what should be done?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I still don't use fvwm-themes but I can confirm core dumps at least a
few times.  However only if the config file contains the gradients, if I
use FvwmConsole to dump in the colorsets I get same errors, and the
gradients are changed, but they are not really gradients, more random
color masks.  Also works the same if I use *FvwmTheme: Colorset.

Well, if you want to get the maximal performance you should do some
benchmarks that are machine dependent.

My guess is that calling many shell utilities (read: many processes) is
sometimes more expensive than one perl script doing the work.

Moreover in pre-2.5.1 you may embed perl in fvwmrc without any additional
processes to be called at all. You should only start FvwmPerl once and do
'SendToModule FvwmPerl eval perl-code' as many times as you want.
The line size limit is not important since you may store the state between
different calls to FvwmPerl. So you may have in .fvwm2rc the following:

  # All these commands may be called either in StartFunction or outside
  Module FvwmPerl

  # find all background pixmaps for a later use
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $a = $ENV{HOME} . "/bg"; opendir DIR, $a; @b = grep { /xpm$/ } readdir(DIR); closedir DIR
  ...
  # build a menu of background pixmaps
  AddToMenu MyBackgrounds "My Backgrounds" Title
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval foreach $b (@b) { command("AddToMenu MyBackgrounds '$b' Exec exec xpmroot $a/$b") }
  ...
  # choose a random background to load on start-up
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval command("AddToFunc InitFunction + I Exec exec xpmroot $a/" . $b[int(random(@b))])

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does this operate synchronously? One of the main reasons I use PipeRead 
is to do maths in fvwm functions i.e.:

PipeRead "bash -c 'echo some_fvwm_function $(($w * 10))'"

which will call some function with the windowid times 10.  If FvwmPerl 
could do this it would be very useful to me (even though I'd have to 
learn perl first :-\ )

Cheers,
Tim.

Repeat-By:
	Arrange for a shell script to update an FvwmButtons title every second
	via FvwmCommand.
	Tear off a menu.
	Put the mouse over then torn off menu item.
	Look at the button which should be updating.
	Move the pointer off.
	Watch the button catch up with the updates.

Another patch that fixes my problems. It was due to running out of 
colors on 8bit while having ReadWriteColors turned on.

This patch also initializes monochrome pixmaps to have a gray 
background. It does three types for colorsets 0, 1 & 2 and then repeats 
for any more. These pixmaps correspond to the ones fvwm uses by default 
in mono for normal, focused and sticky windows. If modules are to use 
them the colorsets the modules use must be referred to by fvwm before 
the module starts e.g. put "Colorset 2" in the StartFunction before the 
modules are started.

This probably won't fix your problems, if it doesn't you should be able 
to get a core dump by starting fvwm with the -debug flag to get 
synchronous behaviour and then putting "abort();" in the error handler 
routine (fvwm.c line 1762).

Hope this helps,
Tim.

Yes, that's by design of the tear off menu code.  I have no idea
what to do about it (other that creating a separate instance of
fvwm for each tear off menu).

Why can't the menu code be in a module?

To retain compatibility, there could be commands like this:

OnCommand Popup       SendToModule FvwmMenu P $*
OnCommand Menu        SendToModule FvwmMenu M $*
OnCommand AddToMenu   SendToModule FvwmMenu A $*
OnCommand DestroyMenu SendToModule FvwmMenu D $*

# Make "SendToModule Module" load FvwmMenu,
LoadOnDemand FvwmMenu


The first time fvwm encountered a "SendToModule" for a LoadOnDemand
module, it would load it.  As long as the module stays loaded,
the menus should be fast enough.

It is not synchronous currently. Sometimes you may like to do the work in
parallel with fvwm. I will solve this problem, but I want to do it in the
perl library, so it may take some time to do this properly. Also, I see at
least 5 different ways to specify this in the FvwmPerl syntax (using new
messages, config options, command line options, perl functions in "eval"
to turn synchronization on and off dynamically).

> (even though I'd have to learn perl first :-\ )

I learned it 7 years ago using man pages. You may start with perlsyn(1),
perlop(1), perldata(1) and then continue with perlfunc(1), perlvar(1),
perlmod(1) and other 150 supplied man pages. :)

And of course, one of the ways to learn perl is to patch FvwmPerl.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I learned it the same way, although I did borrow someone's Camel
book for a few hours once.

I'd just like to add, that I think the effort is entirely worthwhile.

Lately I've been using GtkPerl.  Its pretty neat.

I upgraded my gcc and gdb and now I get non-empty stack traces.
So I may send any stack trace.

But I think you may reproduce this error

  [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
  [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 56, Error 13, EventType: 0

using this minimal config (fvwm -f colorset-bug):

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme
  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg black, bg gray50, VGradient 30 gray40 gray60

You may switch these lines - the same result.

Now, if you remove a comma after "black" or remove fg and bg parts
altogether you get core dump. I think this is because image is NULL in
line 586 of colorset.c.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.206.232)


It would be nice if there were an option called ResizeUnshades such that
when a window is shaded and the user resizes it the window becomes
automatically unshaded so that when the mouse button is released
the whole window is visible once again.

Thanks,

Neil

Subject: FvwmIconMan - "custom" sorting
To: fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

I added support to FvwmIconMan for a "custom" sort type, so you can do
stuff like this:

*FvwmIconMan*sort		custom
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		0 class=XTerm title=special
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		1 class=XTerm
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		2 class=Emacs title=hacking
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		3 class=Emacs
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		4 class=TkRat
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		5 class=Mozilla-bin
*FvwmIconMan*customsort		99

Now xterm windows with the title "special" go at the top, followed by
all other xterms, etc.  The customsort option supports resource, class,
title, and icon (just like show/dontshow).

If this sounds useful, I'll be happy to post the patch.  (It's against
2.4.7, not 2.5.x - sorry.)

- Derek

Of course menus *can* be a module.  It's just that the menu code
was not written to run independently of fvwm and is thus
interwoven tightly with fvwm's data structures.  Well, and as long
as menus grab the pointer and the keyboard, processing module
messages is pointless since the funtion execution code needs (?)
to grab the pointer too.

You don't need a new option to do this.  Use this function:

  AddToFunc ResizeUnshade
  + I WindowShade off
  + I Resize $*

Now, replace "Resize" with "ResizeUnshade" whereever you need it.

It sounds useful, but we still need the patch for the latest
development verstion.  You can download a snapshot or access CVS
via anonymous ftp from our web site.  The changes you have to do
should be small - we didn't change FvwmIconMan much since 2.4.7.

After the latest Olivier commits, these problems are solved.
Gradients now fully work with fvwm-themes.

I would like to know what was the problem and when it was introduced?

Technically, wouldn't that be "Weighted Sorting?"  The numbers appear to
be weights.

Form the ChangeLog:

* fvwm/colorset.c (parse_colorset):
Use the Scr.NoFocusWin as main window in the place of the Scr.SizeWindow,
this fix a lot of X errors in my machine.

I do not think the use of the SizeWindow was correct, it causes problem
when you create the static gc in parse_colorset. If you take a look
at the code the SizeWindow is created after the config file is read.
Also, since a long times it is the  Scr.NoFocusWin which is used for
loading FvwmPicture, so I used the Scr.NoFocusWin (which is created
as soon as possible with the good parameters) and I saw no more
FvwmErrorHandler error ... so I think the change is good :o)

I guess "weights" is a reasonable term.  I was just calling them
"indexes" in the code.  I could change it to something like:

*FvwmIconMan*sort		weighted
*FvwmIconMan*sortweight		0 class=XTerm title=special
...

I'll grab the code from CVS as soon as I have time, and then post a
patch.

We did not release 2.5.x for a long time. I think we should release 2.5.1
in a week or so, since the new window decoration code works well now.
Basically everything seems to work now except for TitleStyle MultiPixmap
and ButtonStyle Solid.

Suzanne, can you please estimate the amount of work needed?
Should we release 2.5.1 with or without working TitleStyle MultiPixmap?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't think I understand the point about the grab.
Its OK for menus to freeze FVWM so the grab should be OK.

I think putting the menu code in a module might simplify tear
off menus.  I'm not sure of all the details but it just seems
like it might.  Perhaps another copy of the menu module could be
started to handle the torn off menu (without grabs once its torn
off).

I think it might have a beneficial effect on memory use too.
More of the menu logic might swap out while the menus are not
in use.

Hmm....I guess I finally need to learn how to use CVS :-)

I'll take a look at it and try to get a response back on this tonight.

Hmm...I'm having a hard time getting the latest snapshot to compile. Maybe
I should go All The Way to current CVS.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to get the titlebars working again, but I'll
give it a shot and probably let you guys know within a few days if I can
manage it.

Sorry, that was my fault. My fvwmrc defines the colorsets as part of the 
start function so I couldn't see the problem.

Me too. Does this mean the mono gc in colorsets.c isn't needed? If not 
it could use Scr.MonoGC.

Is there anyone out there with a monochrome monitor that can test it?

When any client grabs the pointer, fvwm basically stops processing
most module messages too, at least if modules call complex
functions.

Fvwm menus need to grab the keyboard to work properly.  Pure mouse
oparable menus would be useless to me.

You can run XNest in monochrome mode.  The X server has to support
a monochrome visual though.  Currently, I can't get it running
again.

  Xnest -full -sync -depth 1 :1

I would have fixed the solid button style already if somebody told
me what was broken.  I tried it and it works fine for me.  I need
a config example.

  TitleStyle      Inactive Solid darkcyan
  ButtonStyle All Inactive Solid navy

Let's analize using facts, not conjectures. :)

  % make clean >/dev/null; time make install >/dev/null
  Stat: User      System  Total time      CPU     Swaps   Page faults
  Time: 396.980   37.170  7:14.38         99.9%   0       636041/486483

  % make clean >/dev/null; time make >/dev/null
  Stat: User      System  Total time      CPU     Swaps   Page faults
  Time: 387.930   32.250  7:00.36         99.9%   0       493534/429114

I have 3 (actually more) cvs trees, in /data/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.x,
/data/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.x and /data/cvs/fvwm/fvwm, configured to install
everything to prefix /opt/fvwm-2.2, /opt/fvwm-2.4 and /opt/fvwm.
I have write permissions to all these directories.

Now I do the following:

  % cd /data/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.x
  % cvs update  # or change sources
  % make install
  % FvwmCommand 'Restart /opt/fvwm-2.4/bin/fvwm -f ...'

  % cd /data/cvs/fvwm/fvwm
  % cvs update  # or change sources
  % make install
  % FvwmCommand 'Restart /opt/fvwm/bin/fvwm -f ...'

This only rebuilds what was changed.
Please explain how your script does the same.

Moreover, I actually restart to /opt/fvwm-2.4/bin/fvwm-themes-start and
/opt/fvwm/bin/fvwm-themes-start; and fvwm-themes expects a full fvwm
installation to work correctly (scripts, modules, data files).

So, it seems you save 10 seconds from several minutes, but lose
some convenience and, that is more important, correctness.

But I will not try to convince you anymore. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I'd never call make install to build the sources since I
don't always get them installed and I'd have to take care what
command I actually issue.  Usually I press ctrl-alt-left to get to
the shell from the xemacs window, the 'm' <up> <return>.  That
does not work if there are several commands beginning with 'm'
that I use frequently.  Therefore, I would use make install only
when I want to install the sources, forcing me to traverse through
the make tree once again.

  $ make

In fvwm (via FvwmButtons action):

  Restart /home/luthien/bin/restartfvwm

In restartfvwm:

  ~/bin/fvwminstall
  exec ~/bin/fvwm2 $*

In fvwminstall:

  rm ~/bin/fvwm2
  cp $SRCDIR/fvwm/fvwm/fvwm2 ~/bin
  (same for all executables, optionally man pages and utils)

No, I actually win convenience because fvwm is reinstalled and
restarted in no time at all and I don't have to think about what I
am doing.  I can start thinking if something goes wrong (usually
due to changes in the module interface or the FvwmWindow
structure).  Oh, and don't forget that I can run configure without
any options, no matter what I'm installing.  I agree about the
correctnass, but since this is a problem in a bout one of thousand
installations I can live with that.

Personally, I think "make install" is only good for one time
installations, not for regular work.

I don't believe a word ;-)

I'd say without. I've just started playing with CVS and I'm mystified as
to why it's not working. I don't know if I'll figure it out in time for
the next release.

(BTW, you guys aware that fvwm doesn't compile with ----disable-multibyte?)

Strange, when I first learned cvs using http://fvwm.org/cvs.html
it worked from the first time for me. :)

Now when you reported, yes. There is one missing #if and one warning
in Flocale.c, I may fix it.

Now that multibyte support works nicely, itn't it time to remove

I know that, but don't see that as a problem.  We want FVWM
to freeze when a menu is popped up.

I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time.  Maybe I don't understand what
a tear off menu is.  I thought it was like one of those Openwin
menus that you use a pushpin to make it stay visible.

If I'm on the right track, then I think the menu would have to release
the grab once the menu is torn off.  What I thought would happen
is the menu code would send a description of the menu to another
module and the module would create a normal window that looked
like the menu except that FVWM could reparent it, and if desired
frame, title and do other good things to it.

At that point the menu could be operated with the keyboard
or the mouse just like any other window.
(Using  enter, leave, keypress events and the like.)
It could still popup a submenu with a grab, but you wouldn't need
a grab for the torn off menu itself.

It seems that there is two problems here.
- Displaying  string with a core *-iso10646-1 font: at the present
time this should work only with fvwm compiled with MB support, an utf8
locale and a libc that support utf8 locale (also X should reconize
the locale as an utf locale: see /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/loacle.alias).
Unfortunately, I cannot test this as my libc does not support utf8
locale. Mikhael, can you confirm that this work?
- To apply bidi fvwm should reconize a core *-10646-1 font, I think
that fvwm fail to do this because I think that the default charset
with the utf8 XFree-4 locale is iso8859-1. This may be fixed after
a confirmation that the first point work.

I will see if we can implement the use of core *-iso10646-1 font
without all the above requirement (but with XFree-4).

On the other hands, I think that with a true type iso10646-1
font there is no problem (needs XFree-4.x, x>=1 and iso10646-1
ttf with arabic/hebrew/persian characters to see bidi in work)

Hum ..., do you try to add the line
	CT_ENTRY("ISO8859-6.8X",       iso8859_6,           "ISO8859-6")
at the end of the FlocaleCharsetTable[] initialization (around line 338
of libs/FlocaleCharset.h)?

What is the difference between ISO8859-6 and ISO8859-6.8X ?

Yes, I think it safe to use Scr.MonoGC for the mono gc. I will do
the change soon with adding XBM support to colorset.

Just remember that the Scr.MonoGC is supposed to have some members
(like tiling/stippling) set to specific values.  If these are
changed, the original values have to be restored after use.

That's an *excellent* idea.  The colorset code is also the right
place to implement pixmap rotation and/or mirroring if we want to
go this way.

Nonsense.

Exactly.  They are sometimes called pin up menus.  I expect that
torn off menus behave as any other application window does.  This
is very difficult to do if the torn off menus are handled directly
in the fvwm code.

Well, it does release the grabs.  But as it is now, whenever the
pointer enters a tear off menu, fvwm makes the grabs again.  As
long as fvwm is in the menu loop it doesn't really matter if the
grabs are made or not - it can't handle module input anyway in
that code.

Yes, I agree.  In theory this sounds all very good.  It's only
that the menu code is woven into the fvwm framework so tightly
that it's very hard to separate it and put it into a module.  I
don't like the idea of duplicationg the complete menu code
either.  I'm open to any ideas how to do this.

I'm not sure what you mean by "loading the 10646 font", but you can
download the non-truncated 10x20 font using the link(s) below,

  http://www.arabeyes.org/download/external/vim/10x20.bdf.gz
   -or-
  http://www.arabeyes.org/download/external/vim/10x21.pcf.Z

Note: the internal names of the fonts within the files might differ,
      please check 'mkfontdir' output (fonts.dir) for appropriate
      names -- if you have problems, don't hesitate to let me know.

Well, I'm not sure why all that is needed (I'm simply trying to display
a few glyphs not alter my keyboard mapping, or specify date/currency
settings, etc).  By the way, I'm able to use multiple Arabic-enabled
utilities without having to touch any of what is noted above (locales,
libc support, etc) given the availability of the fonts and a rendering
engine (glyph displayer) and Bidi (fribidi) - one such application is
vim-6.0/6.1.

On the same related-topic what about those that are not running linux
per se, but are using various unix flavors (at work, for instance, I'm
on a Sparc Solaris (SunOS-5.7)).

Thanks & let me know if you need more info.

Hmm, not yet.

My glibc-2.2.90 does not support utf8 locales (I don't know how .90 is
possible if the latest is 2.2.5).

I upgraded to glibc-2.2.5. This broke all my programs that use atexit(),
I don't know why they did it. Anyway, glibc-2.2.5 supports utf8 locales.

XFree86-4.1.0 does not seem to support utf8 locales, at least I added
as you suggested these lines to locale.alias, it does not work.

  ar_JO.utf8   ar_JO.UTF-8
  en_US.utf8   en_US.UTF-8
  he_IL.utf8   he_IL.UTF-8
  ru_RU.utf8   ru_RU.UTF-8

So I upgraded X to XFree86-4.2.0. The same result.
Xlib does not support locale en_US.utf8. Ideas?

I tried to extend the iso8859_6 definition instead. Now it works.

I don't know. Probably there were a revision of a charset specification.
I am still waiting for a confirmation that bidi works correctly for both.

Ok, changes to locale.alias do not work, but if I use the locales from the
right column, both glibc and Xlib support them.

I am now experimenting, the main problem is that I don't have true unicode
fonts, specifying "*-iso10646-1" gives some subset.

I also get this behaviour. When running with LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 and I
specify incorrect font, it may wait several seconds. Error messages are
not polished. I will try to improve them a bit later.

*-iso8859-1 font gives this: "*T*i*t*l*e" where "*" is empty square, while
*-iso8859-N (where N is from 2 to 15) shows it right: "Title". Why is it?

When I use:

  Style * Font "xft:Luxi Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso10646-1"

only latin is displayed, but I can see where are spaces and see that Bidi
is applied to Arabic/Hebrew in utf8.

I use this app for testing (where ar_JO may be replaced by he_IL, ru_RU):

  xmessage -name "`env LANG=ar_JO.UTF-8 date '+%a %d/%b/%Y'`" nothing

When I use (fvwm is still run under LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8):

  Style * Font *something_from_426_unicode_fonts*-iso10646-1

it works as expected except that I don't have unicode fonts for Arabic
(*-arabeyes-1 seems unusable at all, and another my *-iso10646-1 has only
Arabic, not latin). I am able to see Russian and Hebrew without problems.
Bidi works well with utf8.

Mikhael.

The idea is right, but is it a time to implement it?

If this is implemented the rest of TitleStyle <style> functionality may be
removed, because all Solid, XGradient, TiledPixmap are already included in
MultiPixmap (i.e. MultiColorset).

Some of the options in the current MultiPixmap affect ButtonStyle with
UseTitleStyle, so probably ButtonStyle should be converted to colorsets
as well, otherwise UseTitleStyle will not work.

Currently the syntax may be the old one, but new options are colorsets.

  ButtonStyle <which> <when> Colorset <n> -- <flags>

  TitleStyle <when> MainColorset <n> -- <flags>

ButtonStyle Vector and MiniIcon should be drawn above colorset area.
Flags probably can't be integrated into colorset, so should stay.

New MainColorset option replaces the old ones Solid, XGradient and
TiledPixmap, should they still be supported?

Other colorsets that TitleStyle should support (see "MultiPixmap" in the
man page):

  MainColorset
  LeftMainColorset
  RightMainColorset
  UnderTextColorset
  LeftOfTextColorset
  RightOfTextColorset
  LeftEndColorset
  RightEndColorset
  ButtonsColorset
  LeftButtonsColorset
  RightButtonsColorset

Too much colorsets, but not all are used for a specific titlebar design.
Only one MainColorset is needed for the 2.4.x themes.

If "ButtonStyle Colorset" and "TitleStyle MainColorset" are implemented,
the rest seems not very hard. Removing flickering seems harder.

But who is a volunteer to implement TitleStyle MainColorset? :)
Olivier, Dominik?

Anyway, this is not for 2.5.1, which I want to release in a few days.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, here's the patch for the weighted sorting feature (renamed from
"custom", following Larry Gensch's suggestion).  This is against the
latest code in CVS.

I will apply and test it. I hope this is the last feature before 2.5.1.

I think there might be a bug in the grabbing and it may be the reason 
I'm seeing it as a problem. I don't mind fvwm stopping module messages 
when the pointer is on the torn-off menu but it seems to keep the grab 
when the pointer moves off and it only releases it when the pointer 
enters another window.
Normally the grab is released when the pointer leaves the torn off menu 
but if you use the keyboard to go from the torn off menu to a sub-menu 
and the use the keyboard to go back to the torn off menu and then move 
the pointer off the torn off menu the grab remains. You can see the grab 
is active because the cursor stays the same as on the menu.

Cheers,
Tim.

Fixed.

The although the grab was released, the pointer was immediately
regrabbed because the menu code did not remove EnterNotify events
from the queue.  These were processed later by the main loop
although the window had long been left again.

Hi,

Is it just me or is the use of the command "State" in 
Current, etc. not in the man page? It works great, by the way.

Hi folks

I briefly tried running fvwm-snap-20020425 and don't get edge resistance
when moving a window using meta+mouse-3, i.e. the following binding:

  Mouse 3 	W M	Move-or-Raise

  DestroyFunc Move-or-Raise
  AddToFunc Move-or-Raise	"I" Raise
  +				"M" Move
  +  				"D" Lower

Dragging by mouse-1 in the titlebar works correctly.

Everything works fine in 2.5.0.

Cheers
Ric

Great, thanks. I should have checked the archive. Is there a way to
disable Alt's new behaviour?

I think this one may catch out a few people who originally came from twm.

It seems that XFree-4 has only one utf8 locale en_US.utf8 and that
there are at the present time discussion/problems (i18n@XFree86.Org)
on how this locale force font loading ...

Yes, it seems that XFree  *-iso10646-1 fonts contains only a few part
of the all iso10646-1 characters. An other problems is that I think
that when you load a core X font all the characters are loaded, this
can cause memory problems. I think there is a way to load only
a part of an iso10646-1 font as iso10646[blabla]-1 or someting like
this I need to re found a doc on this.

The problem here is that the end of an X font name should/must be
the charset. So I was/am surprised by "full10x20-1". So it seems
that full10x20 denote a font size ??? If this is the case I suggest
that you send a bug report to  http://www.arabeyes.org/ :o)

Yes and you use a special font made for vim ... Maybe you start vim with
some options? Moreover, I think that vim use an other method than fvwm
to display strings. Also some applications (KDE2&3/GNOME2) use only utf8,
but this is not possible with fvwm (we cannot ask everybody to use only
utf8 in configuration files). Moreover, most of these applications use
(lib)iconv which can cause portability problem (basically we should also
ask everybody with a non (or old) GNU system to install gnu libiconv).

Here the problems:

1 - if we want to make some bidi conversion on a string we _must_
know the encoding used by the string. The only good general method I
found is to look at the font name of the used font and to extract
the charset/encoding from this name. There is a precise specification
here from the X Consortium, the last two "items" of a font name should
be the CHARSET_REGISTRY and the CHARSET_ENCODING. Then, if you use
a font which does not respect this standard no conversion will be
done. If you use a font which use a strange charset name as say
"my_arabic-36" we may "fix" fvwm so that fvwm understand this
name in one second (if it correspond to an encoding that fribidi
support). This may become configurable in a special way in the
future. A simple alternative would be to add a new fvwm Style
(and new module config options) to specify the charset of the
font ... (basically xterm use this method with the  -u8 option),
but I do not like so much this idea. I prefer that the font
define the encoding used by the user.

2 - After fvwm have determined the charset and load the font it should
display the string (forget bidi here). With an unibyte font (as iso8859-X)
there are no problems. Why do you not use iso8859-6 fonts with fvwm?
Do you need others characters than ASCII and Arabic one's?
With a multibyte font (as iso10646) locale is important, as fvwm use a
(powerful) method from X to display string and load font. Good fonts
are automatically loaded (no need to specify the charset) and string
are well displayed without the need to think to much :o)
So with iso10646, at the present time, you should use an utf8
locale (or good ttf font and XFree-4.good_version, here yet an
other method is used).

Now as utf8 grow in importance and a lot of system does not support
utf8 locale I will see if fvwm can support utf8 on system which does
not support utf8 locale. You may be happy with this but you should
wait a bit. Ooops, this works now on my machine but I cannot commit
the change before Monday, this should work on any X server (I have
added a 4th method to display string ...).

Fvwm is not written for Linux. We try to do so that fvwm can work
on any system that can run an X server. I hope that fvwm has no
problem with Sparc Solaris. However, some fvwm developers use Linux,
GNU tools/libs and XFree so it may happen that there are some problems
with "exotic" architecture (specially if there are not gnushed or/and
XFreed), but we always try to fix these problems.

-x (executable regular file) and -d (directory) are also fairly specific

There is no portable way to test for symlinks that I know of, except
for replacing ancient /bin/sh like the ones in ULTRIX, AIX, SunOS.
Anyway, this is not needed, since we test perl by running.

I can reproduce this easily. Press the default Alt-Tab, move mouse outside
of the menu, release Alt. The problem is not in 2.4.x.

Gee, why I notice problems _after_ release.

With no config file. Open 2 xterm (or FvwmConsole).
Press Alt-Tab-Tab, release Alt. The pointer is warped, but not the focus.

Do "Restart" without parameters from non first desk. Any existing windows
are not (correctly) decorated until the pointer enters them.

Reproducible with no config too. Just open xterm on Desk 1 and Restart.

I just installed 2.5.1 (which includes the weighted sorting patch I
submitted), and I'm seeing a strange bug in FvwmIconMan.  Sometimes when
I iconify a window, the FvwmIconMan window doesn't get resized to hold
the extra button.  (I have showonlyiconic turned on.)  Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't.  If I uniconify the window and reiconify,
it usually ends up correct.  I did not see this behavior in 2.4.7 (also
with my patch).

I did some debugging within FvwmIconMan, and it looks like
XMoveResizeWindow is being called (from resize_window) with the correct
values, but the X server is just ignoring it.  XMoveResizeWindow is
always called correctly, but the results are random - sometimes the
window gets resizes, sometimes it doesn't.

I know the window manager interacts with the X server on window moves
and resizes, but I'm not familiar with the details, and I have no idea
how this would relate to module windows (if at all).  Did something get
changed in 2.5.x that would cause this problem?  Any other ideas?

- Derek

Strange that noone who use a non-swallowed pager did not report it.

FvwmPager is initially drawn incorrectly (for example top title is drawn
at the bottom with no text). May be reproduced with no config. WindowShade
refreshes FvwmPager well.

2.4.x is ok.

Just in passing, those fonts are not specific to vim and no special
options are needed to use 'em (ie. start options).  BTW, couldn't
those methods (libiconv and others) be things that could be included
during configure time ?

A couple of things -

a. You can run Bidi on any string irrespective of its encoding and
   it ought to work (only encodings that it cares about will be
   touched - namely 8859-6 and 8859-8) - so, unless I'm missing a
   detail, I don't see why fvwm needs to know the encoding of the
   strings at all (except in the case where it needs to display
   'em, of course :-)

b. I think we are discussing an optimization regarding the loading of
   the fonts, no ? Meaning, why not simply load all the fonts a user
   specifies even if it were a 10646 with english, russian, arabic,
   japanese, hebrew, chinese, etc when a user specifies "all" (or
   similar somehow within fvwmrc file)

Yup, Arabic requires Form-B glyphs rendering iso8859-6 useless for display.

In brief (beyond the realm of fvwm really, but you asked :-), Arabic has
complexities which few other languages have in which characters are
displayed differently based on their location within the word and sentence.
All files are stored with 8859-6 encodings, but for those applications
which don't use an external display engine (and most don't :-) one is
required to get the extra display glyphs from somewhere else (Unicode's
Form-B -- http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE70.pdf).

OK, I think you are saying that with 10646 fonts the locale will
specify which subsections will be loaded and ought to be used as
the charsets to display within fvwm, right ?  What will a person
need to do in order to display say 4 languages (english, arabic,
japanese, russian) all within the same the 10646 font file - a
single locale won't suffice or will it ?  Seems like a more dynamic
solution ought to be sought.

Before I got this email, I was thinking more along a way to specify
the usage of utf8 within fvwm2rc (or fvwmrc :-); something along the
lines,

  Style * Charset utf8		// meaning all of 'em (*utf8* :-)
   -or-
  Style * Charset english:arabic:sv.UTF-8:iso8859-7

Just an idea.

Yeah I know.  I was just noting it as "food for thought" and
a "reminder" :-)

Me too! I use Alt-M2 to move, and find this, well, disconcerting.
I don't use snap attraction myself, but I use EdgeResistance.

Can this be modified to

This is not quite correct. You add to .vimrc these lines:

  set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-arabeyes-1
  set encoding=utf-8

So you explicitly request utf-8. In fvwm it is currently determined
automatically by font and locale.

libiconv is already auto-configure'd like any other non-portable thing.

I think too that a font should define the encoding used by the user
(together with locale if a font information is not enough), although it
may sound strange. The logic is that a user would not use that font if it
is not suitable for his text to display.

An alternative would be to require to specify an encoding together with
every string. Or adding Encoding option. But in the end we will find that
a user should usually specify Encoding and Font in the same place (for
example in MenuStyle, or like with .vimrc), so there is a duplication.

Because a string "" should only be Bidi'd if its encoding is iso8859-6,
but not koi8-r. Even vim should know string encoding (you specified utf8).

fvwm should also know to translate between charsets used by locales to the
ones fribidi_parse_charset knows about. For example on Solaris "8859-6",
on hpux "iso86", but fribidi_parse_charset knows only about "iso8859-6",
at least we can't risk. It also seems that fribidi does not know about the
iso8859-6.8x charset, still fvwm supports it. If you have any info on the
subject (fribidi or iso8859-6.8x), share it.

It is good to know that iso8859-6 is fully capable for storing Arabic
without a loss, I only knew that iso8859-6 glyphs are not enough for
displaying.

I am not an autority, but I think that locale has nothing to do with
displaying different languages at once, it only defines a natural language
and other local properties that a user wants to pass to his applications.
I.e. with ru_RU.utf-8 /bin/date writes in Russian, with ar_JO.utf-8 - in
Arabic, still both outputs use the same unicode font.

I don't think that locale is used anywhere for font loading optimizations
although it may.

The first line is similar to the Encoding option I mentioned above,
but I don't understand what exactly should the second line do.
I see here natural language names, locale names and charset names. :)

Ok, snap is always initially enabled now. You should press Alt for the
second time to disable snap, see url.

This is actually an old problem, but in 2.4.x it is almost invisible.
I fixed an initial drawing of a pager with 1x1 desks (NxM pages each).
I have no currently time to finish this for the case of CxR desks.

Also fixed label positions with LabelsBelow in all cases.

Mikhael.

So I download your 10x20.bdf.gz vim font put it in a directory
arabic/, run mkfontdir and add arabic/ to my fonts path.
First, mkfontdir gives the following name to the font:

-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1

:o).

Secondly, is that I use current cvs which now support iso10646-1
without any requirement (you may try the "next" snapshot, but 2.5.1
does not work).
And the last thing is that every things seems to work. The test
I done:

MenuStyle * Font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1
# replace /opt/kde to KDE3 dir
ImagePath +:/opt/kde/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/:/opt/kde/share/icons/locolor/16x16/
DestroyMenu kde-sys
AddToMenu kde-sys DynamicPopupAction PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-desktop --desktop kde-sys --lang ar --enable-mini-icons --mini-icons-path apps'

Then, "Menu kde-sys" gives me an Arabic KDE3 menu which seems
good (however, Arabic characters are separated and not ligatured,
is this fvwm fault?).

What's may happen on your system is that bidi conversion is
not applied because your font name does not say to fvwm that
the font is an iso10646-1 font.

Nadim, can you test a "today" snapshot when you have time (really
not urgent).

For portability reason I prefer to use iconv only if there are no
other choice.

Yes and no. The most important thing is that using the good locale
allows to use the Xmb* X functions which do a lot of conversion work
for fvwm. Here an example among others:

With an utf8 locale if we want to display an utf8 string we just
have to call XmbDrawString.
Without an utf8 locale we first have to convert the utf8 string into
USC-4 encoding (not so difficult) and then use XDrawString16.
This is not so difficult (as we know that the string is in utf8),
but we should do an other conversion for JIS encoding, GB encoding,
...etc. As with Xmb* functions conversion are handled by X.
There are other important issues with window names.

The xlfd say that this can be done by the user:

Style * Font -blabla-*-iso10646-1[characters_that_the_users_want]

see the xlfd X doc for more details. Unfortunately, the doc does
not claim that only the "characters_that_the_users_want" must be
loaded and it seems that this does not work with fvwm ...

Yep this can be an idea. however, as Mikhael says that leads to
duplications. What we can do is to extend a bit font name as

MenuStyle * Font -misc-fixed-*-full10x20-1/iso10646-1

i.e., if the font name does not use a standard charset/encoding
the encoding can be added after the font name and after a "/"
separator. Other info can be given:

 font_name/encoding[/iconv_name[/mb_info]]

where encoding is a standard encoding (supported by fvwm) and
iconv_name is the encoding for the system iconv implementation
(there are no standard here). Maybe some multibyte font info
maybe needed in a near future (specially for Xft font).
The advantage of this method is that we do not need to add new
config command (for fvwm and all the modules that load font),
we keep the idea that font define the encoding and that in most
situation nothing special should be added to a config file.
I propose the / for separation as ",", ";" and ":" are already
used in font name but any suggestion is welcome.

I did the same test with KDE 2.2 with your yesterday's commit (it does not
work without it) using C locale.

It seems that KDE 2.2 was not translated to Arabic, so no results here.
Russian - fully works, French - minor problems, Hebrew - minor problems.
All problems are KDE-specific, not FVWM. For example, they use '' (which
is not how it should be written in utf8) in all Programmes submenus, so
entries look like "Syst*", Multim*ia" etc, other submenus are good. And
they use visual Hebrew, so together with Bidi it becomes logical (i.e.
reversed). I hope that KDE 3.0 has logical Hebrew and Arabic.

I think it is good. This is needed anyway for unicode that has more than
one encoding, i.e. utf16 and so on.

And I think we should support also specifying an encoding with the string
itself (this overrides the default encoding used from fonts). I suppose
this should work already when XbmString* functions are used; an encoding
may be specified using escape sequences (would be nice to have any spec
about this).

Nice work, Olivier. We have a nice internationalization.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Here 3 screenshots with the KDE-3.0 head menu. The hebrew and arabic
screenshot are done with  Mark Leisher ClearlyU fonts (Roman Czyborra
has also done Unicode font which cover a very large part of the
unicode). The Japanese menu is done with the Bitstream Cyberbit ttf
which contains a big part of the unicode (Roman, Cyrillic, Greek,
Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese ...etc!!). 
Mikhael is the hebrew menu ok?
Nadim is the arabic menu ok?
Can some one can comment on the Japanese menu?

Arabic looks fine.  The reason it might look "odd" or incomplete
is because Arabic now needs what's termed 'shaping' to join
the characters, but its nothing that you should concern yourself
with (unless you are really interested :-).  I'll take a look
into adding the shaping code to fvwm once I have some time.

BTW: for what it's worth - fribidi will include a library call to
     do the shaping for us; on second thought, let me double-check
     with them on a release date before I start adding potentially
     redundant code.

I'll download tomorrow's fvwm-snapshot to confirm usage :-)

Thanks for all your help !!!

 - Nadim

Olivier, when you have some time can you please document these tips in

Yes, it seems like KDE 3.0 added Bidi support, so uses logical order.

Ok, now FvwmPerl actions ("eval", "load" etc.) are synchronous by default.
You should be careful, so your action is not too long otherwise it should
be killed. Since it is synchronous, some operations are forbidden.
For example, try this code:

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval system("xmessage abc")

This creates deadlock between fvwm and FvwmPerl (fvwm waits for unlock and
FvwmPerl waits for mapping and then closing xmessage), so FvwmPerl is
killed after a timeout of 30 seconds. This is better:

  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval unlock(); system("xmessage abc")

This runs xmessage asynchronously, so there is no deadlock. However, since
system() is blocking, you can't send more actions to FvwmPerl until you
close xmessage window. So if you repeat the previous line and don't close
the first xmessage in 30 seconds, FvwmPerl is killed again.

Just for this situation I introduced detach() that forks FvwmPerl.

  -SendToModule FvwmPerl eval detach(); system("xmessage $version")
  -SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $a = $prefix; detach(); system("xmessage $a")
  -SendToModule FvwmPerl eval command("Exec xmessage $a/bin/fvwm")

You get 3 xmessage windows in separate processes (the last one is spawn by
the fvwm child, the first two - by FvwmPerl childs), so FvwmPerl is free
to listen to more actions.

I hope now you understand better synchronization issues and FvwmPerl.
Tell me if there are still uses for PipeRead that FvwmPerl doesn't solve.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fixes are always done to 2.5.x and sometimes backported to 2.4.x.

What is the problem again? I can't see anything wrong with DeskOnly.
I.e. moving to another desk and StickyIcon work as expected for me.

StickyIcon does not work on my system. But I am not sure  if  this  is
the  only  thing  which  does not work. I remember there was a problem
when a window was removed from a desk. It does not disappear from  the
TaskBar.  Instead  it  was  displayed twice. These problems occured in
version 2.5.0. 

Since I upgrated to 2.5.1 I have not checked for both problems,  since
I thought that it is still the same code as in 2.5.0.

The problem occurs on my computer at home. So I  can  check  it  again
tonight or tomorrow. I will post the result to this list.

The problem is only the one with StickyIcon style. Windows  which  are
iconified  and  therefore  sticky  disappear  from  the TaskBar when I
switch to another desk. 

I played a little bit around and realized the additional problems: 

- using taskbar option PageOnly iconified windows remain on the
  taskbar when I change to another page but disappear from the taskbar
  when I change to another desk.

- using taskbar only with the taskbar option AutoStick and not with
  'Style FvwmTaskBar Sticky' completely fails. When changing to
  another page sometimes the taskbar appears on top of the screen,
  sometimes on bottom, sometimes it disappears at all. 

Just in case: I have put my .fvwm2rc on the web:

Hi,

Here is a very small patch which fixes the  problem  with  FvwmTaskBar
and  StickIcon  style.  It  seems  that  the StickyIcon style has been
completly ignored by FvwmTaskBar. 
I patched it against version 2.5.1 - hope the file  FvwmTaskBar.c  has
not been changed since then. If so maybe one of you guys can apply the
changes by hand. It is only one line in FvwmTaskBar.c.

Uwe
