Subject: Synthetic Button Press Patch

Below is a patch derived from GWM code which creates a new command
"SendButtonPress" that creates a synthetic button press in the window
that the pointer is in.  I use this in conjunction with keybindings that
move the mouse pointer around so that I need not reach for my mouse.
Better for CTS, general comfort, ease of use, and in case you don't have
a mouse.  Lots more could be done to make the patch even nicer,
including:

Arguments for whether you want to send just a press, just a release, or
both (with a specified delay);  currently sends both w/ a fixed delay.

My use of the patch is like this:

#------------
AddToFunc "KeyMouseMoves" 
+ "I" Key $0 A $4 CursorMove  -$5   0
+ "I" Key $1 A $4 CursorMove    0  $5
+ "I" Key $2 A $4 CursorMove    0 -$5
+ "I" Key $3 A $4 CursorMove   $5   0

KeyMouseMoves h j k l CSM 7
KeyMouseMoves y u i o CSM 1

# This stuff requires a gjb@cs.washington.edu patch
Key 7 A CSM SendButtonPress 1 0 0
Key 8 A CSM SendButtonPress 2 0 0
Key 9 A CSM SendButtonPress 3 0 0
#--------------

Patch is below, and technically is relative to fvwm-2.0.45 w/ my
animated menus and gperf command hashing patch, though the changes you
need are all to builtins.c, except for the addition of the new command
name and #define, etc.

Also available at

Feel free to provide feedback (esp. bugs!)  Use at your own risk, etc.

Subject: FvwmPager configuration
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi,

I've been playing with having a system.fvwm2rc which reads in "hook"
files from user's home directories, so that common configuration
changes can be made easily by users.  Users don't have a ~/.fvwm2rc,
but rely on the system.fvwm2rc reading the hook files they place in
their own ~/.fvwm2/ directory.  Since the users can't edit the
system.fvwm2rc file, any configuration it establishes needs to be able
to be overridden by future configuration lines read in from the
user-editable ~/.fvwm2/foo.hook files.

It's working quite well, but the FvwmPager module parses its config
options such that later *FvwmPagerXXX options don't always work
well. As an example, try:

*FvwmPagerGeometry -1-1
*FvwmPagerGeometry +50+50

as the only two *FvwmPagerGeometry lines read in your fvwm2rc.

You might expect the second to take precedence, and have a pager in
the top lefthand corner of your screen (indented 50 pixels from the
top and the left, of course).  What actually happens is that you get a
pager partially off the bottom right of the screen, as if the geometry
spec had been "-50-50".

This is due to some global variables in FvwmPager.c being initialised
explicitly when they're declared, but not re-initialised when a new
geometry spec is read.  This problem is present in fvwm version
2.0.46.

I've got a minimal patch which fixes this problem and a few other
related ones.  I've attached the patch to the end of this email.
Chuck, please could you consider it for inclusion in a future release?

It fixes:

 o the *FvwmPagerGeometry problem described above

 o similar, but for the width and height of the pager

 o the special *FvwmPagerFont of 'none' is now overridable
      by future FvwmPagerFonts (uselabel flag needed resetting)

 o a new option has been added, *FvwmPagerNoStartIconic, which turns
      off the iconic startup flag.  Also a patch to the manpage to
      document it, naturally :)

I hope you can get this stuff in to a future release, it really makes
the goal of dynamic configuration a lot easier :)

Thanks,
Austin

Subject: StartsOnPage patch - update
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


        My StartsOnPage patch now looks pretty solid - I've been running
the latest version for about a week with no, er, surprises. I'd welcome 
any comments from testers, both as to its stability, and more importantly,
as to how people think it *ought* to behave.

        It's rather large (36K), so I'd rather not spam the mailing
lists with repeated versions. It can be fetched from

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html


Usage:
------

1) New Style:
      Style StartsOnPage d x y
   where d = the target desktop, and x and y = the x and y page
   numbers.
   If only one arg is used, it works like StartsOnDesk.
   If 2 args, they specify the page with no desk preference.
   It shares the StartsOnDesk Style flag, so you don't have
   to give up some other style. Existing StartsOnDesk code is
   used, where possible, without functional modification: 2 small
   exceptions are noted below.
2) 3 temporary GlobalOpts pairs for customizing its behavior
   (defaults appear first):
     CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
     RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage/RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
     StartsOnPageHonorsUSPosition/StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition
   I personally think that 2 of the 3 options are a bit of overkill,
   but I put them in to allow testers (including myself) to try out 
   different behaviors to see what they really find useful.


How It Behaves:  (rather well, actually)
---------------

1) StartsOnPage is honored for initial placement of new
   windows, and for initial capture of windows existing
   prior to startup.
2) By default, StartsOnPage (or StartsOnDesk) placement *is not* 
   honored during a Restart or Recapture, but this can be 
   overridden by GlobalOpts RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage.
3) If SkipMapping is not also specified, fvwm will switch to
   the target desktop (if specified) and page (if specified),
   except during initial startup, or during a Restart or
   Recapture.
4) By default, StartsOnPage placement *does not* modify
   USPosition, which means that apps started with a geometry
   spec (and SkipMapping) will probably appear somewhere other
   than the page you intended. This can be overridden by 
   specifying GlobalOpts StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition.
5) ActivePlacement does not honor StartsOnPage (perhaps it should).


To Do:
------

1) SmartPlacementIsFiendishlyClever (see caveat below)
2) Decide whether this should be merged with StartsOnDesk or kept as
   a separate Style. (Chuck - got any strong opinions on this?)
3) Decide which options to keep or remove. (Ibid.)


Caveats:
--------

1) There is one change in the behavior of StartsOnDesk: by
   default, StartsOnDesk *no longer* moves a window back to its starting
   desktop on a Restart/Recapture. (Initial capture on startup does
   as it has always done.) If you dragged it to another desk, there it'll
   stay, unless you override the default. (I think someone recently
   expressed a wish for such a change.)
2) StartsOnPage in conjunction with SkipMapping introduces a
   new, undocumented setting, SmartPlacementMaySeemCapricious. Until I
   (or anyone who cares to volunteer) have some time to tinker with the
   Smart/Clever placement code, a StartsOnPage window is positioned
   within the target page at a spot appropriate for the page you're
   currently on, not necessarily the one where it's about to be placed.
3) The name_list struct now carries the desk no. as 1-relative, not
   0-relative, so 0 means "don't care", not "the first desk". It is
   still stored 0-relative in the FvwmWindow struct, so most of Fvwm
   is unaffected. If anyone knows of any module code that cares about
   the internal Style representation of the desk no., please let me
   know.


        - Bob

Subject: StartsOnPage patch - update
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


        The latest version of the StartsOnPage patch has been running
smoothly on my system for about a week now, so I think it's ready for
general consumption. It includes the PlacementIsAlwaysWickedSmart 
feature: now all of the placement routines -- Smart, Dumb, Clever, 
Indifferent -- can handle placement on a target page that may not
be the currently mapped viewport, so that StartsOnPage works 
intelligently with SkipMapping. 

        At this point, I believe it is functionally complete. Possibly
more than complete, as I imagine some of the GlobalOpts options could
stand to be removed. I foresee no further changes other than cosmetic
code cleanup - unless Chuck (or anyone testing it) has any suggestions.

        As usual, the current version of the patch can be fetched from

        Cheers,
        Bob

Hi,

I've been happily using fvwm for a couple of years now.  

Quite a while ago, while installing, I saw this note: "In theory, this
stuff can be replaced with GNU Autoconf"; and thought to myself, "good,
next time I install, I won't have to wade through configure.h to see what
needs to be changed".

The next time I installed, the note was still there, but a configure
script wasn't. 

Recently, I became a part-time sysadmin again.  The lab has about a
jillion different OSes, each with their own window manager; meaning that I
have to switch modes each time I sit down at the computer, even though I'm
using the same tools.  Not to mention the annoyance in keeping all the
various configurations in synch.  I figured I'd just install fvwm on each,
for a more uniform setup. 

Then I discovered that autoconf still hasn't made it to fvwm.  So I
thought, "why spend a few minutes editing the config files for each OS,
when I can spend hours and hours making fvwm auto-configurable?" :-)

I checked the list archives and see that autoconf comes up on the list
once in a while.  However, the lack of configuration scripts would suggest
that the real hackers are busy with other, more interesting, things.  

So, I've joined the list to sound out the prospects of making fvwm
autoconfigurable.  I will also be happy to help out.

I have tried a couple times before to retrofit existing packages into the
automake/autoconf scheme. My experience has been that maintainers
typically have other priorities, and learning how to use autoconf falls
rather low on the list.  

Ultimately, whether or not fvwm adopts GNU autoconfigure depends on the
maintainers.  So, a dialogue is needed to find out whether there is
support or opposition to the scheme.  Probably that will depend on how
much work is involved for them.  :)  

If nobody else has done it yet, I'm quite willing to do a bunch of the
grunt work: generating configure.in, and the makefile stuff.  However, it
needs to be tested, etc, and eventually the maintainers will have to be
comfortable with editing the Makefile.am's (akin to Imakefiles).

So: what is the state of autoconfigure for fvwm?  If someone has done the
work, I'll be happy to test it at my lab :).  If not:  I hacked on it for
a couple hours last night.  However, it's not done yet, and even when it
is, it will be very rough; hence it will need brave souls to test. :)

Subject: MouseFocusClickRaises and undecorated transient windows
Date: Mon, 29 Sep 1997 11:59:02 -0400
From: Andrew Veliath <veliaa@frontiernet.net>

I noticed on fvwm 2.0.46 on my Linux and also SGI/IBM boxes that when
I have the global option MouseFocusClickRaises enabled, am using
MouseFocus, and not using the DecorateTransients style with the mouse
bindings given in the standard system.fvwm2rc that I cannot move
transient windows, such as the Alt+F in Netscape.

I think I've narrowed it down to the MouseFocusClickRaises globalopt,
but even so it seems to be the result of combination of options, which
I hope can be duplicated with the following procedure.

To duplicate this, use the following procedure:

1. Start with the standard system.fvwm2rc that would normally get installed
from fvwm2 2.0.46

2. Remove DecorateTransients from the Style "*" line

3. Add a 'GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises' line somewhere near the beginning

4. Restart with this rc file

5. Run Netscape and type Alt-F (or Edit/Find, please use this test, as
it seems it to occur on application-type transients only) and try to
move the transient window (it won't move here)

6. Remove or comment out 'GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises' line, and restart fvwm2

7. Run Netscape and type Alt-F again, and this time see if you can move the
transient window (I can here)

I'm not sure if this was discussed before.  I haven't had anytime to
look into why this occurs.

The fvwm95 folks have an autoconf version.  That would be a good
starting place (look at the diffs between the autoconf and the xmkmf
versions that they distribute, and reapply [probably by hand] to fvwm2).

I think it's a worthwhile goal.  See 
http://www.terraware.net/ftp/pub/Mirrors/FVWM95/fvwm95.html
for the fvwm95 versions.

        Followed your directions, and can duplicate the situation exactly.
I can see where the code in HandleButtonPress (events.c) goes astray,
exiting prematurely without checking to see whether there are functions 
bound to the mouse event, when you have the combination of an undecorated 
transient, MouseFocus, and MouseFocusClickRaises. So it's not just unmovable,
it won't respond to any function you may have bound to a mouse action on
the window borders. I need to understand a little more about just what's
going on at this point to offer a fix. Perhaps I'll have some time in the
next couple of days to look into it a little more deeply.


        Cheers,
        Bob
