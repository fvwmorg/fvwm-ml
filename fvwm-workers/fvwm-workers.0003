Sigh!  No, it works perfectly here, even with your config.  Is
this a problem with all icons or do only the icons of some
applications fail to work properly?

Fixed.  The problem was that a colour set was applied to the swallowed
application at all.  I forgot to check if a colour set was specified
in one place, so the default was simply '0'.  Same bug as Mike Han
discovered in FvwmIconMan, but I used a separate flag to indicate
'no colour set' instead of '-1'.

Sorry for the late reply.  Can you try to pin down why is
dumps core in this line (i.e. which variable has a segment
viaolation)?

all icons

OK

I have the fvwm 2.3.16 version from monday (CVS)
I have a 2.2.13 Linux kernel
I have an X server (XFree86 3.3.5, S3) running at unix:0
I open an xterm (rxvt actually)

1. type "Xwrapper :1 vt06 &" // note: if vt06 is used use another
2. type "xterm -display :1 &"
3. go to virtual termninal 6 (ctrl-alt-f6)
4. In xterm type "fvwm2 -f init-d &" // init-d is the provided config
5. use mouse button 3 to pop up menu and start 3 xterms, iconify all (a-f9)
6. you have the initial xterm and 3 iconified xterm now.
7. from the menu, do a restart
8. after restart, click on the middle icon
9. you now have 2 xterm visible, and 2 icons w/ a hole in the middle
10. press "8" on the number-pad to go to page 1 0
11. now you have only the 2 icons visible, with a hole in the middle
12. start a vi or whatever, and iconify: it takes the place in the middle
13. now you have 3 icons on the desktop: xterm, vi, xterm
14. press "7" on the number-pad to go to page 0 0
15. now you have 3 icons and 2 xterm visible
16. now iconify the xterm you started from the menu NOT the initial
    xterm from which you started fvwm2
17. the xterm icon overlays the vi icon

someone ANYONE please tell me that you see this error

When using Pro/Engineer under fvwm2, the following odd behaviour occurs.
Pro/Engineer implements its menus as separate windows that popup next to
the main window. Under fvwm2, when a selection is made from such a menu
that causes it to change, the menu is redrawn slightly offset from its
previous position. Thus someone using Pro/Engineer under fvwm2 will have
their main menu gradually walk across the screen and off the edge. The
movement is always horizontal, and about the width of a window border,
and can happen in either direction. We reported this problem to PTC
(who make Pro/Engineer) and they said their product does not support
fvwm2 :-) :-(. This behaviour does not occur with other window managers.

With 2.3.16, running "configure --help" shows the readline options twice,
like this:

  --with-readline-library=PATH   use readline library
  --with-readline-includes=DIR  set directory for readline headers
  --with-readline-library=PATH   use readline library
  --with-readline-includes=DIR  set directory for readline headers

Hi, 

I have noticed that besides moving the window fast, you can get the same
effect if you give a :  Style "blah" GrabFocus, StaysOnTop, FixedPosition.
Then try to move the window "blah"... any rxvt (or netscape) that the 
mouse pointer crosses will have its text selected.

Hi!

I contributed the `nested boxes' Vector Buttons and here's
a fix for a little error in the minimize button vectors.
It would be nice if the maintainer of the website's VB page
could update it.

Thanks!

+ ButtonStyle 4 10 40x55@1 40x80@0 15x80@0 15x55@1 40x55@1 30x55@1 30x30@1 70x30@1 70x70@1 45x70@1

Cheers,
	Fabian.

Subject: xterm and window manager: somewhere there is a bug

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.3.15
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.13
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.153.50)


Hello,

I have pine 4.10, XFree86 3.3.2 with XFree86 xterm, Fvwm 2.3.15

- I launch the pine mail program in an xterm.
- I maximize xterm with the fvwm2 builtin Maximize function.
- pine behaves correctly and adjusts to the new window size
- but now, I right click to change the font to a smaller one
- the xterm is blanked out for a few seconds, then pine reappears
  occupying only part of the screen (incorrectly).

I repeat the experiment without pine:

- I launch an xterm.
- echo $LINES (output: just '\n', as I noted in another e-mail, anyway...)
- I maximize xterm with the fvwm2 builtin Maximize function.
- echo $LINES (output: 43)
- change font to "Tiny" (output: 43 ... wrong!)
- Minimize and then Maximize with fvwm2 builtin Maximize function.
- echo $LINES (output: 80 ... right!)

Cheers,

Neil

Seems more like an xterm bug than fvwm.

Does it work right if you use a different window manager?  Does it work
right if you use, say, the latest rxvt instead of xterm?

Well, I just tried it under KDE and what KDE did was readjust the size of
the window when I changed the font through xterm's CTRL-Right mouse
button. So yes, it did behave correctly.

As far as I know rxvt does not have the builtin right mouse click
mechanism that xterm has.

One thing I'd like to do before we release is clean up the module man
pages.  Here I'm not talking about content (although probably some of
that could be done too), but rather format.

I think the format of many of the current man pages leaves much to be
desired.  Here's a sample formatted man page from FvwmButtons:

  NAME
       FvwmButtons - the FVWM buttonbox module

  SYNOPSIS
       FvwmButtons  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.  The correct syntax in ~/.fvwm2rc is:

       Module FvwmButtons [-g geometry] [-transient|-transientpanel] [name [configfile]]

       With the -g option you can specify the geometry of the  main
       window.   The  command line option takes precedence over any
       other geometry settings in the configuration file.

       The -transient option tells FvwmButtons to terminate  itself
       after  the  first  key  or  button  press  has been received
       (presses to open a sub panel do not count)  or  a  sub-panel
       has  been  closed  or re-spawned.  This is especially useful

          [...]

  DESCRIPTION
       The FvwmButtons module provides a window  of  buttons  which
       sits on the X terminal's root window. The user can press the
       buttons at any time, and trigger invocation of a user-speci-

          [...]

  INITIALIZATION
       During initialization, FvwmButtons will search for a config-
       uration  file which describes the buttonbox geometry, color,
       icons, and  actions.   The  format  of  this  file  will  be

          [...]

  INVOCATION
       FvwmButtons can be invoked by  inserting  the  line  'Module
       FvwmButtons'  in the .fvwm2rc file. This should be placed in

          [...]

  CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The following options in the .fvwmrc file are understood  by
       FvwmButtons:

          [...]

Etc.  Problems I see are: (a) the different categories aren't
well-defined, and not consistent across man pages for modules. (b) The
SYNOPSIS section should give just a discussion of the syntax for
starting the module, not discuss the options in detail as these do
(IMO).  (c) The SYNOPSIS text also seems to run together and is hard to
decipher.   (d) The SYNOPSIS information comes before the DESCRIPTION,
so you're reading technical details about invoking the module before you
even know what it does.  (e) It seems there may be some duplication of
sections (maybe related to (a)).

Also, few of the man pages use proper encoding for referring to other
man pages (typically by putting the name in italics, like this:

  .IR fvwm2 (1)

(obviously the . must be in column 1).

I also see a lot if use of escapes like \fIitalics\fP; I personally
think it's nicer and less error-prone to use the macros for that, like:

  .I italics

Etc.

What do you all think?  Can we come up with a standardized template for
module man pages--at least for the first bunch of boilerplate sections
(obviously some man pages have extra stuff others don't)?  Is anyone
interested in this?

I'd be interested in helping out, though I don't know much about
?roff. On the occassions that I've needed to make changes to manpages
with patches I've submitted, I've just gone by example of
surrounding/similar text (hence my agreement that a standardization of
some kind would be great -- I imagine there are others out there
providing manpage patches hewing to bad examples).

But still, I'd be happy to take care of scut work once some templates
were generated. Oh, and I'd be happy to do some looking into ?roff so
such things make better sense to me ;>

I'm interested, and I've struggled with some of the issues you've raised.

  NAME
  SYNOPSIS
  DESCRIPTION
  INITIALIZATION
  INVOCATION
  CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

If you just proposed that the synopsis section be one line:

  Module FvwmButtons -x...

I agree.


The remaining 4 categories don't do much for me either.

I'd be inclined to put an overview in DESCRIPTION, and the rest of
the details under ... DETAILS?

The way these pages refer to reading the .fvwm2rc is clumsy at best.
The commands don't necessarily come from there.

The stuff about command line invocation is really uninteresting to
the average reader and should be buried somewhere.  (CAVEATS?).

I am forwarding this bug report to the workers list (it is long I am sorry) in
hopes that maybe something can be done on FVWMs side to fix this very annoying
problem.

Fvwm is a window manager, similiar to mwm, but it supports virtual screens

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2">ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2</A>&nbsp; I am using version 2.0.46
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bug itself is caused by the borders of the frames being ignored.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So this means the inside of the frame is considered 0,0 instead of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
including the border.&nbsp; Say the width of the frame border is 10 pixels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If I say place a frame at (0, 0), in reality the inside of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
frame would be (10,10) because the borders would be (0,0).&nbsp; In version
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.1.6 and 1.2beta3 they don't coun't the borders, so the borders show
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
up "offscreen".&nbsp; ie I say frame.setLocation(0,0) in reality does
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
setLocation(-10, -10).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After this command under fvwm test window will be placed in such a way
that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
title bar and left border became unaccessible while under other WM
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(such as CDE, OpenLook, twm etc) upper left corner of the frame's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
title will be placed at 0x0.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So what user should do is just specify desired frame's location
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
before showing it and this location should take into account WM

Actually, as far as I can judge, it never worked correctly in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fvwm-line (fvwm's, AfterStep, ..) window managers. Here under
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'correctly' I mean the ability to place frame at specified coordinates.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In jdk's earlier than 1.1.6 (including 1.1.5FCS) it was working in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the way that (fvwm-like) window managers were just placing frames to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the location they want 'ignoring' setLocation calls. So there were no
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
way to position frame to the desired location. That's why frames were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
never placed outside the screen - WM did 'the right thing'.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

pauly frame behavior has been changed and now awt is trying to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
place frames to the location asked (using setLocation),

so these new problems were introduced (since jdk1.1.6)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that under OLWM, CDE, twm, WindowMaker and some other WMs all still
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
work fine.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are several reasons why we couldn't (and, moreover, shouldn't)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fix this properly. I'll try to describe them:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- there is no certain way to know from the WM what its
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
policy in placing frames decorations is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- there is no certain way even to determine which WM we're running
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So any code we'll could probably invent to do this will be uncommon
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and there will be always possibility that new WM will appear which
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
our hacks will not be able to handle (good exampe if this point
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is frame's current implementation).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- actually, we're trying to override WM's behavior, which is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
right since WM represents user's preferences. If WM doesn't
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
satisfy user needs he'd move to other one it or do some workaround
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So it was decided to just keep this bug as a record in bugtraq.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It probably will be fixed in 1.2 during the major awt_Frame
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
code rewritting.

The only reason it's long is because it's 90% "&nbsp".  I wonder what it

It looks like this hasn't been tried with any FVWM version except
2.0.46, which is ridiculously old.  Anyway, that's the only fvwm version
I can find in the bug report (would be nice if you could make some
effort to reformat it; every line in the message is indented 50+ spaces!)

Can you test/reproduce this with 2.2.4 or one of the latest 2.3.x betas?

Hi, 

Here is a report on the Sun Java site about poor window positioning in fvwm. Note wish (Tcl/Tk) has the same problem. 

 http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4147997.html 

Dave (description follows) 
                                       Bug ID: 4147997 
Using the fvwm window manager, in JDK 1.1.6 
and 1.2Beta3 it appears that the border dimensions 
are ignored when determining window locations. 
As a result, placing a frame at 0,0 places the 
window contained by the frame at 0,0 and leaves 
the title border above the screen and inaccessable. 

This bug is being submitted on behalf of a 
large Sun customer by a Sun Systems Engineer. 

import java.awt.*; 
import java.awt.event.*; 

class Main extends Frame { 
    // The contructor creates a frame with a window size that gives 
    // the desired interior size. 
    Main() { 
        super("Frame Example"); 
        // Calling addNotify() creates the peers; otherwise insets() 
        // does not return the right values. 
        addNotify(); 

        Insets insets = getInsets(); 
        setSize(insets.left + insets.right + 150, 
                insets.top + insets.bottom + 150); 

        // Add listener 
        this.addMouseListener(new MouseEventHandler()); 

    } 

    class MouseEventHandler extends MouseAdapter { 
        public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { 
            // x, y are in interior coordinates 
            // must be translated to screen coordinates. 
            Rectangle bounds = getBounds(); 
            //System.out.println("evt " + evt.getX() + " " + evt.getY()); 
            //System.out.println("bnd " + bounds.x + " " + bounds.y); 
            int x = evt.getX() + bounds.x; 
            int y = evt.getY() + bounds.y; 

            // Set location of new frame 
            Main m = new Main(); 
            //m.setLocation(X, Y); 
            m.setLocation(0,0); 
            m.show(); 
        } 
    } 

    static public void main(String[] args) { 
        (new Main()).show(); 
    } 
}

AIM = AOL Instant Messenger.  The Java version can be downloaded from

screen name yet, you need to start at http://www.xxxxx.com/aim/ and get

It would be great if we could get JavaSoft and/or SUN people using 
AIM, especially since it *IS* now included on some *SUN* CD. :-) 

Fvwm is a window manager, similiar to mwm, but it supports virtual screens 
and lots more features.  It is a very common window manager used 
by programmers that I work with.  You can get it at 
ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2  I am using version 2.0.46 

The bug itself is caused by the borders of the frames being ignored. 
So this means the inside of the frame is considered 0,0 instead of 
including the border.  Say the width of the frame border is 10 pixels. 
If I say place a frame at (0, 0), in reality the inside of the 
frame would be (10,10) because the borders would be (0,0).  In version 
1.1.6 and 1.2beta3 they don't coun't the borders, so the borders show 
up "offscreen".  ie I say frame.setLocation(0,0) in reality does 
setLocation(-10, -10). 

Thanks,

None. 

 



xxxxx@xxxxx 

  I was able to reproduce it under jdk1.1.6, 1.1.7 and 1.2fcsN. 

  Some window managers (fvwm, fvwm2, Afterstep) just work in the way 
  that they treat requested position as a position to place client 
  area (shell). This is easy to 
  see: just run any X application and programmatically place it at 
  0x0 position (one can use, for example, 'wish') : 
#>wish 
% wm geometry . 
200x200+32+64 
% wm geometry . +0+0 

  After this command under fvwm test window will be placed in such a way that 
  title bar and left border became unaccessible while under other WM 
  (such as CDE, OpenLook, twm etc) upper left corner of the frame's 
  title will be placed at 0x0. 

  So what user should do is just specify desired frame's location 
  before showing it and this location should take into account WM 
  decorations dimensions.

  Actually, as far as I can judge, it never worked correctly in 
  fvwm-line (fvwm's, AfterStep, ..) window managers. Here under 
  'correctly' I mean the ability to place frame at specified coordinates. 

  In jdk's earlier than 1.1.6 (including 1.1.5FCS) it was working in 
  the way that (fvwm-like) window managers were just placing frames to 
  the location they want 'ignoring' setLocation calls. So there were no 
  way to position frame to the desired location. That's why frames were 
  never placed outside the screen - WM did 'the right thing'. 

  After major code rewriting in awt_Frame.c (deltas 1.84, 1.91 
  Fixes: 4028130, 4017504, 4071086, 1231233, 4077874, 4040662, 
  4033151, 4041442, 4080504, ??????? (FrameMoveBug)) by 
  pauly frame behavior has been changed and now awt is trying to 
  place frames to the location asked (using setLocation), 
  so these new problems were introduced (since jdk1.1.6) 

  Note that under OLWM, CDE, twm, WindowMaker and some other WMs all still 
  work fine. 


  There are several reasons why we couldn't (and, moreover, shouldn't) 
  fix this properly. I'll try to describe them: 

   - there is no certain way to know from the WM what its 
     policy in placing frames decorations is 
   - there is no certain way even to determine which WM we're running 
     under 

  So any code we'll could probably invent to do this will be uncommon 
  and there will be always possibility that new WM will appear which 
  our hacks will not be able to handle (good exampe if this point 
  is frame's current implementation). 

   - actually, we're trying to override WM's behavior, which is not 
     right since WM represents user's preferences. If WM doesn't 
     satisfy user needs he'd move to other one it or do some workaround 

  So it was decided to just keep this bug as a record in bugtraq. 
  It probably will be fixed in 1.2 during the major awt_Frame 
  code rewritting.

Sorry for the garbage that I sent to the list and thank you Dan for
re-formatting it for me.

I am running the one of the latest 2.3.x beta version:

ihgp74x123: fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.15 compiled on Feb 25 2000 at 13:04:29
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  ReadLine RPlay Stroke XPM IMLIB Gnome Session

and the problem is still there.

I tried the "wish" example provided in the report and it does demonstrate the
problem.

When using Pro/Engineer under fvwm2, the following odd behaviour occurs.
Pro/Engineer implements its menus as separate windows that popup next to
the main window. Under fvwm2, when a selection is made from such a menu
that causes it to change, the menu is redrawn slightly offset from its
previous position. Thus someone using Pro/Engineer under fvwm2 will have
their main menu gradually walk across the screen and off the edge. The
movement is always horizontal, and about the width of a window border,
and can happen in either direction. We reported this problem to PTC
(who make Pro/Engineer) and they said their product does not support
fvwm2 :-) :-(. This behaviour does not occur with other window managers.

  Check out "Window Position Change?" thread of Jan 2000 in the archives.
I sent a small demo. C prog. that illustrates the 'problem'.

  The thread died without a resolution.

I think fvwm is doing the corect thing at the moment. When a client
askes to be moved to a certain location fvwm does exactly that even
though it means that some of the border may go off screen. Making fvwm
do anything else would require it to guess what the client intended.
Some clients may want a full screen window that really is full screen,
others may want the size and position adjusted so that the border
remains visible. In your case this is complicated further by the
toolkit. I think Sun are right in not attempting to second guess what
the window manager will do with a SetLocation, after all they can't tell
which window manager is running.

All is not doom and gloom though, we could implement a new style that
would make the behaviour of fvwm controllable by the user. The default
would be the current way.

Any takers?

Cheers,
Tim.

  I think that /a/ problem is that CreateWindow & MoveResize are
inconsistent: if one creates a window at 100x100+50+50, then moves it to
same, it does actually move!

  This 'bodge' is probably because almost *all* apps. expect that opening
a new window at (say) (0,0) puts it's border at top-left, not off screen.
But then, of course, moving the window puts it elsewhere.

  Sounds like a plan.


  Out of curiosity, what are the other WMs strategies in this area? What
does ICCCM (?) recommend?

I'd like to at least look at the problem.  When I run the supplied code,
the window places itself in the first open space it finds.

When I make 0/0 available and run again, the frame is at 1/1.
That doesn't seem to match up with the problem report.

I'm running jdk 1.1.6.

Is placement policy an issue?  I use:

Style "*" ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement

I downloaded the latest version today (3/9/2000) and ran configure (I also
tried
doing the "sh ./configure" - same results).  I'm running csh btw.

Configure worked ok until it got to the "System compiler" part where it
stated I was using
gcc.  We actually use cc.  Configure continued onto the next statement
where
it died trying to use gcc.

The problem, as I determined later, was that CC was not in the environment
list
and so configure probably tried to use some other means of determining
what
C compiler I was using.  If possible, configure should be reconfigured so
that
it tests for two or three of the most popular C compilers and then goes
with
the one which has the latest usage datetime stamp.  Or it could just ask
the
user what to do.  Whichever.

Just thought that someone would like to know about this.  :-)

Ok, I can create the  problem with "wish", although I  think its a bit
different when  an application asks to  move a window that already has
its frame vs. the way initial placement is done.

Yep, actually

wish -geometry +0+0

works fine.

I was more interested in a problem report I'm getting from my users about
a Java application they are writing where they claim it works under CDE
and not Fvwm.  But I'm having trouble prying a consistent story out of
them.

Note that Sun's JVM has specific checks to see if it's running under dtwm
or olwm.

> But I'm having trouble prying a consistent story out of them.

That could also be due to the JVM being full-enough of bugs that it doesn't
do things consistently itself.  Though the problems I see (including many
apps getting their decorations placed offscreen) tend to be fairly
consistent.  :(

  My dummy prog. (I'll dig it out & reattach it) comes up OK and moves OK
under CDE and olwm; just not FVWM. Hang on, I'll try to find it again ...

  OK, attached. Again, it comes down to: what *should* MoveResize do under
a WM?


  Further, the latest Enlightrenment 'suffers' the same way (borders go
off-screen).

I know this is _completely_ off-topic, but I also know there are some
knowledgeable Exceed users here, and I am not one...

Someone here uses Exceed to display Emacs, and I just forced everyone to
update to the latest Emacs version, 20.6.

He says that ever since Emacs 20.2 (where I has installed Erik Naggum's
MBSK, so MULE was not there) he's seeing a problem with fixed fonts in
Emacs.  He writes:

Is anyone aware of any font issues surrounding Emacs 20.x and Exceed, or
thoughts on how to fix this one?

Thanks...

I use Exceed 6.1 and XEmacs 20.4.

For 6x13 I use:

"-*-*-bold-*-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-*-60-iso8859-*"

(I think the bold fonts in X are the only ones worth using.)

No problems here, but I understand XEmacs has a completely different
display engine.

Exceed supplies its own fonts (as it should) but this sounds more like
an Emacs 20.2 problem.

If updating Emacs versions helped, whats left to fix?

The language in my post may have been confusing.  The problem didn't
happen in 20.2, but has happened with every version since ("...ever
since Emacs 2.02 he's seeing a problem...").

I'll have him try your font specification and see if that helps.

Thx!

Never mind: problem solved.  Apparently he had enabled "automatic font
substitution" in Exceed sometime in the past; disabling that fixed the
problem.

Sorry for the digression...

Submission from: (NULL) (128.169.112.212)


When starting X apps iconified, IconMan adds the iconified window name to
it's list, but does not draw the mini-icon associated with the app as
feedback that it knows that the app is iconified.  De-iconifying and re-
iconifying the app fixes the problem.

Here are a couple of specific examples that cause the bug for me:

xcalc -iconic &

xterm -iconic &

I'm not sure if this will be wanted, since I see from the
development versions that FvwmGoodStuff is on the way out, but
anyway I've hacked GoodStuff to do a couple of things that I
like: display a CDE-style led that blinks when you a launch an
app, till it's realized; and have buttons that are not relieved
in their rest state, and so blend in with the desktop, but which
"push in" when pressed.

I originally hacked this up using fvwm 1.23, but have now
updated the hack as a patch to 2.2.4.  I tried to achieve the
same effect with FvwmButtons but couldn't manage it with a
reasonable amount of effort.

The patch, with screenshots of the effect, is at

FvwmGoodStuff has been dropped from fvwm in the 2.3.x series of betas.
FvwmButtons is the replacement.

There are lots of changes in FvwmButtons since 2.2.4,
if you'd like to submit a patch, make sure you do it against the latest
beta, 2.3.16.

I'm currently maintaining it, but it's very hard pressed to keep up with
Fvwm2, mostly because the module protocol seems to keep changing; I can get a
version running for fvwm2.2, but it won't work for 2.3.  Etc.

I was thinking of reducing it to a "FvwmTk" module, maintained within fvwm2,
that could then run tkgoodstuff, or other tcl/tk programs, as necessary.

However, 2.3 seems to be in feature freeze, so I cannot do it for 2.3/2.4. I'm
waiting for the next development release to add that to Fvwm.

I know this isn't a complete answer, but it's the best I can do right now.

On 18 January 2000, I had reported the following nuisance.  Has anyone else
experienced this ?

Furthermore, even if I "Raise" FvwmPager (through a mouse menu), it will work
for awhile, and then revert back to _not_ being on top.  There is no
FvwmIdentify difference between the "staysontop" pager and the one that 
misbehaves.

BTW: could someone add the layer info to 'FvwmIdent' (it would help debug) ??

Thanks..

Here is a small portion of the bug report (in 'incoming'),
------------------------------ PR #543 ------------------------------

I have the following lines in my .fvwm2rc file,

  Style "FvwmPager"       StaysOnTop
  Style "FvwmBanner"      StaysOnTop

When I first start fvwm2 everything works great - a few hours later, the
pager no longer "staysontop".  I tried this a number of times and its
happening to me consistently (can't narrow down exactly how to reproduce
it though).

 etc..etc..etc..

We've slowed down now.  Might be a good time to try to catch up.

It's not just fvwm; it seems that the widget code within tkgoodstuff relies on
internal data structures in tcl/tk that have changed since 8.0.  That, plus
the fvwm module stuff, had made keeping tkgoodstuff up to date difficult.

Right now, I cannot recommend it.

Not yet.  I wasn't aware that Mark's site had gone away.  Please disable the
link for now, and I'll try to set something up, but anything I release will
currently be version specific to tcl/tk AND fvwm2, which makes it less useful
"to the masses."

When 2.5 or whatever the next development release is started, I'll put
together a FvwmTk module that hopefully will be welcomed within fvwm and will
allow me to focus on the tcl/tk aspects of tkgoodstuff.  There is really a
need for a self-configuring button-bar for fvwm2... some people just don't
like the arcane syntax of fvwm configuration files.  With FvwmTk, I can simply
extract tkgoodstuff's "engine" and define a plug-in architecture for tiny
"tclets" to be written.

Unfortunately, my FvwmTk and tclet idea came a couple of weeks after fvwm2.3
was declared to be in "feature freeze."  [frown]

Hello dear fvwm addicts,

  The addition of the layer info to FvwmIdent made me wonder if it would
make sense or not for
FvwmIdent to display some info about the style used by a window (at least
the name or/and attributes) ?

Best regards,

	Jeremie.

You may have noticed that these are exactly the reasons why I rewrote
the main man page.  The new style is based completely on the Linux
"man page howto".  Therein the meaning and order of standard sections
in man pages as well as the way to typeset them is set forth.

Yes, I am.  I didn't start working on module man pages because the
main man page held enough work for a complete week in store.

The adjuration to be "normal" seems shockingly repellent to me; I see neither
hope nor comfort in sinking to that low level.  I think it is ignorance that
makes people think of abnormality only with horror and allows them to remain
undismayed at the proximity of "normal" to average and mediocre.  For surely
anyone who achieves anything is, essentially, abnormal.

Sorry if I don't refer to the previous answers directly
(too many mails to answer after my vacation).  I won't
reply to this bug report directly, if somebody is interested
in helping the Java folks, here is the reason:

 - When windows are *created*, fvwm moves them according to
   their gravity so that the complete window with borders is
   at the right position.
 - When existing windows are moved by the application itself,
   fvwm assumes the application is using client window
   coordinates.  I think this is ICCCM compliant.

The right way to prevent this problem is to create the window
at the correct location with the correct size hints set.
Moving the window afterwards or changing its size hints is
almost guaranteed to cause problems with one window manager
or the other.  The ICCCM is not very clear about the right
way to handle this situation.  Since Java windows shouldn't
need to change their position at all it should be simple to
fix this by creating the window at the proper place.

Granted, a style option could solve this, but I wouldn't want
to encourage such a large class of applications like Java applets
to use a protocol that most window managers won't understand.
I'm quite sure that most free window managers do it the fvwm way.

FVWM version: 2.2.4
OS: Linux 2.2.14 (Debian)
X server: Xfree86 3.3.6-1
Private: No

I am currently trying to persuade the company I work for to use Linux
and FVWM but tests in our system have had one problem.

We have many monitoring windows open on other systems and these are
usually iconified. The icon changes color depending on the status of
the system.  However, if you move from the virtual desktop which has
the icons to a different one and an icon changes to reflect the new
status of a system, when you come back to the virtual desktop with the
icons, the updated icon has either moved or dissapeared.  As we have
hundreds of icons, changing fairly regularly this is a big
problem. How do I get the icons to stay put?

Please email me with any ideas/questions at delta_net@btinternet.com.

Thanks in advance,

David Cunningham

I don't know if this is the correct attitude.  This isn't an academic "this
might happen" but a realistic "this IS happening."

Java programmers do not have any choices about this behavior when writing
programs.  The problem is in the class libraries.  I don't see how making
arrangements for them to work properly is "encoraging such a large class of
applications."  (A Java applet is NOT the same thing as a Java application, by
the way.)

And you wouldn't just be penalizing users running Java programs, but those
that potentially run other types of programs (the tcl/tk wish shell shows the
same behavior).

I don't think that users are going to care if this is a strange protocol for
the window manager to understand, or who has got it correct. They notice that
their program seems to work right under Motif/CDE/OpenLook and it doesn't seem
to work right under fvwm2 (and possibly some other window managers).

I would actually understand an answer like "we are in feature freeze, so we
might consider it for a future release, but not now."

Hi All,

I've been trying out fvwm-2.3.15 for a few days now, and found
what seems to be a bug in the random placement mechanism. I
don't know if this has already been reported, if yes, just
ignore this message.

The bug manifests itself when both RandomPlacement and
SmartPlacement are specified as style options. If there is
insufficient space to place a new window without overlapping
with an existing window, then the new window is always placed
at the +0+0 location of the current page. Previously, the
behaviour 
used to be that the new window location would be staggered by a
few pixels from where the last window was placed by the
algorithm.

The platform on which I'm seeing this is:

Red Hat Linux release 6.1 (Cartman)
Kernel 2.2.12-20smp on an i686
X server: XFree86-3.3.6 or XFree86-4.0 or Exceed-6.1 (happens
on all of them)
fvwm2rc: default version that is used by fvwm-2.3.15

Thanks for a great window manager!

Regards,

Nagi Aboulenein

The problem is that you can't know how many EnterWindow events
you have to ignore.  In theory it's even possible that the
event arrives five minutes after it actually occured (if the
server is very busy).

He didn't say that the focus changes - he said that the window list
is changed.  I can confirm that this is a problem.  I think the right
thing to do is to flush all EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events while
a window is being moved or resized.  I'll see what I can do.

You may want to forward this to the developers of the application that
causes the warning.  It explicitly asks to increase the window size
in units of zero pixels, which is nonsense.  It's merely a cosmetical
problem here because min_width = max_width and min_height = max_height.
But they shouldn't ask for a specific size increment in this case
anyway.

It *is* an xterm bug.  xterm illegally assumes that the window
manager will honour its request to resize the window when it
changes its font size.

In my eyes this isn't right either.  If the window is maximised it's
maximised.  Since the user explicitly asked for this, the WM should
assume that (s)he wants a full screen window regardless of the font
size.

There is a workaround though.  Instead of maximising the window,
move it to 0 0 and resize it 'manually':

  Move 0 0
  Resize 100 100

Then you will get the desired behaviour without noticing the
difference (of course you can't toggle the window state then).

Right.  This won't happen with rxvt.

You should report this to the automake/autoconf developers.

The good news: yes, I have seen this problem - partially.
I got the gap even after flipping pages, but the icons
still didn't overlap (instead one of the icons simply
disappeared (?)).
The bad news: I can't make it happen again.  Perhaps it
depends on the order in which you iconify the xterms.
Can you provide more details on the exact order you use?

Fixed.  In placement.c, replace all occurences of

  tmp_win->decor->title_height

with 

  tmp_win->title_g.height

OK, that's true so we can  have a time stamp which defines
the time of flag clearing. Any EnterWindow event which has a time stating 
that event appeared before this time stamp should be ignored.
So this time stamp could work as a flag and for example 0 will mean that
any EnterWindow Event will be ignored and ~0 will mean that any event with
time of appearance before the time stamp will be ignored.
What do you think about it?

But where does said time stamp come from?  You'd have to guess
how long the X server takes to unmap the destroyed window to
determine the right delay.  At the same time the user may move
the mouse and generate 'real' Enter/LeaveNotify events.  Not
that I'm against such a patch if it works reliable, but I can't
see a proper solution.

Dear Workers,

Here is a patch to FvwmTaskBar.  The fvwm version is a cvs one.  I have used
'cvs update; cvs diff >patch_file' command to get it.

The changes are in modules/ChangeLog file, briefly i have done:

* Add new option FvwmTaskBarContinuation.  The option allows you specify a
string different to '...'.  Let say, i am using '>'.  It takes less space in a
button field.

* FvwmTaskBarClockFormat could have 'None' value.  Clock could be disabled.

* TaskBar will autohide as soon as another window get a focus.


Your comments are welcome.

Thanks,
Oleg

Nice. Can I have a similar scheme for maximizing vertically. I don't
know how I would put the following idea into fvwm's syntax:

$x = x-position of window
Move $x 0
Maximize 100 0

Thanks,

Neil

Is this even a bug? The behavior I seem to be seeing is that autoconf
first looks for gcc, then cc. I work on a lot of commercial UNIX
machines without the C development kit, where we just install gcc
instead. cc tends to be present, but is just a stub that can't do
anything useful.

Personally, I think it's reasonable to assume that if gcc can be
found, that it's usable and worth using.

Try --without-cxx, IIRC. As I understand the standard cc test in
autoconf (and I *don't* understand it all that well -- a little help
Paul or Steve?), autoconf will test for gcc and if it doesn't find it,
cc. This is the behavior you're requesting. The problem is that if it
finds CC or CXX, it assumes it's working, which apparently isn't the
case for you with gcc and g++. So unfortunately, autoconf can't find
a CC or CXX, discover that it's broken, and then try other compilers.
If it could, you never would have filed a report (if I understand the
situation correctly), because autoconf would have found your broken
gcc, tested it, found it to be broken, and then continued looking for
cc, which you have. Sadly, autoconf isn't that smart.

>From my reading of autoconf docs and FVWM's autoconf stuff, we're just
using the standard test for CC. That is to say, the behavior you are
submitting a bug report against is the default behavior of autoconf
with respect to searching for the C compiler. So I'd say you want to
file a bug report with the autoconf distributors. The FVWM developers
essentially trust autoconf to Do The Right Thing, which may or may not
be the case. But the whole benefit of using autoconf is in expecting
it to automagically configure the Makefile for users, without a whole
lot of fuss on the part of the developers.

Right, all Linux boxes I've ever encountered provide a working gcc.

Fvwm 2.0.x used the X11-standard Imake template for generating
Makefiles. But in 2.1.x the sources were migrated to the use of
autoconf, which has certain advantages over Imake. However, Imake
probably searches for cc first, not being GNU software.

Hi Oleg, 
I've tested the patch. Unfortunately, I do not think that we can
apply this patch as it is now.
The main point is that fvwm is under feature freeze. The other point
is that I've got problems with it.

It is a good idea. Note that the '...' is transformed to '..' or 
'.' or '' if there are some place "problems". Is this taken in acount
in your patch ?

> * FvwmTaskBarClockFormat could have 'None' value.  Clock could be disabled.

It will be very good to get such an option. I've got some pbs with your
patch:
- If I use 
*FvwmTaskBarClockFormat none
*FvwmTaskBarMailCheck 30
Then, the goodies window is no more sucked (Ie, the lines around the
goodies window are no more visible)
- If I do:
*FvwmTaskBarClockFormat none
*FvwmTaskBarClockFormat %R
and *restart* the TaskBar then the clock is not there. I need to
do DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar* to restore the
default.

> * TaskBar will autohide as soon as another window get a focus.
>

I think that this must be configurable. I know some users that use 
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 iconify off, Focus, Raise
Then, if you click on a button the taskbar lost the focus
and autohide, but the cursor is "on" the taskbar. 
I think that some user may do not like this: some want to use
the task bar to go around all the windows by repeating click 
without having to sometime unhide the taskbar.
 
> Your comments are welcome.

So, my conclusion is that we cannot apply now this patch because we
are in feature freeze. But, after minor fix and improvement I'm
sure that it will be applied to the next devel version (2.5 or 2.9).

Thanks to contribute to fvwm, Olivier

Hello,
IMHO the fact that there are no Solid option to BorderStyle
so that the shadow and hilight colors are computed from *this
solid color* is a "feature bug" of fvwm.

Why ? because fvwm cannot do in a good way a window with 
different colors for the title and the border.
Let us take an example:
I would like grey80 for the border of active or inactive
windows, DarkBlue for the bg of the title (and buttons) 
of active windows, grey51 for the bg of the title (and 
buttons) of inactive windows, and a white fg for the the 
title of active and inactive windows (typical fvwm95 colors).

I think the better thing I can do is:

# the color of the border and the fg of the titles
Style "*"	ForeColor white, BackColor grey80
Style "*"	HilightFore white, HilightBack grey80

# color for the title
TitleStyle	ActiveUp   solid DarkBlue
TitleStyle	ActiveDown solid DarkBlue
TitleStyle	Inactive   solid grey51

# The colors for the background of the buttons.
ButtonStyle All  ToggledActiveUp   Solid DarkBlue
ButtonStyle All  ToggledActiveDown Solid DarkBlue
ButtonStyle All  ToggledInactive   Solid grey51

And this leads to a number of problems:
* The icon titles are almost not readable (the colors are taken 
from Style "*"	ForeColor ...)
* The automatic colors of the pager are bad (the colors are taken 
from Style "*"	ForeColor ...).
* With a Raised or Sunk TitleStyle the stuff is horible 
(the hi and sh colors are taken from Style "*"	ForeColor ...)

If we have a Solid option to BorderStyle so that the shadow and 
hilight colors are computed from *this solid color*, then all these
problems can be fixed easely :)

I've take a look to borders.c, but I do not know if this is 
difficult to do or/and if this can break some stuff. 
Dominik, with the time you pass on the border code I'm sure that 
you can quikly have an opinion (?) and may be do something if
nobody is against this ?

Regards, Olivier

Hi All,

Another issue I noticed while running fvwm-2.3.15 is that, with
a large number of windows open (on the order of 12-15), an
fvwm2 restart often results in the following error message, and
a failure to correctly start the FvwmIconBox module:

[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor:
- data available=N
- terminate signal=N

Removing one or two of the open windows fixes the issue.

Again, the platform on which I'm seeing this behaviour is:

Red Hat Linux release 6.1 (Cartman)
Kernel 2.2.12-20smp on an i686
X server: XFree86-3.3.6 or XFree86-4.0 or Exceed-6.1 (happens
on all of them)
fvwm2rc: see attached tar archive.

I have attached a gzipped tar file containing my fvwm2 startup
files.

Thanks,

Nagi Aboulenein

Please try adding this to your .fvwm2rc:

ModuleTimeout 60

Hello,

I've got a core dump if I do:

- Start fvwm without config file
- open FvwmConsole
- Read the file "test" which is attached to this message
  *2 times*
- execute FuncFvwmRemoveBindings

=> core dump !

I've no direct fix to this core dump, the fix is maybe obvious 
but I do not see the problems. However, I propose the following
that fix the core dump and which add bindings in a more
intelligent way (I hope):

   if((mods & AnyModifier)&&(mods&(~AnyModifier)))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I.e., I suggest that before adding a bindings we remove the old one
if any. In my opinion this is a fix because if not, it seems that
bindings are added and added and added ... (as with Style before 
Dominik change the way to merge styles).
I do not commit this "fix" because I do not really understand the
above core dump and maybe this may break some config (but I do not
think so ...).
So comments or/and two votes for such a commit and no objection is 
welcome.

Olivier

It means that FVWM has given up waiting for one of its modules to
reply, and so has killed it. The length of the timeout is a
configuration parameter - try adding

ModuleTimeout 10

to your .fvwm2rc file. (I *think* that this feature is in 2.3.15.) The
units are in seconds and the default value is 5, so it looks like your
system must be pretty slow with all those windows open.

Chris.

When moving a window using left mouse down in title bar and
start dragging right away, the mouse pointer already starts
moving while the window stays at its location on a busy machine
or network. When the window starts moving , it does not move so
that the title bar is under the pointer where it clicked teh title
bar, but the offset between the pointer and the title bar stays.

Example: The window is at the upper end of the screen. You click and drag
down. The window starts moving when the pointer si 400 pixels down
already.
You move the pointer further down, e.g. to 700 pixels from the top of the
screen, then the window's title bar is about 300 pixels from the top of
the
screen. 

This did not happen in fvwm2.0.37 and 2.0.46.

OS: Solaris 2.6

Submission from: (NULL) (212.249.20.173)


On my keyboard, I want to be able to use the numeric keypad in order to
enter numbers in the entry fields of my appications. Unfortunately when
playing with the "Num Lock" key (switching on/off), my applications have a
strange behavior: Not all numbers are available from the keypad and there
is also un focus problem. Moreover, when the "Num Lock" key is on I cannot
move anymore any windows : they are stuck to their place.

As I WOULD even PREFER to have the numeric keypad always behaving like
numerics without consideration for the state of the "Num Lock" key (on or
off), I've try to force every numeric keys to ONLY its numeric value using
commands like :
xmodmap -e 'keycode 57 = KP_Decimal KP_Decimal KP_Decimal KP_Decimal'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 75 = KP_7 KP_7 KP_7 KP_7'
xmodmap -e 'keycode 76 = KP_8 KP_8 KP_8 KP_8'
in the .cshrc of the user.
This solution works perfectly with CDE (every numeric key gives a numeric
value without consideration of the state of the "Num Lock" key and
applications work perfectly), but when I'm using fvwm with these same
commands in the .cshrc file, I have the following problems: When the "Num
Lock" key is activated (state on) I cannot move anymore my windows and I
have some focus problems making me loosing my hand on the applications (I
cannot have the focus back on the application).
What can I do to have the same behavior under fvwm as I have under CDE ?

Thanks for your answer.

Seems like this is a right patch fixing memory leaks.

Do you have the stack of the core? From the code, everything should be
allocated twice and then freed twice, I also can't see problems.

I started tracking this down, but haven't had much luck.  I did notice
that FvwmWinList suffers the same problem so I started inspecting the
packet send in ADD_WINDOW.  It seems the is_iconified field is always
zero when the modulses get it.  Unfortunatelly I don't know to much
about the packet strucutre so maybe someone more in the know could take
a look at that side for me.

However the pager does handle iconified windows correctlly.  So I can't
believe that the packet is the real problem.  Both IconMan and WinList
being broken is probabbly a reflection of the fact that they share so
much code.

Note: The TaskBar and IconBox suffers the same problem ...

mail (by looking at XBiff), and if they don't have any they log out
even before the Netscape window comes up. Then, the chooser window
reappears and on some X-Terminals (ie. old NCD 19R terminals) a
Netscape window appears too. Since the user may already have left the
X-Terminal, his account may be compromised.

I don't think it's possible to configure the old X-Terminals to
disallow the Netscape window to open, so I wrote a patch for FVWM that
makes the FVWM process send some signals to the entire process group
before the fvwm-process exits. As far as I know, XTerms will always
belong to different process groups, so programs started with "nohup"
will not be "signaled to death". Anyhow, the user can configure which
signals he wants to send by using the "SendSignalsOnExit" directive
like this:

SendSignalsOnExit	"SIGHUP SIGTERM"

(only SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM are supported).

I've attached the patch against version 2.2.2 and some lines for the
Changelog, in case you want to include the patch in the official FVWM.

Thanks for making a nice window manager.

I just realised that there are still a few fprintf(stderr,...)

I considered it, and I agree it can be done in that way. I think it's
more "clean", however, to let FVWM itself clean up. Of course, this is
just a matter of taste.

Thanks Tim.  Well the problem reared its ugly head again this morning (its
been on hiatus for the past week or so :-).  I did an 'FvwmIdent' on the pager
before the problem occurred and after; the results was identical (I'll attach a
shot of it).  Oddly, the xterm has a Layer of 4 noted where-as the pager has a
Layer of 6, yet still the xterm covers the pager (I'll attach a shot of the
xterm's FvwmIdent as well).

Any ideas on why this is happening ?

Sounds like you could also achieve the same effect by putting

stty +hup

in the start-up shell that launches fvwm2, e.g. in
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc. Guys, do other window managers do this sort of
thing? I'd hesitate to implement a feature (particularly since we're
in feature-freeze) that could reasonably be implemented by other means.

I would venture the guess that there's something funny going on
related to the GSFR. I patched up FvwmDebug to be GSFR-aware and
debugged a sample 'xterm -iconic' for kicks. Here's the output showing
the M_ADD_WINDOW and M_OLD_ADD_WINDOW packets:

Add Window
         ID 4c0000e
         frame ID 8002f1
         fvwm ptr bfbff5f0
         frame x 0
         frame y 0
         frame w 671
         frame h 422
         desk 0
         title height 22
         border width 6
         window base width 19
         window base height 4
         window resize width increment 8
         window resize height increment 16
         window min width 27
         window min height 20
         window max 32767
         window max 32767
         icon label window 0
         icon pixmap window 0
         window gravity 1

         frame x 0
         frame y 0
         frame w 671
         frame h 422
         desk 0
         flags 62006400
         title height 22
         border width 6
         window base width 19
         window base height 4
         window resize width increment 8
         window resize height increment 16
         window min width 27
         window min height 20
         window max 32767
         window max 32767
         icon label window 0
         icon pixmap window 0
         window gravity 1

Strangely, each packet returns a different fvwm frame pointer. But
most important is the fact that the flags in an old-style packet are
*clearly* wrong. Something must be going wrong with the creation of
old-style vpackets. But I wouldn't expect the modules to be distracted
by these malformed packets. Any ideas here? I'll continue to dig
deeper.

BTW, I'll also diff FvwmDebug, if there's interest. It should probably
be kept up to date.

A double negative is a no-no.

Hi, as I mentioned in my other mail, I've patched FvwmDebug to support
the new style packets.

Err, I just noticed that the new window_flags is a struct. So having a
value of 6 for flags is probably not right... I'm not sure where
things stand with the old packets. Was it bits in a 32-bit int?

It appears that "stty hup" works on Digital Unix, even though the man
page doesn't say what it's supposed to do. Thanks for the hint.

I've now stopped using my patched version of FVWM in favour of the
"stty hup" method, because I value using an official version of FVWM,
and because "stty hup" is a simple solution. In my opinion everyone
should use something equivalent to "stty hup" or my patch, because it
gives higher security, and I think people should somehow be encouraged
to do it. Perhaps someone will add a note about it one some web page?

Errm, excuse me, but everyone is overlooking something rather important
here !

This is X windows - not MS windows - your X clients are not constrained
to run on the same CPU as your window manager. Unless there have been
some developments which I've missed, it is not possible for FVWM to send
a SIGHUP from its linux box to a remote xterm process on a neighbouring
host :-0

The most satisfactory solution is unfortunately impossible AFAIK because
X does not incorporate a suitable notion of "session" in its protocol.

The next most satisfactory solution (which my site uses) is to arrange
for your server to close its client's connections after the normal
logout actions have completed (such as  exiting the WM). Each client
which still has a connection then gets an XIO error which always causes
Xlib(3) to exit(2) - these clients can still handle non-X closedown
actions on the way out by using an XSetIOErrorHandler(3X) callback.

This is not completely satisfactory because (a) your Xserver has to
support the "client closedown" on logout, and (b) you still have to
somehow block a vvveeerryyy sluggish Netscape from popping up after the
Xserver has re-opened for business (host chooser or xdm(1) login
banner).


We manage (a) on three different types Xserver:

o   Sun-MS workstation: xdm(1) always sends SIGHUP/TERM to Xsun(1) on
logout

o   NCD X-terminal: set "login-xdm-action-on-disconnect = logout" in
/usr/lib/X11/ncd/configs/ncd_std

o   PC running eXceed : set the checkbox "Exit kills all clients" in the
"XDMCP Startup Modes" dialogue.


We should be managing (b) by setting "DisplayManager*grabServer: True"
in the xdm config. file, but we had problems with the next login when we
did this a long time ago (and have not yet revisited it).

Is it possible to run your X-servers with an xauth file? It's much
better than xhosts in that it will restrict access to the server based
on cookies that can be made private to the user rather than just the
host that the client is run from. It would mean that a very slow
starting netscape would be refused access if someone else had logged in
to the X server.

Cheers,
Tim.

Go to  www.fvwm.org and download fvwm.  You   can find documenation at
the  web site and  within  the download.  You  install it  on the UNIX
machine that you are connecting to with Attachmate.

I don't have any experience with Attachmate.

The, shouldn't we increase the timeout to 10 seconds?

This should be documented somewhere (FAQ?, BUGS section?).

I'm thinking a number more like 50.

Urks, do you really think I'm the BorderStyle expert? Shudder!
No sorry, I don't know what to do, but I guess it's not so
difficult.  On the other hand, if the plan is to remove all
the ...Style commands (except Style and MenuStyle) after 2.4,
if may be not so useful to do now.

Yes, xauth does the job nicely: once the user has logged off xdm changes
the cookie, so an app. which is slow to start is refused even before
another user logs in (ie. while the login banner is up). I guess this
just what Rasmus needs.

Thanks for this, Tim.

Please refer to Q5.5 in our FAQ (available at http://fvwm.org/) for
a detailed explanation of your problem.  Since the 2.3.x beta releases
there's the IgnoreModifiers command that can help you (2.1.5 won't do):

  IgnoreModifiers L2

This tells fvwm to ignore the caps-lock and num-lock keys entirely.
The drawback is that the extra communication with the X server
grows exponentially with the number of modifiers you want to ignore.
In extreme cases (slow network connection, many modifiers) it can take
many seconds before new windows/icons are displayed.  Two modifiers
should be pretty straightforward, though.

Next time when this happens, first write down the FvwmWindow structures
of the two windows.  Then kill fvwm with 

  kill -6 <fvwm's process id>

This will generate a core dump.  Fire up a good graphical
debugger and print out the stacking order chain.  Beginning
from Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next follow write down the stack_next
and stack_prev pointers.  If the problem is within the stacking
order you will notice that the two windows have the wrong order.
Try to dump all FvwmWindow structures into a file so I can see
what's wrong.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I had a quick go with the downloadable evaluation version. Fvwm works
quite nicely with it.  Kea! X is very similar to Exceed and will
probably share the same anomalies. I recomend running it in full screen
mode so that you and it don't get confused when you raise a window and
it doesn't end up at the top. See the BugOpts section of the fvwm2 man
page for some things you can change to help with X-on-NT servers.

Cheers,
Tim.

Ah, a fix! I'm still confused by the fact that FvwmDebug reported that
the new AddWindow packet flags value was 6... It should be a pointer
to a struct, no? Hence something more like 082f3d08 would have made
more sense?

Also, according to the mod_f2m_communication.html page, the flag
packet is located at byte 11. Unless I'm misunderstanding, I believe
it's actually at the end. Here's a documentation patch:

Thanks all for the ModuleTimeout suggestion. In my case I've found a timeout
value of 10 to do the trick.

Thanks,

Hum, Hum, almost all the recent commit on borders.c has been
done by ... domivogt. I remembered also discussions between you,
Tim and others about border look. Tim any opinion about this
"border bug" ?

Ok, but how many times we have to wait before 2.6 (or 3.0) ?
Also this story of border is really stupid: we cannot use
colorset for Title in fvwm-themes because we want a redmond98
theme (so we need to have different colors for the title and the 
border). Also, systeme.fvwm2rc-sample-95 suffers the same pb. and
it is not a good colors example for a sample (yes I still work on
this stuff).

So, if no body want to do it (this solid option) and if I get 
3/2 votes (I consider Dominik answer as a 1/2 vote, since it
says that the stuff is easy and do not give a formal objection) 
and no objection I will do it.

Surely the point of making this a parameter in the .fvwm2rc file is
that we don't have to guess any more. Everybody can have the timeout
that they want / need. And even if we do increase the default to 10
seconds there will be people who will need 15 seconds etc.

But yes, I will add a section on this to the docs/FAQ file.

Agree. I was thinking about at least 30 as the default myself.

Yes, this is a very bad emulation (although others are yet worse).
White on gray is unreadable and 2 backgrounds should be different.

I.e. you propose to add additional BorderStyle Solid option, and when it
presents, to evaluate the shadow and hilight colors from it and not from
background color (or colorset). So a better name of this BorderStyle
option is BackColor or/and BackColorset. And you say the fore color is
used from other place (ForeColor/HilightFore or Colorset/HilightColorset).

Is not it more clear to have 2 additional style options BorderColorset
and BorderHilightColorset in addition to Colorset and HilightColorset.
If the first pair is defined, it is used instead the second pair for
borders. The second pair is always used for titles, icon titles, pager.

Regards,
Mikhael.

And what would an option help here?  They would still see that it
works under Motif/CDE/OpenLook but not with fvwm.  The difference
would be only that the few users that studied the man page carefully
may be able to get it working right.  I'd really prefer if this
java stuff would stick to the way virtually all other applications
work (i.e. they fix java).

The only explanation is this. When you start a program (say Netscape), it
has an initial title "someprogram", then after some timeout the program
changes the title (this is what Netscape does). The window still has the
NoIcon style option, because there was not any "someprogram *somewindow*"
string when it was mapped. When you execute RecaptureWindow or Restart
the styles are regenerated for this window accordingly to the new title.

If this is your case, there is nothing to be done here, just don't use
dynamic title names as style paterns, it is unreliable.

I don't think it is currently possible. You probably want a hypotetycal
ClickNonDecorsToFocus style option. You can send a feature request.

There is a not quite related bug - when clicking on unfocused ClickToFocus
window decor, the window is first raised even with ClickToFocusRaisesOff.

I think the developement version issues could be better discussed on
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org list.

I'm not advocating any solution.  Heres an an excerpt from the mwm man
page:

     positionIsFrame (class PositionIsFrame)
             This resource indicates how client  window  position
             information  (from  the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property and
             from configuration requests) is to  be  interpreted.
             If  the  resource  value is True, the information is
             interpreted as the position of the MWM client window
             frame.   If the value is False, it is interpreted as
             being the position of the client area of the window.
             The default value of this resource is True.

Me too. Short timeouts are bad. If a timeout is needed to break a
deadlock it means something is wrong and we won't ever get a chance to
fix it if no-one notices the timeout.

The online documentation is out of date. The 6 is the layer now and the
flags are at the end of the packet. I'm not sure when we should update
the web pages. The CVS version isn't "official" so I don't think the web
paes should track the CVS version, or should it?

I agree but I think the problem is inability to set the text color for
titles.

`Style "*" color fg bg' is probably doing to much. It sets the border
and icon background color to bg and the icon and title text color to fg.
I think it shouldn't set the title text color, which implies I think we
need a TitleColor style command.

TitleStyle lets you set the background but won't let you change the text
or relief colors.

I'd like to nuke BorderStyle, ButtonStyle and TitleStyle and move the
functionality into the style command with some tweaks to make things
simpler, but it would break backward compatibility and I can't see how
to emulate AddTitleStyle's ability to stack multiple pixmaps in the
titlebar.

Cheers,
Tim.

The chances of Java changing to fix this is virtually zero. An option
might be useful if the windows in question have a recognizeable class or
resource, in that case a `Style Java* PositionMeansBorder' might be a
useful default.

Each part of the online documentation has its own rules.
The module interface documentation is only useful for developers.
Developers should always be working against the current CVS.

I'd say that makes most sense, too.

Just for my own edification, where did you slice this into the packet
description? Files like libs/vpacket.h and fvwm/module_interface.c
(the NEWCONFIGARGS stuff) don't give any indication that a new ulong
is present... I'd made the false assumption that those descriptions
would be authoritative. Unless I'm somehow looking at old data, but I
am using cvsweb at the moment.

Anyway, where (in the sources) does one look for descriptions of
module packets and their contents?

Each message type has its own format.  Only the first part of the packet
is standardized.

You really have to look at the code that generates the packet.

I don't think it is currently possible. You probably want a hypotetycal
ClickNonDecorsToFocus style option. You can send a feature request.

There is a not quite related bug - when clicking on unfocused ClickToFocus
window decor, the window is first raised even with ClickToFocusRaisesOff.

I was wondering whether this can be done via a function that puts the focus
back to where it was before the click.

Hello,
What about adding a fvwm_sounds dist ?
I've done one with  5 sounds:
gong.au clong.au pook.au slide.au wipe.au
from afterstep and one from gnome (via sox).
In a tar.gz ball this dist take 75Kb so it is
small (and 88kb uncompressed)

Again, I would like to add this for sample-95 but
I think it is good that fvwm has a small sound dist.

Olivier

Hello,
I would like to add some (mini) icons into fvwm_icons:

I would like to complete the net black/blue/white winops mini 
icons (currently, mini.resize3.xpm, mini.move1.xpm) and adding:
mini.iconify1.xpm, mini.maximize1.xpm, mini.shade1.xpm and
mini.stick1.xpm (from wm-icons)
The green yellow flashy winops mini icons gives a complete set
of  winops mini icons, but I think that almost every body do
not like it.

Also I would like to add one icon (32x32) and a mini icon for 
gimp, one mini icon for kde, one mini icon for gnome and a
shell icon with  the same format than the root taskbar start 
menu from fvwm2rc.system-sample-95.

I would like to add these icons for fvwm2rc.system-sample-95
but I think that it will be useful for every body.

Any objection ?

Olivier

I'm afraid I'm the culprit responsible for the green yellow stuff.

They look good to me (on cornflower blue menus).

No objection from me.

I have some more  mini icons too.   They're not green and  yellow this
time.  If  you want, add yours and  then I'll take care  of generating
the icon-shots files for the mini icons.

You might consider adding them as individual  files and as a tar file.
Then the web  page could have links to   each file and the user  could
sample them before download, or download just the ones they want.

I do not say that I do not like it, I use it for a long time
before I switch to wm-icons :) But on a grey80 background there
are not perfect.

Ok, thanks.

Just an idea: fvwm_icons have a very good set of mini icons, but the
set of icons is quite limited and not really uniform ... what
about to add say the 48x48 icons from wm-icons to the icons dist ?

Yes, as for the icons. I suggest that we replace the "Icons Download"
web page by an "Icons and Sounds Download" web page?

Mikhael, can you explain what you had to do to fix it?  I looked
into the problem myself, but I didn't understand the way autoconf
works.

If you say so I trust you, Tim.  I had the impression they were eager
to fix this.  On the other hand I'm probably too naive (I still believe
that people are trying to write good softwars :-) ).  My main concern
about a new option is/was that it would be unwieldy.  Is it possible to
recognise java windows reliably? (class or resource?)

I have added $X_CFLAGS in line 148 of configure.in (this is in ChangeLog),
so stroke.h, which is usually in X11 include directory, is found;
and added one more search directory to support one rpm.

When/if libstroke is getting more standard, it probably makes sence to

I hope you only voted against BorderStyle Solid, and not against solving
the problem. :)  It is bad if fvwm 2.4 does not support such windows,
especially if there is a simple, in my opinion, fix, see another message.

I think I've got this one.  Can you both please try with again with
my next commit?

Dan, I suspect that a line like

  Style * HilightBack red, HilightBack green

will leak memory.  Can you check this with purify?

Oops, then we're talking about different checks.  I thought you had
fixed the duplicate 'readline' options that appear when you
'configure --help' (Dan reported this).

titlestyle/borderstyle/buttonstyle/buttonstate and decors and move the

Yes, a titlebar is not easy, but a border has no stack ability, only one
colorset is used. I prefer to speak colorsets, because they are left after
2.4, and this can't be said about other color options.

After learning many themes, Olivier and I got to the conclusion that it is
ok for Colorset/HilightColorset to be responsible for title colors, icon
title colors and default pager colors. It is not ok however for them to be
responsible for border colors in some themes (not all). So to support
these windoze-like, afterstep-like and so on themes I propose to add 2 new
styles options: BorderColorset and BorderHilightColorset, which (when set)
will overwrite the Colorset/HilightColorset definition for borders.

The actual color code is already in, it is only to add 2 style options
and use another colorset if defined. This is something, which, is useful
after 2.4, because it could replace BorderStyle [In]active TiledPixmap.

I and Olivier are willing to add these 2 style options.
We need a one additional vote and no votes against.

Mikhael.

You seem to have committed bugacide.

Just issuing the command didn't cause Purify to report a leak, but
it did report a leak during shutdown that wasn't there before:

      Memory leaked: 8 bytes (0.0238%); potentially leaked: 0 bytes (0%)
         MLK: 8 bytes leaked in 2 blocks
         This memory was allocated from:
               malloc         [rtlib.o]
               strdup         [libc.so.1]
               DoGetNextToken [Parse.c:328]
                    if (tmptok == NULL)
                      *token = NULL;
                    else
               =>     *token = strdup(tmptok);
                  
                    return end;
                  }
               GetNextToken   [Parse.c:335]

I get more leaks at shutdown with my regular config file, but the total is
176 bytes.

The original idea of fvwm-icons project (renamed to wm-icons by Steve's
suggession, see the discussion here a year ago) was to replace the icons
shipped with fvwm completely with a more structured and hopefully complete
icon distribution. And now fvwm itself has no icons.

Since wm-icons is only beta now (although is very useful) and there are
many users using the old icons, I think that leaving old icons as they are
is ok to provide a backward compatibility, but I don't think managing them
is a good idea. For example, I wanted to extend the icon list and reduce
colors in 48x48-general icon set, now if you add these icons from wm-icons,
I should do this in 2 places. Actually in 3 if we count fvwm-themes. :)
Do we need such duplication? I suggest us to work on wm-icons only.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Actually, I believe they are trying to. But then maybe I'm too naive.

	Under 1.2, at least (um, pardon me, "Java 2"), it looks like they all
have a class of "VendorShell" (not terribly useful), and a resource of
"AWT*" ("AWTapp", "AWTdialog", etc.). I just checked this on a variety
of Java apps, both Swing and non-Swing. I suspect that the same was true
under 1.1.

Just what I suspected.  I don't think it's really a problem, but
I'll see if this can be fixed with minimal effort.  All styles
that allocate memory probably have this problem.

What style option do you have in mind?  I'm against new
graphical options that are not implemented via colour sets.

Very well, I'll not vote for or against it.  Just one completely
unrelated request:  I have trouble with the mail connection from
my work address.  The effect is that I receive list mails completely
out of order (some mails take minutes to arrive, others take hours).
All I ask for are a few more lines of context in replies so that I
can participate in the discussion.  This explains some stupid replies
from me too.

Bye

I tried to fix this several times :) without much success.
I mean I know why this happens - because of two smr_CHECK_LIB calls
every one adds its own usage lines (if the first is failed). But I didn't
succeed yet to fix this without touching autoconf macros. Will try later.

I  agree  with Mikhael's  comments  about  not duplicating  other icon
distributions.  A few new icons  seems OK to me.

As to combining the icons and sounds pages, that seems OK too, the
page is only 12 lines long right now.

I'm pretty sure that this problem is that same as the Java problem that
we're discussing at the moment. Fvwm and Pro/Engineer do not agree about
the meaning of the coordinates that Pro/Engineer uses to position the
modified menu. We may add a style command that will fix this.

Cheers,
Tim.

It seems that I do somethings wrong here. However, I just do

[olivier@snoopy fvwm-web]$ cvs add -m 'a dir for sounds tar ball' generated/sounds_download/ 
? generated/sounds_download/fvwm_sounds.tgz
Directory /home/cvs/fvwm/CVSROOT/Emptydir/sounds_download added to the repository
[olivier@snoopy fvwm-web]$ cvs add -m 'the sounds tar ball' generated/sounds_download/fvwm_sounds.tgz 
cvs server: scheduling file `generated/sounds_download/fvwm_sounds.tgz' for addition
cvs server: use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently

But it seems that the generated dir have a special status? I do
not succeed to commit the tarball fvwm_sounds.tgz and I do not
understand what is "CVSROOT/Emptydir/". Sorry for missing a
discussion about the generated dir.
Dan can you "generate" the sounds tarball? I think that sounds
have to follow the same logic than icons ...

This means that tkgoodstuff requested a minimum window width
(1024 pixels) that is larger than the requested maximum width
(1009 pixels).  Although most window managers can handle this
situation, it is a bug in tkgoodstuff.  I think the tkgoodstuff
maintainer is subscribed to this mailing list, so you don't have
to do anything else about this.  You can safely ignore this
message.

Bye

In  addition, I believe the min  and max aspect ratios of   1 to 1 are
calling for nothing but square windows.

Done.

I don't think I did anything different than you did.

I did include "-kb" on the add command for the tgz file, since the
file has binary content:

cvs add -kb -m'sounds' fvwm_sounds.tgz

but I don't think that makes a difference.  I'm pretty sure I've forgotten
to do that for some of our gifs without any negative consequence.

First off...

tkgoodstuff 8.0-final will not work with Fvwm 2.3 or higher.  This is because
the program relies on the 2.0 module structure which has changed enough in 2.3
to cause incompatibilities.

I had written an upgrade to tkgoodstuff (for fvwm2.2) that added more fvwm
support (mini-icons, etc.).  However, I only found out about the module
structure changes in 2.3 after 2.3 was put into "feature freeze."

My plans now are to incorporate a new module (FvwmTk perhaps) into the next
fvwm release that will compartmentalize the fvwm module information and in
turn call tkgoodstuff (or any other tcl/tk utility) as desired.

Until that happens, tkgoodstuff will work with fvwm2.0 or fvwm2.2, but will
not work properly with fvwm 2.3 or 2.4.


Now... back to the original question:

I'm not exactly sure why the min_width (1024) is smaller than the max_width
(1009) in the size hints...   may I assume that you are using a 1024x768
screen resolution and having tkgoodstuff align on the bottom (or top) of the
screen edge?

Sorry, forgot a conversation from about 2 weeks ago:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0003/msg00109.html

Right now, tkgoodstuff won't work with the latest betas.

Well, I've been using TkGoodstuff for, well, eons. I still use it in fvwm
2.3.15, but just get that one little error now since 2.3.x. In fact, I don't
remember seeing it until I started swallowing xload into the panel.

But, the FvwmTk module sounds like an idea. I'm making an fvwm-themer engine,
in attempt to have a nice "themable" easy interface setup, and to have
fvwm.themes.org get reborn with it (hopefully!).

And yes, I'm using 1024x768 and tkgoodstuff is at the bottom., in fact, I have
a screenshot of my current configuration on my fvwm-themer page:

Mikhael Goikhman And Olivier Chapuis, two developers from this list,
have been writing a perl-script based theme tool called
fvwm-themes-config which can be downloaded from
https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1738

It appears likely that this new themes package is going to be featured
on the soon to be recreated fvwm.themes.org page. However more people
are needed to help with bug-testing and adding additional features to
this project. All input is being welcomed. Currently a recent snapshot
of fvwm or the cvs sources are required.

There is also a mailing list for fvwm themes.
FVWM-Themes-devel <fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

As an extra note: I think 2.5M is somewhat large and discouraging to
potential users for downloading over modem dial-up connections. The
above mentioned package is under 300K.

I myself have an fvwm themes configuration suite of forms available at
http://www.dove.net.au/~awol/fvwm2/ (bug-ridden pre-alpha only) which I
have 
just begun reworking to hopefully integrate into a full-featured
user-friendly interface to fvwm-themes-config. (It's only 81K)

There are also several other themes designers and packages available,
and I refer you to this lists mail archives for details on them.

Email for fvwm.themes.org can be directed to 
Charlie Schmidt         ishamael@themes.org
as he has been the main contact for that organisation.

Jason Kibblewhite and myself have created channel #fvwm on EFNET irc for
online realtime discussions on themes and any other fvwm matters.
Everybody welcome!  :)

I hope this email helps.

Alex

May I suggest that since icons and sounds are closely related to
"desktop themes", it may be appropriate to make mention of the current
development of fvwm-themes-config and its links on this page as well.
