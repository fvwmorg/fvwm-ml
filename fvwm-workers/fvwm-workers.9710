Hi again,

A few people expressed interest in having FVWM autoconf'd, and nobody said
they'd already done it.  So I went ahead and did the "grunt work".  

It's rather rough, but it is enough to build & install fvwm on the systems
I've tested: linux 2.0, irix 5, sunos 4, and dec OSF/1.  

HOWEVER: in each case, I had gcc & all the GNU stuff installed.  So it
really needs to be tested on some non-GNU systems.

Here's the top of the README.  Please take a look & tell me your thoughts.

			Compiling autoconfigured FVWM
			-----------------------------

All one needs is the standard 2.0.46 distribution for fvwm and the
patch kit.  The latter is available at

	http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software/fvwm

or by emailing me.

Then there are five easy steps:

    1. Unpack the fvwm distribution: tar xzf fvwm-2.0.46.tar.gz 
    2. CD into it: cd fvwm-2.0.46 
    3. Unpack the patch kit: tar xzf .../autoconf-kit.tar.gz 
    4. Run the script: autoconf-kit/runme 
    5. ./configure && make


			What the Kit Does
			-----------------

The biggest change, of course, is that all traces of Imakefile stuff
is removed, replaced by all kinds of autoconf detrius.

In general: all the options formerly contained in the files Fvwm.tmpl
and configure.h got replaced by options to the "configure" script.
Hopefully the correspondence is clear: use "configure --help" for a
complete list of options.

I've not touched anything in the following subdirectories: docs,
extras, and icons.  None of that appears to be used in the current
Imakefiles, anyway.  I also didn't do anything with sample.fvwmrc: one
has to install that file by hand, currently.

Self-destroying functions are buggy in fvwm2, since ComplexFunction in
complex.h reuses the pointer after it has been destroyed with
DeleteFunction (!).  This is a bug, and I agree, it would be nice if
they worked.  I'm only guessing that's the problem your having, but
since I saw that your function did that, I thought I'd bring it up
again.

This was discussed a while back (one of the examples included uses
technique), but no one had time to look into it further.  A hack to
get around it should probably get into 2.0.47 and shouldn't be too
hard.  If I get some time I'll look into it, but at the moment my
hands are tied.

Hi,

I'm using fvwm2 2.0.46.

If you set EdgeScroll to something that's not 100 100 (eg, 10 10 is
good for showing this problem), then if you drag a window across a
page boundary, the window jumps back to its original position briefly
before going to its correct place.

This didn't happen in 2.0.45, probably because dragging a window
across a page boundary would flip by an entire page.

I can supply a fvwm2rc which demonstrates this if needed, but it
should be trivial to reproduce.

Austin

Hi,

For whatever reason, our site doesn't have cpp in /usr/lib/cpp.  We do
have a /lib/cpp, however.  Cunningly, the FvwmCpp module already have
support for an FVWM_CPP #define.  The patch below documents this
properly.

Thanks,
Austin

This patch is my latest collection of such typo corrections.

I fixed some cosmetic bugs in the former version of animated windowshade,
and a bug where you could get an endless loop..

It still doesn't leave the bottom border, I couldnt quite get that part to
work perfectly, so I'll have to get back on that one..

Thanks for pointing this out.  I've fixed my autoconfig patches so that
the configure script will now automatically search out cpp either in your
path, or in /lib or /usr/lib and define FVWM_CPP appropriately.

This update will appear on my web site (www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software)
by Monday morning.
