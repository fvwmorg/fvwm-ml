Hi there,

I don't know when this exactly happen, but although when I
open a new rxvt the mouse works fine (select, paste, etc),
after a while (dunno how much) when I :

left-click  I get this : J1#J1 or D0#D0 or :7#:7
mid-click   I get this : !J1#J1 or !D/#D/ or !@5#@5
right-click I get this : "J1#J1 or "<6#<6 or "-3#-3
(there are more patterns than these, just a few examples)

Very funny. I just found out that as long as I remain in the
same rxvt window, the character pattern remain the same. If
I just move the pointer to another window (with autofocus) and
come back, then clicking gives another pattern. The only thing
that remain the same is the middle hash sign, and a ! if I use
the mid-click or a " if I use the right click.

Does anyone have an idea ? I can't find out if this comes from
Fvwm (2.3.9) or from Rxvt (2.7.1 XPM,utmp,menubar,graphics,.Xdefaults)

Thanks,
Stephane

I haven't been able to track this down quite yet but I was wondering if
any one else as seen it.  If I grab my title bar with the mouse to do
a move I occasionally will lock up the fvwm.  If I check my debugger
the stack looks like sigsuspend and then usleep.  I'm assuming this
is the usleep in move_resize.c but I haven't confirmed it yet.  Has
anyone else seen this I'm trying to reduce my config to the point where
I can reproduce it but no luck yet, as this seems to be an intermittent
problem.

	I'd like to suggest a colorset flag to make it so that gradients are
rendered at the time they're requested--  This way, gradients for large
areas (i.e. FvwmBacker, menus) can be rendered at full size instead of being
stretched from the size that XQueryBestTile returns, and would therefore
look *much* better.  (If you don't believe me, try using FvwmBacker for a
gradient based background and also try to make it look smooth :)

If this is the correct Rxvt home page:

http://babayaga.math.fu-berlin.de/~rxvt/

it doesn't look like there is an rxvt 2.7.1.


I'm still running rxvt 2.4.5, but I couldn't recreate
the symptom you reported.
I can't see how this could be an fvwm issue.

	I think the problem is that something is putting the rxvt into
report-mouse mode, and then not turning it off (so the program that's doing
that is probably the culprit, not fvwm nor rxvt).  Try running 'reset' to
get it out of mouse mode...

Right. I run the latest CVS tree.

Yes ! Thanks very much. An ^[[?9t fixed it (alt-mouse was running
fine by the way.)

I think that some grep through binary files issued escape sequences
to my terminal, because I never use mouse reporting (I think)...

Resolved. Thanks !

Hello,

I don't know whether this has anything to do with
Fvwm but when I launch xfig it covers more than
one virtual desktop. This happens each time xfig
is launched. Is there a way to configure the window
manager to prevent xfig and otther applications
from being larger than one desktop page when launched?
Shouldn't fvwm do this by default?

Thanks,

Neil

If I compose a message in Netscape Mail ( 4.51) then try and close
the window without sending it, the popup that appears for confirmation
is a tiny blob and has to be resized to make it readable.

Full_Name: Chris Siebenmann
Version: 2.2.2

Submission from: (NULL) (128.100.102.185)


 I have 'DeskTopSize 3x2' set, and the default style of my windows
includes 'ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement'. If I am in the top-left
virtual screen (the default start), start up a program that needs
its window placed, and then move my mouse all the way to the left
(to place the window somewhere along the lefthand side) and then
move it up or down, the mouse is very 'sticky'; the window outline
lags significantly behind the actual mouse location. The same thing
holds true if I try to place a window along the top.

 I also have
	EdgeResistance 350 16
	EdgeScroll 100 100
set (and no other Edge* settings made).

 More discussion:
This bug actually happens on any edge of any virtual screen where
the edge in question is the 'absolute' edge of the virtual screen
space, and it can happen during either window placement or window
resizing (resizing is generally the only way to get it to happen
for the bottom or the right edge).

The problem code is HandlePaging in fvwm/virtual.c. Particularly,
the code fails to recognize being on an absolute edge as one of
the conditions that mean that paging cannot succeed; because of
this it will 'camp' in the HandlePaging code, mostly sleeping.

 If you create a menu where the first entry is not the title, and
invoke this menu as 'Popup <menuname>' in an appropriate context in
one's .fvwm2rc, and when you use it immediately release the appropriate
mouse button, expecting to get the first menu entry, you will be
surprised:
nothing happens.

 This is because the code considers this to be a 'double-click',
falls back to the 'default-action' for the Popup, and the default
action is to do nothing. (I believe that the same thing happens for
'Menu' style menus, as well.)

 This may be either a bug or something that the fvwm2 developers
consider a feature. If it is considered a feature, I would like
to argue for why it shouldn't be:

 First of all, it is not documented that the default double-click
action is 'Nop' (indeed, the 'Nop' section of the fvwm2 manpage
suggests that it's not, by labeling this as one use for Nop). I
expect that this is going to surprise people writing .fvwm2rc files.

 Second, forcing people to specify the default menu action in the
Popup invocation means that suddenly one must maintain part of the
menu's contents in two places: in the specification of the menu
itself, and in all the Popup invocations of it. If one changes one
without remembering to change the other, one's .fvwm2rc file develops
peculiar, perhaps rarely occurring 'bugs'.

 Third, doing this at all assumes that the Popup invocation can predict
what entry will be under the mouse when the menu appears. I am not sure
that this is always the case, especially with some of the MenuStyles.

I'll check this and fix the man page if this isn't clear.

This is exactly the problem.  If you doubleclick a root menu near
the bottom of the screen you will get a random menu item.  This is
especially annoying if you have a long window menu and double-click
window button 1 to close windows.

This problem is already fixed in the 2.3.x betas (and believe me,
I would never have fixed it if I had known how much work it would
be :-) ).

I assume you are using H/V gradients.  The key to how the stretched
gradient looks is the number of colours used.  It won't help to
draw the gradient each time.  What you need to do is to create a
colour set with a high number of colours.  I have this in my config:

  MenuStyle * MenuFace VGradient 100 colour1 colour2
  TitleStyle  inactive VGradient 20 colour1 colour2

I.e. for menus that are much larger than window titles I use
much more colours in the gradient to make them look smooth.

BTW, this has nothing to do with the 'XQueryBestTile' call
in the menu code.  You are confusing 'tiling' with 'stretching'.
The tile size determines the width of vgradients and the height
of hgradients, i.e. how many pixels of the *same* colour are used
to tile the complete window.  The gradient itself is always drawn
in the full width/height of the menu.

Bye

Try:

*FvwmBackerDesk 0 Colorset 15
*FvwmThemeColorset 15 YGradient 2400 2 blue 50 green 50 blue
Module FvwmBacker

Smooth and nice enough. :)
This takes some seconds, but xv -root takes even more.

The line for directories was incorect I beleive this is what is needed.
Also the .. line didn't work either.  It seems that the solaris sh
doesn't update $PWD when you change directories but /bin/pwd does return
the right thing

Description:
	If I shade xemacs and then switch to a different page of the
	desktop, when I unshade xemacs its geometry has changed from
	80x40 to 80x1. This doesn't happen with sawmill, so I imagine
	it's not xemacs's fault.

Repeat-By:
	Shade xemacs, switch to a different desktop page, return, unshade
	xemacs.

Hi all,

I've been using fvwm-2.3.8 for a few weeks now, and I've noticed a what
seems to be an intermittent bug. The cursor shape which should be used
inside the xterm window may get corrupted and you wind up with whatever
the most recent cursor was before focus switched to the xterm window.
For example, if the mouse was above the left border, you wind up with
that cursor shape inside the window. If the mouse was above one of the
menu buttons in the title bar, and then moves into the window, you wind
up with the "hand" cursor inside the xterm window. I haven't seen this
problem on anything other than xterms.

I haven't found mention of this in the BUGS document, so I assume it
isn't a known problem?

BTW, thanks for a great window manager!

It still doesn't look very smooth for me at 1024x768@16bpp.  I can submit a
screenshot if you like...

It will never look smooth on a 16 bit display.  Don't let the
65536 colours fool you:  The bits available for the r/g/b
values are very limited.  For example, if you have a gradient
from white to black, your X server can display about 30 shades
of gray in between, so if you use a gradient with 1000 colours,
970 of them would be wasted.  You'll get even less colours if
the starting colours are closer together (e.g. from 00/80/c0
to 00/c0/80 there are only a quarter of the colours in between).
To get truly smooth gradients you need at least 24 bitplanes.  

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I must confess I was too lazy with this bug.  I tried it out
and did not get the problem with 2.3.x (but with 2.2.x) and
so simply marked it as 'fixed' within fvwm.  But I am quite
sure that it isn't a fvwm bug at all.  If the rxvt doesn't
redraw itself I can't see how it could be the fault of the
window manager.  fvwm does neither tell applications when to
redraw itself nor can it prevent them from doing so.  It's
solely an issue of communication between X server and
application.  I noticed that there is some code in Eterm
(which is similar to rxvt) to minimize redrawing of the
background.  This is probably too restrictive (on the other
hand I get excessive redraws myself when I move a 'transparent'
rxvt).

Could you please report this to the rxvt developers
(rxvt-bugs@rxvt.org)?

Bye

I've just spent several hours cleaning up commits from the last two
weeks that produced over 100 warnings with '-Wall'.  Please folks,
compile with '-Wall -Werror' once in a while.  I really don't have
the time for such stuff.

  Style * MaxWindowSize <width> <height>

should do the trick

Thanks, I tried

Style * MaxWindowSize 100 100

and

Style * MaxWindowSize 50 50

With 50 50 I could not resize horizontally and the y value had no
effect. The applicaton still went out of the screen. I am running
fvwm2 2.3.9. Do I need an upgrade for this feature to work
properly?

Thanks,

Neil

It's a bug.  The vertical part doesn't work because of a
cut-and-paste error.  Will be fixed in 2.3.10.

Oops, the current patch is ok for this :o). The only way (I think) to kill
an xsetroot commands for the root cursor is to use BusyCursor Wait True and
use a Function with a Wait pause.

Not exactly. Any CursorStyle command resets the root cursor.
I will fix this now.

Around 5:21am on Nov 3, 1999, Dominik Vogt spoke unto me:

DV# It will never look smooth on a 16 bit display.  Don't let the
DV# 65536 colours fool you:  The bits available for the r/g/b
DV# values are very limited.  For example, if you have a gradient
DV# from white to black, your X server can display about 30 shades
DV# of gray in between, so if you use a gradient with 1000 colours,
DV# 970 of them would be wasted.  You'll get even less colours if
DV# the starting colours are closer together (e.g. from 00/80/c0
DV# to 00/c0/80 there are only a quarter of the colours in between).
DV# To get truly smooth gradients you need at least 24 bitplanes.  
DV# 
DV# Bye
DV# 
DV# Dominik ^_^
DV# 
DV# 

When I think about it, you're exactly right (except I believe it's 40
shades, 2^(16/3)=40.317).  I guess this just goes to show how badly I need a
new video card :)  In the mean time, would dithering be a possible
alternative?  (This is what most other window managers do, which I notice
now upon closer inspection, but never noticed before).  I imagine dithering
is a real pain, so I'd understand why you may not want to impliment it, but
I also think it'd be advantageous to have support for it as well...

It would be a lot simpler if you just created a dithered xpm in a real

If you have a popup with a submenu, and you click on the item that pops
the submenu, it will stay posted even if you move the mouse around off
the menu item.  This is how Motif (and Windows, etc.)  menus work, as
well as most other menus I'm familiar with.

It's very handy if you have deeper menus, as it allows you to drift the
mouse off the item without losing it completely.

Hello,

I have hacked Gnome support into fvwm2, it still needs some cleanup, but
I was wondering if there's any desire to add this to the distribution.
(it's got #ifdef's around all the new code (of course) and 
      a command line switch to disable/enable the gnome extensions)

The specific things I have implemented are:
Gnome Layers (these are annoying btw)
Forwarding Unmapped mouse events to Gnome
Gnome State (I've only done sticky and windowshade at present)
Gnome Workspace and Area changing and reporting

thanx,
-Matt

Did you compare this to the Gnome support in the current CVS?
We are always interested in improvements.

GNOME support has been in FVWM2 since sometime in May, I think.

Get one of the betas, or the latest CVS snapshot, or use anon-CVS to get
the actual cvs code.

Go to http://www.fvwm.org/ and look in the "Downloads" section for how
to get any or all of these items.

BTW, I should say, if your implementation adds any features to what we
have now or makes anything better, please forward them to us!

Send a unified or context diff from the latest CVS sources (preferably)
or as close as you can get to them, to the fvwm-workers list.

Thanks!

The following diff for events.c allows unbound mouse actions on the root
window to be forwarded to Gnome desktop.  This seems desirable to me,

The following diff is just a little cleanup of the GNOME_Init func
in gnome.c  I think it's safe to use the same window for button press
proxying and announcing gnome compliance.

| This is exactly the problem.  If you doubleclick a root menu near
| the bottom of the screen you will get a random menu item.  This is
| especially annoying if you have a long window menu and double-click
| window button 1 to close windows.

 I still think that the current behavior is a mistake, even given this.
Here's some reasons:
- MenuStyle allows you to control if the pointer will always land on
  the same menu entry, regardless of where the menu pops up, so you
  can insure that this never happens to you.

- there is no indication of what is going on when the double-click
  happens. I actually wound up inserting debugging statements into
  the source base to figure out why sometimes my menu selections weren't
  doing anything. Perhaps the default double-click action should be
  'Beep' or something similar.

- this may still make a sensible default, but there is no way to turn
  it off if you really know what you're doing. I think that there should
  either be a MenuStyle option or an option on Menu/Popup (perhaps in
  place of the double-click action) that says 'do NOT do double-clicks
  for this menu'. 

Hmm. Does setting DoubleClickTime to 0 in the global menu style already
disable this? I'm not sure I follow the code well enough to tell for
sure. (If it does, this could stand documenting and would, I suppose,
deal with my objections.)

Please disregard the diffs I sent yesterday in favor of the following 
diffs. In addition to the changes from yesterday, the following allows
gnome applications to sticky and windowshade themselves (or others as 
gnome pager does) and also added the gnomeshowdesks configurable to tell
gnome exactly how many desks to show... also, desk change requests outside
of gnome's range will not be sent to gnome, which seems to improve the
panel's ability to stay on the correct desk/screen when not sticky and
using FvwmPager.

Hm, did you try this with another window manager?  Seems unlikely
to me that this is a fvwm bug.  Can you run 'xwininfo -size' on
one of the screwed up windows and send us the output, please?

Bye

Hello,

Attached to this message a patch which concerns the Stroke patch.
In fact this patch contains a new way to handle mouse Stroke.

I have add a new builtin function called StrokeFunc. Here the man
page between the two ------ lines:

----------
.TP
.B "StrokeFunc [\fIOptions\fP]"
This command causes fvwm to "wait" for a mouse stroke. The cursor
is modified to the STROKE context of the CursorStyle command.
When the stroke is "finished" StrokeFunc looks to a Stroke 
binding of the form
.EX
Stroke sequence 0 Context Modifiers action
.EE
and execute the action accordingly (Note the 0). Normal use of this
function is via a Mouse or Key command. E.g.:
.EX
Mouse 3 A M StrokeFunc
Key x R N StrokeFunc
.EE
If you press mouse button 3 and Alt anywhere (respectively, press the key
x when the pointer is on the root window), then fvwm will record the
mouse motions until the mouse button 3 (respectively, the x key) is 
released and then check if the recorded \fIsequence\fP correspond
to a Stroke binding of the form  "Stroke \fIsequence\fP 0 A M action"
(respectively, "Stroke \fIsequence\fP 0 R N action"). Note that the 
\fIContext\fP and \fIModifiers\fP are taken at the beginning of the 
execution of the StrokeFunc command (so you can release the modifiers 
before the end of the stroke recording in the case of a mouse binding 
and with, say, a TitleBar context the mouse motion can go through an 
application window). The keys Escape and Delete allow to abort the command.

The StrokeFunc command has two options \fINotStayPressed\fP and 
\fIEchoSequence\fP. \fIEchoSequence\fP causes fvwm to Echo the recorded 
stroke sequence.

\fINotStayPressed\fP has effect only if StrokeFunc is used via a Mouse 
or a Key command. This option causes that we do not need to have the 
button or the key pressed during the mouse stroke, but we have to do a 
mouse click or press the Return or Space key to finish the mouse motion 
recording (these keys also work without the \fINotStayPressed\fP option).

You can use the StrokeFunc "alone". In this case it will work as above
with the \fINotStayPressed\fP option enabled. However, \fIModifiers\fP 
will probably do not work as expected (i.e., in this case use A or N as 
\fIModifiers\fP in Stroke bindings).

Note that some computers do not support key release events. If it is the
case the StrokeFunc used via a Key command will work as if the 
\fINotStayPressed\fP option is enabled (I hope).
-----------

I have do so that there is "backward compatibility". However, I think
that we can completely replace the current method to handle mouse stroke
with the one of the patch. Since 
i) It works better: Context and Modifiers works find with the StrokeFunc
(to do so that Modifiers works with the current version of the stroke patch
is a 5 characters patch, but I do not see how to do for that Context works
really).  
ii) It gives more possibilities to the users (and the "default" is the same as before). StrokeFunc via a Key command with a touch pad is a real pleasure ! 
iii) the "stroke patch" can be almost concentred in one builtin
function. E.g., if we suppress the "old" method we can suppress all
the stroke stuff of fvwm/events.c.
iv) It will be more easy to add features to the stroke patch.

So, this patch is an half patch. If there are no objection I will send
the second part which removes the old way to handle mouse stroke. 
The problems here is that we probably lost the "backward compatibility" 
from the config point of view.
However, I do not think it is a real problem since the Stroke command
appear only in the 2.3.x series.

So, any comments will be strongly appreciated.

Olivier

Subject: Compile Problem HPUX w/ GNUC

Full_Name: Robert Klein
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: HPUX 10.20
X_Server: whatever hpux uses
Submission from: (NULL) (134.93.8.241)


fvwm2.2.2 aborts compilation on HPUX with GNU compiler.
gcc is gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release).

Problem is file extras/FvwmConfig/WinBase.C Error is following:
---
WinBase.C: In function `int My_XNextEvent(struct _XDisplay *, union _XEvent
*)':
WinBase.C:985: passing `int *' as argument 2 of `select(int, fd_set *,
fd_set *, fd_set *, timeval *)'
WinBase.C:952: warning: unused variable `int count'
WinBase.C:951: warning: unused variable `long unsigned int targetWindow'
make[3]: *** [WinBase.o] Error 1
---

ok, edited file, now lines 984 et cetera look like:

---
#if defined(__hpux) && !defined(__GNUC__)
  retval=select(fd_width,(int *)&in_fdset, (int *)&out_fdset,0, NULL);
#else
  retval=select(fd_width,&in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, NULL);
#endif
---

rest did ok.  Now testing...

Description:
	Doing an opaque resize on a shaded window does odd things: the

	the window state is shaded but the frame remains too large.
	Unshading correcte the cleint area but the bottom resize handles
	are placed in the wrong locations (they are input only so you
	can't see them but if you use a different cursor you can tell they
	aren't in the right place).

Repeat-By:
	Style * ResizeOpaque. WindowShade. Resize

Fix:
	Forcing an unshade (not animated) would work. Could even do a reshade
	afterwards.

Hi, I was wondering if there was any interest in a patch to FvwmBanner
to allow commands in the format:

*FvwmBannerPage desk pagex pagey action

essentially, making FvwmBanner Page-aware. If so, I have the work more
or less done. I was also wondering if there might be any interest in a
feature like:

*FvwmBannerSynchColorset n 

which would keep the named colorset in synch with whatever the
colorset defined for the current desk/page was. Though I suppose that
FvwmEvent could do this for you. I haven't spent any time with
FvwmTheme so far, but I'm still having fun tinkering with the
possibilities.

I think it's better to simply resize with a wire frame in this case.
I have already applied a fix.

I have no objections against such a patch (although I do don't
understand why anybody uses FvwmBanner at all).

What do you mean with 'keep in sync' with a colour set?  At the
moment FvwmBanner doesn't use colour sets at all.  And since
it simply displays a pixmap I'm not sure what colour sets
could be used for.

Heck, do you still have no CVS write access?  I think I already
agreed that Jason gives you commit privileges (though that mail
may have got lost over the end of the daylight saving time a
few days ago).

The last mail on this subject was from Olivier.  He  felt that 2 votes
were not enough.

We don't have  any strict rules for this,   but I think 2  votes would
normally be enough.

Since no  one else has pointed it  out, Olivier seems  to have all the
necessary skills, and commitment, except that his  English is a little
rough.

I'll  throw in a third  vote, but  I'd ask  that  when Olivier commits
documentation  updates,  he  identify the   sections  of  the document
changed so that one of us can do a little proof reading.

Tim, Dominik, and anyone else who might be reading,

I seem to have lost track of where we stand on colorsets.
- I think we finished with the modules, correct me if I'm wrong.

- We now have use of variables for background and foreground, throught
the rc file, and expansion of those variables at function runtime
(thanks Dominik).

To-do:
- I believe something with the highlight colors was still called for.

- And something to handle updating the Styles that rely on decors or
usestyle, when there color values change.


So was that it or am I forgetting some other issues?

I unfortunatelly haven't looked at any of that code yet myself, so if
either of you feel better equiped to dive in, then have at it, otherwise
I can start thinking about it.

Brad

You can fake it at the moment by using HilightColor $[fg.cs1] $[bg.cs1]
but it doesn't follow colorset changes. The obvious thing to do is to
invent HilightColorset. Your second point may be a problem. HilightColor
can be used in a decor so logically HilightColorset should be too. I
don't know how difficult it would be to chase down the list of decors
updating any that need to be redisplayed as a result of a colorset
changing.

Looking at the todo list for 2.4 (update 24) it feels like we are
getting close to a feature freeze.

Cheers,
Tim.

Sorry for the confusion.  I know I should long have posted
a new to do update, but then I was on vacation for one and a
half weeks in late october, and now I'm very demotivated
(partially because of the complexity of the patches for
the 'Style' command I'm writing - updating styles at run time
without a recapture, partially because of the many
intermittent bugs we have at the moment).

Correct.

Yes.

I wasn't aware of this one.  I'd certainly have to address this
with my work to make 'Recapture' obsolete anyway.

Aaaaah, I understand now.  But then I don't understand why
we need to sync colour sets.  Didn't I implement this

Yesterday I tried to understand how a window is placed
depending on the handle width and the decorations.  What
I want to do is to be able to change the handle/border
width without a recapture.  Bob (W.) or anybody else who
knows the code better than me, can you help me out here?
In the end I would need a new function that does the
following:

  - take a style and an existing, decorated FvwmWindow as input
  - returns the new geometry of the FvwmWindow
  - takes changed border/handle width into account
  - takes into account that the title may have been (de)activated
  - honours the initial gravity (perhaps with the modification
    that a window that has been moved will always have NW
    gravity)

I'd be very, *very* grateful if someone came up with such a
function.  The biggest problem is that the frame must be
resized, it cannot be destroyed.  Thus much of the work in
add_window.c has to be duplicated.

Bye

Uh, maybe you did. I haven't looked that hard at the new Colorset
stuff. If it's already done, so much the better. I'll send in a patch
soon. Before I do, I have two questions.

Can anyone suggest a good way to get the DesktopSize before parsing
the config file and setting up the loop? I did something that maybe
isn't so good... Before parsing config and signaling the module is up,
I enter the loop after requesting a window_list from the core, waiting
until the desktopsize gets set... Bad?

Also, I added an #include Parse.h... Do I need to do anything special,
WRT Makefile.am or anything?

I beleive Bob was the one who brought this up two maybe three weeks ago.
I think he has something like a decor with a usestyle then a style that
used that decor

AddToDecor Test UseStyle TestStyle

Style "tests" UseDecor Test 

Style TestStyle" Back $[cs.bg0]

TityleStyle is probablly another good one to fit in here as well.

Ah, but this is not a problem of colour sets but of styles in general
(and especially the 'UseStyle' style).  This is why I started the work
on styles/recapture in the first place.

> TityleStyle is probablly another good one to fit in here as well.

TitleStyle doesn't support colour sets yet.

You should add " -I$(top_srcdir)/libs" to INCLUDES in Makefile.am.

	I'd like to help here. Unfortunately, my system is, ah, rather unstable
at the moment. I'm in the middle of a long-overdue libc5 -> Glibc2
conversion, and there are more than a few things that are still
broken...and probably a few yet to be broken.

	If anyone else would be willing to take a look at this, *please* do so.
If not, I'll look into it as time permits, once I have a stable
system...but I can't predict how long that will be. :-(

	Erm...not to pick nits, but I assume that the other thing this function
does is the actual resizing of the window.

	Could you give us an hypothetical function prototype, as you envision
the function's being called?

Bob

Good luck. You will need it :(

No, not necessarily.  I'm in the process of modularizing the
code in add_window.c and some relating stuff from various
files.  It might me more flexible if I can choose when to
actually resize the window.

E.g.:

  void change_decoration_dimensions(
    FvwmWindow *tmp_win, window_style *pstyle,
    int *x, int *y, int *width, int *height);

Where x, y, width and height are the return values.  The function would
go into add_window.c.  I want to put all function necessary to create,
delete and redecorate into add_window.c in the long run.

I think the current FvwmWindow structure does not hold enough
information to write such a function.  For example the initial
gravity is overwritten as soon as the window as been placed.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Dominik, 
You can't just return in DrawGrid, if you do that you don't get labels
on your desks, and you don't call UpdateShape if its a shaped window.
I think you need to restrict the boolean to just the draw line section.

Has anyone else noticed that new snapshots aren't getting created?
Last one in ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/ is dated
19991017. Normally I use CVS; I only noticed because I wanted a new
build to use here at work.

I would suggest instead of "*FvwmBackerDesk" and "*FvwmBackerPage"
to implement a more general syntax:

*FvwmBackerAction (Desk 1, Page 0 2) action

Desk and Page default to "Desk *" and "Page * *".
This way it is easy to add conditions. Though, it is difficult to
imagine these conditions now, but users always want something new.
How about fourth dimension conditions. (DayTime night, WeekDay sunday).
Hmm. :-)

And whatever syntax you choose, I think, it is good to support pages.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

I would like first to introduce myself to everybody:

    My name is Javier Carro and I am studing for Industrial Ingenier in
Spain.
    I have been playing with computers for the last 7 years.
    I have just finished writing a C++ library for 3d graphics on the
top of OpenGL that will be released as soo as I write the doc and find a
name for it (actally it is called "vDriaD")
    I have been using linux the last 4/5 years and always use fvwm 1.24
-> 2.046 -> 2.2 and now Gnome as well.

I have tried with fvwm version 1.24 to write a pin-up menus but the code
was too hard for me at that time.

Later on I have learn Xlib programming, but I find that messing arround
with it to write menus is to hard.
Finally I have thought about using gtk to write modules and so I don't
have to worry about the "event loop".

I have just writen a FvwmDebug like module called GFvwmModule that uses
a window with a scrollable list to show the events from fvwm2 and it has
just taken me 4/5 hours.

How can you send the code to you?
Can you run it and tell me what do you think about?

I have made also a enhancement to fvwmlib.h so it can be used with C++
and added the function
        void FreeFvwmPacketBody ( unsigned long *body ) to free the
memory allocated by ReadFvwmPacket in the same library.

I also think it would be nice to add a function called
SetFvwmDeadPipeCallback( ) to set the callbak function to call when the
pipe is broken and not to define a DeadPipe function.

I will like also your opinion about writing a module to handle the
menus, so we can habe a module writen with Gtk to use with Gnome so
menus have more the "Gnome look" and another with Qt so they have the
"KDE look" and so on.

Sorry for so much writing , bye

    JCT.

I like your idea better. I'll probably recode this weekend.

Thanks. I'll change the syntax as proposed and probably submit a patch
this weekend.

I'm sure other people are working on trying to make themes setups for
fvwm2 aswell.  I know I am but I don't really have much time right now
and it it's going slowly.

What I suggest is that all of us somehow get together that talk about
our ideas on this matter so we don't end up with a whole bunch of
conflicting ideas and setups.  Then we can get fvwm.themes.org up and
running again with some new cool fvwm2 themes.

8-) You're talking with the certified fvwm menu expert. I know it's a
pain, but you have full control over what happens. Please *don't*
try writing pinnable menus again without talking to me first. I'm
planning this feature after 2.4 is released. I have already begun
with the preparations, so it would be a shame if we do the work
twice.

Sounds like a great debugging help.

By posting it to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

Certainly, *but* since 2.2 was released, the module interface
changed dramatically, so your module will not be of much use
with the current 2.3.x betas. Could you please fetch the latest
beta release or the sources from CVS and adapt your module?
You will find instructions how to access either on the downloads
page of http://fvwm.org.

I can't comment on this since I'm not a module expert. But we have
reservations about adding C++ code. We were able to remove all
dependencies to a C++ compiler in 2.3.x and would like to keep
it this way if possible (because C++ compilers generally give you
pains if you want to write portable code).

The FvwmGtk module that was added after 2.2 was release does
this for GNOME. If you want to write a FvwmQt module, go for it.

How about modifying add_window() so that if given an existing window it
would resize and move the decorations rather than create windows? It
would be simpler and less bug prone than duplicating the function.

FvwmWinList moves itself but it is important that it's original gravity
is preserved. I would vote for preserving gravity and worry about
changing to NW if anyone complains. I would expect that if someone has
specified a 200x200-0-0 geometry they would expect that changing the
border width would move the window up and left even if they moved the
window. I guess you could be clever and adjust the gravity depending on
how close to each edge the window is when it is moved.

I'm happy to hack add_window so that it can resize/move the subwindows
if they exist. Let me know if I should do this, I'll make sure that the
existing use of add_window doesn't break and you can try putting it into
your style stuff.

Tim.

At the moment I'm following a different approach. I'm moving
all functionality of add_window() into separate functions that
can be called separately. I doubt that we could integrate even
more functionality into add_window() itself - it's already *so*
complicated.

Yes. This would probably be the better solution.

Resize/move subwindows? I don't understand what you mean.

If you wanted to say that you would write what I need: *yes*
please do it, but try not to touch the add_window() function
if possible. I want to make it simpler and more modular. I have
some uncommitted and idsruptive modifications on my disk at home
that won't merge in if we modify add_window.c now. So perhaps you
should wait until Thursday before doing anything.

It works. GREAT!! Now, my desktop looks like the first 
one I used in '94 (tvtwm I think). I really liked the 
pager in that one.

 4)  Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5)  Update the links on our home page.

 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [fixed; there is a new style and the behaviour is a bit more intuitive]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.
     [fixed in 2.2.3, no bug in 2.3.4]

 30) Fix the broken size hints of FvwmWinList (in fvwm itself).
 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
 37) Fix interaction of moving with autoraising icon titles.
 38) Investigate bug #389. (StartsOnDesk does not work)
     [configuration problem, added a warning to the code]
 39) Investigate bug #390
 40) Investigate bug #394. (Overlapping pages)
     [no bug; doesn't happen after a recompile]

 42) Get bitmap icons working again.
 43) Several pager bugs (bug #379).
 44) Fix TaskBar crash caused by latest patch in RemoveButton().
 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]
 54) Find a better solution for raising/lowering of transients.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.
 57) Fix autohiding and TaskBar tips.
 58) DeskTopSize is not honoured upon a restart (the old one is reused).
     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.
 66) Fix ddd problems.
     [fixed as far as possible; bug reported to ddd list]
 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 78) Implement colour sets in window styles.
     [only colours used yet]
 79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?
     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.

This looks like a much better way than lock on every message and have
the modules unlock on every message.

Have you got the time to change FvwmIconMan.  I get an occasional hang
with this but I've been unable to get it to core dump when locked. I
suspect FvwmIconMan is causing the lock when several message arrive but
I can't be sure. If you chnaged it to the new style I think the chances
of lock up will be reduced/eliminated.

Another thought: could you try removing the LOCKONSEND command
altogether. We are running short on space for new module commands and
this would free up one.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hello,
Ok I think I will have the time in the 4 next days to do that.

This means that I have also to add the new methode to all send on Lock
module ? This means I think Animate and Auto ... and Gtk! ?
Strange why FvwmGtk is LOCKONSEND. I will take a look to these modules
after I have done IconMan and TaskBar. But, I do know nothing on these modules.
If one want to do one, no problem !

I just noticed that all my windows are mapped one pixel
too far down and right.  I.e. if I have a clean page and
open a window it appears at +1+1, not +0+0.  If a window
should be at -0-0, one pixel of the border is off screen.
Any ideas what could have caused this?

Bye

               ^^^^

I think you mean +0+0?

I never noticed, but I seem to get the same result with 2.2.

No, I would think it *is* in fact -0-0... We're talking about the
geometry being adjusted +1+1, so a window at -0-0 ends up pushing off
the bottom-right corner by one. Oops. I just noticed it this morning,
but forgot to think about it.

Oops, sorry.  Ignore my comment about 2.2.  I misunderstood the issue,
and the testing I did was flawed.

Don't worry, I will finish the GFvwmDebug module first, and later I will
probabily do a GtkFvwmIconMan.

Ok, now I will send an attachment with the files. Please forgive me for not
using CVS yet, because
altought I have been using RCS for some work, I don't know CVS at all and I
have a slow dial-up link.
I have tried to make a proper Makefile.am and modified configure.in to enable
C++, I will read the autoconf, automake doc as soon as possible.
Mean while would you be so nice of uploading my code in my behalf and chek th
Makefile.am and configure.in files.
I am using the fvwm-2.3.9.tar.gz
Thanks a lot.

Just done, and I must say that the new API is cleaner.

Forget about the function beacuse with the new module API is not neccesary.
The modifications I have made is to make C++ compilers aware that fvwmlib.a
is a C library and there are no problems with linking.
There should not be any problems of portability with C++ compilers, I write
Object Oriented programs that compiles under Visual C++, gnu C++  and
SGI C++.

So it can be linked by other languages as C++ or something more exotic
without having linking problems. See the my code to see how I have had to
define it to avoid linking problems.

I have just seen it :-D
Sorry but altought I have heard that Gtk and Qt are similar I only have
experience with Gtk, so I will go for a GtkFvwmIconMan.

Just want to point out that if you have a slow link you should
definitely _prefer_ CVS.  CVS will only update files that have changed
and only download diffs (patches) and automatically apply them for you:
it will be a lot faster and a lot less bandwidth than downloading a
large .tar.gz file every time you want to update.

We have pretty decent instructions on using CVS on the FVWM web page.
It's not hard at all, really, since you won't be committing anything
(yet?) just updating.

Of course, you do need CVS installed on your system.

No, I mean -0-0.

> > Any ideas what could have caused this?

Actually I noticed that this depends on gravity. A window
with NW gravity is shifted down and right while a window
with SE gravity is shifted up and left. Thus, what I said
was incorrect: a -0-0 window is shown at -1-1, not at
'-(-1)-(-1)' as I claimed. Notheless it is a bug.

Ah, the problem with C++ compilers is not the code you write but that
you rarely find a properly installed compiler. At the moment I am the
one who builds our releases. If we add a C++ module I will be unable
to do so because by Linux distribution comes with a screwed up
g++ installation.

At the moment menus use these tab-related key bindings:

  tab                 down 1 item
  alt-tab             up 1 section
  shift-tab           up 1 item
  shift-alt-tab       up 1 item
  ctrl-shift-tab      up 1 item
  ctrl-shift-alt-tab  up 1 item
  crtl-tab            down 5 items
  ctrl-alt-tab        down 5 items

Am I the only one who thinks these bindings are confusing at best?
I suggest to change these so that you don't have to press three
keys to use the 'alt-tab' feature:

basic navigation:

 !tab                 up 1 item (easier than alt-shift-tab)
 !alt-tab             down 1 item (like in &%!&$95)
 !shift-tab           up1 section
 !shift-alt-tab       down 1 section
  crtl-tab            down 5 items
 !ctrl-shift-tab      up 5 items
  ctrl-shift-alt-tab  don't care
  ctrl-alt-tab        don't care

This should allow consistent one-hand navigation.  Since I never
use the windowlist myself I wanted to get some feedback before I
change anything.

I'm at home stuck using Exceed right now and I just discovered
that so far I'm unable to get Exceed to give the "alt" to fvwm,
so I can't test anything.

"tab" going up is counter intuitive.  I still like down 1 item.
"alt-tab" going down sounds good (partly because its like &%!&$95,
      partly because I don't know what a section is).
"shift-alt-tab" I think should remain up 1 item (because its intuitive,
      and it mimicks &%!&$95.)
"shift-tab" same as "shift-alt-tab".

I don't use any of the other "tab" variations so I don't care either.

The WindowList isn't my favorite way to switch windows, but I confess
to resorting to it once and a while.

What we really need in the windowlist is an option that would allow
the alt key being released to select the current item.

I thought that tab = up is easier to get than alt-shift-tab. The
general rule is that pressing/releasing alt reverses the direction.
Although I find this more intuitive than a 3-key combination, it
would definitely be confusing in normal menus (but then there is
no reason to hit tab in a menu).

> "alt-tab" going down sounds good (partly because its like &%!&$95,

A section is made up of the menu entries between two separators. In
case of winlist I think each desk has it's own section (I didn't try
it).

Since I coded the '*FvwmPagerSloppyFocus' option I find myself
usding this primarily to switch pages (pointing in the pager
sets focus just like SloppyFocus). Unforunately there is a
extremely annoying race condition with fvwm:

  1) I start on page x, move the pointer over a window in
     the pager (on page y) and click button 1 to switch
     pages.
  2) Out of habit I move the pointer towards where the
     window will appear. Unfortunately there is another window
     in between (in the pager), i.e. to move the pointer out
     of the pager I have to pass over another mini-window in
     the pager.
  3) fvwm switches the page, the pointer ends up in the window
     where I wanted it, but the other window the pointer passed
     over has the focus.

This is easy to explain:

  When I click on the window, fvwm is busy for a few moments
  because it has to unmap/map windows (rxvts with xpm background
  make it even worse). Then, before fvwm has switched the page,
  the pager sends another 'Focus' command for the window the
  pointer passed over. Fvwm finishes switching the page. At this
  moment there is an 'EnterNotify' on the X queue and a 'Focus'
  command in the module pipe. Fvwm handles the event first, then
  the 'Focus' command - and the focus ends up in the wrong window.

  How could we prevent this? Perhaps the pager could ignore
  'EnterNotify' events on its subwindows until fvwm has finished
  switching pages. But then fvwm might have already put new
  messages in the module pipe. Any ideas?

Has anyone looked at Matt's GNOME enhancements?  I haven't seen any CVS
notices about them go by, so I guess they haven't been merged?

I don't know much about GNOME but from the descriptions of the changes
they look useful.

Does anyone who _does_ know something about it have an opinion?

It may be easier on the fingers but I only made tab work in menus
because I was trying to emulate something.

I think you hit on a key point.  The "tab" stuff is  not for menus.  I
would guess that shift-tab  is never used in #$%^  or fvwm, its easier
to  pound on tab  a  few times.  I  only  added  shift-tab to  emulate
something.

You're right about sections, I just managed to try it out, but use the
WindowList a few times,  just to see what it  does.  Don't worry,  you
won't get addicted.

I agree for menus, but I'm unable to think of an easier way to switch
windows with 1 hand and a windowlist.

Last year we were seeking improved Gnome documentation.  I think the
response then made it clear that we are "Gnome Challenged".

No, sorry. I had written a reply asking a few question about his
patches, but it got lost over a mail server crash here and I didn't
have the time to write it again yet. I guess since Matthias Claasen
has vanished (or are you still lurking in the background, Matthias?),
we have nobody with good knowledge of the GNOME patches. Personally
I don't want to spend much time for it myself since most of the stuff
Matt coded will be obsolete with the next version of the GNOME/KDE
specs anyway.

The same feeling here. Besides I don't have time to hack fvwm anyway.

Hello,
>From WinList Man page (added recently by Dominik):

*FvwmWinListAction action response 
Tells FvwmWinList to do response when action is done. The currently
supported action s are: Click1, Click2, Click3. The currently supported
response s are any fvwm built-in commands, including modules and functions. Warning: Use of the former syntax that allowed to use comma separated lists
of commands is strongly discouraged due to synchronization problems with fvwm.
Please use complex fvwm functions instead (defined with the 'AddToFunc command
of fvwm).

I am agree with this and I have put the same warning in the TaskBar 
Man page. Unfortunately, the defaults Click 1 action in WinList and 
TaskBar use the hold syntax (this cause a mini-bug in TaskBar if you
do not change the default by a (complexe/builtin) function and you
use NoIconAction).
In WinList "Iconify -1, Raise", in TaskBar "Iconify -1, Raise, Focus".

So, I think that we need to change these defaults. Here some possibilities:
1. Add two builtins DeiconifyAndRaise and DeiconifyAndFocus
2. Add one builtin DeiconifyAndFocus and change WinList default
3. Add one builtin DeiconifyAndRaise and change TaskBar default
4. Set the defaults to Nop
5. Change nothing

Some votes ? Or a better suggestion ?

Olivier

Fvwm queries the X server for the range of useful keycodes.
If you fetch fvwm-2.3.9 you will find around line 223 of
libs/Bindings.c (don't confuse it with fvwm/bindings.c):

    if (type == KEY_BINDING)
    {
      XDisplayKeycodes(dpy, &min, &max);
      maxmods = 8;
    }

Could you add

    fprintf(stderr,"kexcodes: %d - %d\n" min, max);

after the call to XDisplayKeycodes? Perhaps the keys you have
are not in the allowed range?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hello Matthias,
I currently work on the "Lock on send logic" in fvwm. In fact,
as Tim Phipps suggested, we are going to probably replace M_LOCKONSEND
in "message mask" by a separated mask (which defines on which messages
the fvwm-to-module communication need to be lock on send).
All the modules are ready except FvwmGtk. In fact I'm
quite surprised by the fact that FvwmGtk is lock on send. However I know
nothing about gtk programming and do not study in depth FvwmGtk ...
So, is FvwmGtk really need to be lock on send ? If yes, can you
say on which messages FvwmGtk need to be lock on send.
Many thanks, Olivier.

Unfortunatly my memory is a bit foggy, but I remember that I needed
LOCKONSEND since fvwm would otherwise not send the M_STRING message
triggering the menu popup until it has seen the button-release event.
This is of course bad, since FvwmGtk wants to have the button-release
event. Thus I guess M_STRING is the only one for which it needs 
LOCKONSEND, since that is the message which triggers the menu popup. 

I hope this helps.

If I remember correctly there is no real problem with these defaults.
The problem arises when you use constructs like 'Next (rxvt) focus',
so keeping these wouldn't hurt too much. Of course a default like
'WindowListFunc' would be better. We can add the necessary functions
to ConfigFvwmDefaults

Maybe instead of this, just to implement a new mouse action in a pager
(like double clicking on a window), which switches to that window,
focuses it and moves a pointer to it.

Should this action also raise the window? I think it just may be a
configurable function. If already, how about a mapping of any mouse/key
in a pager to any fvwm command? This can be not easy, sometimes the same
key action should be in a window context, sometimes - in a page/desk
context (see the current mouse key 2) and we have no if's in functions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Did you mean "up 1 section" here?
Unfortunately, my shift combinations are just ignored (they worked some
time ago and I have no time to track this), so I can't test this one.

I think that only ctrl bindings are confusing and never used anyway.

But tab is "down 1 item" in all toolkits. shift-tab is "up 1 item".

Sorry, I think the current situation is much better than this.

WindowList and normal menus should use the same keys (an option to switch
alt mapping is a bad idea, IMHO). Since alt bindings (for sections) are
added only recently and ctrl bindings are not used anyway, I think, you
can just bind ctrl for sections and use alt to emulate windows or anything
else (in case someone cares about windows).

So here is a possible compromise:

  tab             down 1 item
  shift-tab       up   1 item
  ctrl-tab        down 1 section
  shift-ctrl-tab  up   1 section
  alt*-tab        don't care, may be like Dan or you suggested

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
I've just downloaded and compiled the latest/greatest and I've noticed
that suddenly the buttons on the frame have stopped working. I can
still resize windows and move them around, but I can't minimise
anything any more.

Does anyone know what's happened?
Cheers,
Chris.

Hi,
After a bit more experimenting, I have concluded that frame-buttons
for the latest/greatest CVS version fail to work if (and only if) the
window currently has focus.

Cheers,
Chris.

--this-is-a-MIME-boundary-bork-bork
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi, as promised, I've completed some patches to FvwmBacker. The
primary change I made is to replace the config command FvwmBackerDesk
with FvwmBackerCommand (Desk x y). In the process of changing things,
I also discovered and fixed a bug involving negative desk numbers, and
converted FvwmBacker from using an action table to a linked list of
commands. Here's the changelog:

1999-11-13  Michael Han  <mikehan@best.com>

        * FvwmBacker/FvwmBacker.c: Added page-awareness; converted to
        linked list of commands instead of table (to fix bugs caused
        if DesktopSize changes or if desktop is negative).
        * FvwmBacker/FvwmBacker.1: Documented page-awareness

And the patch is attached.

 .SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
 The following is the only supported option at present:
 
-.IP "*FvwmBackerDesk \fIDeskNumber command | -solid color | colorset n\fP"
-Specifies the \fIcommand\fP to execute when the specified
-\fIDeskNumber\fP becomes active.
+.IP "*FvwmBackerCommand \fI(Desk PageX PageY) command\fP"
+Specifies the \fIcommand\fP to execute when the viewport matches the
+arguments for the desk, x coordinate and y coordinate. Any or all of
+these arguments can be replaced with an asterisk (*) to indicate that
+any value matches.
 
-If the next word is \fI-solid\fP FvwmBacker uses the next
+If the \fIcommand\fP is \fI-solid\fP FvwmBacker uses the next
 argument as a color in the X database and sets the background to that
 color without generating a system call to xsetroot (only single word
 color names may be used).
 
-If the next word is \fIcolorset\fP FvwmBacker uses the background
+If the \fIcommand\fP is \fIcolorset\fP FvwmBacker uses the background
 specified in colorset \fIn\fP for the given desk.  Please refer to
 the man page of the FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.
 
 Otherwise the command is sent to fvwm to execute.
 
+.SH OLD-STYLE OPTIONS
+There is continued support for the now deprecated option:
+
+.IP "*FvwmBackerDesk \fIDesk command\fP"

+It is functionally equivalent to using an asterisk for both page
+coordinates with \fI*FvwmBackerCommand\fP.

I have problems with this patch. Old syntax actually is not emulated.

  *FvwmBackerDesk 0 Colorset 15

gives

  [FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command '0'

I didn't manage to get a new syntax working well too:

  *FvwmBackerCommand (0 * 0) Colorset 1
  *FvwmBackerCommand (0 * 1) Colorset 3

always sets Colorset 1 for me (-solid instead of Colorset works well).

And the new syntax is still fixed. I would like more an extendable
syntax, also using 3 integers seems a bit cryptic to me, the tokens
Desk & Page would clarify them, i.e.:

  *FvwmBackerCommand ()         colorset 0
  *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 1)   colorset 1
  *FvwmBackerCommand (Page 0 1) colorset 2

instead of:

  *FvwmBackerCommand (* * *) colorset 0
  *FvwmBackerCommand (1 * *) colorset 1
  *FvwmBackerCommand (* 0 1) colorset 2

I can do this syntax change myself if you agree.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Oops. I think I forgot to adjust the Desk case when I redid the
Command case...

It appears I didn't test things comprehensively... Sorry all.

Sounds fine to me if you want to make the changes... I actually wanted
to get this out, because I've got to be out of town next week and
wouldn't have time/opportunity to work on it further until next
weekend. So if you want to fix things up and make things more robust,
please go ahead.

I don't know what distribution you have, I don't even know if you use the Intel
architecture. I use RedHat 6.0 and goes fine.
Abyway I was using C++ because I can define variables everywhere and memory
allocation is simpler, but I have ported the code to ANSI C and also downloaded
the CVS.
I don't have writing access to the CVS tree, so to do not overcharge the list,
    do you want me to mail the sources to you ( dominik.vogt@fvwm.org ) with a
ChangeLog and you do the update ?

If the zipped files are not very large (>50k), you can send
them to the list so that everybody can have a look at the module.

Although having definable actions bound to the pager buttons
would be great (it's already on the enhancements list in
Jitterbug), this won't help with my problem. I don't want
that the pager warps the cursor. The problem is that I do
something that might as well be an intentional user action.
I guess this will trigger some bug reports in the future.

Yes. I forgot to to use the new 'decor_w' instead of the 'frame'
in focus.c at two places (but did it right at a third). Fixed
now.

There are still problems with NoHandles windows, the border can be
accessed only when the window is going to change its focus state during
this click.

Also it seems strange to me that FvwmWinList is always NoHandles, even
with 'Style FvwmWinList Handles'. I don't remember seeing this before.

Regarding the new menu tab bidings - seems good with me except of one bug.
Here is a patch to menus.c to fix it:

RCS file: /home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm/fvwm/menus.c,v

diff -u -r1.155 menus.c

+	items_to_move = -1;
 	break;
       case 4:

But my Shift combinations are ignored for me anyway, here is why:
  XK_Tab=65289
  keysym=65289 (tab)
  keysym=65505 (shift-tab)

so (case XK_Tab) is not handled.
BTW, shift-tab works just well in my motif (netscape).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I love you and want to have your children :), that titleatbottom is
fantastic and shades very smooth,  Now I can have Licq shaded at the
bottom of the screen and don't have to move the window around to see it
when I unshade it.  And the shaded windows look much cleaner also.

Really a very good idea ! 
May be all your works on style, decoration, add window ... allows

Yes it is fast now !
You say in previous changelog that "Most styles can be updates 
w/o recapture now (except UseStyle, HandleWidth and BorderWidth)"
However it seems that HandleWidth and BorderWidth works except
for the "resizing windows step". I am ready to modify the TaskBar 
(and eventually WinList) for that the things works well after a 
modification of the HandleWidth and BorderWidth.

Not my idea. We got several requests for this feature.

Perhaps if I have time.

Yes, but this is the crucial step. The other code for it is
already written because of the other styles. BTW, title/notitle
suffer from the same cause.

Which will be in a year or so... Personally, I'm swamped right now - but
I'd like the patches integrated if they don't ruin something else.

Hello,
I've got a core dump if I popup a menu by clicking on the frame
(in fact when I leave the menu).
the patch below solves this but I do not apply it because I do not
think it is the good solution.

I have made my own version of the fix. Can you try it, please?

I've autoconfiscated wm-icons this afternoon.  I have a few questions
before I make it available for testing.

Firstly, there are currently 15 sets of icons.  It would make sense to
split them into about 4 sets, one base one which is always installed
and three optional ones which can be installed via --enable-martyr or
something like that.  Or would we want to be able to selectively
choose each individual set?

Also, is there ever any need to install the 01x01-templates directory,
or should that remain in the source package only?

Another thing: I presume it would be preferable to have the scripts
written as shell scripts rather than Perl scripts?

   Julian

Grouping is good enough. I definitely prefer 4 questions instead of
15 or --enable-*.

Like we have discussed already, the packages can be:
  * wm-icons-base
  * wm-icons-general   (or should it be included in base?)
  * wm-icons-penguins  (they are so cute, include into base?)
  * wm-icons-kde
  * wm-icons-3dpixmaps
  * wm-icons-martys

> Also, is there ever any need to install the 01x01-templates directory,

If you choose to create a wm-icons-devel package directory, it should go
there, otherwise - remain in the source package only.

> Another thing: I presume it would be preferable to have the scripts

There are 3 kinds of scripts:
  * ./configure    - I am going to switch to autoconf
  * in bin/        - probably can be converted to .sh, but not now
  * in devel/bin/  - can remain in perl

Unfortunately I have not much time this month even to switch to autoconf.
I would like someone to help with this (Paul?).
Thank you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think this means you need to do a cvs update to get the latest (then
probably resolve some conflicts, since it's a ChangeLog).

I've *DONE* the work in converting to autoconf.  Please don't bother
to do it again!

OK, so I'll do the following:

(01x01-template      None)
14x14-general        base
16x16-general        base
16x16-kde            kde
17x14-3dpixmaps      3dpixmaps
20x20-martys         martyrs
20x20-martys2        martyrs
21x18-3dpixmaps      3dpixmaps
32x32-kde            kde
32x32-kde2           kde
44x52-penguins       penguins
48x48-general        base
48x48-kde2           kde
56x46-3dpixmaps      3dpixmaps
56x56-martys         martyrs
56x56-martys2        martyrs

That's one base and four optional sections.

Almost done.

Working on it ;)

Agreed.

I'll let you all have the results in a day or two.

Ah, is this a new jargon, I mean "autoconfiscated"? :)

I always wanted to know why you spell it "martyr"? :)

Ok. This just mean that we badly need to clean general icon sets, included
with the base.

Fine. Take your time.

It sounds like Julian is already doing it.  Which is good, because I'd
like to help but I'm completely over my head right now, and have been
since Sept.  No idea when the madness wil abate...  I don't even get to
update my FVWM sources more than once a week or so :).

Anyway, I don't have time to convert anything myself but I'll be happy
to check out the good work I'm sure Julian is doing, when he's done, and
make comments or send patches if there are any to be made or sent.

I'm much less optimistic about the mythical WM unification.  As far as I
can tell, that effort is going nowhere pretty quickly.  I think holding
off waiting for it isn't a good idea.

The patches look like good stuff to me, although I don't use GNOME much
(at all).  If no one has any problem with them I'll try to find some
time to apply them.

Hello,
can you say more on this hang: is it a crash (without core file) or
a fvwm freeze ?
In fact I have noted some random TaskBar and WinList crash without 
core file. I have worked on these last night and I see that in fact
the problem come from SendFvwmPipe and that fvwm2 kill the The TaskBar
and WinList in HandleModuleInput (from modules_interface.c) !
It seems to me that IconMan do not have *this* problem and I have
use the SendFvwmPipe of IconMan in TasBar and WinList and the problem
disappear. So, before committing this change I will be interested to
know more on the IconMan hang that you mention.
I say that the TasBar and WinList crash are random, but you may try to
reproduce it at follows:

Open a lot of windows (may help)
Use an app "xyz" which is starticonified.
Do a Recapture
Click on the button which represent "xyz" to deiconify it
Play a little bit with this button
Do a Recapture
Click on the button which represent "xyz" to deiconify it
...

In my machine TaskBar and WinList usually crash at the first or second step.
May be these crash are the crash that mention Nadim Saeed few weeks ago ...

I didn't want to say that I'm against including any patches, just
that personally I won't spend time to understand the old spec when
I'm participating in the 2.0 discussion myself.  And I'm not using
GNOME at all.

That would be great.

It does not write to the source directory on "make install" now.

Hm, I have no problem with the pager. It's a bit confusing
because the shaded window seems to jump down a few pixels
if you have a small pager window, but that's caused by the
minimum window size in the pager.

Subject: compile error regarding extras/FvwmConfig/WinBase.C with HP-UX 10.20 and gcc 2.95.2

Full_Name: Thomas Anders
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: HP-UX 10.20
X_Server: XFree 3.3.5
Submission from: (NULL) (134.30.15.45)


When compiling fvwm 2.2.2 with gcc 2.95.2 on a HP-UX 10.20 system,
there's one small glitch:

foo# g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../../libs -I/net/usr/include \
    -I/usr/X11R6/include -fpermissive -c WinBase.C
[...]
WinBase.C: In function `int My_XNextEvent(Display *, XEvent *)':
WinBase.C:985: passing `int *' as argument 2 of `select(int, fd_set *,
fd_set *, fd_set *, timeval *)'
*** Error exit code 1
[...]
foo#

The relevant portion of extras/FvwmConfig/WinBase.C is line 984-988:
#ifdef __hpux
  retval=select(fd_width,(int *)&in_fdset, (int *)&out_fdset,0, NULL);
#else
  retval=select(fd_width,&in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, NULL);
#endif

Apparently there shouldn't be a special case for HP-UX (at least for
10.20).
After removing line 984-986,988 compilation succeeded.


Hope this helps,
Thomas

I'm not sure where the problem is but I'm sure someone out there knows
what they did.  With current CVS if you select move from a menu or type
it into FvwmConsole you get the window selection cursor (as expected)
then you click and hold inside a window the cursor changes to a move
cursor (as expected), however the window doesn't actually move when you
move the mouse, you need to release the mouse and press it again, upon
this first release you don't loos the move cursor.

As I said I'm not sure what the problem here is something in events.c
I'm guessing, but I figured someone would remember this if I brought it
up.

It was a deadlock caused by FvwmIconMan doing an XSync() when fvwm had
the server grabbed. It doesn't happen now that FvwmIconMan uses a sync
mask for messages.

Cheers,

Maybe once FvwmPager has sent the first focus command the
*FvwmPagerSloppyFocus should be turned off until the M_FOCUS message
comes back from fvwm that matches the window id. The the sloppyfocus
behaviour could be turned on again.

Thank you very much, here there are the makefile.am diff so they take
into account the new module directory, and all the files that go into
the subdirectory: "fvwm/modules/GFvwmDebug"

patchfile -> patch file for the existing ones.
GFvwmDebug.zip -> the zipped directory contents.

Please let me know your opinion about the module.

Bye and thank again,

	JCT.

Just downloaded the above noted snapshot.  After a configure and make, I get
the following error;

make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `fvwmDragWell.h'
Current working directory /usr13/new/fvwm-snap-19991118/modules/FvwmDragWell

The following files are missing in .../modules/FvwmDragWell

  fvwmDragWell.h dragSource.h cursorStuff.h commonStuff.h

Was the snapshot built correctly ?

Yeah. When I updated my CVS tree after the addition of FvwmDragWell I
got this until I did an:

automake --add-missing
autoreconf

which creates Makefile.in. I think the CVS source isn't supposed to
contain Makefile.in anymore, but I thought that snapshots were
supposed to be ready for compilation, even w/o the full GNu auto*,
gcc, gmake setup.

Unless I'm totally confused, in which case you should ignore me.

Three (3) debug issues here:

1. With the same setup file that I've been using for awhile now (again, no

   pixmaps are there).  When I switch to 2.3.9 everything is cool.

2. Noticed below noted error and investigated the 'make'.  It doesn't look
   like that module is being compiled in module/FvwmBanner.  Possible Makefile
   problem ?  I tried a "make" in that subdir and nothing (no executable...

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmBanner' in ModulePath

3. Relating to the bug I reported awhile back on Oct 14, 1999,
   (http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9910/msg00378.html).  With Oliver's
   new printfs (good call), we are now at least getting some message outputs

Hi,

I don't understand what this is:

  *FvwmTaskBarGeometry {+-}<X>x{+-}<Y>

it looks like an example would be:

+0x-0

If this is just the location part of a geometry, shouldn't it be:

+0-0

Is the "x" just a typo?

Since  this isn't  a normal geometry   specification perhaps it should
have another name.

Find, my intution on your problem was almost good (almost because
I never had this error in my machine, but an other one which is very similar).
The message means that WinList is (probably) the 3th module that you run
at startup, that winlist "send a message of size 4" but that fvwm can
not read it (read 0 byte).
Now, the point is to know if the snap-19991118 contains or not my fix
to this problem (commit of olicha  99/11/18 15:08:54).
We can wait the next snap, but can you go in the source at libs/Module.h
and see if there are the word "SendFvwmPipe" in it ?
If not, please, try the next snap ... If yes @#!#*$!

Yes it is just a typo. When the taskbar parse the configline it reads
*FvwmTaskBarGeometry as an X geometry and use it as it is  one but
your are true only the position part is taken in account.

Agree with you, Location or Position will be more intuitive. But, I think
that we have to be backward compatible with "Geometry", so I am not sure
that we have to do the change ... ?

This should be fixed in the next snapshot.  fvwmDragWell.h wasn't in the
Makefile.am that is used to build the snapshots but it was in CVS.

Since it was a typo, and since, without the "x" it is a valid Geometry
specification, you've convinced me that calling it a Geometry is fine.

I have to make some adjustments, so don't worry about fixing that in
the documentation.

Hello Dominik,
If you decide to add the Style TitleOnTheLeft, I am ready to add to
the library the rotated X font utility of Alan Richardson (under GPL,
it is used in wmx and wm2). I study a little bit this "library" and look
at the fvwm border code and perhaps this will simplify the implementation
of TitleOnTheLeft and will give a better look than a title of the form

  x
  t
  e
  r
  m

There is only a little work to do on this utility to put it in libs/
(in particular add some internal doc).

I'm just putting my test version of wm-icons 0.2.4 which is now
autoconfiscated on my college machine at
http://www.maths.qmw.ac.uk/~jdg/wm-icons-0.2.4.tar.gz.  Please have a
look at it and let me know what you think and whether it works for
you.  As always, more documentation is needed!

Also, as the GNU project does not believe in /usr/(share/)doc, there
is no support for plain text documentation in autoconf.  (At least,
that's the way I understand it.)  Not sure what to do about this at
present -- will need to think about it.

Dominik,
I just noticed this one and thaught I'd let you know that lines like 
Style "app" MiniIcon mini.xhippo.xpm
don't get updated until you do a recapture or recapturewindow.  I hadn't
heard you mention this before so I thought it might have been missed.

I can't confirm this. For me both Icon and MiniIcon style changes get
updated without recapture.

Not quite related to this. I wish to have time to implement a new command
ReloadIcons for reloading all icons (in case they were changed on disk).

Another thing. Maybe auto-style-update is not always good. What if you
have 1000 style lines in your config file?

Mikhael.

You scared me there for a second Tim I was sure I had killed the
colorset related bugs in FvwmIconMan, it seems you are speeking of
FvwmIconBox, since I started the colorset work on both of these I can
take a look, but could you clarify that all of the mentioned problems
are with IconBox and not IconMan.

This, along with the FvwmDragWell's missing header files, is fixed in
'fvwm-snap-19991119' (thanks Tim).

Cool.  I wasn't able to get FvwmWinList to disappear (tried for a good =
4-5
minutes - good work Olivier).  I am still noticing the occasional weird=

geometry calculation though; here's a way to reproduce it,

Make sure you have a running FvwmWinList
1. iconfiy an xterm (any which way - middle button on FvwmWinList would=
 do)
2. right mouse click on the iconified window in FvwmWinList (my setting=
s are
   noted below) and you'll note the strange location geometry in the fe=
edback
   window (something along the lines of "-315 +636831")
3. since one is unable to see the window to move it (ie. no skeleton), =
if one
   presses the middle button (or ESC) the window will reappear on the s=
creen
   but not FvwmPager

NOTE: if you skip step #1 above everything works great..

Here are the relevant parts of my FvwmWinList setting,

# FvwmWinList
#

AddToFunc goto_it
+       "I" iconify off
+       "I" raise
+       "I" focus
+       "I" warptowindow 50 50

*FvwmWinListBack Gray59
*FvwmWinListFore Yellow
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise, Focus, WarpToWindow 50 50=

*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, move
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList

Keep up the GREAT work guys...

I think the status of this is that we agreed with this but its really
an issue for the "configure" developers, not fvwm.

I don't know if this will help you, but my "configure" command line
is way too long for me to consider typing it in by hand so I have it
in a shell.  I guess you could export LDFLAGS in the shell, but I did it
with this argument:

  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib\

The  "x-libraries" get put into  a "-R" argument  and my xpm libraries
are in /opt/public/lib.

Either way, a little automation should help you out.

I like this autoconf'ing, amazing work.
There are several problems with this 0.2.4 version. A quick fix:
executing 'touch wm-icons-fix-old-rc' for make to pass.  wm-icons-config
has a new interface, so all menu actions should be updated and more...

I am locking wm-icons and will release 0.2.5 tomorrow (with all my fixes
and updates) in http://wm-icons.dhs.org/ - no additional announcement.

Do we need a CVS? The problem is symbolic links, which CVS does not
support. I can set up a wrapper my-cvs to "solve" this problem:

  #!/bin/sh

  make pack-symlinks    # creates _links.lst
  cvs "$@"
  make unpack-symlinks  # restores symlinks

A better solution? But the question is whether CVS is needed at all.
Does someone else want to have write permissions in wm-icons project?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,
If I type Move in FvwmConsole then I do not have the selection cursor 
but the move cursor and I do not have your problem. If I type "Pick Move"
then I have the selection cursor and after selection I can move without
holding (need to click to stop the move) or with holding.
Is your move a complex function ? Sorry if I missunderstand something.

I got the behaviour of Move and company that Brad described few days ago,
but just before Brad's posting, the code in CVS changed that behaviour to
what you (Olivier) describe.

> If I type Move in FvwmConsole then I do not have the selection cursor

I remember the usual behaviour is to do "Pick Move" on "Move" in
non-window context. Why this was changed some days ago? Not that I am
against this change, it is a matter of one's habit.

Mikhael.

In FvwmIconMan (x.c) there is some code:

      while (XPending(theDisplay) &&
         XCheckMaskEvent(theDisplay, ConfigureNotify, &theEvent))
      {
        ...
      }

For weeks I chased a bug that caused the icon man to use
a screded up internal geometry.  Finally I figured out
that this is because sometimes (perhaps once for thirty
icon managers), an EnterNotify event slips into the loop
body.  I can't understand how this can happen (other than
an X server bug).  I'm confused.

Wow, if you ever have the time: good luck. Not quite the
easiest task to start with.

The fvwm will wait until the file is completely read before
updating a single window.  I'm more worried about module
input if he module is not fast enough.  I haven't yet tried
this, but I guess the redraw-minimising code still need to
be improved.

As far as I know my changes might have caused that.  The change you
notice is simply a bugfix.  Previously the 'select' cursor was used
for 'Move' and the 'move' cursor for 'MoveToPage'.  It should have
been vice versa. The binding problem is probably one of the (already
fixed) bugs introduced with the decor_w patch.

Does anybody remember what this piece of code in
module_interface.c (HandleModuleInput) is good for?

    if(tmp_win)
    {
      if (!IS_ICONIFIED(tmp_win))
      {
        Event.xbutton.x_root = tmp_win->frame_g.x;
        Event.xbutton.y_root = tmp_win->frame_g.y;
      }
      else
      {
        Event.xbutton.x_root = tmp_win->icon_x_loc;
        Event.xbutton.y_root = tmp_win->icon_y_loc;
      }
    }
      else
    {
          XQueryPointer(dpy, Scr.Root, &JunkRoot, &JunkChild, &JunkX,&JunkY,
                        &Event.xbutton.x_root,&Event.xbutton.y_root,&JunkMask);
    }

I understand why we need to fake a ButtonPress, but why
is it necessary to make it look as if it was at the position
of the frame window instead of the real pointer position?
Is this necessary for some cryptic functions sent by modules?
Or can we simply alwasy call XQueryPointer?

There are two problems:

 1) A bug in the module code; I've fixed this one, but I'm not
    sure if the fix is okay.

 2) Don't use a comma separated function list, use a fvwm
    function instead.

Furthermore you can now tell 'Move' to place the window at
the mouse position. Try this config:

  AddToFunc DeiconifyAndMove
  + i iconify off
  + i move m+0 m+0
  + i move

  *FvwmWinListAction Click3 function DeiconifyAndMove

Brad, are you sure your version is up to date?  I definitely adapted
the MiniIcons code to handle updates at run time, and it works
for me with window buttons and all modules.  You mentioned another
problem with 'move' from a menu, and I don't see this problem either.
If this a real problem I need more information (bindings, focus
policy, where is the menu invoked from, globalopts affecting focus
policy, ...).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Log message:
* Handle borderwidth/handlewidth changes without recapture.
* module commands don't fake a ButtonPress with the frame location;
XQueryPointer is always used.
* A 'm' before the move arguments denotes movement relative to current
mouse position.
* Changing the window font now honours the gravity
* Hopefully fixed all 'sticky window' bugs once and for all (session manager).
* Shading/unshading is perfectly smooth now, even with bottom titles.
* Fixed bug: maximize on pages other than 0-0, 0-1, 1-0 and 1-1 didn't work if
the window was not visible.
* X server bug (?) workaround in icon man.
* Fixed FvwmCommand pipe names.
* Fixed drawing bug in icon man.
* Fixed size of mini icons in win list.
* XFree86 bug workaround (ButtonRelease event displaced).
* -Wall fix.
* Fixed typo in FvwmTaskBar man page.
* removed GRADIENT_BUTTONS, PIXMAP_BUTTONS, VECTOR_BUTTONS, BORDERSTYLE,
EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE, ACTIVEDOWN_BTNS and INACTIVE_BTNS options
* nearly a complete rewrite of the sizing and positioning bits in the
FvwmWindow structure. Had to touch many, many files and functions, but
I hope the benefit is that all calculations are much easier now.
Perhaps the most important change is that the normal_g/max_g members
now are the authorative source of the window position. Whenever the
frame is moved, the 'update_absolute_geometry' function has to be
called to re-adjust the appropriate values. Even if the window is
maximized the code moves the normal geometry if the maximized window
gets too far away from its unmaximized version, i.e. if the maximized
window is moved by more than a page width or height. This may cause
that a window in unmaximized off screen if the viewport is not at a
page boundary, but at least it's consistent. The absolute geometry of
sticky windows is updated when the viewport is moved. Thus, sticking
a window now is as easy as resetting the flag.
I have scrapped the xdiff/ydiff members of the FvwmWindow structure.
There are now some functions for decorating, moving, resizing, etc.
a window while taking gravity into account.

I have not resisted to send the attached screen shot to every body.
I do the FvwmIdentVertical option only for testing propose but if 
every body want it I can add the option ... ;o)

Great commit! Although I had no chance to learn all aspects of it,
but I am sure the code is more structured now.

Shading is smooth as only possible (for bottom titles as well).
Sticky windows in restarts are ok and Recapture in SM works.

Negative mouse diffs in Move work somewhat unexpectedly (I think that
gravity should not be taken for this case).

"Workaround for buggy XFree86" produces bad results for me.
The pager immediately changes its size to some unknown (fixed?) value.

Mikhael.

The problem was in the wrong calculating of xdiff/ydiff for windows
started by session manager (gnome-session). I was not sure how to fix it.

With the latest Dominik's changes, xdiff/ydiff were scrapped.
And now Recapture (and RecaptureWindow) works well for all windows.
Shading flag is not preserved though.

Actually there are still (yes) problems with session code, which can cause
"disappearing" on Restart (a wrong page).

Mikhael.

That is why I rewrote the code :-)

WHat do you mean?  I didn't touch the 'shade' flag in the sessin
manager and it still works for me.  If you mean that the 'shade'
flag is not preserved without the SM: we have known that for
several months. The 'iconified' state isn't preserved either
(it's even on the to do list).

I need a bit more details :) But in general I think that it's
not possible anymore that the SM screws window positions up
since it simply stores the absolute position now.  I didn't
address icon locations yet.

Uh, what are 'negative mouse diffs in Move'?

??? But surely not because of the code I wrote!  Did you try
to remove it?  It's in x_pager.c around line 1520ff.  This
only prevents that you switch to a random page if you click
and the immediately flick the mouse off the pager.  XFree
sometimes reports that the click occured outside the pager,
and the calculations which use 'modulo' screw up completely
when calculating the desk number.  This shouldn't affect
the pager geometry.

I mean that RecaptureWindow for a shaded window unshades it (this is not
related to your latest changes nor to a session code). RecaptureWindow for
iconified windows leaves them iconified.

Yes, recapture un-shades for the same reason that restart
un-shades.  Now that you mention it I wonder why it doesn't
iconify.  There's no real difference between a recapture and
a restart. or is it?

No, restart restores all flags (using a session code).
Quit and then Start inside X do not preserve iconified state, not Restart.

There is a recapture on restart, but they are not the same operation.
You can do Recapture in the same executable (no session code involved,
because MatchWinToSM should always return False for Recapture by itself),
while Restart lanches another fvwm executable (saves/loads session state).

With your latest changes, Recapture probably has no much sence, it just
iterates over all windows and does (Re)CaptureWindow: destroy/add window.
As far as I understand (I do not), it was used mostly for style updates.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, but without the session code it does not remember the shaded

Good grief, how did that happen?  Yes, the bugs are for FvwmIconBox. I
think my fingers have learnt how to type FvwmIconMan all by themselves.

Cheers,

Hi,

I've added Xpm support to the FvwmBacker module.

It is now faster and also saves network bandwidth, because the Xserver is
caching the background pixmaps.

The patch is made against fvwm-2.2.2, but not much have changed in FvwmBacker
recently so I think patching the CVS-tree will be a cakewalk.

Any feedback welcome, but cc to my address, because I'm not a list-member.

FvwmIconMan has a problem with the colour set implementation:
If it grows down because new windows are added, the colour set
pixmap is not stretched to fit the new box.  Just take a look
at the attached screenshots.  My config:

--------------- snip ---------------
*FvwmIconMan*Action Mouse 3 N sendcommand close
*FvwmIconMan*ButtonGeometry 57x11
*FvwmIconMan*FollowFocus true

Not exactly, there was a number of changes and I am going to apply
another FvwmBacker patch in a day or two after fixing it.

Can you redo your patch against the CVS or fvwm-snap-19991124.tar.gz?
(if you feel that colorset support is not that you want, of course.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does anyone like the one pixel gap between title buttons and the menu
that is posted? In menus.c at line 2241 there are a few " + 1"'s that
could be removed if no-one objects. I used to over-ride the default
position to remove the gap but I can't do this and be able to put the
title on the bottom.

Cheers,
Tim.

Upon noticing the traffic I created I went back to look at my bindings and 
this is what I have 
Mouse 3    R       A       Popup Window-Ops Nop

DestroyMenu Window-Ops      
AddToMenu Window-Ops    "Window Ops"    Title
+       "Raise"         Raise
+       "Lower"         Function Move-or-Lower
+       "Move" 			Function Move-or-Raise

DestroyFunc Move-or-Raise  
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise "D" Raise
+       "D" WindowShade    
+       "M" Move
+       "C" Raise
+       "H" Move


Previouslly a right mouse click on root poped up my menu and I would
get a selection cursor if I choose the function called move, I could
then press the mouse button and move the mouse and the Motion binding
would be triggered, this however is nolonger the case.  If this is a bug
fix that is fine, it was just different behavior and based on commits
suprised me.

It is possible for the xserver to combine to events in one event
structure, granted its very bad manners, but nothing says it can't.  So
what is happening is for some odd reason the xserver decided to put the
enter and the configure in one struct, the simplest solution would be to
verify that you don't have and enter struct once inside the while loop.

Really? Yuck! Anyway, I wouldn't have noticed the problem if 
the values in the EnterNotify would make sense.  I don't have
the spec handy right now, but I think an EnterNotify and a
ConfigureNotiy event are incompatible because the event union
for EnterNotiy doesn't have all the fields that are necessary
for a ConfigureNotify (i.e. I got a screwed up height and 
y = -109000000 or so when I interpreted the event as a
ConfigureNotify.

If the X server did this it is definitely a bug.

Hm, the current behaviour seems to be consistent to me because
it exactly does what the function suggests.  But it was no intentional
change.  What should we do with this?

I don't care at all.  If you like it the other way, feel free
to change it.  BTW, think with the menu position arguments
you should still be able to move the menu with the 'Button#'
context rectangle of the menu position hints with something
like (untested):

  menu foo Button1 0 c-100m-100

The right setting is

  menu foo Button1 0 -100m

or 

  menu foo This 0 -100m

But if you use a nice circular gradient you get a nice looking repeating
effect.  I'll see if I can look at how to strech it on each window add and 
remove.  I guess I also need to look at multi column managers.

Hello,

Upon restarting Fvwm2 the window located directly under the mouse pointer
should have the window focus. The window should receive the focus upon
restart without having to move the mouse to the border of the window first
to give the window the focus.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice if it were possible to implement a style option 
named Focused/Unfocused so that when the window popped up it would
automatically steal the focus from another window or not receive
the focus at all, hence letting the user carry on typing in whichever
window the user was typing in.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice if it were possible to pop up the FvwmPager with a
mouseclick in the root window. The FvwmPager would have to appear in
the right position with respect to the mouse.

The latest CVS fixes the problems with restart not remembering the
iconification status.  How you fixed that I'll never know.  The startup
logic had me scratching my head.

Its funny how you fix one thing, and an old symptom keeps coming back.

After a restart, none of my root window key bindings work.  I have to
use the mouse once before they start working.

Recapture causes a wire frame to appear for one of my off screen windows.

To fvwm-workers: maybe someone can write a FAQ or html page about this?
Or a documentation in FvwmTheme.1 is enough?

Ok, it is not trivial to understand, but once you understand, it is very
simple. You can take a look at the FvwmTheme and FvwmBacker man pages.

Basically, you should run FvwmTheme module, hare are commands for .fvwm2rc:

  AddToFunc StartFunction "I" ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme

Then you should define colorsets themselves, here are some examples:

  *FvwmThemeColorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:E4/D2/C0
  *FvwmThemeColorset 1 YGradient 200 3 blue 49 navy 1 blue 50 navy
  *FvwmThemeColorset 8 Pixmap my_big_background.xpm
  *FvwmThemeColorset 9 TiledPixmap my_small_background.xpm

Then you should tell FvwmBacker to use some of the defined colorsets.

  *FvwmBackerDesk 0 Colorset 8
  *FvwmBackerDesk 1 Colorset 9

All fvwm modules and menus support colorsets. The purpose of colorsets is
to define color themes. So you can say that every module uses a colorset 0
as its main colors (background, foreground), a colorset 1 for its second
colors and so on (a man page of every module defines its colorset syntax).
The FvwmTheme man page contains many ideas.

Now, it is possible to change a look of all modules at once, just send
these commands using FvwmConsole (FvwmTheme should be running):

  SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 0 fg red bg white
  SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 8 YGradient 800 3 red 1 green 1 blue 1 red

The last command will replace my_big_background.xpm background
with a nice rainbow.

Colorsets are supposed to be used by experienced fvwm users. It is
possible to use fvwm without them.
I hope this helps.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Try:
	Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient

and press Ctrl-Mouse3.

But without this gap, with normal raised title/buttons, and bright title
and menu colors, you get white with white hilitings, or gray with gray
shadowings (for bottom titles).

My title menus are much nicer with this gap for most windows. :)

It's so simple: In events.c, in the paragraph beginning with 

  /* If the window has never been mapped before ... */

I reset isIconicState to DontCareState before calling AddWindow().
No wonder nothing restarted iconic :-)  However, now that I removed
this bit, my ddd windows are again iconified during a restart :-(

Is it really caused by this particular change?  Do the key bindings
work if you use the old events.c?

> Recapture causes a wire frame to appear for one of my off screen windows.

? As if it had 'ActivePlacement'?

Well at least it matches all the other GUI's that I can think of 8-)

You can put an arbitrary gap back by using 'Menu <whatever> this 0
100+5p'.

Where's the smiley after "It's so simple?".  (I looked thru the change
and the supporting code.)  Simple for you maybe.

This morning I'm unable to reproduce the problem.

Yes.

Actually  I  normally  run  with 2  offscreen   windows, a small  one,
(Workman)  and a large one  (Netscape).  I'm seeing the Workman window
appear during startup, but its gone by the time startup is complete.

The Netscape window is the one producing the wire frame.  When I click
or hit return, the window never shows up, its created off screen as it
should be.  So   I think its really   a problem of off screen  windows
being temporarily mapped.

The code to do this should be in the ConfigureNotify handling code
already.  I think the 'resize_manager' function would be the right
place.

Can you please think of Eterm? 8-) It has a one point gap (of dark
background or image) not to have white with white menu hilitings.

As you yourself noted no current settings are possible to justify both
titles at top and at bottom. Probably a new option can be added, which
takes into account a title placement. For example:
  Menu <name> this_for_top 0 100+5p

This means that 100+5p is valid for top titles/buttons; for bottom ones
it will become -100m-5p; and, well, you can guess, for left/right titles
it will swap coordinates too. :-)

Regards,
Mikhael.

This list server toes not reject mail coming from root.  It does reject
mail that:

1) has a syntactically incorrect envelope sender,
2) has an envelope sender containing a hostname that does not resolve,
3) comes directly from a dynamic IP address listed on the DUL,
or
4) comes directly from an address listed on the RBL or RSS.

see http://www.mail-abuse.org for the last three TLAs.  I checked over the
recent rejections and didn't see any that looked like they hit the person
reporting this issue.  I'm inclined to believe that my server had no chance
to reject their mail because it never made it this far.

Submission from: (NULL) (128.100.102.185)


 FvwmTaskBar's Start button stays depressed when pressed.
This appears to be the same bug as #185; I'm resubmitting
it because that was submitted against a 2.1.* version, and
it's not clear to me if the fix was thus supposed to be
in 2.2.2 and slipped through the cracks.

I've been playing with GNOME a little bit, and I noticed that fvwm doesn't
properly report the current row/column in the current desktop.  I'm poking
around the source to try and fix this problem, however, I'm *very*
unfamiliar with the GNOME protocol and such (if anybody has an URL that'd be
helpful to me, I'd appreciate it).  Anyway, the main side effect to this is
that the task list applet for the panel doesn't show the tasks on any
desktop except the first, and it shows them all on the first, which is
*really* annoying.  If anybody has information that'd be helpful, or if
anybody else has a clue and can do it better than I, I'd appreciate it.

Just to eliminate any confusion, this is what I'm talking about:

+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| Desk 1  | Desk 2  | Desk 3  | Desk 4  |
|_________|_________|_________|_________|
|_x__|_y__|____|____|____|____|____|____|
|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|

GNOME sees all applications on 'x', even when an application is in 'y'.  No
applications (unless they are sticky) are shown when 'y' is active.

Uh, actually it took me several hours.  The patch I made in the first
place was just plain stupid.  *Of course* you won't get iconic windows
at startup if you delete the isIconicState variable :-)  BTW, I don't
understand much of the startup code either.  Whenever something goes
wrong it's hours of debugging.

You are not using ActivePlacement for any windows, are you?

Easy.  Just restore the desk number from the value saved

You didn't mention what version of fvwm you have.

There are some patches to GNOME support from Matt Rossmiller which, I
guess, are on my plate to integrate but which I haven't yet :(.  I don't
know exactly whether they'll solve your problem (I don't use GNOME
myself), but perhaps.  Here's a copy of the text accompanying his diffs
(unfortunately I don't have a copy of the original message his refers
to, but you can go get it from the archive I'm sure):

Fixed.  The menu code overwrites the global event struct.
After the final key press, the x/y coordinates of the event
have been still over the menu.

'k, fixed this one.  I accidentally removed the focus from
Scr.NoFocusWin when changing styles (Okay, it was not really
an accident, I was just stupid).

No, it's not.  Some people have reported strange things with cursors
and decorations.  Can you please fetch a current source snapshot and
see if this problem persits (don't use 2.3.9, it  will *not* do).  I
made several changes that might affect the problem in the last few
weeks.

I don't want to say that fvwm has no GNOME problems, but I think that the
applets themselves are buggy.

AFAIK, the old applet GnomePager will not be included anymore into gnome
(too problematic?) and the substitutions DeskGuide and TaskList are still
under developement.

Try to open all three these applets, they behaviour differently (have
different bugs?). For example unlike TaskList, GnomePager do list windows
on "y" and DeskGuide even gives you to move them.

Mikhael.

Dominik,

I've downloaded and compiled the 11/23 snapshot, and I'm still seeing the
cursor corruption happening on xterm windows.

Thanks!

Hi everybody, I have been trying to commit several
bugfixes for several hours now, but to no avail.
CVS just freezes after I enter the commit message
and doesn't even terminate if I hit ^C or 'kill' it.
Guess I can't do anything about it now - but whatever
mails I wrote about fixed bugs have already arived.
Please be patient, I'll try to commit again tomorrow
morning.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

And just as I speak it and hit the send button (actually a key :) )
the commit completes.  Just forget what I said.

Can you send me your fvwm config file along with your complete
xterm configuration (e.g. from .Xdefaults/.Xresources) please?

# I don't want to say that fvwm has no GNOME problems, but I think that the
# applets themselves are buggy.
I agree on both parts-- however, I did play with the applet's source for a
while, and thinks that fvwm is to blame (I think gnome wants you to
specifically give this info, and fvwm is not, but again, I don't have a
spec-- I'm just going at source I looked over)
Still, I'm not too picky-- I just want to get this working, I'm not asking
for full gnome compliance or anything :)

Again, if you know of any place I can get documented info on this, please
let me know, and I'll just fix it myself...

#=20
# AFAIK, the old applet GnomePager will not be included anymore into gnome
# (too problematic?) and the substitutions DeskGuide and TaskList are still
# under developement.
#=20
# Try to open all three these applets, they behaviour differently (have
# different bugs?). For example unlike TaskList, GnomePager do list windows
# on "y" and DeskGuide even gives you to move them.

Here's my fvwm2rc:

# Trying to compile an old .fvwrc to the  new fvwm-2.0 Format
# Unfortunately, order does matter in this file
# The correct order for inserting configurations is:
# 1. Colors
# 2. Assorted configuration paramters such as ClickToFocus, or MWMBorders
# 3. Path setup (ModulePath, PixmapPath, IconPath)
# 4. Style settings, including the default style Style "*" ...
# 5. InitFunction and ResetFunction definitions.
# 7. Menus definitions. Same caveats about forward referencing
# 8. Key and Mouse Bindings.
# 9. Module options.

This was my fault, sorry.  The nroff documentation contains a good

Ok. Then my next question is: should FvwmBacker support Xpm backgrounds
*without* FvwmTheme?  What is your opinion, everibody?

To be honest I see no real reason to re-implement stuff that can already
be done.  It may be more simple, yes; but in the future I don't want
to maintain and debug code that is not necessary.  The FvwmTheme
approach even doesn't suffer from the memory penalty you mentioned
plus the ColorLimit command takes effect too.  And a colour set is
much more flexible than an explicit Xpm option because with colour
sets you can even have gradient backgrounds and stretched vs. tiled
pixmaps.

  I've only just noticed (since I just redid a 'catman') that fvwm2.1
claims to be 'fvwm' not 'fvwm2', which makes (at least Solaris) catman/man
fall over. I've just checked and it seems to be still this way in CVS (my
build's a month or two out of date).

  This has happened before, and I'm /sure/ it was fixed ... but I don't
have CVS, so I can't check the history of it.

OK you convinced me. Now the question is what sort of option should it
be: GlobalOpt, MenuStyle or Style?

You should never assume it was never fixed, just quietlly ignored.  I
for one just edited the top of the man page to get it right, and since
that line doesn't change I never get cvs update problems.

You caught me my last build missed a c file for some reason so I did a clean build and all is well, so disregard.

Correct as usaul Dominik, here is the patch if you could apply for me. 

On another note if you and Tim still give your votes for CVS commit, I can
finally do it through my firewall.

I hadn't regenerated my windex since the last time this was fixed,
so I didn't realize the problem was back.

I think I remember the problem report.  It might have been ignored
because I just assumed that an older version of the man page where the
name was known to be wrong was being accessed.

Anyway its fixed now.

has any else noticed that man (at least on solaris) dumps core on
fvwm-menu-desktop.1.  My roff isn't what it used to be but nothing bogus
jumps out at me it.  If just do nroff -man fvwm-menu-desktop.1 the last
line before core is :

If you think that  fvwm-menu-desktop  slows  too  much  your
startup  do  not  use  PipeRead  and mSegmentation fault (core dumped)

and nothing in the text appears to be wrong there.

Alright Tim, find below a fix for #2 (thanks in advance for applying),
and I'm assuming your commits fixed #1 and #4 (but correct me if I'm
wrong).  As for 3 what window is not higlted? I don't see a difference
here betweeen colorsets and non colorsets.

As I mentioned in my last note to Dominik, if I still have your votes
I'm now able to commit from site.

Solaris's nroff is not 8 bit clean.  This is the line causing
the problem.

  + I AddToMenu "kde\-all" "Kde Syst=E8me%mini/mini\-k.xpm%" Popup kde\-s=
ys
                                    ^

It didn't pop out at me, so I eventually found it by deleting half the
file then 1/4, etc.

I notice there are a few other things in the man page that need adjustmen=
t
so I'll commit the fix after I review the whole page.

Thanks, every thing is fixed now. The hilight problem is that when you
change focus FvwmIconBox should reflect that, it does now

If you're feeling keen you could change FvwmIconBox so that specifying
icons doesn't require quotes around the window name.  Or you implement
an FvwmIconBoxIconAction option so that Iconification animation can be
done.

Cheers,
Tim.

I would prefer to have an unified image format support in one place
and not in all modules, which require it.

FvwmBacker already supports pixmap backgrounds without FvwmTheme using
Exec commands.

Imlib comes about my mind.  In FvwmTheme.

Sure.  But it _really_ slow.  It requires
1. a fork
2. opening/reading/decoding the image file
3. transferring the Pixmap to the server
and this everytime the user is switching desktop.

The fast way is, if FvwmBacker simply instructs the Xserver, that the
root-background is now a previously transferred pixmap.

I'd rather see a Gnome/GTK program that converts the Gnome theme into
colorset messages. FvwmGTK may be a candidate since it already does
Gnome themes, all we have to do is convert the GTK internals into
colorset messages and Fvwm would become Gnome theme compatible. As you
can tell I don't know anything about Gnome/GTK internals so this may be
difficult/impossible.

Oh I see.  You want to trade lots of memory for speed.  How about
modifying FvwmBacker so that it creates the pixmap from the colorset and
keeps it in the desk structure list.  Rather than SetWindowBackground()
when the desk changes it would be XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap() and a
CreateBackgroundPixmap() whenever a colorset changes. This should be
optional as I really don't want my XServer to grow by 4MB per desk.

Cheers,
Tim.

So in the process of working on FvwmBacker, I discovered that it is,
in certain respects, pretty similar to FvwmEvent. Either can be setup
to execute arbitrary Fvwm builtins on new_page and new_desk events.
The real differences are that FvwmBacker knows a bit about graphics
and message data, while FvwmEvent can handle any event but doesn't
know anything about an event's data.

So I was wondering whether it would be worthwhile/interesting to make
FvwmEvent able to read event-specific data. I was thinking something
along the lines of the following:

*FvwmEvent new_page Function _NewPageFunc $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5

Notice that *FvwmEventCmd would not be used under the circumstances.
Does this seem worthwhile?

I think yes. Since, only fvwm command Function gets parameters, the better
syntax would be:

*FvwmEventCmd builtin-function
*FvwmEvent new_page _NewPageFunc

And the specified function is called with all event data parameters
(5 for new_page, 1 for new_desk etc.).

Mikhael.

I wasn't sure if it'd be sufficient just to pass all the data all the
time, or if it'd be better to let someone pass only the args that
interested him. Then you could directly:

*FvwmEvent new_page PipeRead blah $0 $1 $2

or something. But yes, I initially thought that a simple boolean that
appends the packet data as args would be fine.

I'll probably go ahead and start working on this over the long
weekend, since I'll have some time.

Hello,
I've tried a little IconBox, it seems that the color stuff work

 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]

 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.

 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.

     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.

 54) Find a better solution for raising/lowering of transients.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.

     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.
 66) Fix ddd problems.
     [fixed as far as possible; bug reported to ddd list]
 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.
 74) To fix: icons are not preserved over a Quit - Start for fvwm
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 78) Implement colour sets in window styles.
     [only colours used yet]
 79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?
     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.

Did anybody notice that FvwmCommandS often produces a core dump
when the X server is shut down?  The core dump occurs in
function close_fifos() in the command

  free (F_name);

Since the memory is definitely valid at the time I can only
guess that the memory corruption happens earlier.  Could
someone 'purify' FvwmCommandS and see if it detects a problem,
please?

Hello,
It seems also that there are no UseListSkip option. I can add it
if no body want to.

Instead of an option I prefer to have a new ThisForTop menu position hint,
which is valid for title and title button menus, with auto translation of
the position for non-top titles. I can implement it. A default could be a
0 point gap (or 1 point for compatibility?).

Mikhael.

I think I've fixed this one. On Solaris closing the pipe to FvwmGtk
caused it to loop. The change is:

-  gtk_input_add_full (fvwm_fd[1], GDK_INPUT_READ, read_fvwm_pipe,
-                      NULL, NULL, NULL);
+  gtk_input_add_full (fvwm_fd[1], GDK_INPUT_READ | GDK_INPUT_EXCEPTION,
+                     read_fvwm_pipe, NULL, NULL, NULL);

read_fvwm_pipe() will exit if the pipe is closed.

I think we should leave it in.  It doesn't affect stability for non I18N
users and we may get lucky and attract some testing/programming talent
if it's in a stable release.

Don't worry about fixing decors. It seems to me that decors are a
workaround for things like HilightColor/ButtonStyle etc. being globals
instead of styles. Now that we have no limits on the style set we could
obsolete decors by creating additional style settings.

>  35) Test the strokes patch.

I've had a play with it and I haven't found any bugs but had plenty of
difficulties:

*) It's hard to configure, I think it just needs more examples.
*) The number grid is upside down! It's like a telephone instead of a
keyboard numpad.
*) You get lots of different sequences if you try complex shapes.
*) It needs more feedback, using the Stroke command on its own gives no
feedback, the StrokeFunc helps a lot but it would be nice if it drew an
XOR line as you traced the shape.

Cheers,
Tim.

At the moment the I18N option is disabled.  You have to edit config.h
manually to enable it.  There was some bug report that it doesn't even
compile at the moment.  I'm not opposed to leave it in in principle
(remember I've applied the patch in the first place against the opinions
of several others), but I don't want that this style of code spreads
further through the sources.  BTW, I've only partially applied the
patch back then because it was a 2.2 patch and I didn't understand it
well enough to adapt some parts of it.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Full_Name: Brent Beacham
Version: 2.3.9
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS
X_Server: X11
Submission from: (NULL) (128.100.24.33)


I didn't notice this when I was using version 2.2.2.

I have in my .fvwm2rc file

Mouse 2	R    	A      	Menu MiddleMenu Exec exec xlock -mode blank 

The double-click-action doesn't work if the menu that pops up from
the single click is positioned so that the pointer is over the title
for a sub menu popup.  (such as something like 
+ "Window Ops"	Popup Window-Ops)  

The double-click-action works as expected if the mouse pointer is not
over a submenu title.

I would think that the double-click-action should work regardless of 
where the menu pops up under the mouse pointer.

Right now, the only  generated man pages are  the  ones from the  last
"official" release (2.2.3 or 2.2.2 depending on where you look).

The only utils/*.1   man page in that   release was for xpmroot.   I'm
betting thats not the man page you are looking for.

Someone suggested also putting up man pages from the latest beta, but
right now that hasn't been set up.

There is some information in "fvwm-web/README", and a little more at
http://xxx.fvwm.org/cvs.html#fvwm-web.

I wonder what you are referring to about the documentation not being up
to date?  I know "www.fvwm.org" is way behind "xxx.fvwm.org", but there
is nothing I can do about that.

Some automation is possible.   Right now we are  waiting for  Jason to
have some time to devote to making the transition from xxx.fvwm.org.

Once thats done the automation can be done on his end, or by anyone
of the developers with update access.

One of the reasons I never bothered with the man pages from the latest
beta is that no one would see them anyway at xxx.fvwm.org.

Unfortunately,  there  are a  few  things that can't  be automatically
generated;  The screenshots   of  the icon  package  and the   "vector
buttons"  page I set up recently.   There's not a  lot of change there
anyway.

I am referring to xxx.fvwm.org (fvwm-web).
I thought that if the FAQ is current, the man pages could also be current.
Of course, if they should not be current, no automatization is needed.

I have no opinion here ... Note that there are examples in the
libstroke distribution.

Here I think that the example for netscape in the man page shows how
to deal with complex sequence. An other problem with complex sequence
is that with an Intel arch the stroke binding store the stroke sequence
in an 32 bits integer as libstroke use store sequences in a string of 
length 20 (I imagine that with an alpha arch this is not a problem).
So, a question: do you think that we need to modify the stroke patch
so that the stroke binding store the sequences in a string of length 20 ?
I did not do that because this may take a lot of memory ???

It is one of the reasons I do the StrokeFunc ... Thanks. In fact I think
that this function is the good way to use libstroke. When I posted the
patch for this function I suggested to suppress completely the "old" way
to handle mouse stroke. Dominik discourage me to do that (in a private
message). I take the occasion of this message to ask again :)
The reason I wanted to do this is that we could suppress the Button*MotionMask
in the main fvwm2 event loop. May be this can give a better performance
to this loop ???

> but it would be nice if it drew an
> XOR line as you traced the shape.

I have absolutely no idea how to do this ... but I can try to do it (as
an option of the StrokeFunc).

Finally, I would like to say that I use the stroke patch since now 5 months 
and I think it works find.

Shrug; I finally fixed the bug by calling XGetGeometry at the start
of HandleButtonPress.  The BadWindow is ignored anyway.

I'd like it the other way round too.

Hey, if I discouraged you you must have read something I didn't
(want to) write.  I just asked that you consider if we have to
keep backwards compatibility.  The strokes patch has been lying
around for years, so the users might not like if we remove the old
syntax.

Grab the X server, draw the line with the Scr.DrawGC graphics context.
(Heck, why isn't this called XorGC?). This is the GC used to draw the
outlines of windows when moving/resizing.

I was thinking about a more detailed test than 'use it and see
if something comes up'.  A proper test checks all kind of extreme
cases as well.

With the latest CVS, after a restart,  I have XEmacs windows that were
open  becoming iconic, and an  rxvt  window moving itself  back to the
location it was at when it was first created.

I don't imagine it matters, but I'm running fvwm on a Sun at work with
the  display on a PC using  Exceed in X window manager/multiple window
mode.

The 3dpixmaps icons are now GPL'd!  And there seem to be a few new
icons in there as well.

Also, I would suggest that it's probably worth updating the
README.3dpixmaps file to reflect the new location.

Hi Julian,

I just released a New version of 3dpixmaps. Have a look at
http://www.solsys.org/linux/

The Version is there. It's the complete source. I haven't made a RPM or
debian package, as I have no time for that anymore :(

Have fun.

If there's something you don't like about the Copyright, just tell me and
I'll change it.

Regards
	Joerg

Subject: Problem using FVWM2 and "xpp"

Full_Name: Leo Comitale
Version: fvwm2-2.2.1
CVS_Date: 
OS: Mandrake Linux 6.0
X_Server: XFree86-Mach64-3.3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (137.82.9.32)


The program called "xpp" available at 
ftp://ftp.math.pitt.edu/pub/bardware/xppaut4.01.tar.gz 
is not displayed correctly while using FVWM2.  

Specifically, the subwindows opened when you run the program
are corrupted.  It almost seems like they are not getting redraw 
signals, as anything that is moved OVER them doesn't get erased 
within their border when they are brought to the foreground, and 
their controls do not get drawn.

If we minimize the affected windows, and then bring them back
up, they work as they are supposed to.

This does not happen when we use other window managers.

I'd rather not have to switch window managers in order to 
use the program, you know how picky l-users can be...

Thanks for the great work!

With the pager in 2.3.10 clicking on a virtual window in a different
virtual desktop moves me to the same relative window in the current
desktop, and I am forced to also click on the approrpiate desktop
in the Pager.

If this is a new feature please consider moving back to the behavior
in 2.3.9 and before, where clicking on any window in the Pager
moved you there directly.

Why would you want this? Why can't GNOME know about all desks?

So... if you've said that GNOME should only know about 2 and you switch
to #3... then the window lists etc won't be correct anymore.. Why this?


I've been poking around to get the _WIN_AREA atom set on all windows
which says on which virtual page the window is on right now but I need
some hints where to place all the updating functions.. Is it a gazillion
places or can I get away with just a few places?

It needs to be updated when a window is moved or anything else changes
which changes the x,y virtual page the window is on...

Dom?

Since the decor_w stuff was introduced, closing windows with mouse+key
stopped working...

functions.c in DeferExecution: (search for 'mess' ;P )

  if((*w != original_w)&&(original_w != Scr.Root)&&
     (original_w != None)&&(original_w != Scr.NoFocusWin))
  {
    if(!((*w == (*tmp_win)->decor_w)&&
         (original_w == (*tmp_win)->w)))
    {
       ... bail out

*w=0x8000a7
original_w=0x500000e
(*tmp_win)->decor_w=0x8000a8
(*tmp_win)->w=0x500000e

It looks like it's comparing the wrong windows... but I don't really
know which one is to be compared to which, so I leave that up to someone
who knows...

How to test:
Mouse 1 W CS Close
And click on a window with Ctrl+Shift.. You'll get a beep..

Also, it seems a bit more sluggish nowadays.. we just got a bit faster
machines here (still pretty slow, but..) and now they're almost back to
the old speed 8( As I understand it, there's one more level of windows
in every window now.. right? Could that add the slowness when flipping
pages etc?

Btw, I dig TitleOnBottom 8)

I take some times to understand that it is second vote for the possibility
to use keyboard numpad grid in stroke binding. I will do something (keeping
backwards compatibility).

Sorry, sorry ... But we cannot keep backwards compatibility, since 
Stroke need an unbinding of the form "Mouse 3 R N" as the StrokeFunc
need a binding of the form  "Mouse 3 R N StrokeFunc [options]".
Anyway, I mad some performence test and I did not see any difference
between fvwm2 compiled with stroke or without stroke.

I'm starting XEmacs like this from my .xinitrc:

(sleep 20;xemacs -iconic&)&

There are times  when fvwm fails to put  any kind of frame  around the
window.  (It normally has a frame.)  A restart cures the problem.

The delay  was put  in there  because  XEmacs was core  dumping during
startup.  I suspected it was due to  fvwm putting frames on the window
as XEmacs was starting.  Now, my  startups (from home) are taking much
longer than  20  seconds.  I'm guessing  there is  some period of time
during startup where a window being created won't be noticed by fvwm.

Dan, there are several places in the AddWindow function where
grabbing the window may fail.  Can you find out if AddWindow
is called at all and if it is where it returns?  My guess is
that one of the XGetGeometry calls at the start of the function
fails.

The subjects says it all.  Why isn't this configurable?  It's
hard coded into DeIconify(), just at the end of the function?

BTW, Dan, why did you move the 'raise' to the end of the
function?  This causes a funny effect:  If the window was
partially covered orivinally, the uncovered parts are drawn
first, and then the parts that were previously covered.
You may notice the window being drawn in blocks.

I noticed that the pager balloons flicker when you press button
1 in a mini window in the pager.  I found out that pressing the
button causes a LeaveNotify, then an EnterNotify and finally
a LeaveNotify.  When the button is released, another EnterNotify
follows.  No wonder the balloon flickers (it's mapped/unmapped
every time a window is left/entered).  I'm puzzled; where do
these events come from?

If you tried to put the window back in  its original position relative
to other windows that it overlapped, what would you do with additional
windows and original windows   that had been raised,  lowered, shaded,
iconified/deiconified.

I think most times when you  deiconify you want  the window at the top
and doing anything else could  get complicated.  I  know I always want
the window at the top.


I put  in  the tracing  code  you suggested  but  I can't  produce the
symptom with every startup.

Um, aren't the window and the icon kept at the same position in the
stacking order?  I'd expect that when I iconify a window and immediately
deiconify it that the stacking order doesn't change.

I don't, but I'm aware that zillions of users will cry out if we
change it.  I don't see why it should get complicated though.
Simply remove the line

  RaiseWindow(tmp_win);

and the icon stays at the same position in the stacking order
(try it out).  Perhaps an option to the Iconify command will
do.

BTW, is that a new problem?

I've never looked at the stacking order code, but I would have suspected
that when a window is iconified, it would have been removed from the stack.

What you say below indicates that it doesn't.

The need for an option was my main point.

If nothing  else changes between iconify/deiconify I   can see how the
option might work.  If the windows are  shuffled around a bit, between
the iconify  and deiconify, I  can't see how  it  could work.  I don't
know if having an option  that only works  under some conditions would
be a problem or not.

No.  I figured it was all part of the iconic state problem.
Once you fixed that and this problem showed again, I decided I'd
better report it.

I've been seeing it for at least a month.  (But only occasionally.)

Now you are  probably wondering  what else  I've  seen that I  haven't
reported.

I still see  wire-frames for off screen windows.   I have  workman off
screen and I don't normally see a wire frame for it, but I think thats
probably because there is room to place  it automatically, I sometimes
see it map during restart.

Maybe new global options DeIconifyRaises/DeIconifyDoesntRaise?
The first can be a default for compatibility. I prefer the second.

Would it be possible to turn off the flattening of borders that are two
pixels or less in width?  I have several windows that don't need big
borders and having just a 3-d relief was nice.  Now they are drawn flat
and it looks bad.

Cheers,
Tim.

DrawMotion helps a lot.  I didn't realize my hand was so shaky. It is no
wonder that libstroke gives several different sequences when you try to
draw anything complex.

Cheers,

The stacking order code (I guess) makes no difference if the window
is iconified or not.  If you raise an icon, the window is raised too.
So it would simply work as if the window hadn't been iconified when
the stacking order was shuffled.  But in the end it's probably a
useless otion.

No. I would only wish that everybody stated the version number of the
code where a problem occured initially.

To be honest:  I'm getting desparate.  I know about a dozen or more
bugs that have to be fixed before 2.4 and that I don't see myself.
The simple truth is:  either the reporters of those bugs debug
these or we ship 2.4 with these bugs or we don't ship 2.4 at all.
It's simply too much for me.

Agreed, it looks ugly.  The reason for that patch was that the
colour of a 2 pixel border doesn't even resemble the colour
a thick border would have had.  Perhaps it looks better if the
relief is made thinner instead of switching it off completely.

Well I tried real hard on my Sun box to reproduce this, with purify, to
no avail, and I don't think I've ever seen this bug myself.  Although
that does sound like a memory problem, if you are sure F_name should
be valid, one thing that you could check is to see if close_fifos is
getting called twice.

And I did just check and rational still hasn't ported purify to linux.
So it sounds like unless someone else with purify who can produce the
problem needs to step up. (ports to SGI, HP, and Solaris and you can get
a free trial granted not the most above board way to go about it).

I took a look at IconAction and one problem is the icon structure
doesn't keep track, of where the real window is, or even its id, as near
as I can tell.  Do you have a vote on which module I should steal that
from?

Is this the reason I get this message:

*FvwmTaskBar: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 9 (BadDrawable)
   Major opcode of failed request:  53 (CreatePixmap)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
   Resource id of failed request:  0xa01 
 Leaving a core dump now

Is there any fix that I could try?

Can I do anything with the core file to help solve this problem?

Thank you for any and all help.

There are a number of heap checking libraries out there besides Purify,
and most are even free :).

Probably the best known one is dmalloc but there are others.  I
outfitted GNU make to configure with dmalloc if requested for the last
release; I can do the same for FVWM.

Purify is nice in that it doesn't require a rebuild of the source; it's
a link-time tool so you just relink.  Also, it instruments the object
code so you can often get the exact point where memory is written or
read beyond the boundarys.

But, dmalloc and co. can also find a very large class of heap problems
and with a little extra debugging it's usually quite sufficient.

With the debugging added,  and without XSynchronize,  so far I've been
unable to reproduce the problem.

I just wanted to comment about that XSynchronize  and something else I
noticed.  At work   I didn't notice   anything unusual, but  at home I
thought I was having some kind of problem with my cable modem.

Normally menus just  flash on to  the screen.  With XSynchronize, they
drew themselves one line at a time, about 2 seconds  per line.  What I
found odd is that I can plainly see a whole  bunch of data transferred
back and forth after the menu is completely displayed.

Oh,  I just checked again,  whats going on is, as  long as the pointer
stays on the title, there's  constant network traffic back and  forth.
It can be a title anywhere in the menu.

(This is fvwm2 running on a Sun, Exceed running on  the other end of a
cable modem.)

I'm still using current CVS.

Whether this is a problem or not, I don't know.  It sort of looks like
one  to me.  I know  lots of users are running  fvwm across a network.
Perhaps not one this slow.


Before sending this, I thought I'd take another stab at it.
Here are some stack dumps while this is happening:

I thought I'd built this with -g, I'm not sure if "pstack" will give me
line numbers anyway.

Anyway, I've got to eat sometime...

I've noted some similar "strange" events with the TaskBar. I do not
know where they come from, but you may perhaps detect such events
by a test like:

 if (Event.xcrossing.mode != NotifyNormal)
 { /* strage event */

Yes, you can do:

gdb modulepath/FvwmTaskBar core

and then type: "where"
I will be interseted to see the output.

Guys, I don't see this on fvwm 2.3.3 on a linux box (XFree86 3.3.5).
A button press unmaps the balloon, but that is on purpose. I put the
following in x_pager.c (line 589) a long time ago:

    case ButtonPress:
      if ( ShowBalloons )
        UnmapBalloonWindow();

because moving a mini window left the balloon behind in the old
location, which looked silly.

Playing with xev I find that the main window generates the following
for a mouse click:

  ButtonPress
  ButtonRelease

as expected. In the sub-window I get:

  ButtonPress
  EnterNotify
  KeymapNotify
  ButtonRelease
  LeaveNotify


I'm guessing main window is entered in order to pass the KeymapNotify
to it instead of the sub-window, then left again to return to the
sub-window.

You could try sticking a test for the sub-window in front of the
call to UnmapBalloonWindow().

You can't use fvwm_msg because a module might use the Binding library
in the future.  fvwm_msg is not in the library.

But I have only put fvwm_msg in fvwm/bindings.c not in libs/Bindings.c
so I think it is ok ?

Hello again,
Do you have the crashes if you use the option:
*FvwmTaskBarShowTips

If no I hope my last commit fix your crashes
(I have added the line:
  if (!ShowTips) return;
in the begining of void ShowTipWindow(int open)).

If yes can you send me your TaskBar config ?

FvwmWinList tracks its location by listening for ConfigureNotify
events.  The code in there can pick out the synthetic ones sent by
fvwm.  I don't think you can rely on M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW messages from
fvwm as there is potential to receive information out of order when
things get busy.

I don't think I phrased my question quite right, its not the iconbox
itself I can't track its the windows its managing.  You are right
configureNotify is the right place to track the box itself but
what should I do to track the windows IconBox is managing?  Is
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW the right place?

Has anyone else noticed that the recent changes to IconMan make its
start up rather slow.  I can really notice it on a restart because
FvwmButtons unswallows a bunch of windows that get picked up by
IconMan on the restart and there is a good 30 seconds between them
getting reswallowed and getting removed from IconMan, before the
last few commits removing XSyncronizes and such this was pretty much
instentaneous.

Oh sorry.  Do you mean the location of the icon? If so I think
XTranslateCoordinates from item->icon_win to the root window would
work.  If you mean the location of the window that the icon represents:
the location is in the M_ICONIFY packet (see FvwmWinList)

Cheers,
Tim.

I think it's drawn the way you intend. I prefer the old behaviour of not
showing any border color when the width becomes very small. If I wanted
to have the border color override the relief I would use "borderstyle --
flat".  It's not important though.

I think there is a bug in the un-depresing of NoHandle borders. When
moved with a mouse the border is drawn pressed but is not unpressed when
the move is finished.  This doesn't happen with resize handle borders.

Cheers,
Tim.

Ah, yes, I thought ParseBinding was in Bindings.c. Sorry.

Subject: HandleModuleInput ERROR command is too big
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

Hi !

I'm using 2.3.10 on Linux RH 6.1 2.2.12-20 and Digital OSF1 V4.0 878
alpha, with basically the same .fvwm2rc (only the paths to pixmaps and
executables are different). Everything is fine on Linux, while on Alpha
fvwm2 hangs when I start one of the modules. The typical messages 
(obtained after killing fvwm2) are:

WinList:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module(0) command is too big
(536863056), limit is 1000
[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Fail to read command (Module: 0,
read: 165, size: 1000)

Banner:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module(0) command is too big
(536863056), limit is 1000
[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Fail to read command (Module: 0,
read: 0, size: 1000)

Pager:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module 0, Size Problem: cont is zero

Can this be related to the 64-bit stuff on Alpha ? Is anybody testing
fvwm2 on this platform ? The same .fvwm2rc works fine with 2.2.3.

I've tried with both gcc (egcs-2.91.60) and with cc (DEC C V5.6-071).
Same problem.

Any idea ?

Giuseppe.

This looks funny.  Is this the intended behaviour of nohandle,
depressableborder windows?  I mean, should the complete border
be drawn depressed when you press on the border?

Yup, that was the place where I started debugging.  BTW, shouldn't
button 1 leave the balloon mapped?  I see no reason why not since
with a button 1 click you can't drag the mouse anyway.  Of course
this won't work at all before this enter/leave problem is solved.

Can you try putting a fprintf just behind the EnterNotify and
LeaveNotify labels?  And if that doesn't help, can you try 2.3.10?

All the EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events that the pager received were
for the subwindow, so this won't help.  I tried a workaround already
(keeping the state of the button), but that failed miserably.  I guess
the only good fix will be to suppress the events.

I think it has always been that way.  I'm used to it but that doesn't
mean it's what it should look like.

Remember that errors are handled asynchronously.  The stack trace
will most likely show some other position in the code.

If you're already using 2.2.3 you won't need 2.2.4.  I've only
made a few patches for HP-UX 10.20 and compiling without the
shape extension.  If you could compile 2.2.3 you won't see
any differences.

I suspect the native HP-UX compiler isn't ANSI, but only K&R.

FVWM doesn't support building with pre-ANSI compilers, and hasn't since
the 2.1.x days.

"pesh (a perl.org project) is a Perl interface to Enlightenment IPC"

  http://linuxtoday.com/stories/12980.html

Just read this in-passing and thought I'd mention it.

How do the fvwm developers look at something like this for fvwm ?  I now
there was an FvwmPerl module (it's gone now), but would it be worth while to
get 'perl.org' involved just so to increase fvwm's visibility ?

BTW: I know controlling fvwm can be gotten via different means (FvwmScript,
     etc).  What I'm getting at is whether there is a need to give fvwm more
     visibility (more PR, if you will :-)

Just a thought..

FvwmPerl isn't gone. It's just out of the FVWM distribution. However,
it's still in CPAN (I'm pretty sure). It no longer works (I'm pretty
sure) because the last version released: 1) explicitly looked for the
version == 2.0.46; 2) supports an outdated module interface. But these
are pretty trivial to fix. I still use FvwmPerl (and TkPerlConsole, or
whatever it was called) on a regular basis. Oops, and I never updated
its module interface!

  dv> How do I set up dmalloc?

I've modified configure.in so you can add "--enable-dmalloc" to the
configure command line to enable it.  It just looks in the standard
places for dmalloc.h and libdmalloc.a for now--maybe we should enhance
that.

You can get more info including the manual online if you don't have or
don't like the texinfo version that comes with dmalloc at its homesite:

  http://www.dmalloc.com/

In general you build your program linking with the dmalloc library and
(to get the best results) #including the dmalloc.h header file.  Then
before you run the program you set various environment variables to
control how it works: levels of checking, where the logfile goes, etc.
There's a special command to help with that.

Then run the program, and examine the log file.  Also, you can do things
like set a breakpoint at dmalloc_error() which is called every time an
error is seen, etc.

I also had it enable DMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK (see the manual) which replaces
many "standard" functions that might read or write to the heap
incorrectly (strcpy, strcat, memcpy, etc.) with versions that implement
dmalloc checks; that can sometimes allow dmalloc to find the problem
much closer to where it occurred.

I built with dmalloc enabled as a test, but I didn't run FVWM that way,
so hopefully it works :).

HTH.

Hi Julian;  I wanted to check out your autoconfiged versio of wm-icons
but I can't reach it at the url you posted a week or so ago:

  http://www.maths.qmw.ac.uk/~jdg/wm-icons-0.2.4.tar.gz

Did it move?  Can I get a copy somewhere else?

Thx.

I removed it once Mikhael had announced 0.2.5.  I can reupload it if
you'd like.

No, that's fine, I'll get 0.2.5.  I didn't realize this had already been
"integrated" into the next version.  Cool!

Subject: flat icon/border patch

I know flat icons are on the wish list but I wanted them now so I activated
'flat' and 'sunk' for BorderStyle with these two tidbits.  I dont know if this
will be the preferred method for flat icons and borders, but it made sense to
me.  The obvious drawback is that icon and window border flatness is not
disjoint.   If this is acceptable maybe someone w/ CVS access can plug it
or some variant in.

In border.c:
============

/****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Draws the relief pattern around a window
 *
 ****************************************************************************/
void RelieveWindow(FvwmWindow *t,Window win, int x,int y,int w,int h,
		   GC ReliefGC, GC ShadowGC, int hilite)
{
  XSegment seg[4];
  int i;
  int edge;

#ifdef BORDERSTYLE
  GC tmpGC;
  if(Scr.Focus != t) {
    if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.inactive.style) & FlatButton) { return; } 
    else if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.inactive.style) & SunkButton) {
      tmpGC = ReliefGC;
      ReliefGC = ShadowGC;
      ShadowGC = tmpGC;
    }}
  else {
    if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.active.style) & FlatButton) { return; } 
    else if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.active.style) & SunkButton) {
      tmpGC = ReliefGC;
      ReliefGC = ShadowGC;
      ShadowGC = tmpGC;
    }}
#endif

...



Also in border.c
================

void RelieveWindowHH(FvwmWindow *t,Window win, int x,int y,int w,int h,
		     GC ReliefGC, GC ShadowGC, int draw, int hilite)
{
    XSegment seg[4];
    int i = 0;
    int edge = 0, a = 0, b = 0;

    GC tmpGC;
    if(Scr.Focus != t) {
      if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.inactive.style) & FlatButton) { return; } 
      else if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.inactive.style) & SunkButton) {
        tmpGC = ReliefGC;
        ReliefGC = ShadowGC;
        ShadowGC = tmpGC;
      }}
    else {
      if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.active.style) & FlatButton) { return; } 
      else if(GetDecor(t, BorderStyle.active.style) & SunkButton) {
        tmpGC = ReliefGC;
        ReliefGC = ShadowGC;
        ShadowGC = tmpGC;
      }}
