Strangely, but after I'd rebuilt fvwm with debugging symbols included (cc -g) it ceased to happen. As to old core file it was not useful because of a huge stack trace with no function names. I'll try to send a new one as soon as it happens again. However, judging from all the events, now it seems to be some bugs/misconfiguration in my beta FreeBSD libc.

I managed to get the stack trace for recent fvwm crash, here it is:

== start ==

Core was generated by `fvwm'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

Everything else the same: it was caused by firefox file/quit menu

??? It can't have crashed in that line!  The only possible case
would be if te is invalid, but then it should have crashed
earlier, in line 3353:

  unsigned long win =3D (unsigned long)te->xunmap.window;

Besides, te is *never* invalid as it points to stack memory.  Can
you please post the output of the following gdb commands (while
debugging the core file):

  (gdb) p te
  (gdb) p te->xunmap.window
  (gdb) p dpy
  (gdb) p ea
  (gdb) p ea->exc

Full_Name: Rouben Rostamian
Version: 2.5.11
CVS_Date: 
OS: SuSE Linux 9.0
X_Server: XFree86-4.3.0.1
Submission from: (NULL) (68.55.20.208)


I have encountered what seems to be a bug in fvwm 2.5.11.
I have verified that the bug is not present in 2.5.10 and 2.5.8.

I have a short script to demo the bug.  The script calls for two
pixmaps.  I don't know how to submit the script along with pixmaps
through this web interface.  If you give me an email address
where I can send the three files and the description of the problem,
I will be glad to do so.

Rouben Rostamian

Hello Fvwm Team!

I encountered what seems to be a bug that was introduced in 2.5.11.
The bug was not present in 2.5.10 and 2.5.8.

Unfortunately it is somewhat complicated to describe the situation.
I have tried to localize the problem to a minimal script.  Couldn't get
the script any smaller.  Sorry.  The script is extracted from a much
larger script which is my fvwm configuration.

I have shown the script below with line numbers added so that I can
refer to them.

In line 26, I bind a mouse click to titlebar's button 4 to execute
the function "MaximizeHeight".

The function "MaximizeHeight", defined in lines 21-24 is a toggle;
if the window's "State" is 4, it calls the function MaximizeHeightOff
(which returns the window to its normal size and sets State 4 to
False).  Otherwise, it calls the function MaximizeHeightOn (which
stretches the window in the vertical direction and sets State 4
to True).

 1   DestroyDecor StateNormal
 2   AddToDecor StateNormal
 3   + AddButtonStyle 4 Pixmap button-vert-off.xpm
 4   
 5   DestroyDecor StateMaxHeight
 6   AddToDecor StateMaxHeight
 7   + AddButtonStyle 4 Pixmap button-vert-on.xpm
 8   
 9   DestroyFunc MaximizeHeightOn
10   AddToFunc MaximizeHeightOn
11   + I State 4 True
12   + I ResizeMoveMaximize frame keep 85 keep 5
13   + I ChangeDecor StateMaxHeight
14   
15   DestroyFunc MaximizeHeightOff
16   AddToFunc MaximizeHeightOff
17   + I State 4 False
18   + I Maximize False
19   + I ChangeDecor StateNormal
20   
21   DestroyFunc MaximizeHeight
22   AddToFunc MaximizeHeight
23   + I Current (State 4) MaximizeHeightOff
24   + I TestRc (NoMatch) MaximizeHeightOn
25   
26   Mouse 0  4  A  MaximizeHeight


The script, as shown, works in fvwm 2.5.8 and 2.5.10, but fails in
2.5.11.  In 2.5.8 and 2.5.10, mouse clicks on titilebar button 4 toggle
the window's maximized state.  In 2.5.11 the window gets maximized,
but subsequent clicks do not return it to its normal state.

The problem in 2.5.11 can be narrowed to lines 11-13: the State
which is set in line 11 gets clobbered when line 13 is executed.
You can verify this by inserting a few "Echo" commands in the code.

I can work around the problem by putting line 11 after line 13, as in:

 9   DestroyFunc MaximizeHeightOn
10   AddToFunc MaximizeHeightOn
12   + I ResizeMoveMaximize frame keep 85 keep 5
13   + I ChangeDecor StateMaxHeight
11   + I State 4 True

Although this solves my problem, I don't see why the original
arrangement doesn't work in 2.5.11.  If it is a bug, then it
may have other consequences which I haven't yet seen.

It would be great if FakeKeyPress was enhanced a bit. Specifically, I'd
find very useful the following enhancements:

-Send keys not just to specific windows, but the currently active window
-Allow sending of keys modified with Ctrl, Meta, etc.

Perhaps this could be put into an executable or script. XMacro had a good
concept, but is unfortunately way too old, and doesn't work for me at all.

Hi there,

I recently switched to fvwm because I was tired of strong-arming KDE
to do what I want, or bashing my head against the incoherence of
Enlightenment.  I _love_ this window manager.  I had no idea fvwm had
evolved so much since I last looked at it.

I'd like to donate $100 to your efforts, to be used as you see fit,
and I have a xinerama screenshot that takes some ideas from Cameron
Simpson and then makes them very much my own.  I'd love to put the
screenshot up on the site with some links to my scripts so other
people can play with them.

PayPal works best for me as a payment method, so just tell me the
preferred email recipient, and if there's room for the screenshot,
inform me of the upload procedure.  (If there's no room, that's
totally understandable.)

Cheers,

-John Hawkins

Just send the link to your screenshot and to your site to one the the
fvwm mailing lists.

I used to be able to switch to thee last focused predictably &
consistently in 2.5.10 w/ the following functions & key binding...

  key f  A   4  Function switch-to-last

  DestroyFunc  WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc    WindowListFunc
  +  I Iconify false
  +  I WindowShade false
  +  I Raise
  +  I FlipFocus
  +  I WarpToWindow 50 50

  DestroyFunc  window-list
  AddToFunc    window-list
  +  I WindowList Root c c Sticky,  OnTop \
    NoGeometryWithInfo  NoDeskNum  NoNumInDeskTitle \
    MaxLabelWidth 30 IconifiedAtEnd \
    $*

  DestroyFunc  switch-to-last
  AddToFunc    switch-to-last
  +  I Function window-list  SelectOnRelease Super_L


In 2.5.11 i am at loss to know in advance if i would get the last
focused window.  Above generates only the window list; no window is
selected on release of Super_L.

I see a line is mentioned in the "News" section on fvwm.org about
changes to WindowList, but nothing helpful for me.  I also tried the
following 3 versions, bounded to "tab M", as hinted in the FAQ & the
man page....

  key Tab A M switch-other-gui-2

  DestroyFunc  switch-other-gui-0
  AddToFunc    switch-other-gui-0
  + I WindowList \
      Root c c CurrentDesk , NoGeometry \
      Prev (CurrentDesk) WindowListFunc

  DestroyFunc  switch-other-gui-1-prev
  AddToFunc    switch-other-gui-1-prev
  + I Prev (CurrentDesk) WindowListFunc

  DestroyFunc  switch-other-gui-1
  AddToFunc    switch-other-gui-1
  + I WindowList \
      Root c c \
      , CurrentDesk , NoGeometryWithInfo , CurrentAtEnd ,  IconifiedAtEnd \
      , SelectOnRelease Alt_L \
        Function switch-other-gui-1-prev

  DestroyFunc  switch-other-gui-2
  AddToFunc    switch-other-gui-2
  + I WindowList \
      Root c c \
      , NoGeometryWithInfo , CurrentAtEnd ,  IconifiedAtEnd , NoDeskNum
      , NoNumInDeskTitle , SelectOnRelease Alt_L
      Prev (CurrentDesk)


Am i doing anything wrong wrt WindowList in v2.5.11?

This works as is:

FakeKeypress press h

should send a 'h' to the active/current window.
(Try it with "Module FvwmConsole -terminal rxvt". Note that it won't work
with xterm though.)

However, there is a problem with binding FakeKeypress to a key event. ie.

Key H A CM FakeKeypress press h

Presumably this doesn't work because there is a grab on the keyboard
before FakeKeypress is invoked. Dominik may be able to tell us if a
workaround is possible. Dominik?

> Allow sending of keys modified with Ctrl, Meta, etc.

This works fine as is. You need to use the "modifiers" keyword:

FakeKeypress modifiers 6 press a

should output a capital 'A'. Ctrl is modifier 8 I think. (see fvwm man
page)

SCoTT. :)

-Allow sending of keys modified with Ctrl, Meta, etc.

Perhaps this could be put into an executable or script. XMacro had a good
concept, but is unfortunately way too old, and doesn't work for me at all.

	Notes: Sat Oct  2 21:19:03 2004	scott	> Send keys not just to specific windows,

This works as is:

FakeKeypress press h

should send a 'h' to the active/current window.
(Try it with "Module FvwmConsole -terminal rxvt". Note that it won't work
with xterm though.)

However, there is a problem with binding FakeKeypress to a key event. ie.

Key H A CM FakeKeypress press h

Presumably this doesn't work because there is a grab on the keyboard
before FakeKeypress is invoked. Dominik may be able to tell us if a
workaround is possible. Dominik?

> Allow sending of keys modified with Ctrl, Meta, etc.

This works fine as is. You need to use the "modifiers" keyword:

FakeKeypress modifiers 6 press a

should output a capital 'A'. Ctrl is modifier 8 I think. (see fvwm man
page)

SCoTT. :)

It would be great if FakeKeyPress was enhanced a bit. Specifically, I'd
find very useful the following enhancements:

-Send keys not just to specific windows, but the currently active window
-Allow sending of keys modified with Ctrl, Meta, etc.

Perhaps this could be put into an executable or script. XMacro had a good
concept, but is unfortunately way too old, and doesn't work for me at all.

It does not need to be enhanced, it already supports what you are
looking for.

Try

  Current FakeKeyPress ...

  FakeKeyPress modifiers 8 press xyz release xyz modifiers -8

Because the currently focused window is the first entry in the
list.  This config should never have worked (and it does not work
here with 2.5.10).  If it did, I don't understand why.  You need
to have the window that had the focus last at the top of the list.
The CurrentAtEnd option provides this feature.  Adding
"CurrentAtEnd" right before $"*" makes above config work for me.

If that does not help, post a minimal config that shows the
problem.

There have been no WindowList changes since 2.5.10.  The NEWS line
refers to the perl library.

Hello Dominik,

Thanks for your instantaneous response to the problems I had noted
in my two previous messages.

It's support and dedication like this that makes fvwm stand
out among other software.

Best regards,

Rouben

Sure, here it is:

(gdb) p te
$1 = (const XEvent *) 0x0
(gdb) p te->xunmap.window
Cannot access memory at address 0x14
(gdb) p dpy

$4 = (const exec_context_t *) 0x818ee00
(gdb) p ea->exc->x
$5 = {etrigger = 0x818ee1c, elast = 0x810ade0}

== stop ==

Looks like te is NULL :-(

Hi,

I know Dominik will kill me eventually ;-) , but once again I made a
small update to fvwm. This time it is not a really new functionality
because the same you can achieve using PipeRead and shell script, but
I've thought that running new process just for doing a simple test is
overdoing.
That's why I added new Test condition: Compare. With this little thing
you can check if a variable have a certain value or just if it is set.
It normaly compares two values as integers, but I added also a special
operator 'strcmp' to compare values as strings (I haven't found a way to
automaticaly decide if comparision should be made on ints or strings).
Attached patch contains also man page updates with some examples of
using this new Test option.
I've tested it on my system and it works just like described, hope it
can be merged into fvwm.
It should cleanly patch current cvs version

Sorry, I didn't think to look at the manpage, but rather checked the 
online documentation.

Regarding the title-bar at the side, is it possible to have rotated 
text? So the title would look like:

M
o
z
i
l
l
a

?

If you actually mean the text that looks exactly as shown here, then this
is not currently possible, and there are technical reasons why. We would
need to implement our own divider to chars (not trivial at all with i18n)
and our own rendering of individual chars rather than the whole text
(this is doable except for some languages like Arabic).

This is also arguably less readable for long text. I would not do this.

Or maybe you don't ask for T in the side titlebars, but for |-- vus --|.
Then take a look at Style LeftTitleRotatedCW and LeftTitleRotatedCCW
in the man page.

Feel free to ask questions on fvwm @ fvwm.org list.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I seem to have the same effect when doing like this:

I have an application panel'ed in FvwmButtons (namely psi)
I open the panel
Then, minimize the application with titlebar minimize button
Then, press the button on FvwmButtons to close panel

fvwm crashes, dumps core, and the stack trace looks the same:

== start ==

#0  0x0806a208 in HandleUnmapNotify (ea=0xbfbfe7b4) at events.c:3374
#1  0x0806a850 in dispatch_event (e=0xbfbfe7e0) at events.c:3616

#3  0x080951f2 in main (argc=2, argv=0xbfbfec30) at fvwm.c:2524

== stop ==

and those gdb commands you asked me to execute :-)
looks the same:

== start ==

(gdb) p te
$1 = (const XEvent *) 0x14
(gdb) p te->xunmap.window
Cannot access memory at address 0x28
(gdb) p dpy
$2 = (Display *) 0x811a000
(gdb) p ea
$3 = (const evh_args_t *) 0xbfbfe7b4
(gdb) p ea->exc
$4 = (const exec_context_t *) 0x8140180
(gdb) p ea->exc->x
$5 = {etrigger = 0x814019c, elast = 0x810ade0}

== stop ==

So I suppose this is a bug in fvwm code for handling unmapping windows in general rather than exclusive firefox issue

No.  When we wrote the rotated titles feature, we first
implemented it with upright letters.  But it looks absolutely
awful, so we replaced it with the rotated strings.

It can be reduced to a simple formula:

  Core dump =3D bug

:-)

I think I've found the reason.  The FCheckIfEvent() call writes
over the te variable because the wrong pointer is passed to it
(&win instead of &args).  Can you please try the attached patch
and tell me if it fixes the problem?

Ciao

Here is a problem when tearing off menus with the mouse with
ManualPlacement activated.  Run Fvwm as

fvwm -f ~/.fvwm/fvwm-test

with the config-file appended below.  Click and release mouse 2 on the
root window to open menu Menu-1.  Move the mouse over item "Menu-2" so
that menu Menu-2 pops up.  Move the mouse over "Menu-2-Title" and
click mouse-2 (to tear off menu Menu-2).  Do that mouse-2 click
carefully without moving the mouse.  A ribbon-band window shows up,
indicating the place for the teared-off menu.  Move the mouse slowly
-- the ribbon-band window jumps to another place.  Or click the mouse
to place the window:  The window is not placed at the location
indicated by the initial ribbon bands.  I guess that jump is not
intended.

If you use bigger menus, the jump can become bigger.

This happens with 2.5.11 and with the cvs version after 2004-07-01.
It does not happen with 2.5.10 and with the cvs version before
2004-07-01.

(Fvwm 2.5.12 & 2.5.10 are being compared below.)

In both 2.5.10 & 2.5.12, use of commas to separate the options causes
the WindowList to appear with full geometry information and
SelectOnRelease has not effect.  It is as if WindowList was invoked
w/o any parameters.  I tried 3 variations ...

  DestroyFunc  window-list
  AddToFunc    window-list
  +  I WindowList Root c c Sticky \
    , OnTop   NoGeometryWithInfo   NoDeskNum    NoNumInDeskTitle \
      MaxLabelWidth 30   IconifiedAtEnd    CurrentAtEnd \
      $*

  DestroyFunc  window-list
  AddToFunc    window-list
  +  I WindowList Root c c Sticky \
    , OnTop , NoGeometryWithInfo , NoDeskNum , NoNumInDeskTitle \
    , MaxLabelWidth 30 , IconifiedAtEnd , CurrentAtEnd \
    , $*

  DestroyFunc  window-list
  AddToFunc    window-list
  +  I WindowList Root c c Sticky \
      OnTop , NoGeometryWithInfo , NoDeskNum , NoNumInDeskTitle \
    , MaxLabelWidth 30 , IconifiedAtEnd , CurrentAtEnd \
    , $*


In 2.5.12, following syntax brings up WindowList w/ "Desk: 0" title,
current window at the end, and rest of windows in focus-LIFO order...

  DestroyFunc  window-list
  AddToFunc    window-list
  +  I WindowList Root c c Sticky \
      OnTop   NoGeometryWithInfo   NoDeskNum   NoNumInDeskTitle \
      MaxLabelWidth 30   IconifiedAtEnd   CurrentAtEnd \
      $*

You are quite correct about the use of CurrentAtEnd, of course.
During experimenting w/ the odd focusing behaviour of version 2.5.11,
i forgot to add it in one place or the other.

There definitely is(are) some change(s), related to Style/focus, which
affects the order of WindowList which was missing from 2.5.10 but
is(was) present in 2.5.12(2.5.11).


Below is the the combined configuration snippet w/ working functions
(as i desire) but apparently in incorrect syntax, and problem causing
style definition(s).

There is a bug in some of the parsing functions.  In the
WindowList (and possibly some other commands) there must not be
any whitespace before the comma (it works with the Style command,
though).

Is that the order you want or is it not?

I completely rewrote the focus code in 2.5.3, introducing all the
FP... styles.  Not using CTF myself, I believed to remember that
CFT sorted windows in order of creation, not in the order of last
focus.  I noticed this some time ago, and CTF behaves properly
since 2.5.9.  Said behaviour can be activated with

  Style * !FPSortWindowlistByFocus

In any case, I consider the focus handling code stable since 2.5.9
and very quirky from 2.5.3 and 2.5.8.

Can you say that again?  What was missing in 2.5.10?

You should be aware that the maximum command length in fvwm is
1024 bytes.  If you keep adding styles to this list you might hit
that limit at around 30 lines in the style definition.

Just to clarify ... "no whitespace before the comma" is a bug in
parsing functions and is not a syntax requirement?

Could you please provide an example demonstrating line
continuations, proper placement of commas, use of position, options,
and mouse action?

Speaking of syntax example, it would be swell if there were BNF(-like)
definitions for all the syntax.  Alternatively, display the syntax bit
more explicitly.  For example...

  MenuStyle stylename options

  ...would be changed to ...

  MenuStyle <stylename> <option [, option] [, option ] ...>

  ...where <word> implies a word is required & [word] implies word is
  optional.

Argh, my fault; i meant to write 2.5.10 not 2.5.12.

Yes, i do want the list in the order mentioned.

Something that is in 2.5.12 but was not in 2.5.10 that affects the
order in WindowList, well, list; result is NOT "current-at-end,
rest-LIFO-order-based-on-focus" sorting in 2.5.12.

Sorry for the vagueness, but that's the behaviour difference i
observed and am not able to pinpoint the specifics.

I thought about that (as converting the above syntax w/ line
continuations to "Style * " for each line undid some problem that
turned out to be a red herring).

Thanks for pointing that out explicitly.  Could a note be added to the
man page?

Not a herring after all!  After breaking up the above Style thusly ...

  Style  *  FPLenient \
    , FPClickRaisesFocused      , FPClickRaisesUnfocused \
    , FPClickDecorRaisesFocused , FPClickDecorRaisesUnfocused \
    , FPClickIconRaisesFocused  , FPClickIconRaisesUnfocused \
    , FPGrabFocus , FPReleaseFocus \
    , FPFocusByFunctionWarpPointer \
    , FPAllowRaiseClickFunction

  Style * ClickToFocusPassesClickoff , ClickToFocusRaises \
    , MouseFocusClickRaises , MouseFocus


... in 2.5.12, WindowList is making the list in the desired order just
like it does in 2.5.10 (w/ or w/o both combined).  Combining the two
styles does cause the problem (in 2.5.12).  Thanks Dominik.


BTW, comma placement has no effect on the order.  I understand that
the situation may change in future as Dominik has pointed out in this
thread and also previously in various threads.

That feels lika a bug int the style merging code.

I still don't know exactly what behaviour you see. In which order
do you get the window list:

  - with 2.5.10,
  - with 2.5.12 and a sing style line,
  - with 2.5.12 and multiply style lines?

With the config you posted earlier, I get exactly the same
(correct) order with 2.5.10, 2.5.12 and current CVS, regardless of
whether I split the style lione or not.

No, and that will never change.

When (if) I change it, it won't affect the order.  Style lists
without commas will simply stop working.

I'd like to remove the current implementation of FvwmCommand
because its signal and pipe handling is fundamentally flawed.  Too
often, a lock file of the FvwmCommand executable is left in
/var/tmp although it's already dead.

Rewriting it in a safe fashion should not be too difficult.  But
FvwmCommand has a couple of features that I find completely
useless:

 * Any value > 1 for the -i option.  There are other modules
   to dump fvwm module packets.
 * The -F option (same reason).
 * The -m option (can be done easier by invoking a function).
 * The -r and -w options (dito)

Overall I think FvwmCommand is causing more trouble than it's
worth.

What do you think?

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Can we use atexit(close_fifos)? (Lemme guess, not portable?)

It pleases me greatly that I can find a use for such esoteric features. :)
(Perhaps this merely suggests my choice of implementation is suboptimal
though.)

I use '-i2' & '-m' options in a simple shell script which allows me to
send windows to an FvwmTabs tabber. ie.

tab rxvt -bg blue

will create an rxvt window & put it in the last focussed tabber.

Script is here:

I don't mind if it gets rewritten. I do use a couple of the features
you're contemplating removing, but there may be other ways to
accomplish the functionality in tab.zsh.

SCoTT. :)

Whether it's portable or not - the main problem that FvwmCommand
has is that it's prone to many race conditions that may cause it
to segfault.  It it shuts down normally, it removes the lock file
itself.

Well, I'd rather write it from scratch, but keeping just the code
handling i/o formatting wouldn't be too bad.

I'm trying to construct a focus policy which basically dictates that a
click to an unfocused window will have no consequences at all except to
focus/raise it. The !FPPassFocusClick/ClickToFocusPassesClickOff styles
make this work, with one notable exception-- window buttons and other
decor-related functions are still called, even in the presence of the !
FPAllowFocusClickFunction style-- it seems to only apply to functions
invoked in the window or icon contexts. 

I'd like to see it possible to prevent the Focusing click from invoking
any Decor-context functions, if at all possible.

Hi Dominik, :)

After revision 1.61 of libs/Parse.c, DoPeekToken() is behaving very
oddly. Best illustrated with an example:

If I pass a string, say, "2.5.13" to DoPeekToken() with delimiters ".",
I get back the token "2" (correct) but the pointer to the rest of the
string (the actual return value) is ".13" which is incorrect. (The '5'
character got truncated in CopyToken().)

+   t = SkipSpaces(src, spaces, snum);
+   if (*t != 0 && dnum && strchr(delims, *t) != NULL)
+   {
+       src = t + 1;
+   }

I think the strchr() needs to be replaced with a function that
checks for delims at the _start_ of t (not just anywhere in t).
But I'm not really sure what your intention was, hence why I'll
leave it to you to fix.

I noticed this problem because the following syntax no longer works:

Test (Version >= 2.5.11) Echo yup

Seeya!

SCoTT. :)

strchr(delims, *t) looks for the character *t in the string
delims, not vice versa.

The intention was to skip the delimiter that ended the token, even
if it is preceded by spaces.  I missed the case that there is no
whitespace *after* the delimiter, though.  Fixed.

Is that what you want?

  Style * !FPAllowFocusClickFunction, !FPAllowRaiseClickFunction
  Style * !FPPassFocusClick

Note that currently if you click on the decorations to raise/focus
a window, the part you clicked on is drawn pressed in and does not
return to normal state.  I will fix this.

Ahh, thank you. Apparently, the raiseclick was what was getting me. I
did actually come up with another way (amazing how a little sleep can
inspire one sometimes), by executing WindowStyle NoButton and Button in
a focus_change FvwmEvent. Having it in the focus model is a little more
elegant though. :)

I knew that feature would come in handy some day :-)  It's one of
those that I added just because it was easy to do and I did not
see a reason against it.

Hi all my name is Darren,
 
I have never asked for charity before but when I typed it in a search engine I came up with your email address.
 
My wife had a car accident last year, shattered her back in a few places and now is paralyzed. I spent 9 years in the British Army and am now disabled, we have two kids. We are extremely poor and are in need of assistance. Our car is on its last leg and we really need a wheelchair accessible dependable vehicle. In addition the house we live in is extremely old and the doors (except for the front) will not allow for a wheelchair to pass through them. So we need a dwelling which will allow for a wheelchair to pass through the doors. In addition this will give her a sense of "independence" to where she can move freely about the house and can bathe in the bathroom.
 
Whats sad is.... I have searched the internet only to my disgust. It seems all these charity sites only want to take things, and dont provide a place for a "needy" person such as ourselves to apply.
 
One of them, wont say which, but seemed to be a popular one, provided a contact email, which didn't even work  
 
In conclusion, I appeal to your conscience to send whatsoever the Lord lays in your heart to give to help us out of this condition. Please feel free to reach me at my personal email address: pioneercoy@netscape.net
 
Sincerely,
 
Darren L. Wheeler

Subject: Window move/resize problem

Full_Name: Kan Sasaki
Version: 2.5.13
CVS_Date: Wed Oct 13 04:23:48 2004
OS: FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7
X_Server: X.Org 6.7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (61.114.163.126)


Since last change of move_resize.c, revision 1.260, Move and Resize
function seems
not to work correctly.

I bind Alt+F7 to Resize and Alt+F8 to Move. If I select a window, push the
key,
move a mouse and push a mouse button 1, it will return to the original
position.
However, I push a key instead of a mouse button, it moves correctly.

This problem will not be found if I use the previous version of
move_resize.c.

Is this a bug?

Thanks.

Yes, it is.  I have committed a fix to CVS.

By the way, for bug reports on the CVS code, it's better to mail
to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

Dear Fvwm hackers,

I'd like to ask you if there is ongoing work about the implementation of 
the freedesktop.org's System tray (notification area) inside FvwmTaskBar:
http://freedesktop.org/Standards/systemtray-spec

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Gilles

	Hello,

I've made a couple of changes for FvwmTaskBar:
1) *FvwmTaskBar: ClockFont allows to set font for clock and tips 
independently.
2) *FvwmTaskBar: SystrayWidth allows to extend mail&clock area. Then 
user is able to put some mini-windows above empty space on taskbar using 
conventional fvwm tools thus emulating systray.

Is the community interested in patch?

	A. Soukharev.

Currently, nobody is doing much with the taskbar.  A patch would
be welcome, though.

I'd enjoy writing this hack using the code of peksystray
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/peksystray).

I should maybe get some knowledge about FVWM module writing and X
programming. I already did some code with X/OpenMotif but I'm not an
expert at X programming.

Do you have any reference documentation to FVWM module programming
(communication protocol, events)  ? and X programming ?

Regards,

Fvwm 2.5.1[02] gets stuck sometimes, always while raising or deiconifying a
Mozilla window via WindowList command.

When fvwm gets stuck...

  - CPU usage reaches near 100%
  - Mouse pointer remains in the set "CursorStyle MENU"
  - Mouse moves but clicks do not respond
  - Keyboard is also lost
  - No windows is raised/lowered or a page is changed

  Adrian Nye, Xlib Programming Manual, O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-002-3
  Adrian Nye, Xlib Reference Manual, O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-006-6

(about 35 USD each).  Both are invaluable to the Xlib programmer
(fvwm is written in plain Xlib).

Ciao

I can not reproduce the problem, but I can see a bug in the code:
If a transient window is iconified by its parent window and then
loses the special relationship, for example because the parent is
closed, a loop in the DeIconify() function never exits.

I have committed a patch to CVS for 2.5.13 and 2.4.19.

You said it also happens when the window is just raised, not
(de)iconifed.  Does it hang in the same place in this case?

Hello,

I began to embed peksystray code inside the FvwmTaskBar
I have one problem for now : the systray window does not receive events 
when it is embeded inside FvwmTaskBar window.

In the file modules/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.c, if I change
  dockWindow =    XCreateSimpleWindow (dpy, win, 0, 0, w, h, 
border_width, 0, 0);
to
  dockWindow =    XCreateSimpleWindow (dpy, Root, 0, 0, w, h, 
border_width, 0, 0);
The systray is not the child of win (ie. FvwmTaskBar main window) 
anymore, and the dockWindow receives events as expected (it display/hide 
client on a left click, display the contextual menu of client on 
right-click).

Do you have any idea of what is wrong ?

Here follows the patch, (modifications are inside the files 
modules/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.c modules/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.h and  
modules/FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c).

Regards,

Gilles

-.TH FvwmTaskBar 1 "6 October 2004 (2.5.12)" FVWM "FVWM Modules"
-.UC
-.SH NAME
-FvwmTaskBar \- the FVWM taskbar module
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-\fBFvwmTaskBar\fP [\fIname\fP]
-
-FvwmTaskBar is spawned by FVWM, so no command line invocation will work.
-
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-The FvwmTaskBar module provides a taskbar made up of buttons arranged by
-rows, each corresponding to a window that FVWM is managing.
-Clicking on first button gives focus to the corresponding top level window;
-clicking on the middle button will hide a top level window; third mouse 
button
-is reserved for a future extension (context menu).
-Like the other modules, FvwmTaskBar only works when fvwm is used as the
-window manager.
-
-When started, the taskbar shows up as a single row of buttons filling the
-full width of the screen, but during the work can be resized to accommodate
-up to 8 rows. In addition, if the AutoStick option is used, the taskbar
-will auto position itself at the top or bottom of the screen, and can be
-dragged from one position to another with a normal move operation.
-
-The first button of the taskbar, labelled "Start" sends a "Popup
-StartMenu" command to the FVWM, which can be used to pop-up a
-general-purpose menu when the button is pressed.
-
-The FvwmTaskBar also displays at the right side a window showing the
-current time and the built-in incoming mail indicator.
-
-.SH COPYRIGHTS
-The FvwmTaskBar module is derived from Mike Finger's FvwmWinList.
-
-Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes no guarantees or 
warranties of
-any kind about the use of this module.  Use this modules at your own risk.
-You may freely use this module or any portion of it for any purpose as long
-as the copyright is kept intact.
-
-.SH INITIALIZATION
-During initialization, \fIFvwmTaskBar\fP gets configuration information
-from FVWM to find the options that pertain to it.
-These options are discussed in a later section.
-
-.SH INVOCATION
-FvwmTaskBar can be invoked by fvwm during initialization by inserting the
-line 'Module FvwmTaskBar' in the .fvwm2rc file.
-
-FvwmTaskBar must reside in a directory that is listed in the ModulePath
-option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.
-
-.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
-The following options can be placed in the .fvwm2rc file
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Geometry \fI{+-}<X>{+-}<Y>\fP"
-Specifies the location and gravity of the FvwmTaskBar window.
-Currently, this option is scanned as a normal X geometry string.
-You can include the width and the height in addition to the "x" and
-"y" offset.  However, only the "x" and "y" offset are used.
-To avoid possible future compatibility problems, only code the "x" and
-"y" offset.
-
-The actual width of the taskbar is always the full width of the screen
-and the height is controlled by the *FvwmTaskBar: Rows option.
-
-If the AutoStick option
-is specified, the taskbar automatically "sticks" to the top or
-the bottom of the screen, whichever is closest to the geometry 
specification.
-
-To position the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, use a geometry of
-"+0-0".
-
-.IP  "*FvwmTaskBar: Rows r"
-Specifies the initial number in rows of the FvwmTaskBar window. Default
-is 1 and the maximum is 8.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Font \fIfont\fP"
-Specifies the default font to be used for labeling the buttons, when they
-are not depressed. If not specified, fixed font is assumed.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: SelFont \fIfont\fP"
-Specifies the font to be used for the depressed buttons. Note that the
-Start button will use always this font even if is not pressed. If this
-option is not specified, the default font is used instead.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: StatusFont \fIfont\fP"
-Specifies the font to be used for the clock and tip windows. If this
-option is not specified, fixed font is used.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Fore \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to use for the button names.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Back \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the background color for the bar and buttons.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset \fIcolorset\fP"
-Tells the module to use colorset \fIcolorset\fP for the window
-background and the foreground color of the buttons.  Please refer
-to the man page of the FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: IconFore \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to use for the button names which represent iconified
-windows.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: IconBack \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to use for the buttons which represent iconified 
windows.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: IconColorset \fIcolorset\fP"
-Tells the module to use colorset \fIcolorset\fP for the
-buttons of iconified windows.  Please refer to the man page of
-the FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: FocusFore \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to use for the button which represents the window
-with the focus.  If not specified the color specified by *FvwmTaskBar: 
Fore or
-*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset is used.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: FocusBack \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to use for the button which represents the window
-with the focus. If not specified the color specified by  *FvwmTaskBar: 
Back or
-*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset is used. Note that the button which represents 
the window
-with the focus is also highlighted.  See "*FvwmTaskBar: NoBrightFocus".
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: FocusColorset \fIcolorset\fP"
-Tells the module to use colorset \fIcolorset\fP for the button
-which represents the window with the focus. Please refer to the man page of
-the FvwmTheme module for details about colorsets.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: NoBrightFocus"
-By default the button which represents the window with the focus is
-highlighted. This option disables this feature.  \fINote:\fP you will
-want this option if you use a pixmap (via FvwmTheme) for the background.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: TipsFore \fIcolor\fP"
-Specifies the color to be used for the text in the tips windows.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: TipsBack \fIcolor\fP"

-Please refer to the man page of the FvwmTheme module for details about
-colorsets.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: AutoStick"
-This option causes the taskbar to "stick" either to the top or bottom
-of the screen, whichever is closest to the initial window placement. Any
-further move operation is also subject to that behavior.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: AutoFocus"
-This option causes the taskbar to raise a window if the cursor stays on a
-button in taskbar and its tip is open.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: AutoHide [\fIpixels\fP]"

-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Action \fIaction response\fP"
-Tells FvwmTaskBar to do \fIresponse\fP when \fIaction\fP is done.  The
-currently supported \fIaction\fPs are: Click1, Click2, Click3 and so on.
-By default the module supports 5 mouse buttons, but it can be compiled
-to support more.  The currently
-supported \fIresponse\fPs are any fvwm built-in commands, including modules
-and functions.  Warning: Use of the former syntax that allowed to use comma
-separated lists of commands is strongly discouraged due to synchronization
-problems with fvwm.  Please use complex fvwm functions instead (defined 
with
-the AddToFunc command of fvwm).
-
-In the \fIresponse\fP part, you can use a number of predefined
-variables: \fI$left\fP, \fI$right\fP, \fI$top\fP and \fI$bottom\fP
-are substituted by the left, right, top and bottom coordinates of
-the button pressed. \fI$-left\fP, \fI$-right\fP, \fI$-top\fP and
-\fI$-bottom\fP are substituted likewise, but the coordinates are
-calculated from the bottom or the right edge of the screen instead
-(for a button that is 5 pixels away from the right screen border,
-$-right will be 5). \fI$width\fP and \fI$height\fP are replaced by
-the width or height of the button.  All this is done regardless of
-any quoting characters. To get a literal '$' use the string '$$'.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Button Title \fItitle\fP, Icon \fIicon\fP, Action 
\fIaction\fP"
-Tells FvwmTaskBar to put a shortcut minibutton in the taskbar that does
-\fIaction\fP when clicked.  The icon can have a caption denoted by 
\fItitle\fP,
-an icon denoted by \fIicon\fP, or a combination of the two.  The icons will
-appear to the immediate right of the start button, and will appear in the
-order that they are declared in the .fvwm2rc file.
-
-To invoke different commands for different mouse clicks, use this syntax:
-
-.nf
-.sp
-*FvwmTaskBar: Button Title \fItitle\fP, Icon \fIicon\fP, \\
-              Action (Mouse 1) \fIaction1\fP, Action (Mouse 2) 
\fIaction2\fP
-.sp
-.fi
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: ButtonWidth \fIwidth\fP"
-Indicates the maximum width that window buttons should reach.
-(the minimum is hard coded at 32).
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: WindowButtonsLeftMargin \fImargin\fP"
-Specifies the space (in pixels) between the left side of the left-most 
window
-button and the right side of the start button or right-most shortcut
-minibutton.  If this option is not specified, the default margin is 4.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: WindowButtonsRightMargin \fImargin\fP"
-Specifies the space (in pixels) between the right side of the right-most
-window button and the left side of the clock and tip window.  If this 
option
-is not specified, the default margin is 2.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: StartButtonRightMargin \fImargin\fP"
-Specifies the space (in pixels) between the right side of the start button
-and the left side of the left-most shortcut minibutton.  If this option is
-not specified, the default margin is 0.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: 3DFvwm"
-By default the buttons use a special (asymmetric) 3D look. This option 
enables
-a more classical 3D look (Ie., a la fvwm).
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: HighlightFocus"
-If the mouse pointer is over the taskbar, the window under the current
-button is active. This behavior is like the TVTWM Icon Manager or
-FvwmIconMan. \fINote:\fP If you use this option combined with FollowMouse
-focus style, you'll want the taskbar to be ClickToFocus.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: ShowTips"
-Enables the tips windows (by default disabled).
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: NoIconAction \fIaction\fP"
-Tells FvwmTaskBar to do \fIaction\fP is when a NoIcon style window is
-iconified or de-iconified. Relevant coordinates are appended to 
\fIaction\fP so
-that the icon can be traced to an FvwmTaskBar button. An example action
-is "*FvwmTaskBar: NoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate". A 
blank or
-null action turns this feature off.
-
-.SH ""
-
-The following options deal more specifically with the status indicators
-displayed at the right of the taskbar.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: ClockFormat \fIformat-string\fP"
-This option specifies the time format for the digital clock.
-It is a \fIstrftime(3)\fP compatible format string.
-By default it is "%R". There is a 24 character limit for string
-expansion. The string depends of locale settings.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: DateFormat \fIformat-string\fP"
-This option specifies the date and/or time format for clock tip.
-It is a \fIstrftime(3)\fP compatible format string.
-By default it is "%A, %B %d, %Y". There is 40 characters limit for
-string expansion. The string depends of locale settings now.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: UpdateInterval \fIseconds\fP"
-Specifies how often the clock display should be refreshed, so that times of
-the form HH:MM:SS can be used. By default 60 seconds.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: BellVolume \fIvolume\fP"
-This sets the volume of the bell when mail is detected.
-It is a value between 0 (no bell) and 100 (maximum volume).
-By default it is set to 20.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: MailBox \fIpath\fP"
-This option instructs the module to look for mail at the specified place
-It is a full pathname to the user's mailbox.
-By default it is \fI/var/spool/mail/$USER_LOGIN\fP.
-A value of 'None' instructs the module not to have a mail indicator.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: MailCommand \fIcommand\fP"
-Specifies a \fIfvwm\fP command to be executed when double-clicking
-on the mail icon.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: MailCheck \fIseconds\fP"
-Specifies the interval between checks for new mail. The default is
-ten seconds. A value of zero or less switches mail checking off.
-
-Note, this value is only relable when greater than the \fIUpdateInterval\fP
-value. The mail check is done either on any redraw (like a focus change)
-or every nearest factor of the \fIUpdateInterval\fP value.
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: IgnoreOldMail"
-If set, draw no bitmap if there is no new mail.
-
-.SH ""
-The following options deal with the Start button at the left of the 
taskbar:
-
-.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: StartCommand \fIcommand\fP"
-This option specifies a command to run when the start button is
-pressed.  Some strings are replaced in the command when it is
-executed like for the other buttons.  See
-.B Action
-for details.  If both,
-.BR StartCommand " and " StartMenu
-have been defined, the command is executed first and the menu is
-opened afterwards.  The
-.B StartCommand
-can be used to exactly place a menu atop a button.
-

starting with fvwm 2.5.11 when fvwm is executing something like
"Wait NoSuchWindowName"
it shows a "busy cursor" and waits forever.
Well, not really forever: as soon as I hit any key, it crashes.

Hello,

Is the problem of events in systray clearly stated in my previous mail ?

I restate it if necessary.

Thanks in advance,

Cheers,

Gilles

> -.SH SYNOPSIS
> -\fBFvwmTaskBar\fP [\fIname\fP]
> -
> -FvwmTaskBar is spawned by FVWM, so no command line invocation will work.
> -
> -.SH DESCRIPTION
> -The FvwmTaskBar module provides a taskbar made up of buttons arranged by
> -rows, each corresponding to a window that FVWM is managing.
> -Clicking on first button gives focus to the corresponding top level 
> window;
> -clicking on the middle button will hide a top level window; third 
> mouse button
> -is reserved for a future extension (context menu).
> -Like the other modules, FvwmTaskBar only works when fvwm is used as the
> -window manager.
> -
> -When started, the taskbar shows up as a single row of buttons filling 
> the
> -full width of the screen, but during the work can be resized to 
> accommodate
> -up to 8 rows. In addition, if the AutoStick option is used, the taskbar
> -will auto position itself at the top or bottom of the screen, and can be
> -dragged from one position to another with a normal move operation.
> -
> -The first button of the taskbar, labelled "Start" sends a "Popup
> -StartMenu" command to the FVWM, which can be used to pop-up a
> -general-purpose menu when the button is pressed.
> -
> -The FvwmTaskBar also displays at the right side a window showing the
> -current time and the built-in incoming mail indicator.
> -
> -.SH COPYRIGHTS
> -The FvwmTaskBar module is derived from Mike Finger's FvwmWinList.
> -
> -Copyright 1994, Mike Finger. The author makes no guarantees or 
> warranties of
> -any kind about the use of this module.  Use this modules at your own 
> risk.
> -You may freely use this module or any portion of it for any purpose 
> as long
> -as the copyright is kept intact.
> -
> -.SH INITIALIZATION
> -During initialization, \fIFvwmTaskBar\fP gets configuration information
> -from FVWM to find the options that pertain to it.
> -These options are discussed in a later section.
> -
> -.SH INVOCATION
> -FvwmTaskBar can be invoked by fvwm during initialization by inserting 
> the
> -line 'Module FvwmTaskBar' in the .fvwm2rc file.
> -
> -FvwmTaskBar must reside in a directory that is listed in the ModulePath
> -option of FVWM for it to be executed by FVWM.
> -
> -.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
> -The following options can be placed in the .fvwm2rc file
> -
> -.IP "*FvwmTaskBar: Geometry \fI{+-}<X>{+-}<Y>\fP"
> -Specifies the location and gravity of the FvwmTaskBar window.
> -Currently, this option is scanned as a normal X geometry string.
> -You can include the width and the height in addition to the "x" and
> -"y" offset.  However, only the "x" and "y" offset are used.
> -To avoid possible future compatibility problems, only code the "x" and
> -"y" offset.
> -
> -The actual width of the taskbar is always the full width of the screen
> -and the height is controlled by the *FvwmTaskBar: Rows option.
> -
> -If the AutoStick option
> -is specified, the taskbar automatically "sticks" to the top or
> -the bottom of the screen, whichever is closest to the geometry 
> specification.
> -
> -To position the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, use a geometry of
> -"+0-0".
> -
> -.IP  "*FvwmTaskBar: Rows r"

I notice it mainly when sometimes a "Saving ..." mozilla window is
tried to be deiconified/raised.  Does not happen often, only when
downloading a large file (so that "Saving..." window will remain for
longer and deiconifying it will let me know the local path for the
remote file).

Thanks.

Do you really mean 2.4.19 not 2.4.20 (implying that fix is available
in stable release, fix for unstable is only in CVS)?

Sheepishly say i ... you see, i was using a function which would
unconditionally raise & deiconify the window (from WindowListFunc);
i cannot confidently say if window raising would also cause, or is
part of, the problem in any way.  The trace apparently shows
problem, for now, only w/ the deiconification.

I have generated the patch (from 2.5.12 & CVS via ftp)  below for
icons.c.  Is this sufficient?

Here it is. The only changed file is modules/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.c.
I used fvwm-2.5.12.

As an illustration I also include my config for patched taskbar.

Currently, EdgeResistance doesn't seem to take struts into account. This
makes sense for scrolling, but for window movement/resizing, I think it
would make more sense to treat them as screen edges.

Ola

I rarely use the mouse to manipulate windows, preferring keyboard
shortcuts.  Moving windows can be a pain, though, since there is no way
to automagically snap a window to another window border.  This patch
introduces the "SnapMove" command, which will move a window in a
specified direction until it snaps to another window border or the edge
of the screen.  This can be considered as almost equivalent to the
GrowUp/GrowDown etc. maximize parameters.

For a little demo, open several xlogo's, apply the patch, add the
following to your .fvwm2rc

	Key Up		WSF	C	SnapMove North
	Key Left	WSF	C	SnapMove West
	Key Down	WSF	C	SnapMove South
	Key Right	WSF	C	SnapMove East

and shuffle windows to your heart's content.

I'm slightly unhappy with the syntax.  As is it does everything I want,
but it might be preferrable to use "SnapLeft/SnapRight" etc. as
parameters to the Move/AnimatedMove commands (i.e. "Move 0 SnapUp").
Handling diagonal motions is not currently implemented -- should we move
horizontally, then vertically, or the other way around?

Movement is currently hardcoded to warp the pointer and animate window
motion, but adding extra parameters should also be considered, e.g.
"SnapMove North Animated" or "SnapMove South Warp".  For further
bitches, moans and probable stumble blocks, see the comment block at the
top of the code.

Hope you like the idea...

Starting with version 2.5.11 SnapAttraction no longer works for me.

I have narrowed it down to the transition from 2.5.10 to 2.5.11 in
fvwm/move_resize.c.

In particular the __move_loop function has changed some event management
stuff in the proximity of lines 2100-2200.  I switched it back to the
2.5.10 code in a test and SnapAttraction went back to working.

However, I do not have time to look into why the code changed in the first
place, so I have no proper patch to fix this.

Can you please fetch me a stack trace?  Look for the "core" file,
then run

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

and post the output to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

Ciao

2.5.12 does not work either.

I first notcied the problem when I last updated my debian box, which jumped
me to 2.5.12.  I then tried versions of fvwm in backwards progression,
compiled myself (starting with 2.5.12, to ensure it was not the debian
packager's fault), until I hit one that worked...namely 2.5.10.

I then isolated the problem to the mentioned area of code.

 SnapAttraction 20 SameType
 SnapGrid 10 10

	It actually works, but only if no modifier is pressed. So, if
 one has a binding like 

Mouse 1 T A move-or-raise 
 one has to release alt before getting attraction.

Hi,

        [Please retain the CC to 276434-forwarded@bugs.debian.org
         so that the Debian BTS has a record of your input]

	This was reported by a Debian user.

 Fvwm2 seems to have some trouble with the EWMH fullscreen mode.

 My configuration includes a stay-on-top FvwmPager.  When putting EWMH
 compliant applications, such as tvtime, the pager is not obscured by
 the fullscreen window, so I get a TV window with a pager floating on
 top, which is less than desirable.

 The bug can also be reproduced with the fullscreen modes in Mozilla
 Firefox and OpenOffice.org, but I have not tested using this
 extensively as I have with tvtime.

 The bug can be worked around by setting:

 Style *           EWMHUseStackingOrderHints

 in the .fvwm2rc file.

 After investigating the problem, my analysis of the problem is that
 it seems (according to the excellent fvwm manual page) that the
 EWMHUseStackingOrderHints was intended to disable/enable some
 KDE-specific extentions.

 Unfortunately, the slightly misleading option name lead a programmer to
 misinterpret the meaning of the flag when programming the fullscreen
 code, and made that disable the stacking code in that when it was
 enabled.

 The fact that the option is not intended to disable *all* stacking
 hints is further supported by the fact that tvtime also has an (AFAIK)
 EWMH-compliant Always-on-top mode, which does manage to obscure the
 pager properly, even when EWMHUseStackingOrderHints unset.

 From http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/1.3/ar01s07.html#STACKINGORDER

 # Stacking order
 #
 # To obtain good interoperability between different Desktop Environments,
 # the following layered stacking order is recommended, from the bottom:
 #
 # * windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP
 # * windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW
 # * windows not belonging in any other layer
 # * windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK (unless they have state
 #   _NET_WM_TYPE_BELOW) and windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE
 # * focused windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
 #
 # Windows that are transient for another window should be kept above this
 # window.
 #
 # The window manager may choose to put some windows in different stacking
 # positions, for example to allow the user to bring currently a active
 # window to the top and return it back when the window looses focus.


	Let me summarize:

 If the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints style is on, fullscreen works. Pager
 is hidden as it should be.

 If the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints style is off, fullscren works, but
 pager is not hidden. But, EWMH always-on-top modes such as the one
 found in tvtime still works.

 According to the documentation, EWMHUseStackingOrderHints affects
 KDE-specific extentions. The extentions mentioned aren't KDE
 extentions, they are a part of the EWMH standard 1.3 from
 freedesktop.org. So either the documentation is wrong or the code is
 wrong.

 And still, you shouldn't have to activate a special option in order
 for FVWM to fully comply with the recommendation in the standard.

 So, I see two possibilities:

 - The option is intended to tell EWMH never to dictate stacking. In
   that case it's broken since tvtime's EWMH always-on-top stacking
   still works when that option is disabled, and the documentation is
   wrong.

 - And what I think is more likely: The option was intended to
   activate special KDE-specific extentions (as per the documentation)
   but somehow breaks fullscreen mode to be out of compliance with
   recommendations if disabled. This has nothing to do with KDE
   extentions AFAIK.

So, everything is fine. No? You use a stay on top pager (i.e., you use
stacking), so you should use this style. I've no time to explain why,
but I do like stay on top windows at all. Maybe, this
EWMHUseStackingOrderHints should be on by default. I do not know (and
I do not care).

For me the bug is in the man page.

FVWM try to follow the spec but surely do not follow this
*recommendation* without an user intervention (or if
EWMHUseStackingOrderHints was a default, without the possibility to
break such a recommendation). For me, the only acceptable stacking
rule is the one concerning _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP.

Fine.

Maybe  tvtime use the old GNOME hints? What happen if you use
Style * IgnoreGnomeHints ?

The documentation is wrong. The EWMHUseStackingOrderHints code and doc
was written before _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW, _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN was introduced in the ewmh spec.  Even, I
think that at some point in the spec elaboration it was decided that
no stacking rules should appear in the spec (Dominik?), but one day 
someone decided that all wm should work like kwin and metacity ...

The code follows the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints style but not the
doc :o/ This happen even with FVWM!

Not agree (but I do not care if we can disable these stacking
dictatorial rules via a style).

Yes!

Maybe there is a bug somewhere. I've not tvtime here; but as I said
maybe the old GNOME hints are used. Try to disable the GNOME hints
and see if tvtime is still stay on top.

No.

Thanks for the clear feedback.

Hi,

        [Please retain the CC to 276434-forwarded@bugs.debian.org
         so that the Debian BTS has a record of your input]

	This was reported by a Debian user.

 Fvwm2 seems to have some trouble with the EWMH fullscreen mode.

 My configuration includes a stay-on-top FvwmPager.  When putting EWMH
 compliant applications, such as tvtime, the pager is not obscured by
 the fullscreen window, so I get a TV window with a pager floating on
 top, which is less than desirable.

 The bug can also be reproduced with the fullscreen modes in Mozilla
 Firefox and OpenOffice.org, but I have not tested using this
 extensively as I have with tvtime.

 The bug can be worked around by setting:

 Style *           EWMHUseStackingOrderHints

 in the .fvwm2rc file.

 After investigating the problem, my analysis of the problem is that
 it seems (according to the excellent fvwm manual page) that the
 EWMHUseStackingOrderHints was intended to disable/enable some
 KDE-specific extentions.

 Unfortunately, the slightly misleading option name lead a programmer to
 misinterpret the meaning of the flag when programming the fullscreen
 code, and made that disable the stacking code in that when it was
 enabled.

 The fact that the option is not intended to disable *all* stacking
 hints is further supported by the fact that tvtime also has an (AFAIK)
 EWMH-compliant Always-on-top mode, which does manage to obscure the
 pager properly, even when EWMHUseStackingOrderHints unset.

 From http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/wm-spec/1.3/ar01s07.html#STACKINGORDER

 # Stacking order
 #
 # To obtain good interoperability between different Desktop Environments,
 # the following layered stacking order is recommended, from the bottom:
 #
 # * windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP
 # * windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW
 # * windows not belonging in any other layer
 # * windows of type _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK (unless they have state
 #   _NET_WM_TYPE_BELOW) and windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE
 # * focused windows having state _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
 #
 # Windows that are transient for another window should be kept above this
 # window.
 #
 # The window manager may choose to put some windows in different stacking
 # positions, for example to allow the user to bring currently a active
 # window to the top and return it back when the window looses focus.


	Let me summarize:

 If the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints style is on, fullscreen works. Pager
 is hidden as it should be.

 If the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints style is off, fullscren works, but
 pager is not hidden. But, EWMH always-on-top modes such as the one
 found in tvtime still works.

 According to the documentation, EWMHUseStackingOrderHints affects
 KDE-specific extentions. The extentions mentioned aren't KDE
 extentions, they are a part of the EWMH standard 1.3 from
 freedesktop.org. So either the documentation is wrong or the code is
 wrong.

 And still, you shouldn't have to activate a special option in order
 for FVWM to fully comply with the recommendation in the standard.

 So, I see two possibilities:

 - The option is intended to tell EWMH never to dictate stacking. In
   that case it's broken since tvtime's EWMH always-on-top stacking
   still works when that option is disabled, and the documentation is
   wrong.

 - And what I think is more likely: The option was intended to
   activate special KDE-specific extentions (as per the documentation)
   but somehow breaks fullscreen mode to be out of compliance with
   recommendations if disabled. This has nothing to do with KDE
   extentions AFAIK.


 The bug has been tested mainly on fvwm debian versions 2.5.10-12 and
 2.5.10-13 (latest testing versions), and has also been tested against
 2.5.12 from the tarball from upstream.

Well, so far there has not been a lock up.  Now, only if i could
reproduce the problem on demand.

Very well -- so long as a proper description of the option is in the man 
page, I think this bug can be closed.

That's a policy decision for the fvwm team I guess, but I still think it 
makes sense to give full screen applications -- er -- the full screen. :-)
But I can see the case where some body would like to float xclock over 
their session of Quake 3 or whatever to make sure he doesn't stay up too 
late gaming. :-)

No. According to Billy Biggs (main developer of tvtime), he says that he's
pretty sure that he uses EWMH hints only for this case. I haven't looked
closely at the source code himself, though, but I could unless you know 
another way to check what tvtime uses.

The IgnoreGnomeHints style does nothing to change the described behavior.

I think the EWMH stacking rules are mostly common sense, and should be the 
default, although they should be overridable by user setting -- i.e. the 
inverse of EWMHUseStackingOrderHints or whatever, but again that's a 
policy decision for the fvwm team.

I've just tried tvtime version 0.9.12. I can confirm that it uses the
EWMH fullscreen hint and no GNOME hints. However, If I've a stay on
top window (EWMHUseStackingOrderHints not enabled) this window is
*not* covered by tvtime.

What version of tvtime do you use?

I take fast look at the 0.9.13 source code. What *may* happen is that
after tvtime is mapped it ask to be above with the _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE
hints (if a window want to be above it should set this state before
mapping). So, FVWM interprets this has a user query (e.g., the user
has used the kicker taskbar menu on the tvtime "icon") and not as a
program query and respect the user query (ignoring !EWMHUseStackingOrderHints).
If tvtime do effectively this, in my opinion, it tries to override
the wm stacking policy and this is not regular (and I will be not happy
with such application).

There is a plan to extend the EWMH spec so that the wm can know
who send a _NET_WM_STATE_FOO query (so if the app developers do
not cheat we will be able to handle the situation below).

I sure hope that is meant as an acknowledgement that this is a problem,
not as a solution/workaround.

I only move and resize windows with modifiers since I do not have title
bars or borders at all.

The intended logic is simple, as long as Alt is pressed, there is no
snap-attraction; as long as it is not pressed, there is one.

It is possible to press and release Alt as many times as needed to switch
snap-attraction on and off while moving windows using keyboard or mouse.

But, I think, the described logic was such only initially when I added
this feature. I changed it since then:

2002-04-27  Mikhael Goikhman  <migo@homemail.com>

        * fvwm/move_resize.c:
        don't start Move with snap disabled if Alt is initially pressed

So, indeed, it seems like someone changed the logic again.

Please don't keep fvwm-bugs in Cc, any message to it starts a new bug.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not when alt being continuously pressed is part of your only way of moving
a window...which is the workflow I put SnapAttraction into fvwm in the
first place for.  Therefore, I hope that this new intended logic is not
really intended anymore.

Really, this toggable snap feature thing should be via some bindable event,
not a specific modifier (like an alt key), and it should be unbound (off)
by default.

Alternatively it should be setup by a command like:
SnapToggle M

It was on in 2.5.10, and it seems you liked it. The toggle-able snap
feature worked starting with the first fresh Alt press.

There are many hardcoded bindings, like Ctrl-arrows moves a window by 1
pixel in interactive Move. Middle mouse button cancels Move, third button
activates a certain window flag. This is good. Noone complained yet.

In short, I agree that the logic from 2.5.10 should be restored. but I
think your suggestions are redundant.

Mikhael.

I don't think this is the right behaviour, Maximize with grow should
only ignore the working area when ewmhiwa is specified.

I attached a simple patch to fix that.

Hi,

        [Please retain the CC to 278443-forwarded@bugs.debian.org, so
        that the Debian BTS has a record of your input]

	This was reported by a Debian user. I have managed to
 reproduce it (indeed, for me it happens even without adding the
 explicit Wait to my regular .fvwm2rc).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 I keep getting segmentation faults from fvwm, and I figured out a way
 to reproduce them consitently.

 It seems that fwm segfaults when the control key is pressed while the
 wm is waiting.

 Here is how to reproduce it. Use the following fvwm2rc:

   DestroyFunc InitFunction
   AddToFunc InitFunction
   + "I" Wait foo

 Then, while fvwm is waiting for something which is not going to
 happen, press the control key. It's a guaranteed segmentation on my
 system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	It does not appear under gdb, or while stracing (at least,
	under strace, things just hung, there were no crashes -- but
	it was not normal behaviour)

	manoj
