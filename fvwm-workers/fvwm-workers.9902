Just in case anybody was curious enough to get it already, 
I have replaced the copy of GtkMenus.tgz on peano with a version
correcting two bugs found immediately after putting it up.

 * look for $HOME/.GtkMenusrc, not $HOME/.*GtkMenusrc
 * don't forget to send UNLOCK if an unknown menu is popped up
   (this caused fvwm to lock up).

I think that the module name aliasing in its current incarnation
is useless. I tried to have two copies of GtkMenus:

Module GtkMenus
Module GtkMenus FooBar

Mouse 3 A A SendToModule GtkMenus test 3
Mouse 2 A A SendToModule FooBar test2 2

and I found that the two copies of GtkMenus in fact read their
respective configuration lines, but SendToModule doesn't know
anything about aliases; pressing M3 sends "test 3" to both incarnations
while pressing M2 sends nothing, since there is no module named FooBar,
as far as fvwm knows.

I think there is a similar problem with KillModule.

These ones seem to be bugs. If the menu is n times m
pixels wide/high, the biggest valid x/y values are n-1 and
m-1. I.e. x = mr->width and y = mr->height are not inside the
menu. Wasn't there some discussions recently if the end points
of a line are drawn (XDrawLine)? The same applies to other
parts of the diagonal gradient code.

If this solves the problem in this situation there must be
a bug in the compiler or some math library or your X server.
Anyway, I wouldn't trust a linewidth of one painting every
pixel. Jay, did you have a look at how it's done e.g. for
title bars?

I dont understand these lines:

  if( i % dc == 0 )
    XSetForeground(dpy, Scr.TransMaskGC,
                   ms->look.face.u.grad.pixels[cindex++]);

What are the circumstances under which the cindex is increased
(in human readable language)?

I agree completely.  As it is, the second arg on a module invocation
line may be an alias, or it may be something else.  fvwm2 has no clue.

I'm not sure what  the solution is,  but, at  least for  KillModule, I
lean  toward the module   reading config lines   as it is running, and
understanding "stop" commands, as in FvwmAnimate.

This gives modules a chance to intelligently  process the stop command
in something other than a signal handler.

When I reported a FvwmWinList hang, it turned out to be a Recapture and
FvwmAnimate LockOnSend problem.

Perhaps we need an explicit way to start a module with an alias:

AliasModule GtkMenus Foobar

to work like "Module", just giving fvwm2 the information that this
incarnation of GtkMenus wants to be called Foobar ? Or even

Module GtkMenus alias=Foobar

Perhaps the softlink method is still the best...

Sounds reasonable and GtkMenus reads config lines, but my more urgent problem
is with SendToModule (its not actually that urgent, I merely wanted to
try stupid things like having a macos-themed menu on the left button and
a win95-themed menu on the right one...)

	Well, I believe the (int)(i*ds) - 1) is wrong also (deliberately
so - as I said, I just wanted to see what happened if I moved the line
one pixel to the left, and was surprised that it didn't cause a different
mis-drawing). Only the rightmost end point should have been moved to the
left.

	I should think so. But this is the only area where I saw the
problem occurring, so it's the only one I tinkered with. I'm really
curious whether anyone else can duplicate the problem.

	That's conceivable. I'm using egcs 1.0.2 on a Linux system
with the AcceleratedX 4.1 X server (which has always seemed quite
solid). This is the only machine I have access to that I can test
this stuff with. The Sun box at work is one of those infernal 8-bit-
only mongrels, so any gradient decorations are pretty much out.

	As I said before, I don't pretend to understand any of
the menu code. Umm...who wrote this part?

I just spent the last few hours putting in debug statements and it seems the problem was with the and xpm call, upon checking it was a problem with the xpm library, we may want to make a note to not compile fvwm against libxpm that is built with -debug.

Brad
Sorry for the delay I just didn't want us to have another module problem that was going to force a rerelease.

I have a 2.1.11 spun and ready to go, but it seems like people are still
picking at the DGradient problem.  Shall I wait a bit and see if
anything comes of it today?

Can you give a few more details?  Why should compiling with debugging on
cause a problem like this?

It seems that when 3.4.11 of libxpm is built with -DDEBUG it compile in a debug version of free that does a sleep 60, and then continues on.  Which gives the appearnce of a X server hang since the Server was grabbed when the free was called.  So I rebuilt the library without this function and everything worked as expected.
I suppose the real question is why anyone wouldn't want to sleep inside of a call to free but that is a question for a different list.

	Hmm...I was forgetting the odd line of pixels in the middle
where the background showed through. Maybe the move of both end
points was the right thing.

It looks like you have a server bug, at least that would be my guess at
why you get the vertical lines left behind.  The lines are drawn in
mr->w and they shouldn't go outside.  The missing pixel lines are where
the code goes from drawing the top left corner to the bottom right. It
could be that rounding errors are getting in and by moving the lines
left by one pixel you fix them.  I don't get the missing pixels so this
fix makes the centre line be drawn twice for me.  There should be
missing lines in BGradients for you and they should be fixed the same
way.

To be honest I don't like the look of D/BGradients, I'd rather see the
lines drawn at 45degrees. Here's a patch that implements this and does
not use any floating arithmetic.  It's less code since it does the
gradient in one stage rather than two and it should not have any missing
pixels, but it does draw lines to points outside the window (the server
should clip them).  Each line is at 45 degrees and only one pixel from
its neighbour. To me this looks better when you have visible bands in
the gradient (DGradient 4 blue white). Before submenu gradients would be
at different angles to their parents.

If this fixes your problems we should vote on whether it goes in (I
abstain, but then I don't get missing pixels).

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes, let's discuss this one first. Paul (PDS), could you write
a FAQ question/answer that summarizes all these problems that
may show up with XPM? It seems to be a rich source of complaints
so I'd like to have some hints in the FAQ even if it's not
fvwm's fault.

Could you try the same with gcc, just to make sure?

Well, I think I can decide if this was right or wrong by
checking the code, but it doesn't explain the vertical
lines on the root window.

How about I put something in the INSTALL.fvwm file, with a pointer to it
in the FAQ?  I think build/install issues are better addressed there in
the (vain?) hope people read that file before installing.

Actually, I already added some text there--I forgot :)

I added a new note to the top warning about config.cache.

The text there now dealing with shared libs is somewhat generic (that
is, it doesn't mentione xpm very explicitly) but accurate.

I'll try to come up with some XPM-specific notes.

	This did fix the problem. Also the gradients seem to look
smoother. Based on this, I'll cast a blind vote (meaning I haven't
taken the time to look at the code, I just applied your patch and tried
it) for including this. And maybe we can get 2.1.11 out Real Soon Now!

	Not quickly, since I don't have a stock (non-egcs) gcc on
this machine anymore. I'd have to install one.

	However, for our immediate purposes, the change that Tim
just posted corrects the problem, so I'd vote that we go with it
unless anyone sees any reason for skepticism. It also seems a mite
quicker and smoother on my slo-o-o-w 133 MHz machine..

	When I have a little free time, however, I would like to try
a stock gcc (and a newer egcs) with the old code, just to see what
we can see.

	I did just now.. the gradients on buttons/titlebars are drawn
using XFillRectangle.  There is, however, a XSetClipMask in there (at
least if PIXMAP_BUTTONS is defined.  If there was any 'accidental'
bleedover it would clip it.  Perhaps this is something we should try for
the D/Bgradients.  Though if it is buggy XServer code, there probably
isn't much we can do.

> (in human readable language)?

	This line appears just before the for loop:

	dc = mr->width * 2 / ms->look.face.u.grad.npixels + 1;

	What this does is set dc to the number of pixels in each band of
color for the given gradient.  It bases its estimate on a window twice the
width of the menu it is drawing. 

	These lines, then:

	if( i % dc == 0 )
          XSetForeground(dpy, Scr.TransMaskGC,
                         ms->look.face.u.grad.pixels[cindex++]);
  
	Test to see if i is evenly divisible by the color-band width.  If
it is, then it's time to switch to the next color in the gradient.  


I am beginning to think we should either trash D/BGradients or confine
them somehow.. Perhaps doing something like WindowMaker and making the
D/Bgradients localized... IE- in a small box, say the size of a single
menu entry.  Maybe the 45 degree-version would do well with this regard, I
have not looked at it yet..  

or maybe just fix them as best we can and have a disclaimer: 'Processor
intensive and possibly ugly' ;P

	I can duplicate it.  If I use DGradient I get that extra band
along the side every so often.  I think that it may actually be a bug in
the AcceleratedX server (which I too am using).  I bet it is.  I'll look
tomorrow at work and see if I get the same thing on my 'normal' XFree86
system.

	I think they are bugs in the Xserver, because if they were just
math errors, I would think that the Xserver would not let it off of the
window it was drawing on.  My guess is that it has something to do with
the line-drawing code in AcceleratedX.

	I'll check it tomorrow and report.

Sounds sensible. I propose that we incorporate Tim's 45 degree
drawing code and be done with it for now. In the future I'd
like to document such bugs and ignore them otherwise.

Looks very good.  It isn't mentioned in the README though.

Since nobody has reacted to the problems with Move and GetArgument
which I reported some days ago, I looked myself and found that
there was an implicit assumption that the InteractiveMove function
would only be called from KeyPress or ButtonPress events. A one-line
fix is appended. The problem with GetArgument is a bit more complicated
to resolve and I ended up with an extra parameter to PeekArgument.
To avoid any possible problems I renamed it to DoPeekToken and wrote
a wrapper under the original name. This, too, is appended below.

I guess you may not want to apply these fixes while struggling to
put out 2.2. I'll be happy to push them on my stack of pending patches.

  I guess this won't be a 2.2 thing, but FvwmCommand won't with more than
one workstation-login at a time 'cos the ~/.FvwmCommand[CM] files areb't
uniquely named. I suspect just putting the hostname in there would cover
it.

  I'll patch it myself next release, since I actually doubt anyone else
cares ...

No need for a patch, you can have FvwmCommand(S) use a different name by
setting the first parameter to FvwmCommandS to a unique name and using
the -f option to FvwmCommand.  If you use FvwmCpp/M4 to process your
start-up you can use the HOSTNAME variable in the function that calls
FvwmCommandS.  You could write a shell script to cal FvwmCommand that
also uses $HOSTNAME.

Cheers,
Tim.

	I've confirmed it... (to my satisfaction) Using the same config
that I get all sorts of ugly lines left behind on my home machine
(running AcceleratedX), it works fine on my workstation, running XFree.

Jay

PS- I updated this morning, and I think the 45 degree code looks great.
And it has no ugly residue ;P

OK, I'll add it there, as well as the FAQ.

So, I saw the gradient fix go in... is 2.1.11 ready to be spun?

I think so, three people have confirmed the 45degree gradients work
better (including me).

Great!

FYI, we did not forget you we're just so busy with 2.2.

	Of course, I have seen. That's why I didn't post anymore on that 
subject. During the time I upgraded to 2.1.10 and found a port of xpm library, 
so now, I also have textured windows and menus (great job about menu 
customization, I like the SidePic where I put a rotated FVWM logo from icons 
directory). All docs are ready. OpenVms people have lived without Fvwm until 
now, they can wait some more days :-) 
	It's possible that I have to move away from OpenVms (toward Unix:-) 
soon, maybe before 2.2. I'll trying to find someone else to go on with my 
work in case I must abandon... I'll tell you.
	Fab.

We've had some reports about key bindings, but we couldn't
reproduce them and the reporters were unwilling to cooperate
with us so we don't know if our fixes work. Please try to
answer these questions:

1) Which OS do you have?

2) Which XServer?

3) Which compiler?

4) Does it work if you press num-lock first?

5) Does it work if you replace the '1' with 'M' (or whatever
   is the correct modifier)?

6) Does it work after you restart fvwm?

7) Do you use SloppyFocus?

8) Does it work with MouseFocus?

9) Does it work with ClickToFocus?

10) If you use sloppy focus, try this while no window is focused
    (just close the window with the focus and make sure the mouse
     does not move into another window).

11) Could you post all your key/mouse binding lines from your
    .fvwm2rc (or better the complete file)?

Your help will be appreciated,

Bye

Dominik

Speaking of which...it would be nice if we had a sideways fvwm2 logo
in the icons directory.

We already use the "mini." convention for mini icons.  It would seem
to me that "side.xxxx.xpm" would make sense.

Agreed!

There's a few nice sideways logos that come with the Debian
distribution; there's an "fvwm 95" -- I don't know why "95", but it's a
start.

Oops, sorry, I got distracted.
You should reply to the workers list, someone else might want to pick this up.

For a stack trace, cd to the directory containing the core file,
(your home directory).  Type in:

gdb full_path_to_fvwm_event core

after gdb comes up, type in "where".

Send us the output.

2.1.11 is in the incoming area.

So... we should assume this is it, right? :)

I think the thing to concentrate on now is any documentation issues.

Jason; I know the initial DNS changes for fvwm.org are done but you said
you might want to change things around some more: is that still TBD, or
should we start changing the CVS, FTP, and email addresses to the new
domain in the docs, etc.?

What else?

  I keep thinking M = Alt (not Sun Meta) on my keyboard. I'll try  ... 
yes, it does!

  Indeed.

  Gack. Can't really anwer that without logging out, since it works after
Restart.

  Ditto.

  I'm going to have to log out, aren't I :)

Thanks for the quick answer. We'll see what we can find out with 
this infomation.

OK, the name probably does not matter. If I recall correctly
all the people who reported this key binding troubles had
Solaris/SunOS (well I'm not 100% sure).

Do you mean "'1' to a 'M'"?

You can use FvwmTalk or FvwmCommand to change that while fvwm is
running. E.g. with FvwmCommand:

  Put this line in your .fvwm2rc:

    Module FvwmCommandS

  And then you can issue this command in your shell:

    FvwmCommand 'Style * MouseFocus'

  And then do a recapture (you can use FvwmCommand too if
  you don't have it in some menu or bound to a key).

    FvwmCommand 'Recapture'

This is really handy for testing and debugging. You can
issue most fvwm command while fvwm is already running.

Ditto ;-)

No, not really :)

  No, it doesn't work like this.

I've lost track a bit. Could someone have a look at said bugs in
the incoming directory and see which are resolved/setup problem/...
i.e. which can be moved to some 'resolved' state?

Bye

Dominik

128) I think is resolved in that AutoHide is known to be dodgy and there
is already a bug report.  The focus changing bit was due to running the
wrong version of FvwmTaskBar.

154) is the FvwmWinList core dump that caused us to go to 2.1.11. It's
fixed

Cheers,
Tim.

Ouch.

Double ouch!  I think there are a large number of patches to Openwindows
for Solaris 2.4 (boy, that's old! :).  No idea if this is one of them.

On a "normal" Sun type5 keyboard, the X server treats the key marked
"Alt" as the Alt modifier (I think it's also mod4).

The key with the diamond on it right next to the space bar is the Meta
key.  That responds when I use "M" as the modifier.  Using "1" didn't
work for me.

Yes.  Let's go ahead and change everything over to point to
(cvs|ftp|www).fvwm.org; these should be working now (thanks, Jay).  I still
have some movement I want to do, mainly switching to a Linux machine
instead of this Digital machine that, while free, running at 266MHz and
having 256MB of RAM, is rather disappointing performance-wise.  I've also
gotten used to the extreme ease of working with Linux.  But that's neither
here nor there, and nobody but me should have to worry about it.

One important thing: when giving instructions for the mailing lists, it's
best to use the -request addresses instead of majordomo@hpc.uh.edu.
Relying on the central address makes a few things more difficult.

I'd also like to give the web pages a going-over before the true release
time.  The Links page especially needs some serious work.  If you know of
links that need to be added (at least fvwm.themes.org and the fvwm2gnome
site) please say so.

Jason, could you write a summary of what exactly has changed and
post it to the mailing lists? I think not too many people have
followed this.

137) This was fixed before 2.1.10 came out, I think; we switched the
     configure tests and makefiles around to put the specific XPM lib
     and include flags before the generic X flags.

     Marked fixed.

144) This one we never really resolved.  The situation was very odd, to
     begin with; Steve (? someone, anyway) suggested using
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH and that resolved the problem for the user.  We
     decided not to bother pursuing it.

     Marked fixed.

122 was unreproducible and 155 hasn't been pursued yet. Is this
correct?

I see this also, with 2.1.4 and 2.1.10.

This was OK with 2.0.46. I suspect it derives from the new algorithm
for doing shading. I found that the FvwmScrollBack config works just
fine like this, however ... 

  *FvwmScrollBack Grey

Note to fvwm-workers ... black is a bad choice for default colour
given the new algorithm. Does someone want to change the following
default to something more sensible?

  FvwmScroll.c:52:char *BackColor = "black";

Cheers

Quite simple, really:

Web site is now:

    http://www.fvwm.org/

FTP site is now:

    ftp.fvwm.org

Mailing lists are now:

    fvwm@fvwm.org
    fvwm-request@fvwm.org
    fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
    fvwm-workers-request@fvwm.org   (?)

CVS server is now:

    cvs.fvwm.org

In other words, throw out all the various uh.edu addresses and replace
them with fvwm.org.

Basically, there is an address at fvwm.org for everything:

cvs.fvwm.org - CVS server (points to cvs.hpc.uh.edu for now)
www.fvwm.org - same as fvwm.math.uh.edu
ftp.fvwm.org - points to ftp.hpc.uh.edu for now

The mailing lists:
fvwm@fvwm.org
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
fvwm-announce@fvwm.org

The mailing list -request addresses:
fvwm-workers-request@fvwm.org
fvwm@fvwm.org
fvwm-announce-request@fvwm.org

Subscription instructions:

Send "subscribe" in the body of a message to one of the request addresses
above.

All of the other hostnames and addresses still work, at least for the time
being.

For 155 I think I have seen this, what had done was eaten up all my colors on an 8-bit display changed some of the title stuff in FvwmConsole and then did a recapture to pick up the changes .

When te recapture finished I didn't get any buttons at all until I freed some colors and did another recapture.  I'm not sure this is the same bug.  If it is I would say its not a bug but a limitation of a bit displays.

Well, it's still a bug I think.

If fvwm can't allocate a pixmap for a button, for any reason including
lack of colors, it should choose a default and still allow the button to
operate (while printing an error to the log about it).

It must be more complex than simply not being able to create the pixmap,
because I've quite often fat-fingered my config file such that a pixmap
could not be found; then the button was blank but it still worked.

Never did it during a recapture, I guess.

Given the problem report:

The title bar buttons stop  working occasionally, they no longer press
in and do not perform their defined function.

I don't see this as a color map problem.

Given the way the Title bar buttons are bound:

  Mouse 0 2 N     Close
  Mouse 0 3 N     Stick
  Mouse 0 4 N     Maximize
  Mouse 3 6 N     Replace
  Mouse 0 6 N     Iconify
            ^

I would think it very likely there was a modifier active at the time.
(Ie. num-lock, or caps-lock was on.)

This would explain the seemingly random way the symptom appeared and disappeared.

Subject: Problem with raising X window

Full_Name: Purushottam Sane
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: DG/UX 4.20
X_Server: Exceed
Submission from: (NULL) (128.221.131.252)


I use Exceed to display X windows on my Windows NT machine.
I have few applications (eg -netscape) running on winNT.
If focus is in one of these windows (winnt application), when I click
on a X window (under fvwm window management), this window does not come
to the foreground (ie - does not get raized). With previous version of
fvwm (2.0.46), at least when I click on the titlebar of the said window,
the window used to come on the foreground. With new one, unless I drag
the window (in order to move it), this window does not come to fore.

It's a very annoying feature when switching between a window under fvwm
management and on drawn by a native winnt application.

One thing i see right away is that the web site is stale.

* The news/change log page is only up to 2.1.8

* The links page has many dead links. (near 50% ??)

* Also, if all of "Bob Woodside's Miscellaneous patches" have been
applied, then I'd (temporarily) remove or demote his link because his
page is also out of date. (no offense intended).

* For the links page I'd suggest adding these links:

Also, I saw on Yahoo, under the windowmanager directory,

http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/
	Operating_Systems/X_Window_System/Software/Window_Managers/

, that FVWM is labeled as the "Feeble Virtual Window Manager".   While
there is merit to being humble, this doesn't seem very flattering, and
it certainly isn't accurate.  We need better PR than that (as i note
below).

Someone should remember to update the Yahoo link for the home page to
point to www.fvwm.org  -- it's pointing to www.hpc.uh.edu ! (It would be
a conflict of interest for me to change it... :)  

Also submit the new link to all the search engines.

Almost all of Yahoo's fvwm links are dead too. :(

Scanning the net, it looks like we need to stir up some hoopla about
FVWM2 -- many fvwm pages seem to have disappeared.  Everyone seems
distracted right now by E and WindowMaker... :(  

Part of the answer is very user-friendly (html) documentation -- and
showcasing the many fvwm2 features and functions on the website.  Most
people i talk to think fvwm never evolved beyond the 1.0
functionality... even if they're using fvwm2!  

By showcasing, I mean small screenshots and config samples for each
bullet point in the features list.

Look at http://www.windowmaker.org/features.html for an example.  I'd
like to do it one better.  Their whole site is very nice and business
like.

(I'm being brave here:) What about a new logo for the new release?

Thoughts?

	I'd be willing to work on this... I'm going to work on a sample
fvwmrc that shows off some of the new features, but I think I could
squeeze some time in for documentation stuff... Someone want to help with
a list of some of the things that should be showcased?
	I've not used alot of the new-to-2.1 stuff... I'm thinking:

		MenuStyles
		SnapAttraction
		FvwmPager
		Direction-Focus stuff
		Animation
		PipeRead

	Any additions?

> (I'm being brave here:) What about a new logo for the new release?

	I have a friend who does graphic design who made one on a whim
while she was bored one day... (after hearing me talk about the feline
thing) It's sorta goofy, but it has possibilities... if people are serious
about a new logo, and if anyone wants to see it, I can probably get it
from her...

If that is something we want to do, I could probably convince her to do
one or two logos up for us to look at if I asked real nice.  =)

I'm a fellow Exceed sufferer so I know what it feels like.

> fvwm (2.0.46), at least when I click on the titlebar of the said window,
> the window used to come on the foreground. With new one, unless I drag

The window raising/lowering part of fvwm was changed recently. This was
to fix bugs and it is an improvement. One thing that happens now is that
fvwm won't raise a window that it thinks is already at the top, it used
to just do a raise which could raise the window above it's own menus.

The problem you have is that fvwm thinks it is talking to an XServer
that is the only thing on the screen, it has no way of knowing about NT
apps.  The problem really lies in Exceed but it's a hard one to
express.  I found the best way to run Exceed is to configure it to
single window mode (config/screen definition). You then get a window
that is the XServer root window. You can still have NT apps running at
the same time but when you switch to Exceed it pops the server to the
top.

The real problem lies in Exceed, I can't get it to not change focus when
I move the pointer into and Exceed client window. If it worked like
other NT apps (only change focus on a click) then Exceed could raise the
window at the same time as changing focus.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think the problem here is not the background colour being black but
the shadow/relief colours being the same as the background.  The colour
picking part of the library could be changed to pick white if it can't
allocate the colour it calculates from the background. (or pick black if
the background is white)

Everythings seems okay but go back to the window you started from and Ctrl-C
Congradulations you just hung your X server. If you want to get out click on any 
button in the WinList. Which suggests it is waitng for some event a stack trace of 
fvwm shows it in an XSync call in the focus code.  A trace of FvwmWinList shows it in
poll --> select --> MainLoop

If I use NoAnchor the problem disappears but I don't see anyhting wrong with the code
that refrences this.  The behavior is better but not perfect in 2.1.8. There the server 
doesn't block the window list just doesn't update until some window puts out an exit 
or enter event.

I don't see any obvious changes looking at the logs and diffs between the versions so,
maybe someone who was working the signa; stuff can take a look.

What version did you test with?

There are known FvwmWinList issues with 2.1.10, but they should be
resolved in 2.1.11 or the latest CVS stuff.

Yup, there was nothing new int 2.1.9 and 2.1.10 so nobody created
the headers in the NEWS file.

Can we do anything about it (without breaking the code again,
of course)? People who have to use Exceed to get fvwm2 are unlucky
enough even without us telling them they should get a real OS
if they want to run fvwm2 smoothly.

Right.

The thing to remember is that the NEWS file contains only _user-visible_
changes.  It doesn't contain info about every bug fix, etc.  I guess the
line can sometimes be fuzzy (is a bug fix user-visible?).

The ChangeLog file contains the full details about all changes to the
source.

        Just to say that I'm  very very pleased to read that, Dominik.
I have some poor co-workers fighting against both the m$ thing and the
people who decide to use it without  knowledge  and programs like fvwm
may help.  Thanks to you all for the results and the goodwilling.
        Fab.

went to the Reply-To address, fvwm-workers@fvwm.org, but it doesn't
seem to be getting through.)

	We'd need to add something like an Avoid/NoAvoid/NonManagedWindows
option to revert to the old Raise handling, if this is the change that's
causing the problem. That could easily be added with a quick 'n dirty
GlobalOpts. Doing this shouldn't break anything else, except that you'd
have to put up with the old Motif-windows-raised-above-transients
quirk, and Pager ballons would sometimes get covered by a raised
Pager. These caveats should be documented if we add such an option.

	The question is, do we contemplate trying to do something for
2.2, making the first 2.2 "Unofficial Patch", or doing something
official soon after 2.2?...or none of the above?

	I have to wonder, though, in light of Tim's comments, if this
is just one of many problems with Exceed.


- Bob

Subject: FvwmButtons doesn't die

Full_Name: Anthony Lynch
Version: 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.6
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (143.182.246.21)


After logging off the console the FvwmButtons process continues to run
and consume processor time, at a high rate.  We have been running fvwm2,
version 2.0.45 on all our Sun workstations, without any issues.  The
problem happens frequently on all versions greater Solaris 2.5.1, Nov97.
Meaning we have alot of Solaris 2.5.1, May96, that it isn't obvious on,
and many Solaris 2.6 versions which see the problem.  We recompiled fvwm2,
version 2.0.46, to run on the Solaris 2.6 systems in hopes to resolve the
issue.

Any light you can shed on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

	Hello all.
	Ok, here are the 3 little pixmaps I drew the other night. They are just 
quick job but I can modify them according to your suggestions.

I can't reproduce this.  FvwmWinList does grab the server though. Could
you commanet out the grab/ungrab lines and see if the problem goes away.
They are at lines 756 and 769 of FvwmWinList.c>  Here's the section:

      MyXGrabServer(dpy);
      frame = find_frame_window(win, &off_x, &off_y);
      XGetWindowAttributes(dpy, frame, &frame_attr);
      XGetWindowAttributes(dpy, win, &win_attr);
      win_x = frame_attr.x + frame_attr.border_width + off_x;
      win_y = frame_attr.y + frame_attr.border_width + off_y;

      if (win_grav == SouthEastGravity || win_grav == NorthEastGravity)
        win_x += win_attr.width - new_width;
      if (win_grav == SouthEastGravity || win_grav == SouthWestGravity)
        win_y += win_attr.height - new_height;

      XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, win_x, win_y, new_width, new_height);
      MyXUngrabServer(dpy);

The reason for the grab is so that FvwmWinList can grow/shrink without
wandering even during a recapture or move.

Cheers,
Tim.

Definitely post 2.2.  We don't know that this would fix the problem and
it would nee testing.  We could add a note that Exceed in multiple
window mode has problems. The workaround is to either run Exceed in
single window mode or to iconify all NT apps.

I gave up trying to use multiple window mode.  It's reliable in single
window mode with all other NT apps iconified (i.e. Exceed is the only NT
window open) when other NT apps are open you get excessive refresh
events and NetscapeNT has colormap spasms (I have seen it or Exceed go
into blinding full screen flash mode (reboot is the only way out)). I'm
OK with this set up but then the only NT app I have to use is to fill in
my timesheet every month (why this isn't a web form I don't know,
actually I do, someone has been sucked in by the "Microsoft is the best
tool for everything" myth). Hopefully NT5 or whatever will have
NT->Xserver capability and then I can put Linux on the PC in front of me
(I can dream can't I?).

Perhaps we could create some patches that modify fvwm to run
better on Exceed (based on the latest release). Of course this
would only be a temporary solution.

Bob, could you make a patch for 2.1.whatever to change this
back that anyone could use for now?

Then, why not dream about Linux winning over m$ within a year :)

I need some education.

I've used Exceed in single and multiple window mode.  In single window
mode, I use fvwm2 as the window manager.  In  multiple window mode, it
appears to me that NT is acting as the window manager.

How do you  get fvwm2 involved  when  using Exceed in multiple  window
mode?

In the Config/ScreenDefn dialog box. When you click on
MultipleWindowMode a WindowManager dropdown appears and you can select
one of:

*) Native: which uses NT to manage the windows (they look like NT
Windows)
*) X: which removes the NT borders and lets a real window manager
control the X-clients
*) Default to native: which behaves as the first until a window manager
tries to run when it switches to the second.

The "Default to native" setting is very nice because it lets you start
(and stop) fvwm without losing the ability to move/iconify/focus
windows.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hmm...Will we give away a free copy of fvwm2?

> http://www.oneway.com/jay/fvwm-thing.gif

I like the image.  I propose to give it a transparent background, save
it as an Xpm, and add it to the distribution as fvwmcat_big.xpm.  (The
"_big"  seems to be  our   current convention for FvwmBanner  images.)
Comments?


Fabien's 3 images  gave me some  extraction problems  (I using XEmacs,
MH-E, and TM).  By editing the mail a little I was  able to extract 3
images:

  -rw-r--r--   1 dane  18895 Feb  2 14:35 LogoFvwm1.xpm
  -rw-r--r--   1 dane  18935 Feb  2 14:53 LogoFvwm2.xpm
  -rw-r--r--   1 dane  13834 Feb  2 15:11 LogoFvwm3.xpm

LogoFvwm1.xpm is a horizontal FVWM in blue on gray, western style text.
LogoFvwm2.xpm is a vertical FVWM in wood pattern, plain text.
LogoFvwm3.xpm is a vertical FVWM in brown on tan, stenciled text.

The first 2 are quite large, owing to using 2 characters per color and
200+ colors.

I'm not sure what the first one is for, I thought this was in response
to the "side pixmap" proposal.  I like the  blue color.  (I know I can
rotate it with xv.)

They all seem like good candidates for side pixmaps, although I'd like
to cut the file size a bit.

The names I suggest are:

side.fvwm-western.xpm
side.fvwm-wood.xpm
side.fvwm-military.xpm

I'd like to see one with "fvwm2" rather than just "fvwm".

I think for people that customize fvwm2 to look like that other thing,
we should have one with a  gradient background.  I  have access to NT,
and  it uses a gradient with  black at the top, to  blue on the bottom
and non-serifed white text.

I got the cat to  go from 117K  to 59K by editing  the bytes per pixel
down to 2.  When I change the background  color to None, this leaves a
fuzzy white  border around  the image.  I  know  I can repair  it with
gimp, but I wonder if your friend has some easy way to clean this up?

Tim,
	Unfortunatelly I tried that it doesn't seem to help I through in some printf's and it doesn't actually get to that function yet.  I was hoping someone else could reproduce before I rip my hair out.  But I'll keep looking.  I actually didn't find the bug it was one of the masses who uses my instilation of fvwm2.  To reproduce I had to phisically exit out and then restart fvwm without the NoAnchor.  Oh well I keep trying

How can I read these? This looks as if the file was uuencoded, but there's
no header. It's definitely no zip archive snd I got no attachment.

Jay, the only thing i see wrong with your friends logo is that they
forgot the "2" :)  I'm going to be greedy and ask if you can post the
.xcf or .psd  or whatever file that image came from.  It's a great
design. 

If there are multiple people interested in creating a new logo, perhaps
we could hold a contest like many other programs (and wm's) have? (I
guess someone already suggested this?)

** Mmmaybe the guys at http://contest.gimp.org/ would take care of the
submissions for us?  Someone more official than I want to contact them? 

I'm sure any number of us could whip up Perl apps to do the job of
displaying entries and even taking votes, but it'd be nice to do it in
an established public forum.  Getting a front page blurb on themes.org
would be sweet.  

Remember, it's an easy way to get more people to look at or think about
FVWM2.  It's a public event we can advertise.

Later,
~p@

Ehm, a member of the fvwm workers list is official enough in my eyes.
You can be sure to have my support. You could say that you speak for
the fvwm workers list.

Your ideas are good and I'd be happy if we can enlist you to do
some of the things you suggest.

Yes, the MIME is busted in this message.  But check the
Transfer-Encoding; it's base64 encoded (that's the new standard in MIME,
replacing uuencoding; it gives a more compact encoding).

I had to cut/paste it to a file and run a base64 decoding program on it
by hand, then use unzip (not gzip).

All in all, not the most straightforward message for us UNIX types :)
But, thanks for sending them!

Thats "mimencode -u", part of metamail from ... Bellcore.

I did correctly post the images to the list.  About an hour ago.

I got mine to use with Emacs VM, from:

  ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/mail/vm/

There are many tools you can use; any MIME-capable mailer will come with
one either builtin or as a separate program.

	I talked with her a little while ago and she is willing to do
some clean up and add the '2' as patrick suggested.  It will probably be
this evening though.

Personally, I just can't see this change making it into 2.2.0 at this
late date :(.  I'm still hopeful that 2.1.11 will be a successful
release candidate.

I think if someone fixes it and posts a patch, then if necessary we can
release it in 2.2.1.

Thoughts?  Opinions?

Okay I went back and played some more and think I fixed the problem.
It seems and this is weird that the problem only occurs if you just
run fvwm2 with no args from your xinitrc, I know that is weird but I
don't make up the rules I just get confused by them

The change to ButtonArray.c can probably go in anyway as for the
XGrabServer I'm not sure why it is causing a problem.

Actually, you might want to take a look at VNC:

    http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc

This program is basically `screen' for windowing systems.  On a unix box,
you can start up a vnc X server, detach it from the current display, move
to another box, pull it up again, and start working.  The other box can be
any other computer with vnc, a network connection, and some sort of
graphical display.  Including NT!

You can also package up an NT session in the same way, and display it on an
X display.  I wouldn't want to play Quake across this thing, but for
filling out a timesheet (if that's the only app you want to use), it's more
than sufficient.

So go ahead, put Linux on your desktop, and fear not the evil forces of the
Enemy!  :)

I don't know if this fixes all the problems, but so far,
it looks like a safe patch to me:

Full_Name: Neil Bird
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.4

Submission from: (NULL) (195.166.41.35)



  Currently, there's no way to find the window ID of the window that
triggered
FvwmEvent (e.g., upon open).

  I guess this counts as an enhancement request: I guess $w ought to be set
for
Function calls. Or possibly more preferably, $w is usable in the
EventCommand spec.

I have a feeling that if someone just asked Tigert, he/she/it would be
happy to do a logo.  Tigert seems to like making FVWM pretty.

I must not be part of the *In Crowd*, cause I'm not on a user name basis
with Tigert. :)

Will someone please ask Tigert, then...

(I'd also like to submit my own logos, that's why i suggested a
contest...)

Shouldn't this depend on the foreground/background color?  What if
someone used reverse-video (white as their foreground and black as the
background--blech, but... :)?

Or would this be right anyway?

Any other suggestions before I do?  Anybody out there work for Yahoo?

	How about just getting a few together and letting the list

Beats me.

What  I did was grab  a little of  the original logic.  There was some
more color  allocation logic which I  blissfully ignored.  Perhaps not
the most intelligent thing...

Heres the original:

  if(Scr.d_depth > 2)
  {
    if(fore != NULL)
    {
      Scr.MenuColors.fore = GetColor(fore);
    }
    if(back != NULL)
    {
      Scr.MenuColors.back = GetColor(back);
    }
    Scr.MenuRelief.back  = GetShadow(Scr.MenuColors.back);
    Scr.MenuRelief.fore  = GetHilite(Scr.MenuColors.back);
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.back = Scr.MenuColors.back;
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.fore = GetColor(stipple); 
  }
  else
  {
    Scr.MenuColors.back  = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuColors.fore  = GetColor(black); 
    Scr.MenuRelief.back  = GetColor(black);
    Scr.MenuRelief.fore  = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.back = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.fore = GetColor(black);
  }

Its the last 6 lines that got lost.

It looks like I missed the stipple, (grayed out items).
I would guess that the menu colors themselves are OK as is,
probably as a side effect, since they weren't mentioned.

I was trying to create as small a patch as possible.

A contest gives us a little publicity.  I said before, it looks like
everyone's excited about E and Windowmaker right now.

The number of dead links to fvwm pages is alarming to me, at least.

I forwarded these last mails about tigert to him.. His response when I
said "You have to draw a new logo" was: "EEEK" ...

Let's see if Tuomas paints something pretty... (I know he's very busy,
but he has been an fvwm2-fanatic for quite a while, now switched to
wmaker tho..)

He usually hangs around on #gimp on gimpnet (as I do too)

I made a first pass through replacing uh.edu stuff with fvwm.org stuff.
I also reworked the information about the mailing lists, recommending
the -request@fvwm.org addresses instead of majordomo itself.

Please take a look.

Note that I can't seem to access either the bug database or the mailing
list archives via the new www.fvwm.org domain, so I left those links as
they were.  I also couldn't get to cvsweb via www.fvwm.org (although I
don't think it's referenced anywhere--we should probably put a reference
to it in cvs.html or someplace).

I also found some files which appear to be useless: are they still used
for something or should we remove them?

  ftp.html      -- superceded by mailinglist.html?
  version.html  -- not referenced anywhere?
  fvwm-2.xx.lsm -- did we decide this wasn't needed?

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I downloaded fvwm-2.1.11 and I thought I would download and install rplay and
readline and play around with these features.

The only problem I have is that when I run configure, it can not find the header
files rplay.h or readline/readline.h.

I've ran configure with "--with-rplay-include=/opt/x11r6/include" and
"--with-readline-include=/opt/x11r6/include".  This does not help.

Here is what is in the config.log:

configure:4675: checking for rplay.h
configure:4685: gcc -E   conftest.c >/dev/null 2>conftest.out
configure:4681: rplay.h: No such file or directory
configure: failed program was:
#line 4680 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <rplay.h>
configure:4778: checking for readline in -lreadline

#line 4847 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <readline/readline.h>
configure:4945: checking for readline in -lreadline
configure:4964: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c -lreadline -lreadline -lncur
ses  1>&5
ld: fatal: library -lncurses: not found
ld: fatal: File processing errors.  No output written to conftest
configure: failed program was:
#line 4953 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char readline();

int main() {
readline()
; return 0; }


If I edit the configure script and change line 4681 from "#include <$ac_hdr>" to
"#include "/opt/x11r6/include/$ac_hdr"" I can get configure to locate the rplay
header but I can not do the same for readline.

There must be an easy way to get this working, or maybe I'm missing something. 
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

You must use --with-readline-includes=....
                                    ^
(note plural)  See the INSTALL.fvwm file or "configure --help".

Does the file /opt/x11r6/include/readline/readline.h exist on your
                                 ^^^^^^^^
system?  Ditto for /opt/x11r6/include/rplay.h?

  rhf> configure:4842: checking for readline/readline.h
  rhf> configure:4852: gcc -E   conftest.c >/dev/null 2>conftest.out
  rhf> configure:4848: readline/readline.h: No such file or directory

See, this is wrong: there's no -I on the compile line so of course the
compiler can't find the header file.  This is probably due to the
misspelled option, above.

If you still can't get it to work, please resubmit a bug report with:

  * The kind of OS and hardware you're using.

  * The _exact_ command line you used to invoke configure (cut and
    paste, please).

  * The output configure generated to the screen when looking for
    readline and rplay.

  * The sections of config.log (as you provided here) related to
    readline and rplay.

  * Look on your system for where readline and rplay were installed and
    provide full paths to the readline.h, rplay.h, libreadline.a, and
    librplay.a files.

Thx!

Try using --with-foo-includes and see if that helps.
                           ^^^
Note the 's'.

Also, readline.h expects to be in a subdirectory named 'readline'.  In
your case, the header should be at

	/opt/x11r6/include/readline/readline.h

The mailing list archives haven't moved yet; they're still served from
another machine.  The bug database works just fine from here at
http://www.fvwm.org/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug.

The CVS tree is still sitting on the old Sun machine because folks
complained that the new machine was slower.  CVSweb has to live with CVS;
either that or I mirror the raw tree somehow.

It's the little things in life that can really bring you down.  I knew to type
that silly little "s" in "--with-foo-include" but didn't.  That not only wasted
a few hours of my time, but also your valued time.  I am ashamed.

Thank you for your courteous responses, this was just a silly mind block.

	Yes, this one goes. Also, fvwm.lsm should be removed, and
fvwm-2.2 should be renamed to fvwm.lsm.

	Since you have their new url, I assume you've visited their
site recently and grabbed the latest release of the Win version,
which finally has Button2 emulation; but if not, do it right away.
I just discovered it today.

	Heh-heh!  May the source be with you.

	I second the recommendation. I've found VNC to be highly
reliable, and extremely flexible in a largely MS dominated environment.
I can run the thin client (or viewer, as they call it) on any old
desktop in the office: there's no setup required. I just use the
Exploder to locate the executable on a network drive, and double click
on the executable.

	If I have to reboot WinDog (and who doesn't) - no problem. All
my Unix apps will still be happily running, waiting for my return.

This is probably an automake feature but I thought that GNU long options
let you use abbreviations as long as they were unambiguous.  Is
--with-foo-inc a subset of --with-foo-includes?  If it is then shouldn't
configure be happy? If it isn't then configure should complain.  This
sort of problem is going to plague us especially as --with-foo-library
isn't --with-foo-libraries.

Cheers,

Jason, I can't see any mail that has been sent to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org. I tried myself but the mails
don't get through. Are the new mail addresses working
correctly?

It might help. I don't normally run Exceed in multiple window mode so
I'm not sure I'm reproducing the problem. After the patch I was still
able to get Xwindows stuck under NT windows, even though the
XRaiseWindow was being executed.  I think there are Exceed bugs
happening here and that the old method wouldn't have always worked
anyway.  It's probably best to get the original victim to test this
out.  I have certainly been able to show Exceed not raising Xwindows
above NT windows when given an XRaiseWindow (in this case there is
nothing we can do). Sometimes it works and with this patch it probably
works more often.

Another thing, this patch gives me problems with RaiseLower. I think it
might be something to do with Scr.LastRaised not getting set with
NoAvoidUn...

Cheers,
Tim.

OK, 2.1.11 has been up for a while now.  We've seen some issues but
(IMO) none that should derail the 2.2.0 release.  The problems we wanted
to fix in 2.1.10 appear to be resolved (right?)

What's the plan?

	I don't know whether you've been following the
discussion of this problem on the fvwm-workers mailing
list. I noticed that you weren't being cc'ed on the
messages, so I thought I'd send you a reply just in case.

	The consensus of the developers is that the new
handling of window raising corrects several long-standing
bugs, and that it's too close to the release (the code
has been frozen except for the most critical bug fixes)
to be adding changes to accommodate the quirks of a
hostile operating environment.

	After the 2.2 release is out, we will be looking
into the question of what options we can add to help out
Exceed users.

	In the meantime, I have placed a patch on my
Unofficial Patches page at

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html

The NoAvoidUnmanagedWindows patch should apply cleanly to
either the 2.2.11 beta or the 2.2.0 final release (unless
otherwise noted - we don't anticipate any changes that would
conflict with it).

	If you apply the patch, and add the line

GlobalOpts NoAvoidUnmanagedWindows

to your .fvwm2rc, FVWM should revert to the old RaiseWindow
handling. Note that this reinstates some old bugs, but
there is no alternative. It is really the only way we can
accommodate an operating environment that is basically
inimical to good window management.

	Please review the mailing list archives at

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9902

for the last few days' discussion of this problem, its causes,
and why we're proceeding as we are.

OK. I got the CVS version yesterday, looks like the fix was
already in there. Anyway, it did not work. Change was only in UpdateMenuStyle
function, shouldn't it also be in NewMenStyle or other related routines.
I can see this "depth > 2" in few other places too.

Whenever I start an app. such as xterm or netscape with the -iconic flag
and there
is not enough free root window space to automatically place the window,
fvwm
attempts to interactively place it.  When I click to place, the icon shows
up in the
icon box as it should.  I'd expect -iconic apps. to start iconified,
without 
bothering the user for placement under any placement method.  In fact,
that's what 
fvwm did until the previous alpha (2.1.6?) when the current behavior
started.  

Key .fvwm2rc lines:

Style "*" IconBox -140 225 -1 -260, IconFill top right
Style "*"           MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style "*"           DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"           ActivePlacement

Due to the word wrapping of my editor, I ended up with the
following line in my .fvwm2rc:

  key h   A       MC      Direction West      (!Iconic CurrentPage

I restarted fvwm2 and got a proper complaint:

  [FVWM][CreateConditionMask]: <<ERROR>> Conditionals require closing
parenthesis

but when I tried meta-control-h anyway (I hadn't read the
mesage yet), fvwm2 core dumped on me.

They seem to be working for me; sendmail will remap the address on this
message, but I'm sending it to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

I suspect that there are still some stale DNS caches out there.  If you
want to look up the MX records for fvwm.org, it might be helpful.

I see the primary MX as karazm.math.uh.edu.

This patch has _NOT_ been committed.  I'm looking at the latest source
and it's not there.

Are you sure you're looking at and building with the right code base?
The file size of the latest builtings.c is 119766 bytes, FYI.  How did
you do your checkout from CVS?

Hmm.  So, can you paste the portion of the code that shows the patch
already in there?

My version of builtins.c around line 1691 still looks like this (the
"before" part of the patch):

*** builtins.c.orig	Thu Feb  4 13:43:30 1999
--- builtins.c	Thu Feb  4 13:47:12 1999

      ms->look.MenuStippleColors.fore = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
!   ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetShadow(ms->look.MenuColors.back);

    ms->look.MenuStippleColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
  
    /* make GC's */

Not like this (the "after" part of the patch):

      ms->look.MenuActiveColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
    if (!ms->look.f.hasStippleFore)
      ms->look.MenuStippleColors.fore = ms->look.MenuColors.back;

!     ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetShadow(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
!     ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetHilite(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
!   } else {                              /* black and white */
!     ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetColor("black");
!     ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetColor("white");
!   }
    ms->look.MenuStippleColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;

I have several programs that I have the Style NoIconTitle defined.  The problem
I am seeing is that these icons never get the focus.  If I move the cursor over
the icon, it does not rise to the top and on the flip side these type of icons
will not drop behind a focused window.

I thought that this was the same bug that I reported in 2.1.10, and would be
fixed with Bob Woodside's patch, but no such luck.

I looked through the mail archive and documentation to see if icons with no
titles where treated differently then one's with a title, but I found nothing.

If someone can shed any light on this, I would be grateful.

Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Sorry, I haven't followed the discussion
about FvwmWinList problems on this list,
but I am experiencing the following problems
with FvwmWinList and fvwm2.1.11: 
FvwmWinList clicking on an item to transfer focus
  does transfer the focus, but doesn't depress the
  item. To be more precise, the button depressing is
  lagging behind the focus change; if the button of
  win1 is depressed, I can press the button of win2
  to transfer the focus to win2 (while the first button
  is still depressed). Pressing the button of win3
  moves the focus to win3, but depresses the button 
  of win2.

  Also, if I have multiple nxterm windows, then moving
  the focus from one to the other (by moving the mouse
  over them) will sometimes not change the depressed
  items. The button of the second nxterm flashes, but
  the depressed state "jumps back" to the first nxterm.
   
This is with a fairly standard RedHat 5.1 setup.

	I suspect not. I tried it a couple or so days ago, and couldn't

	I sent him a reply earlier today from Jitterbug. We'll
see whether we get any response. I did have a little trouble
sending it - the first 3 tries failed. On the fourth, Jitterbug
reported success, but that's the time I forgot to copy the
workers list.

	RaiseLower is working fine for me - under a regular X server
on a Unix system. I wonder if this is another Exceed malfunction. The
spot where Scr.LastWindowRaised gets set is before we enter the changed
code.

	I think it's fairly apparent now, though, that there are severe
limitations to what we can do to improve the lot of Exceed victims.
Actually, that should probably be "Windows victims": I think that
trying to mix Windows-managed and Fvwm-managed windows on a Windows
desktop is probably a doomed venture from the start.

	If the original victim - or anyone else, for that matter -
reports that this patch solved his problem and he's ecstatically
happy to have things working as they did before, then I'd argue that
we should consider doing something formally with the patch. Otherwise,
we should let it fade into obscurity.

	I have no trouble getting them to drop behind a focused window.
Could you elaborate a little on just what sequence of actions should
cause one of these icons to drop behind a focused window, but doesn't?
I'm strictly a ClickyFocus kinda guy, except when I'm testing, so I'm
not used to all the niceties of MouseyFocus and auto-raising.

	I don't believe this failure to raise is related to the other
non-raising problem.

	I recall some discussion a good while back about tweaking some
code in SetFocus and rearranging the window list, and I'm wondering if
something went astray there. Does anybody recall what that was all
about?

	(Second try on this one - it didn't make it through
	to fvwm.org. It may be a few days yet before everything
	propagates.)

	I just deleted the 2 oddball .lsm files, and brought fvwm.lsm
more or less up to date. Dominik, would you take a look at it and see
how we want to style the copyright line?

	Do we want to upload 2.2.0 to Sunsite as soon as we've cut the
release? And if so, would you like me to take care of that one?

	I haven't had a chance to look into the current state of the
LSM - is it alive, who's currently maintaining it, do you still send
them lsm's, etc. Maybe I'll have some time to drop in on COLA this
weekend and see what's going on. Of course, if anyone has up to date
info, please don't keep quiet about it.

Now, after applying the changes, I do see the arrows in the menu.
But, before I used to see shaded arrows, now I see a perfect
triangle without "button-like" shade, I am happy though.

you guys have been very helpful.

I applied the change as follows:-

  /* calculate colors based on background */
  if (!ms->look.f.hasActiveBack)
    ms->look.MenuActiveColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
  if (!ms->look.f.hasStippleFore)
    ms->look.MenuStippleColors.fore = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
#if 0
  ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetShadow(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
  ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetHilite(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
#endif /* SAM: */
  ms->look.MenuStippleColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
 
  /* make GC's */

The reason they don't look right is because you did not apply the patch
we provided.  You merely commented out some code; that is _not_ what the
patch we sent did.  It _replaced_ that code with an if-statement.

Please try to actually make the changes provided, and see if they fix
your problem.

You might look and see if you have the "patch" program on your system.
If you do, then you should feed the email into it (while in the
fvwm/fvwm subdirectory) and it will do everything for you.

Since none of us has a system like this, it's up to you to verify the
fix for us, or we can't confirm the change works and it has much less
likelihood of making it into the codebase.

No, that's not what you want.

You should _replace_ the two lines you commented out with these:

    if(Scr.d_depth > 2) {                 /* if not black and white */
      ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetShadow(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
      ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetHilite(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
    } else {                              /* black and white */
      ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetColor("black");
      ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetColor("white");
    }

Please try that and let us know if it looks the same as before.

I don't have this problem on my machine with your setup

This is the only hint we have. How is your fvwm2 started? This
looks as if the modifiers were changed after fvwm2 has been
started. Can you look at what happens when X is started for the
first time? Is there an xmodmap somewhere? In xinitrc/.xinitrc?

This worked in 2.1.5, but stopped in 2.1.6 and above.  It may
be a bug.

Here's one more problem I've run into.  The Gnome Mahjongg game
(distributed in gnome-games versions 0.99.3 and below - I haven't
checked 0.99.4 or higher) has a problem with every FVWM2 version
I've tried.  When the game comes up, its "body" is mapped "directly"
to the upper left of the screen.  A frame window appears on the
screen, and can be moved, but the game itself stays put in the upper
left.  The game also appears on all of the screen pages.

This application seems to be Ok in several other popular WMs.

If I kill FVWM2, and restart it while the game is running, it
will "capture" the game window and work correctly.  It's only
when the game starts after FVWM2 that the problem occurs.

Lastly, when the game runs, FVWM2 2.1.5 gives me the following
errors:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 1, Error 2, EventType: 20
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 2, EventType: 20

Thanks,
Lee

I just committed the fix (in mahjongg) into gnome-cvs...

I don't know why, but some apps needs to get the main window realized
manually.. Otherwise funky stuff happens... Not sure if it's only fvwm
or any other WM has the same problem..

Any Gtk-expert know?

I've looked into this. The problem is that GnomeApp/Dock does
some improper things which result in the application window
being temporarily created and mapped with an incorrect
minimum or maximum width/height. In some cases, this width/height
could be 0x0, which confuses the heck out of fvwm.

In detail, the problem is that gnome-app is changing its
requisition in its realization handler, which is just
a bad thing to do. (GTK+ runs the size_request before
the window is realized, so this change doesn't take
effect until the next idle queue run, and in between
things are in an odd state.)

Probably the right thing to do is to move the 
gnome_dock_add_from_layout() call and associated stuff from
gnome_app_realize() into gnome_app_size_request().

(GTK+ should probably refuse to set a maxium width
 height of zero, which would tame the problem to simply
 being a flash at the wrong size, but I think fixing
 gnome would be appropriate)

                                        Owen

Hi, I don't really know why I thought of it (was there a feature
request recently?) but I thought it might be nice to be able to have
more than one menu item per hotkey in a menu. For long menus, or
automagically generated ones, it'd might be nice to be able to hotkey
to items w/o worrying about duplicates.

Anyway, I wrote a little patch which maybe we might like to put in
2.3? Here's the Changelog entry:

1999-02-07 Michael Han <mikehan@best.com>

        * fvwm/menus.c (menuShortcuts): Changed the hotkey handler from a flat
        once-over the menu to a "smarter" search that locates the next match
        and distinguishes between unique and non-unique hotkeys, doing a
        MENU_NEWITEM selection for non-uniques and retaining existing behavior
        for unique hotkeys.
        (AddToMenu): Commented out checks to prevent binding of duplicate
        hotkeys for what I think are obvious reasons.
        (FHotKeyUsedBefore): Noted that this function is now unused.

And attached is a patch. Context format diff against CVS from maybe
2/4/99. Thoughts anyone?

I think we should just hint at the COPYING file there. There is only
one thing all the files have in common: you can freely distribute
them if you do not touch anything. Should we put this statement in there
and say that you have to check the COPYING file for further permissions?

As I am completely illiterate regarding infrastructure on the

I don't have this problem on my machine with your setup
(Linux with XFree) :(

This is the only hint we have. How is your fvwm2 started? This
looks as if the modifiers were changed after fvwm2 has been
started. Can you look at what happens when X is started for the
first time? Is there an xmodmap somewhere? In xinitrc/.xinitrc?

(Due to my problems with the fvwm.org mail addresses this mail
is a bit outdated.)

----- Forwarded message ----------------------------------------

I've taken the liberty to compile the different threads into one mail.

I think Patrick is right. A while ago I had this quote from the
X speedup FAQ where fvwm was said to be 'bloated as any other WM'
(was in the manpage once). A bit more self esteem wouldn't be bad.
I'm happy that Jay has volunteered to do some of the work. But I
don't think one person can do all the work alone. Certainly, one
of the main weaknesses of fvwm is that it can't be configured to
your likings in one day.

I propose we start a fvwm usability and PR project in which we
concentrate our efforts to make fvwm and the documentation more
user friendly and telling the world about it. If this project
has even its own mailing list (at least for the start) it might
be more attractive for people to participate. Surely there are
some people who could help even if they would not want to write
code. And for the developers it might be easier to decide on what
things we spend our time.

So, who would be interested to have such a project/mailing list?
Who would like to participate (even if it's only one hour per week)?

Hi,

Following is the code after the patch is applied.
I do see the arrows, but I still don't see the shade
in the arrows in the menu.

  /* calculate colors based on foreground */
  if (!ms->look.f.hasActiveFore)
    ms->look.MenuActiveColors.fore=ms->look.MenuColors.fore;
 
  /* calculate colors based on background */
  if (!ms->look.f.hasActiveBack)
    ms->look.MenuActiveColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
  if (!ms->look.f.hasStippleFore)
    ms->look.MenuStippleColors.fore = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
  if(Scr.d_depth > 2) {                 /* if not black and white */
    ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetShadow(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
    ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetHilite(ms->look.MenuColors.back);
  } else {                              /* black and white */
    ms->look.MenuRelief.back = GetColor("black");
    ms->look.MenuRelief.fore = GetColor("white");
  }
  ms->look.MenuStippleColors.back = ms->look.MenuColors.back;
 
  /* make GC's */
  gcm = GCFunction|GCPlaneMask|GCFont|GCGraphicsExposures|
    GCLineWidth|GCForeground|GCBackground;
  gcv.fill_style = FillSolid;
  gcv.font = ms->look.pStdFont->font->fid;
  gcv.plane_mask = AllPlanes;
  gcv.function = GXcopy;
  gcv.graphics_exposures = False;
  gcv.line_width = 0;

I can't sign up for major amounts of work, but right now, I am gearing
up to pester Yahoo! until they make changes to our part of the tree.

** I NEED YOUR HELP **

Please, if anyone knows anyone who submitted an fvwm link to yahoo,
please let me know or get them in touch with me.  We need the original
contact info from these people as a "security" check inorder to make
changes.

I REALLY want to modify the original listing for the fvwm directory. 
The word "Feeble" has to go.  

Did Rob Nation submit this entry, perhaps?  Anyone got Rob's email
address?

Thanks,
~p@

Lines 228-230 are (current CVS):

  if (Action[0] == 0 || Action[1] == 0){/* impossibly short command */
    return;                             /* done */
  }

Could you change this to

  fprintf(stderr, "Action = 0x%08x\n", Action);
  if (Action[0] == 0 || Action[1] == 0){/* impossibly short command */
    return;                             /* done */
  }

And see if Action is a NULL pointer?

This looks like it it might be related to my problem as well, It seems
like the current cvs for FvwmWinList is always waiting for focus change
events to update itself.  Did anyone put a change like this in?

It seems to be even worse:

  [FVWM][CreateConditionMask]: <<ERROR>> Conditionals require closing
  parenthesis
  Action = 0x00000009
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I don't know who submitted them. Couldn't anybody at yahoo tell you?
Perhaps you could ask one of our ex-maintainers:

  Charles Hines <chuck_hines@VNET.IBM.COM>
  Brady Montz <bradym@cs.arizona.edu>

Chuck was the fvwm maintainer for a long time. The vnet mail address
may not be valid anymore since IBM replaced their prehistoric mail
system with lotus notes last year. Even if the address still works
he may not read mail sent there. I've a friend at IBM who would be
willing to help to find him if all else fails.

If i succeed in just getting Yahoo to delete our directory so we can
start over (since most of the links under it are dead), who's name
should I put as the main contact?

I don't want to tie myself down for eternity, ya know?

I'd say Jason Tibbitts would be a good choice. What do you say, Jason?

OK, two different scenarios.  The first, I have my contool iconified in the
upper left corner with NoIconTitle defined for this app.  I raise it to the top
with the "Raise" builtin (I have to use Raise since the icon will not get the
focus).  I now focus in on an app that is partially behind this icon but this
app will not raise on top of contool's icon.

Scenario two:  I have Communicator's Messenger window defined to have
NoIconTitle.  When a new message is received it pops the icon to the top of the
desktop.  If I focus on an app behind this icon, it will not raise on top of
this icon.

The only way to get these icons to drop behind is to use the Lower builtin.

That's fine by me.

Note that I'm sick and will be around for only limited amounts of time for
the next couple of days.

Please try this with 2.1.6 but replace fvwm/bindngs.c with the
file from 2.1.5. Does this work?

Here is another thing to (maybe) add after 2.2: Session Management.

I have started putting together a prototype implementation by 
adapting file session.c from Enlightenment. There are still some issues,
eg offscreen windows are not properly placed, no global configuration
is saved; but apart from that it seems to work. It is a bit hard for me 
to do proper testing, since the only SMP-aware client on my home machine
seems to be xclock.

	OK, our observations are in sync. I thought you couldn't even
manipulate them with the Raise and Lower functions.

	This is at least partly related to the new RaiseWindow code. The
fix to take icon windows into account didn't go quite far enough. In
the case of the NoIconTitle windows, there is no xxx->icon_w icon
window, only the xxx->icon_pixmap_w window, which the new code doesn't
recognize. This is the source of the icon-window-won't-raise and then
I-can't-raise-other-windows-above-the-icon problem. I'm testing the
fix for that.

	The non-focus issue still puzzles me. I have trouble seeing how
auto-raise could ever have worked for NoIconTitle windows. The SetFocus
code that tries to set the focus to the icon window looks unchanged
since 2.0.46, and it bypasses the focus if there is no xxx->icon_w,
just as the code is doing today.

	I'll defer to the group consensus if anyone objects, but I think
this definitely needs to be fixed for 2.2.0. As to whether it will
warant another beta, I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other.

Hm...it had better still be vaild, since I'm still receiving mail through
it... :)  But I have been worried that they'll cut me off at some point and
force my external mail to go through the <shudder> Lotus Notes servers.

Well, I should see mail through that address too (hinesc@us.ibm.com) as
both sources end up being forwarded to my workstation (where I read it
using VM under XEmacs, not any Lotus Notes client).  But for now the vnet
address still works.

Anyways, did y'all need me for something?  I still do monitor the mailing
list, sort of - I generally just skim over each note very rapidly (or skip
it entirely depending on the subject/thread).  My name being near the top
of this particular one happened to catch my eye as I passed over it
(although apparently the original didn't)...

Ok, I went back and looked at the previous notes on this - I never
submitted anything to Yahoo or anything like that.  No idea who did, but I
don't think Rob Nation did either.  Yahoo must have some sort of control
person that you can send a note to that might listen to reason though ("hey
look, that old link is dead!").

I'm also seeing some odd behavior in WinList with the latest version of fvwm.
FvwmWinList, in 2.1.5 for example, would highlight the current focused window
(by highlight I mean either a depressed look or a button color change
depending on one's setup).  What's happening now is that the highlight of the
button happens _after_ focus is removed from a window.


Here are relevant parts of my .fvwmrc file

########################## FvwmWinList #####################################
*FvwmWinListBack Gray59
*FvwmWinListFore Yellow
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise, Focus
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify 1
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 WindowList
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0

The behavior, as noted above, is different from 2.1.5

Please cc me.

Yes, with the 2.1.5 bindings.c, it works.

	I tried it under 2.0.46. It didn't work there either, as
I surmised from the code.

	I've attached the corrective patch that I'm nominating for
inclusion in 2.2.0. The patch also makes auto-raise work for
NoIconTitle icons.

	The polls are officially open.

Huh? Now I'm really confused. Perhaps you could help me here
(since none of the maintainers sees this problem). What I ask
you to do is in no way trivial and required some experience
in C programming and debugging:

What I need is to know where the differences between the two
bindings.c versions are (not the diffs of course). The function
ParseBindEntry has changed. It seems that the 2.1.6 file does
not bind the same keys as the 2.1.5 file. I don't know why.
The set of bindings in 2.1.6 should be a super set of 2.1.5.

So, could you step into both versions with a debugger and see
what they do? This is harder than it sounds, so here are a few
hints:

- use a .fvwm2rc with only the binding line
- attaching the debugger to fvwm2 is a bit tricky (since as
  soon as it runs into a breakpoint you can't use your desktop
  anymore).

  Possible solutions:

    - run ther XNest X server with another display number and
      run fvwm2 on this display from your original display
    - start a second X server on a different display

I am interested in ther information that is stored in the
bindings (about last thirty lines of ParseBindEntry).

----

Parallel to this, could anybody look at bindings.c and tell
me what I'm doing wrong? I've looked over it again and again
and can't see the bug.

The change went in for 2.1.9.  The event loop was rewritten and it needs
an XPending() before the select call.  There was a discussion (see
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9901/msg00972.html and follow-ups) I
don't think the patch Chris posted ever got committed.

!?!?

I thought the main point of the 2.1.11 respin was to include the winlist
fixes; we had a 3-4 day window where important bugs were supposed to be
committed; did we drop the ball and forget one?  Did we forget more than
one (*cringe*)?  Am I out-to-lunch?

At any rate, it looks like there's no avoiding a 2.1.12, if we can
figure out these problems.  I vote that _if_ we're making a 2.1.12
anyway, Bob's icontitle fix goes in, and the fix for mono displays (at
least the change we've got now, which doesn't seem to do exactly what
the old code did but it's better than nothing).  We should probably wait
and see if we can't crush the @#$%&* keybinding issue once and for all;
if Lee and Dominik (and anyone else) can work out what's going on.

The other option is to spin 2.2.0 essentially as-is, and dedicate
ourselves to a 2.2.1 followup with these bugs fixed.

Thoughts?

Seeing the arrows is good.

I have some questions about the shading.

During the  debug process you changed from  your original menustyle, I
think it  was "fvwm" to  another menustyle   that  gives flat  looking
arrows.   Have you  changed your menustyle   back to fvwm?  That might
account for not seeing any shading...

I'm unclear as to  how a black and  white terminal can render any sort
of  shading.  Shading  on a color  terminal  comes from using  a light
color on one side of  an object and a darker  color on the other side.
Since you only have black and  white to work  with, I don't understand
what you mean by "shading".

Thanks for your help so far.

Please, I need help on this key binding problem. I can't see where the
bug lies. Could anybody else have a look at the changes in bindings.c
betweed 2.1.5 and 2.1.6?

I'm no friend of this one. If we have critical problems we should
do them right the first time.

I think there were two bugs And we only fixed the core dump, I'm a
guilty as anyone of not checking, I thought we had done both.

I'd vote for doing 2.2 now. It's never going to be bug free and the
longer we wait the more bug fixes and patches back up.  Fvwm itself is
looking pretty stable.

No, that was something different. This one was in events.c. 2.1.6
has the reported bug and it goes away when he replaces bindings.c
with the one from 2.1.5.

You can get grey by stipling. For a black button a nice effect is white
for the top shadow and a 50/50 back/white stipple for the bottom shadow.
It's also why a shadow thickness of 2 is nice. I don't know if fvwm ever
used stipling for making greys on b&w displays though.

Cheers,
Tim.

I didn't  see any  logic  in the old  code that  put stippling  in the
arrows, so I'm still confused about the report that its missing.
Of course I could have missed the logic.  If I did, I'd like to know.

I'd vote for a 2.1.12. There is one problem with 2.2.0/2.2.1: It wouldn't
help to reduce the queued up patches. When we do 2.2 we'll be in the
same situation as we are now. Nobody can work on 2.3.x until the patches
that have to go into 2.2.1 are in. Or would anybody want to work on
2.2.1 and 2.3.x in parallel (I wouldn't)?

Thoughts?

Yes, this was my first thought, too.  I decided there must be some kind
of stippling going on.

I wonder if it has anything to do with the other code you posted about
missing:

  if(Scr.d_depth > 2)
  {
    ...
  }
  else
  {
    Scr.MenuColors.back  = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuColors.fore  = GetColor(black); 
    Scr.MenuRelief.back  = GetColor(black);
    Scr.MenuRelief.fore  = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.back = GetColor(white);
    Scr.MenuStippleColors.fore = GetColor(black);
  }

Offhand it doesn't look like it, but you never know...

     I thought I'd break the discussion of LSM, etc. out into a separate
thread.

     I checked linux.org, and it looks as though the LSM is still alive and
well, currently maintained by Aaron Schrab <aarons@execpc.com>. We should
send an updated copy of the lsm when we release 2.2.0. We should probably
send him a note requesting a clean-up, since there are currently 2 entries
(one for 2.0.42 and one for 2.0.43), both about to be out of date, and I
think it will require manual intervention on his part to fix this. I'll be
happy to take care of this, unless the Pumpking would rather do it.

     This brings up the subject of oher public archive sources for FVWM. I
certainly don't know all of them, but here are a few that I know of. Do we
want to try to update them (or get the archive maintainers to do so), or
just ignore them?

     - Sunsite Linux archive  --  The latest one they have is 2.0.43.

     - x.org  --  The latest they have in X11/contrib is 2.0.42.

     - Sunsite's Solaris package archive  --  This seems fairly active:
they have 2.0.40 and 2.1.5 (!) pre-built Solaris binaries. I believe that
Mark, the archive maintainer, does all the builds himself, rather than
taking binaries from just anyone. Probably a courtesy note to him
(mark@metalab.unc.edu) would be in order on the day we release.

     I'll follow up on these, if you like. Does anyone know of any others?
Chuck, did you put up any of the common public archive copies, or did they
just appear from somewhere one day?


- Bob

The only updates I ever did were on the fvwm ftp site.  Sometimes the
source tar files would get mystereously uploaded to ftp.x.org, sunsite,
etc.  Have no idea who was doing that...

I never did any prebuilt binaries either, except for IBM internal ones.

Your  patch  fixes the problems   I was having  with XEmacs  icons not
lowering below XEmacs windows.  Looks like a good patch to me.

I thought we should ignore the icons on top problem for 2.2, but
the WindowList stuff is pretty bad.  I don't normally use the window
list, but after having it up for a while, it just doesn't seem to know
which window has focus.  If I was using it, I wouldn't be happy.

Anyone like this idea:

Fix the black and white problem, fix the window list problem,
and fix the icons on top problem, test this from CVS and if OK,
release as 2.2?  (In other words, do our final testing just
within the workers list?)

Problem: fvwm/misc.h gives an error for the use of "online".

Explanation: The MIPSpro 7.2 compiler on IRIX 6.4 supports inline
    with internal linkage only, not external.  The configure script
    tests for internal only.

Note: Current ANSI/ISO C does not support inline.
    The imminent standard C9X does support inline, with some obvious
    restrictions on what may go in an external inline function.
    ANSI/ISO C++ does not support external linkage.

Fix alternative 1:  Alter the test case in the configure script.
    
    int main() {
    } extern $ac_kw foo() {
    ; return 0; }

Fix alternative 2: Add an extra option to the config stuff so that 
    there are separate "inline" and "extern_inline" instances.

Fix alternative 3: Rewrite code that uses extern inline" to be internally
    linked.

    options (e.g. --with-xpm*) or environment (e.g. CPPFLAGS=-I...)

Fix: Get configure to look in /usr/openwin and /usr/local by itself.
    (This is genrally a good idea, not just for Solaris.)

In a menu-label, the use of a double ampersand to stand for a literal
ampersand is documented.  What has been omitted is that the other
special characters (asterisk, percent, at-sign, caret) may also be
doubled up to produce a single literal.

We definitely want these two updated.  ftp.x.org is still just about the
first place I look for X software.  The fact that they only have 2.0.42
means they're not actively updating it.

Sunsite Linux is (IMO) less important: _most_ people use RPM or DEB

That sounds good.

We should keep track of all the places and people we need to contact and
write it down in a file in the tree, so we don't forget it.

Drats, I just noticed that my fix for the Direction coredump
didn't make it to the list. This one is really serious too.
I'll repost it when I'm back home. It fixes a number of
actual and possible coredumps.

I agree: I don't use it either but from what I've seen _many_ people do,
and this is a very serious problem.

I'd agree with this.

I'm still concerned about the keybinding issue; I'd say hold out for
that except we don't seem to have any good ideas and we can't even
reliably reproduce it (although at least now someone can who's willing
to work with us on it--thanks Lee! :).

Can someone enter a bug or pick an existing bug (surely there is one?)
to be the "master bug" for these keybinding problems, and add notes
describing what we know so far?

E.g., a change to builtins.c between 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 caused the problem.
A precise description of the problem, and any odd things about it (does
restart cure it, etc.?)  Can we come up with a very, very minimal
.fvwm2rc that exhibits the problem on at least someone's (Lee's) system
and attach that?

If we don't come up with something soon, since it's not reliably
reproducible, I say don't bother with this one; we'll work on it
post-2.2.0.  Surely there will more bugs to be fixed necessitating a
2.2.1 anyway :)

One thing to soothe you conscience ;-) : The error message is
printed when you press the key combination, so you couldn't have
seen it before the coredump even if you wanted.

OK, I see where the problem is. In fact there are five problems:

1) DirectionFunc (builtins.c) may pass an invalid pointer because
   it assumes that

     flags = CreateFlagString(action, &restofline);

   always returns sensible values. It happily continues with
   whatever it gets back and even passes a NULL pointer to
   ExecuteFunction (functions.c).

2) ExecuteFunction accesses any action it gets, even NULL pointers.

3) CreateFlagString doesn't touch the 'restofline' return parameter
   if it fails. I.e. whatever value was in there before is finally
   passed to ExecuteFunction.

4) Other code relies of CreateFlagString to work.

5) Other code relies on ExecuteFunction to handle NULL pointers.

Summary:

  :-(


I don't see a way how we can release 2.2 without fixing these
problems. I will create a patch and post it on the list. On the
other hand the fixes are really trivial so I'd accept if we
Apply them, let Ives verify that the fix his problem and include
the in 2.2 without further testing.

OK, here's the patch (applies to 2.1.10 and current CVS source).

Please ckeck if it fixes the coredump and post a reply to the list.

Dominik,
I took a look at bindings.c and nothing jumps out at me. The
real difference to the file between 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 is in
ParseBindEntry. Maybe you could try explaining to us the rational for
the changes and maybe that would help us spot the problem.

I am seeing another problem with focus raising a window to the top.

Here is the scenario:

I am in a desktop with at least 10 terminal sessions and several icons.  I
changed to another desktop then go back to the one with the previous one.  I
move focus to a window on the bottom (I can see just the top third of this xterm
window), it gets the focus but does not pop on top of the other windows and
icons.  Now if I focus on other windows and icons (at least the icons that have
titles) then re-focus on my xterm window, it will now pop on top of the windows
and icons that I had just focused on but not on top of the windows and icons I
didn't.

Did I confuse anyone or just myself ;)

Something else for you to chew on Bob :)

I don't know if turning debug on would show anything useful.  If you think it
would I'll do it.

By the way I am running 2.1.11 on Solaris 2.5.1, X11R6.1.  I use SloppyFocus and
"FvwmAuto 500".

I'll take charge of that (but probably not today).

                    ^^^^^^^^^^

Nope, it was bindings.c.

I'm almost convinced that Lee is working with a Solaris/SunOS machine
(without asking him). These have always been the machines causing
trouble.

Looks like you  didn't apply this mornings stacking  order patch.  You
will need 2.1.12 (the current CVS).  Please apply this patch:

Subject:  PipeRead vs. FvwmM4
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Didn't someone ask for good examples showing how far fvwm 2.2
is superior to fvwm 2.0 ?

Here is one: PipeRead does not only obsolete FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp,
it is also more correct.

It always struck me as odd that on RedHat systems, the fvwm decorations
of clients started via Xclients don't obey the Style commands in the
config files. Today, it occcurred to me why this is: RedHat starts
fvwm2 via fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 $RCFILE'. fvwm2 doesn't wait for Fvwm4
to finish and enters StartupStuff which decorates the early clients
with the default decorations.

Another easy way to see this behaviour is to change the RedHat setup
to call fvwm2 without -cmd and create an .fvwm2rc like this:


##### start of .fvwm2rc #####
# read RedHat's default fvwm2 config. This defines eg the Window-Ops menu
FvwmM4 /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4

# Append something to the Window-Ops menu
AddToMenu Window-Ops
+ Shade/Unshade WindowShade

##### end of .fvwm2rc #####


And be surprised that "Shade/Unshade" ends up as the *first* entry
in the Window-Ops menu.

My first try to improve the behaviour was to use the Wait command to
wait for a client which is started in the config file parsed by FvwmM4.
This didn't work...for some reason, fvwm2 waited forever.

A much better way to use macros in config files is imho

PipeRead "m4 -DWIDTH=1024 \
             -DHEIGHT=768 \
             -DUSER=clasen \
             -DHOME=/home/clasen \
             /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4"

(The -D options turned out to be necessary, since FvwmM4 predefines
some m4-macros on which the AnotherLevel files depend.)

I'm convinced now that the preprocessor modules should be considered
obsolete and that PipeRead is the better alternative to be advertised.

I have access to both of these (in spades :), and with both Sun's
Openwindows version of X and TOG's "vanilla" version of X.

With a suitable description of the problem I can try to recreate it.

This used to be zero or one, it now has all kinds of interesting
values.  There are places where it is specifically tested for being
equal to 1.

I added this debug statement:

      fprintf(stderr,"IsMouse %d Button_key %d key_name %s Context %d Modifier %d Action %s\n",
              (Scr.AllBindings->IsMouse ? 0 : 1),
              Scr.AllBindings->Button_Key,
              (Scr.AllBindings->key_name
               ? Scr.AllBindings->key_name : "Noname"),
              Scr.AllBindings->Context,
              Scr.AllBindings->Modifier,
              Scr.AllBindings->Action);

There is a comment at the start of this:

  /*
  ** why wasn't XKeysymToKeycode used instead of this for loop?
  ** domivogt (18-Dec-1998): because multiple key can be bound to the same
  ** key symbol?
  */

I couldn't find any instance where one keysym was on more than 1 key.
Which key should I try?

Why?  ! is a boolean operator in C, and boolean expressions always
evaluate to 0 or 1.

This looks the same as the previous code to me.

Sorry, my brain slipped out of gear.  You are right of course.

I have a patch I will apply as soon as it is clear what will
happen with my menu position patch.

Hi folks,

I have created one more patch I want to include in 2.2 even
though it introduces a new 'feature' (in fact it only changes
the parser). I want to change the syntax to allow more flexible
placement of the menus on screen (as Neil Bird requested).
Unfortunately there's no consistent and simple way to do this
without breaking the old syntax. The reason why I want to put
this in 2.2 is that this feature wasn't in 2.0.46 and I don't
want people to get used to a syntax I'll change immediately
after 2.2.

Furthermore the patch is resonably simple so that we'd not
have to do a lot of testing.

----- excerpt from the updated manpage (not in the patch) -----

  The  position  arguments  allow  to  place the menu               
  somewhere on the screen, for  example  centered  on               
  the visible screen or above a title bar.  Basically               
  it works like this: you specify a context-rectangle               
  and  an offset to this rectangle by which the upper               
  left corner of the menu is  moved  from  the  upper               
  left  corner  of the rectangle.  The position argu-               
  ments consist of several parts:                                   
                                                                    
       [ [context-rectangle] x y ] [ special-options ]              
                                                                    
  The context-rectangle can be one of:                              
                                                                    
       Root                                                         
          the root window.                                          
       Mouse                                                        
          a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.                    
       Window                                                       
          the window with the focus.                                
       Interior                                                     
          the inside of the focused window.                         
       Title                                                        
          the title of the focused window or icon.                  
       Button<n>                                                    
          button #n of the focused window.                          
       Icon                                                         
          the focused icon.                                         
       Menu                                                         
          the current menu.                                         
       Item                                                         
          the current menu item.                                    
       Context                                                      
          the current window, menu or icon.                         
       This                                                         
          whatever widget the pointer is on  (e.g.  a               
          corner of a window or the root window).                   
       Rectangle <geometry>                                         
          the  rectangle  defined  by <geometry> in X               
          geometry format.  Width and height  default               
          to 1 if omitted.                                          
                                                                    
  If  the context-rectangle is omitted "Mouse" is the               
  default.  Note that not all  of  these  make  sense               
  under all circumstances (e.g. "Icon" if the pointer               
  is on a menu).                                                    
                                                                    
  The offset values x and y specify how far the  menu               
  is  moved  from  it's default position. By default,               
  the numeric value given is interpreted  as  a  per-               
  centage  of the context rectangle's width (height),               
  but with a trailing "m" the menu's  width  (height)               
  is   used  instead.   Furthermore  a  trailing  "p"               
  changes the interpretation to mean "pixels".                      
                                                                    
  Instead of a single value you can  use  a  list  of               
  values.  All additional numbers after the first one               
  are separated from  threir  predecessor  but  their               
  sign. Do not use any other separators.                            
                                                                    
  If x or y are prefixed with 'o<number>' where <num-               
  ber> is an integer, the menu and the rectangle will               
  be  moved  to  overlap  at  the  specified position               
  before any other offsets are applied. The menu  and               
  the  rectangle  will be placed so that the pixel at               
  <number> percent of the rectangle's width/height is               
  right  over  the  pixel  at <number> percent of the               
  menu's  width/height.   So  'o0'  means  that   the               
  top/left  borders  of  the  menu  and the rectangle               
  overlap, with 'o100' it's the bottom/right  borders               
  and  if  you  use 'o50' they are centered upon each               
  other (try it and you will see it is  much  simpler               
  than  this  description).  The default is 'o0'. The               
  prefix                                                            
                                                                    
  A prefix of 'c' is equivalent of 'o50'.  Examples:

The first line of the comment was there before I touched the code.
I saw no reason not to use XKeysymToKeycode either so I rewrote this
part to use it (this was before 2.1.5). Then the bug reports about
key bindings not working started and finally I changed it back hoping
it would fix the problems. We didn't hear about that again. Then with
2.1.6 we got this new report that pinned it down to the diffs between
2.1.5 and 2.1.6. The situation described in the comment isn't very
likely I think.

	I like this idea. First, we're not likely to release a beta
(or a production release) that won't generate some bug reports; so,
if we wait till we can do so, we'll never get a release out. Second,
the purpose of a beta is to shake out and fix what bugs we can
before cutting a production release; fixing them, where feasible,
is definitely a part of the process.

	I'd be really skeptical of releasing massive code changes
without another beta, but I think this is a manageably small set of
changes for internal testing.

	Bummer! I just noticed that that #@$&#%!! Notes system at work
isn't plugging in my name when it uses an SMTP address. I'll have to
see if I can coerce it into being a little more courteous...or stick
to sending mail from one of the Unix boxes, where I can dictate what
the From: header looks like.

	Particularly when it comes to external mail, I have to
sympathize with your distaste: Notes, as Ogden Nash once said of
parsley, is gharsley.

	I think quite a few people do as I do, and monitor what's showing
up in Incoming, particularly those who don't mind building from source.
For binaries, I think you're probably right. So, I'll add Red Hat and Debian
to the list. Austin Donnelly is a long-time list follower/contributor, and
he's the fvwm package maintainer for Debian; so I imagine they'll have an
up to date package pretty quickly.

	I have no idea who the Red Hat package maintainers are, but I'll
look into it. I will, that is, if their contrib machine's response picks
up a bit from what it was this afternoon. Dominik, did we actually make
any headway in establishing relations with those folks when you finally
got your hands on their famous bug fix patches?

	I also put Patrick Volkerding on the list. I suspect that notifying
the various Linux packagers is more of a courtesy than a necessity, though.
I think they'll notice as soon as Jason posts a notice to Freshmeat.

	I'm makin' a list, and checkin' it twice.... This sort of thing,
I think, argues for having something like the old archive directory, that
would be in the CVS tree, but not included in the build tarballs.

I'm not sure we need a whole different directory for that; any files not
listed in the appropriate variables in the respective Makefile.am won't
go into the dist tarball...

  docs/Makefile.am:

Anything you don't put in this list, won't show up...

	The patch should work if you have the 2.1.11 tarball installed. I
don't believe any actual code changes have been committed since then (yet),
though lots of proposed patches have been floating around.

In bindings.c, in the 2.1.6 code, there's the following
loop:

  for (i=min; i<=max; i++)
    if (!fKey || XKeycodeToKeysym(dpy, i, 0) == keysym)
    {
      /* Code to add binding, I think */
    }

In my .fvwm2rc, I have:

  Key KP_7        A       M       GotoPage 0 0

With the new code, fKey is 1, min is 8, max is 134, and
(XKeycodeToKeysym(dpy, i, 0) == keysym) is never true, so
the key doesn't get added.  In the 2.1.5 code, the add
is done (and it *is* done) at the end of the procedure.

Anything else I should look at?

Thanks,
Lee

	I haven't followed the windowlist problem carrefully, but it seems I had
something like that with DecWindow and OpenVMS. The window list did alwas show
the last focused window : I added an XFlush() in fvwmwinlist.c/RedrawWindow() just
after the call to DrawButtonArray() and now it seems ok.

I just checked and it works. I get a nice error message now and it
doesn't core dump anymore.

Bummer, I'd never have thought of that. Could you find
out what value keysym has and what the corresponding
keycode should be? This looks as if the XDisplayKeycodes
function is broken on your system. Theoretically you
should have had the same problem with 2.0.46 (?) as
it used the same call. And perhaps you could post the
output of 'xmodmap -pk' and 'xmodmap -pke'.

What OS/Xserver do you have?

Ugh, my fault. It *does* work as specified. The percentage refers to the
reference rectangle and this is 1x1 pixels. So 48% = 0.48 pixels.

I think you can apply the patch to any 2.1.x version.

It's the right sort of fix. FvwmWinList is going to sleep in select()
without flushing the output buffer to the server. How far behind it gets
depends on the size of the buffer.

Cheers,

Fvwm{Cpp,M4} have extra things defined for convenience that "PipeRead
cpp file"
wouldn't get so it doesn't obsolete them by itself.

This is due to a bug in the way fvwm starts up. It waits for the first
read/readpipe to complete before doing the first capture.  This is wrong
when there is more than one read specified on the command line.  There
is a bug report for it, I forget the number. I have a patch but it's a
bit wacky so I won't post it until after 2.2.

You get a hang here because fvwm is not processing events yet and
clients don't get mapped without fvwm processing the create-window
events.  The client hangs in XCreateWindow() and the Wait never
completes.  The big problem with PipeRead is that it stops fvwm
processing events until the process on the other end of the pipe exits. 
If the PipeRead process tries to open a window it will hang itself and
fvwm. It's a Catch 22 situation, you can't have the advantage of
PipeRead input taking effect immediately without the danger of hanging,
the same goes with trying to get Exec to wait for completion before
doing the next line of a function.

This is still vulnerable to the start up bug.  Try 

fvwm2 -cmd "Read /dev/null" -cmd 'PipeRead "m4 whatever"'

The initial capture will happen before the PipeRead even starts.

I have three pending patches and still not a single comment.
Should I commit them or not (see individual threads for
details). I vote for yes in all three cases.

Full_Name: Dan Espen
Version: 2.1.11
CVS_Date: 2.1.11
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: XSun
Submission from: (NULL) (128.96.133.4)
Submitted by: dane


I get a core dump from the following TitleStyle command:

+ TitleStyle Centered \
             ActiveUp (Solid pink -- Raised) \
             Inactive ( -- Flat) \
             ActiveDown (Solid yellow -- Sunk)

The space before the 2 dashes seemed to be the culprit,
when I removed the space, the command was processed OK.
Here is the stack trace:

Session management is essentially the saving of state of a user's desktop
so that it (applications, window positions, etc.) can be restored when the
user next logs in.

It seems to require cooperation between X, the window manager, the
applications and probably the phase of the moon, but it is a useful thing
to have.  As Linux pushes onto the desktop it becomes increasingly
important.

Some docs are in ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/doc/hardcopy/SM/.

OK, I understand now. But isn't that what a 'desktop environment'
is supposed to do? Certainly it's nice to have, but I don't see
it as a task of the window manager. Or could we have a module
for that?

OK, if nothing comes up I will commit them tonight (about

I though we already had a module for that SaveDesk, although it doesn
need some work it doesn't save everything that is on the desktop not
really sure why.  The ida is you would but a wrapper function that calls
Module FvwmSaveDesk and then quits.  And somewhere in the arc you do a
read of .fvwm2desk

This, though has nothing to do with X session management, which is a
defined protocol for doing this kind of thing.

I've just read the web documents that Jason pointed out.

Recently I was forced to use CDE  for a week or  so.  I assume the CDE
feature that attempts to restart applications you  have open on logout
is based on this.  (I know assumptions are dangerous.)

If thats what this is, my first observation is, I  was careful to exit
everything when  I logged out.  Making logging  out extra work.  There
are loads of things you don't want restarted automatically.  The whole
thing seemed to boil down to a tool that writes your .xinitrc for you.

Since Matthias came up with this, I  wish he would offer some opinions
about how useful this is.

Bob,

I applied your latest focus patch (updated files events.c, misc.c and focus.c). 
It seems to work for most of the problems I've reported.  The only ones that
still remain are these:

	1)  It seems that any sun tools that are iconified with NoIconTitle
	    specified still will not pop to the top.

	2)  FvwmPager will not pop to the top.

I can fix this by setting the Style flag Lenience for these apps.  I can see
where the sun tools might need this, but FvwmPager?

Thank you for the patches and all the help and for not getting on my case for
not entering my little bugs on the "FVWM Bug Tracking System".

I really don't know what fix we are talking about now.
In general I want to leave that decision for discussion.
If you feel it should go into 2.2 I have no objections.
What do the others say? Looking back I have the impression
that we tried to go for 2.2 too early and now we're
presented the bill: a constant stream of new bugs.
Anyway. I feel confident that we can pin it down as soon
as we have the key binding bug fixed.

I see that we didn't apply this one. Since it seems perfectly
safe I'll commit it.

I'm not sure if it's already in now. But if it isn't I don't
object against inclusion. After all the work you spent on this
I want this to work in 2.2.

Am I being dumb? Inline is supposed to be a C++ feature,
isn't it? I see that RelieveWindow and RelieveWindowHH in
borders.c are declared inline functions. There are some
other places where it's used too. Apart from this is can't
fathom why a function longer than 80 lines should be an
inline. Seems like tons of useless duplicate code to me.

Shouldn't we remove 'inline' altogether?

Looking at the gcc info page I see that gcc supports inline
for plain C but it's not ansi C:

  `-ansi'
       Support all ANSI standard C programs.

       This turns off certain features of GNU C that are incompatible
       with ANSI C, such as the `asm', `inline' and `typeof' keywords ...

->Bummer, I'd never have thought of that. Could you find
->out what value keysym has and what the corresponding
->keycode should be? This looks as if the XDisplayKeycodes

->What OS/Xserver do you have?

Redhat Linux 5.2, kernel 2.2.1.  XFree 3.3.2.

I think I've found the problem.  In 2.1.5, I bind to KP_7, but
the latest code requires that I bind it as KP_Home.  Not sure
which one is "right."

Here's the xmodmap's:

 xmodmap -pk

It'll end as soon as you edit your automake script and change the line:

  TAR=gtar

to:

  TAR=tar

just as I said last time this happened :).  Note you'll have to remember
to re-do this change every time you reinstall automake, or install a new
version.

Of couse, once 2.2.0 is cut I hope the very first commit to 2.3.x will
be Steve or someone removing all these files anyway--then you won't be
able to build without having autoconf and automake installed (and GCC
and GNU make) but at least we won't have this problem anymore.

IMO a good practice whenever you're about to commit changes is to run
"cvs update" first, and look at the files marked "M"; these are ones CVS
thinks you've modified and the ones that it will check in as changed.
If you see odd things in there (like every Makefile.in when you didn't
change configure.in or any Makefile.am's) you can investigate then
before you commit.

Don't run 'cvs commit' but 'cvs commit <thefilesyouwanttocommit>'.. that
will take care of all these "Oops.. there they go again"...

True... but you run the risk of forgetting to check in some changes.

YMMV, but I prefer my method (cvs update, check the "M"odified files to
make sure they're reasonable, then cvs commit).

Finally I understand what is happening :) The problem is
that:

1) Multiple keycodes can be bound to the same keysym
2) Multiple keysyms can be bound to the same keycode

E.g. you could have this in your xmodmap:

  79           0xff95 (KP_Home)        0xffb7 (KP_7)
  80           0xffb7 (KP_7)           0xff95 (KP_Home)

So if you use XKeysymToKeycode on KP_7 you may either
get 79 or 80 as the return code. On the other hand, if
you only have 

  79           0xff95 (KP_Home)        0xffb7 (KP_7)

XKeycodeToKeysym will return KP_Home for the keycode
79. This doesn't match what we are comparing it with.
Technically it should be forbidden to bind keysyms that
require a modifier to get them in X. Unfortunately this
is not quite clear to the average user (or even the
expert user).

A way to fix this would be to check the keysym for every
possible combination of keycode and a single modifier
(patch attached, but I don't think the patch is elegant.
It may prove way too slow).

To reproduce this bug anyone can just issue

  # xmodmap -e 'keycode 79 = KP_Home KP_7'

and put these lines in his .fvwm2rc:

  key kp_home a n menu some_menu
  key kp_7    a n menu other_menu

When you press KP_7 you get 'some_menu', not 'other_menu'
as you would expect.

----------- a few minutes later -----------------

No, the patch doesn't slow things down too much. You might
notice if you have tons of key bindings. I'll commit the
patch so that everyone can test it. Please do have a look
at it if it does the right thing.

Lee, does the patch solve your problem?

Bye

Dominik

Yes, of course. I didn't reapply this when I installed automake-1.4.

Well, hope you didn't spend any time looking, since here's the info:

Aron Griffis <agriffis@css.tayloru.edu> did the 2.1.x contribs, though
RedHat has someone doing the one's they distribute. RedHat's packager
is most recently Cristian Gafton <gafton@redhat.com>.

Wouldn't be so sure, taking into account that 2.1.x has been packaged
and contrib'd by a 3rd party.

Wow, a lot of response... let me try to answer

First, Dominik is right, it is not the job of the WM to be a session 
manager. But a well-behaved WM should be SM-aware, ie be a client of
the session manager (a session manager is a separate program like xsm
or gnome-session). 

Session management under X means basically supporting the X SMP (Session
Management Protocol), as defined by the documents mentioned by Jason.

Being SM-aware requires the WM to do things like the mentioned module,
FvwmSaveDesk, does. But it has to be done in a SMP-compliant way. The
SM has control over when the client should die or save its state. This
is achieved via communication over an ICE connection. Every SM-client
is given a globally unique ID by the SM and the WM should look up 
information about a clients windows based on this ID, window class, 
name (and an optional role property to further disambiguate multiple 
windows of a client)

Finally, session management certainly aims to be more than automated
.xinitrc writing. Continuing a session means that all clients should be
restarted and put in the state they were before, ie an editor should come
up with the cursor at the same position in the same file, the WM should 
sort the clients windows in the same stacking order, preserve iconification,
etc. My patch was only a beginning, I already have a better version at
home which is saving much more state (including the stacking order).

I'm not sure if it would be feasible to put this functionality into a 
module. It certainly was easier to adapt the enlightenment implementation
to become part of fvwm proper.

Making fvwm SM-aware would be nice, since it would improve the 
interplay between fvwm and desktop environments (Gnome uses X SMP, don't
know about KDE)...and it would mean that the Enlightenment authors couldn't
claim any longer that Enlightenment is the only fully SM-aware WM out there.

I did put some notes in my bug report, but I've just double checked
C9X and had it wrong.  C9X and C++ both have the same behaviour.
External linkage of inline is permitted but not in the way that
RelieveWindow[HH] tries to do it.  An inline function must be defined
in every translation unit that calls it.  The extern qualifier serves
to make sure that all translation units with a definition of an inline
function have identical definitions for it.

My fix alternatives 1 and 2 are inadequate.

Inline function definitions belong in header files.  If they are not
able to be inlined, e.g. with C89, then they belong in a C file.  So
if we are to be able to compile in both environments you'd need the
following sort of ugliness.

/* relieve.h */

#ifdef HAVE_INLINE
/* define the functions */
#include "relieveP.c"
#else
/* just declare the functions */
extern void RelieveWindow(FvwmWindow *, Window,
                          int, int, int, int, GC, GC, int);
extern void RelieveWindowHH(FvwmWindow *,Window,
                            int,int,int,int, GC,GC, int, int);
#endif


/* relieve.c or borders.c */

#ifndef HAVE_INLINE
#include "relieveP.c"
#endif


/* relieveP.c */

extern inline void RelieveWindow(FvwmWindow *t,Window win,
                                 int x,int y,int w,int h,
                                 GC ReliefGC,GC ShadowGC, int hilite)
{
...


I have only addressed language standards: C89, C9X, C++.  Compilers
may have limitations or extensions.  For instance the AIX C compiler
can inline functions even though there is no inline declaration.
Remember that inline is just a hint, there are similarities with the
register qualifier.


 > Shouldn't we remove 'inline' altogether?

Probably.  It is only really useful for short functions.  Given the
size of RelieveWindow[HH] the overhead of a normal function call is
minimal.  I wouldn't be too surprised if some compilers decided that
these functions were too big and "outlined" them anyway.

We are talking about FvwmWinList not showing the currently
focused window. It seems to be oblivious to lots of events.
I think we have already agreed that the fix
is necessary before 2.2.  Its pretty bad as it is now.  If
Tim has a fix, I think it should be committed.

Sometime after 2.2 we really need to write one or more
generic event / pipe read loops for the modules...

I'm sorry.  This doesn't parse.  "How to my?"

How about inserting the word "configure" before the word "my?"

This is not a bug report, more of an opportunity.
Many modules share a similar loop where they read fvwm messages and
process X events.  The function is called "MyNextEvent" in FvwmButtons,
FvwmIconBox, FvwmPager, FvwmTalk, FvwmGoodStuff, and FvwmWharf.

I think this could be a callable function put in the libs directory.

Err. You are right of course. Though rather than "configure" I'd say
"change" or "edit." I've reattached another diff, this time corrected.
Also made one other minor fix (accompanied by rather than accompanied
with). Sorry 'bout that.

    This whole thread is probably pretty academic at this point, since
we'll probably
not have the generated files around much longer. But I never had this
problem. I never
do a build in my CVS directory. As soon as I do an update, the CVS tree
gets copied
to my test build directory, where configure and make can do their
damndest without
polluting the original source tree. The only thing that modifies the CVS
tree are
changes that I explicity make (or updates from the repository).

    This also has the advantage that I never run into stale cached
config info or the
like. Every new build is totally clean.

Here's a thought: we have a number of holes in our FAQ numbering now,
due to old questions no longer being relevant.

Should we try to fill those holes with new FAQs, like this, or just
leave them as holes for posterity?

I'd wondered the same, but since the practice has been to append,
rather than to fill holes, I followed. Thoughts? I'd be happy to fill
the first available hole with my (hopefully) finally-fixed FAQ entry
(like the alliteration?).

While working on fvwm, using cut and paste   plus
FvwmTalk  to test things can become a bit clumsy.

Here is a very simple module that allows to execute
the selection directly.

Aargh!

Okay all, here what I hope is the last iteration of this entry.

But then the clients have to be aware of session management too. Right?
Are there any applications who are?

Hm, if it isn't a module is should definitely be a compile time option
(--with-session-management, off by default?). The changes are quite large
and probably not too many people will use it (?)

I wonder if it's possible to start an application on a
different page/desk *without* moving the viewport to this
new page. At the moment I don't think fvwm2 is able to do
so. Is this doable at all? Or do some applications always
require to start on a visible page?

The setup I use is this: On page 0 0 I do all the work. When
I begin a PPP session I usually start a large mutt window on
page 0 1 and sometimes a netscape window on 1 0. To supervise
PPP startup I have to return to page 0 0 however. I'd like to
run mutt and netscape in the background and flip pages
manually when the connection is up.

Bye

	Add SkipMapping to the style for whichever app you want
to do this with. For your example, starting Netscape like so:

Style "Netscape*"    SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 1 0

will start Netscape on page 1,0 of the current desktop without
forcing a viewport switch.

	I tend to group a lot of related things on a specific
desktop. For example, communications stuff goes on desk 1, so
I start Netscape this way

	I installed the latest Linux kernel - 2.2.1 - this weekend, and
found that FvwmConsole no longer builds.

	The problem is that the type of sun_family in un.h has been
changed from unsigned short to sa_family_t, which is typedef'ed in
socket.h, which is included *after* un.h.

	The fix is to switch the order of the includes for sys/un.h and
sys/socket.h in FvwmConsole.c.

	This also works fine under the older Linux kernels. *If* I have
time tomorrow - and the way things are at work right now, that's a
very big if - I'll try building under Solaris.

	I'd appreciate it if you can try this under as many different
Unices as possible before I commit the change. I don't expect it to
cause a problem, but you never know.

I noticed this problem in the late 2.1.x series, with libc5, and forgot to
check whether it worked as-is under libc6.

So ... two data points here ... it compiles fine either way with linux
2.2.0-final and glibc 2.1, as well as on a stock Solaris 7 system (though I
get other, unrelated prototype warnings).

	Dang! Color me green with envy - you managed to snag glibc 2.1
before they yanked it while they bicker over copyright issues. I was
planning to do the glibc upgrade this weekend (I'm still using libc5);
but now, who knows when I'll get around to it.

	Thanks for the info. My feeling is that if it works either way
on most systems, we should change to the reversed order, since we know
of at least one configuration where it doesn't work as is. My hope is
that we don't have to add more config logic to try to cope with this.

I've just taken over the maintainership of the Debian fvwm2 package,
which will aim to keep up with the fvwm 2.x.y software.  Obviously, if
I am going to be able to do a reasonable job of maintaining the
software, I should have a decent idea of what is going on internally.
As I have never worked with a windowing system before, can anyone give
me some pointers to find out the basics needed to understand how an
X Windows manager works, and in particular what goes on inside of
FVWM?

My contribution in return will obviously be twofold: forwarding
(genuine) bug reports expediently (once I have got to grips with what
is going on), and supplying patches in those cases where I can figure
out what needs to be done.

	Will you be responsible for both the Stable and the Unstable
trees, or are there two separate maintainers for the two trees? Is
Austin no longer involved with fvwm, at least in an official Debian
capacity? I'll need to update our contact list.

	The X Window System series of books published by O'Reilly &
Associates is probably your best introduction. I find I refer to
Volumes 1 and 2 most often. Volume 1 has a chapter on "Interclient
Communication", which describes the interaction between the window
manager and client programs.

> and in particular what goes on inside of FVWM?

	Whew! Well, before somebody says "Use the source, Luke",
here are a couple of starting points. Look at fvwm.h and screen.h
for some of the basic data structures. Then, fvwm.c has the
initialization and termination logic, and events.c has the event
loop and all the event handlers. The built-in functions (i.e.,
the commands you place in the .fvwm2rc file, or issue interactively
from FvwmConsole or from a shell script via FvwmCommands) are
implemented via a function pointer table in functions.c; most of the
functions pointed to in the table will be found in builtins.c.

	I realize that this barely scratches the surface, but it's
a starting point. I hope it helps. Good luck!

Note: the reason glibc was yanked has _nothing_ to do with copyright
issues; that rumor started on slashdot has no basis in reality.  The
real reason is much.... stranger... if you ask me.  No one did, of
course.  I heard this straight from the developers' mouths (er,
keyboards).

Anyway, I'd advise against installing 2.1 right now; I've heard some
very, very bad things about it (someone claimed it trashed his hard
disk).  I'm not sure how many of these things I believe outright but all
the same, I personally have no plans to upgrade until an officially
"supported" version of my distribution (Debian, since last month, RedHat
before that) is available.  Of course, I'm already on a glibc system so
it's not that big a deal for me to wait :).

Uh, what is wrong with distributing such a file?

Sure, 99.999% of the people won't care about it, but there's always the
chance that someone who just got the tarball would send us a correction or
addition to the list.

More importantly, it is just less work all around if the tarball coincides
with the CVS tree.  Why make them differ??

Here's an idea for Julian: while you are delving into the innards of FVWM,
take notes.  Then work the notes into some kind of "hacker's guide" for
FVWM, and you'll be world famous!

Hi,

Sorry if this already got answered; I may have skipped over it.  I'm just
catching up on emails after 10 days out of the country.

It hasn't much to do with GNU long options, because the option parsing is
done in shell script that autoconf generates.

For the STANDARD "configure" options, such as "--bindir", unambiguous
prefixes are allowed.  For the "--with-*" and "--enable-*", they are not.
You'll have to take it up with the autoconf folks to change this.

The configure script will not complain about illegal options.  I think
this is goofy, too, but this is by design, and I think the autoconf people
have a rationale for this behaviour.  I can't recall where I saw the
rationale spelled out, however.

Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'!

I use StartsOnDesk in conjunction with SkipMapping to achieve
something like that.

Austin has offered fvwm 1.x up "for adoption"; I've offered to take
over from him, but haven't heard anything yet.  When I start to work
on it, probably within the next few weeks, I will take over both
versions (unless I have heard otherwise from someone about the stable
version).  I recommend that you use jdg@debian.org as my email
address, as this will remain as long as I am a Debian maintainer.

Aargh... sounds heavy!  But I guess I'll have to start somewhere. :-/

Well, reading the source is, obviously, the way to go (I have played
this game before ;-), but it's not a simple program, and I wanted a
couple of pointers to get me going.  Thanks for the hints -- hopefully
they'll help.

Cheers!  (Which is British slang for "Thanks!")

That's not a bad idea, but I'm not so sure about the world famous bit ;-)

Found this while pasting into FvwmConsole:

A line typed into FvwmConsole that just has whitespace causes fvwm to core
dump.
So does FvwmCommand "  ".  Reading a file with spaces does not.

I don't think this is exactly a bug as everything is working as
intended here. What you probably want, given your configuration, is:
Style "*" DecorateTransient
so the dialogs and other goofy things will get titles and borders.

Or you could create a hotkey or somesuch to allow you to begin moving
your windows.

Julian

There are lots of links to X resources and tutorials at Kenton Lee's
site: http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html.

There is Xlib tutorial info at http://www.tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/.

It can also be educational to look at the very simple window managers
provided as examples in X distributions over the years (such as
[x]wm, uwm, twm). I have links at http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/wm/.

Yup, and I can reproduce it in 2.1.13 too.

The problem as I see it is that code is not careful about checking
function return values. 

In this case, I can fix this by adding the lines marked "+" in
ExecuteFunction (fvwm/functions.c): 

  taction = expand(Action,arguments,tmp_win);
  action = GetNextToken(taction,&function);

+  if ( function == NULL )
+      return;

> So does FvwmCommand "  ".  Reading a file with spaces does not.

This I cannot reproduce.  I just get a cryptic error message:

	steve@hilbert{steve}FvwmCommand "  "
	No such file or directory FvwmCommand error in opening message fifo

I don't understand this.  But maybe you could check if the above fix takes
care of FvwmCommand, too.

Probably not. I forgot to give Tim the time to commit that FvwmWinList
patch. And the Bob found this Linux 2.2.x problem. We should fix these
fast and make 2.1.13 as soon as possible.

Correct. 2.1.12 coredumps too. This is due to the change I made
to GetNextToken a while ago. If there is only whitespace in the
string, GetNextToken returns a NULL pointer now and
FindBuiltinFunction dereferences it. No big deal to fix. I'll
commit the patch soon.

I have removed the 'inline' declaration from the offending functions
(fvwm2 as well as several modules). The 'inlined' functions were
quite large anyway. The funny thing is that the executable has become
48 bytes larger (Linux PC).

OK, now that I know how it is called I can find it in the manpage.
I wouldn't have seen it even if I knew where to start looking. I
think in the future we really have to have better documentation.
'SkipMapping' has a certain logic if you already know it, but to
the novice (like me in this case) it means nothing.

Should we create a 'fvwm2-howto' with lots of examples how to
configure all these nifty features?

	I'll go ahead and commit the Linux 2.2.1 fix tonight. I don't
think it should cause any problems, but I'd certainly like to hear
of results on some systems other than Solaris and Linux.

Subject: FvwmButtons: Per Button Focus

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: Red Hat Linux 5.2 kernel 2.0.36
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2 Mach64
Submission from: (NULL) (134.153.98.6)


I like to have an FvwmButtons buttonbox with several swallowed and
non-swallowed 
buttons showing up on my desktop during the whole session. I am faced with
the
following dilemma:

Some swallowed buttons are very well suited for SloppyFocus.

Other buttons are much better suited for the ClickToFocus property.

Since all buttons lie on the same buttonbox (and I like to move the
buttonbox around
from time to time), I am faced with making either all buttons ClickToFocus
or making
all buttons SloppyFocus.

This is too bad, as it forces me to create at least two buttonboxes, one
with the
SloppyFocus Style and one with the ClickToFocus Style.

The problem is that I really intend to have only one buttonbox for my
desktop,
not two or more.

Some extra flexibility in FvwmButtons with regards to this would be nice.

Thanks to all developers.

Subject: BitmapPath: syntax improvement

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.0.46

Submission from: (NULL) (134.153.98.6)


I would like to suggest a syntax improvement for future system.fvwm2rc
files:

Make the use of IconPath supported but deprecated in favor of BitmapPath .

This would better complemet the use of PixmapPath in the .fvwm2rc files.

It would be nice if windows could have the titlebar on the bottom, and if
there
were a mechanism for unwindowshading a window so that the titlebar would
result
being on the bottom.

Um, I hope not. I repaired it for the 2.1.12 tarball.

Well, on my home system, the only app I could find was xclock :-(, 
but there is a program called smproxy that can be used to increase the
sm-awareness of X programs. It allows programs using older versions
of the XSMP (ie the SAVE_YOURSELF protocol in WM_PROTOCOLS) to become
fully session aware. 

I guess this will change with when the free desktop environments mature
a bit more.

The biggest part of my patch was a new file, session.c, which contains
the new stuff. Apart from that there are only minor changes to 
fvwm.c (initialization), add_window.c (making client windows use their
saved state), icons.c (right now fvwm lowers clients and moves the
icon on the current page - this has to be avoided if the client was
left in iconic state from a previous session).

The patch I'm going to present for post-2.2 inclusion will be fully
ifdef'ed and have --enable-session.

The FvwmWinList fix is in 2.1.12 so don't wait for me.

You mean the fix was already in when we started discussing if
you should commit it ? :-)

     I think it is an old bug. It sounded familiar, so I checked the
archives. There was some discussion back in Sept, 1997, when the problem

was reported by Andrew Veliath. My reply at the time was

     Obviously, neither I nor anyone else found the time to look more
deeply, and the matter didn't generate a lot of interest at the time.

     As well as I recall, the code was pretty convoluted, and in the
limited time I had to look at it, I got fairly confused trying to figure

out what to do about it. I would think that by now that section of the
code had been significantly reworked, and in any case my memory of it
is totally cold.

     Am I overlooking something - i.e., is there a good reason why one
shouldn't be able to bind a function to the border of such a window?

Paul (PDS), what is the status of this bug report? Is it still an
issue?

  Further to this: with 2.1.11, plus your two key & menu patches,  the
following *locks* fvwm:

Key Tab        AWTSFI 1       Prev FlipFocus
Key Tab        AWTSFI 1A      \
   WindowList Root c c Alphabetic NoDeskSort NoGeometry "Prev FlipFocus"

  .. with:

[FVWM][ParseBindEntry]: <<WARNING>> Binding specified AnyModifier and

fers too. Excess modifiers will be ignored.


  Of course, that's not be the way to do it! I keep putting 'A' for 'Alt'
(not 'M' for 'Meta').

  As an aside: with M in there instead of A, the '1' only definition
doesn't work - it's overridden by the '1M' one, even when Meta's not held
down.

Somehow, I missed the WinList fix being committed.
This morning I tested it, and it seems much improved.

One strange  thing.  Entries depress when  I move  the  mouse into the
window or icon (MouseFocus).  However, I have  an X3270 window with an
active icon, and a icon title.  In that case, the entry in FvwmWinList
only depresses when   I put  the   mouse over  the  icontitle, nothing
happens when I put the mouse over the icon.  This doesn't bother me in
the least, as far as going ahead with 2.2.

I'm still in favor, of making this next package as 2.2 and
going directly to announcing this as a non-beta.

I'd prefer to see this  information as part of  the FAQ.  Perhaps  the
FAQ should be re-organized so that there is a "configuration" section.

Well, I really don't care where the information is kept. I didn't
use the FAQ since most entries don't have a question to answer.

This must be something to do with fvwm not knowing about the window that
has focus.  I was looking around events.c trying to find a way to tell
the modules whether a Focus or FlipFocus had been done (so they can
correctly follow the winlist order) and the focus message to the modules
comes from a focus-enter event.  Maybe the active icon is a window that
fvwm doesn't know about or it doesn't know how to back-track from the
active icon to the main window.

So was I, but now I think that the new menu positioning stuff could do
with a bit more testing.

Cheers,
Tim.

  dv> Paul (PDS), what is the status of this bug report? Is it still an

I didn't do anything with it.  I'm not sure it's really a bug: after
all, the entire reason those options exist is so you can point configure
to where your files are, if they're not in the standard place (/usr/X11
something).

There's some argument to be made for searching /usr/openwin by default,
I suppose, since that's where all standard Sun X installations reside
(and, I assume, if you use Sun's xmkmf to build libxpm that's where
it'll put things) and Sun is a pretty common platform.

As for /usr/local, again there's some argument to be made for looking at
$prefix/lib and $prefix/include for libraries in general, but I feel
this should be a feature of configure itself (and I've mentioned this to
the autoconf folks a number of times).  And generally libxpm.a won't
ever be installed automatically into /usr/local, since it uses
Imakefiles, so this isn't that common of a situation, I expect.  This is
more important for libreadline and rplay, I think.

In short, we could do both of these but I consider this more along the
lines of an enhancement request than a bug.

If someone wants to publish the testcases, I'd be happy to run
them.  Just announcing another beta isn't guaranteed to test any
of the menu positioning changes.

Just to give a closing status, I've had but heavy winlist users test out the current checked in stuff for FvwmWinList and they aren't reporting any problems so I would say we are all set.

The problems they were having just to refresh was a focus update problem and potental locks on window deletes.

If you try to move a window using the middle mouse button in the pager, it
moves with the pointer, but jumps back when you let go.  It worked right
in
2.0.45.

Full_Name: Eddy J. Gurney
Version: 2.1.12, 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: X11R6.1
Submission from: (NULL) (147.225.20.26)


Go to http://www.datek.com/streamer (with Java enabled in Netscape) and
wait for the "Streamer" java app to appear.

Enter anything for a user name and hit "Ok" (it doesn't actually check
username/password until you try to add a stock). Now click the "Settings"
button, and then the "Resize" button. Click the "Make bigger" button and
notice that the Streamer window does not grow; the contents get bigger
but the not window itself. Click "Make bigger" again and see the same
thing again. Also notice that the windows shifts up and to the left.

This happens under both 2.0.46 and 2.1.12. It works fine under vtwm.

This merely demonstrates the problem; it makes the Streamer applet fairly
useless in everyday use because you can't display more than two quotes
since that is all that fit in the default window size.

I'm happy to make it if we're sure (a) we want one--at least one person
has proposed we go straight to 2.2.0, and (b) everyone has all their
fixes in--I've lost track of the "proposed patches" that have been
posted to the list: have all of them gone in?  What about the
FvwmConsole core dump due to GetToken() returning NULL (I think I've
been bit by that too, I just didn't know what it was :)?

How will 2.2.0 work?  Are we just going to build it and release it?  Are
we going to build it, have it in test for a check, then release it (if
so, what do we do if we find a problem with it)?  Are we going to create
some kind of 2.2.0candidate1 release or something, then if that works
respin with nothing but the configure.in version changed?  Will we test
_that_? :)

Also, we should probably spend some time scrubbing off the bug database
between now and when we release.

Jason: are the mailing lists with the new domains working OK?  I'll try
a test message myself in a minute.  If so, maybe we should change the
automated footer on the mailing lists to contain the new info; you can
see what it is now below; I guess we want something like:

I can't see a reason. I get the same behaviour easily. Bob, if you'd
volunteer to make a patch (post 2.2) we'd all be a bit happier.

Well, I have no strong feelings about that and I don't think we can
make configure 100% foolproof. Please do what you like with the bug
report. Either make it an enhancement request or just close it or...

I see no hang. You get some unnecessary X errors and the binding doesn't
work at all, but nothing hangs. I've made a small patch to the code that
fixes both. Perhaps it helps you too. In bindings.c add this line:

  if((mods & AnyModifier)&&(mods&(~AnyModifier)))
  {
    fvwm_msg(WARN,"ParseBindEntry",
             "Binding specified AnyModifier and other modifers too. Excess modifiers will be ignored.");
    mods &= AnyModifier;  <-- this one is new
  }

Isn't '1' and 'M' the same on your system? Anyway that's the way it works.
You have to press *all* the modifiers you specified in the list and not
just one of them. If you want bindings for 'M' and '1' and both you have
to place them on three lines:

  Key tab A 1 beep
  Key tab A M beep
  Key tab A 1M beep

- check if the documentation is complete/correct/understandable

- check if lists of numbers work
  (e.g. menu foo mouse +1-2+3-4+5-6+7 +1p-2p+3p-4p+1234p-1234p
   is equivalent to 'mouse +4 -2p')

- check if the o<number> bit works
  ('Menu foo window o0 o0': upper left corners of menu and current window
   are placed above each other;
   'Menu foo window o100 o100': same with lower right corner.
   Play with other values (<0, >100 and in between)).

- check if the c[<number>] bit still works
  ('Menu foo root c c+100p')

- check if negative numbers work
  ('Menu foo Mouse -50p -100p': Mouse is at position 50/100 of the menu)

- check if the 'm' suffix works
  ('Menu foo mouse +33m +33m' places the menu 1/3 of its width/height
   down and right from the pointer).

We had no official beta since 2.1.10 so I don't see a way around it.

I've committed both patches and I believe everything else is in.

We'll have to do *some* testing. Then we can call it 2.1.13 as well and
relabel it to 2.2 if it works. We were thinking of all revisions since
2.1.4 as the potential 2.2, right?

? I have cleaned up the bug database quite often, so this is no issue. The
BUGS file is another story however.

I'll build the 2.1.13 package now and I'm willing to ignore all but the
most serious bugs. The release *has* to be out until next monday (I'll
be skiing for ten days from then ;-) ).

Heck, I can't find the mail where we were discussing 2.2
vs 2.1.13. Here is a short summary of pro's and con's for
making 2.2 immediately and calling the next release
2.2.0.prerelease.something:

pro

- We'll stop fixing bugs now.
- The name of the release speaks for itself.

con

- Beta tests are for finding-and-fixing bugs, not for
  finding-and-ignoring them.
- We need a bit of testing for the most recent fixes.

So here is what I propose:

I'll make 2.1.13 and upload it to testing without
announcing it (in fact I only need to upload it). In the
end 2.1.13 is just a name. We allow three days to pass in
which we all try to test these fixes as best we can. If no
absolutely critical bug comes up we rename 2.1.13 to 2.2.

The things to be tested are:

1) New menu position hints syntax
2) Key binding bugfix
3) All this Iconify/Raise/StartsOn... stuff
4) The FvwmConsole fix
5) The FvwmCommand coredump fix
6) FvwmWinList

For the fixes I made (1, 2 and 5) I'd prefer if you
review the code. 1 Has to be tested too, however. I
understand that FvwmWinList has been tested thoroughly
already.

Bye

Dominik

Given the rate at which we get questions/bug reports on this I
wonder if we should make 'DecorateTransients' the default (to
be more precise I wonder why it isn't already).

Thoughts?

Hey, this one is new. I saw all the makefile.in's on the
commit screen, but they were not committed.

Making 'DecorateTransients' the default makes absolute sense because one
of the biggest complaints I hear from coworkers, help desk users, et al.
is, "Why do some of my frickin windows not have resize/close buttons --
or worse -- title bars!?!".  It's unintuitive for 'NoDecorateTransients'
to be the default behavior.

Having all the bells and whistles on by default (like
'NoDecorateTransients') is a bad thing when it confuses novice (and
experienced) users.

And this frustrates the HELL out of them!  

The "F" in FVWM2 should NOT stand for "Frustrating"...  

Let's turn 'DecorateTransients' on by default for 2.2.  All those in
favor?

I just built and installed the latest beta.  It works, but icons sometimes
pop over
windows (not grabbing focus), and worse can't be lowered unless I uniconify
and
iconify them again.

	There were some problems with using Button2 on the
window icons in the Pager. These were fixed, I think in
2.1.12, but certainly in 2.1.13 (the very latest release at
the moment, but, I believe, not formally announced).

	From the Downloads page, follow the link to "the
latest alpha and beta releases". In the directory
pub/fvwm/version-2/testing you'll find release 2.1.13.
Please give it a try, and let us know if you still have
problems.

	I would flatly say "it's fixed" and move this one
to the Fixed category, but your description is not *exactly*
like what had been reported before. That's why I'd very much
appreciate it if you would try 2.1.13, and confirm to us
that your problem is corrected.

	I may have missed a comment on this before, but has anyone
noticed that Jitterbug doesn't seem to like e-mail addresses of the
form

	FVWM Workers <fvwm-workers@fvwm.org>

(now where the hell do I put the question mark in a sentence that ends
like that?)

	When I try copying the list in a reply to a bug report, I get
the following dreck from Jitterbug:

       The system encountered a fatal error

        After command: RCPT TO: <Workers>

     Received: 550 <Workers>... User unknown

    The last error code was: Not a typewriter 

               uid/gid=105/70 


Duhhh. I finally figured out that it only likes the form

	fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

(Well, no, I didn't have the patience to try the form with quotes.)

	Your test message came through fine, but the new domain mail
info still doesn't seem to have propagated to my neck of the woods. I
sent a test message to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org earlier this evening, and
it doesn't appear to have gotten through.

It hasn't broken anything in my default set up (not that it does much),
I used to use "root 0 -24p" to get a menu just above the FvwmButtons (24
pixels high) now I have to use "root 0 o100-24p". I don't know if this
is an intended change.

I can't test this.

Being unable to raise a window over icons has been fixed. A
not-worth-fixing-yet bug is that when the icon title is expanded it
isn't raised to the top.  If you have very long icon titles and icons
packed close together you can get the expanded icon title going
underneath other icon titles. Looks a bit weird but easily fixed with "+
I Current (Iconic) Raise" in a focus event function.

All fixed.

Well I guess your experienced users are rather inexperienced then.  A
Transient window by definition of being a Transient doesn't get window
manager decorations it is supposed to be a modal dialog with exclusive
grab used by an application to force you to interact with the dialog.  I
for one just to be sure have NakedTransients defined in my rc file.  If
we are going to completly ignore window hints then we need to make the
change consistent. That would mean making Style "*" DecorateTransient,
HintOverride the default.

I'm glad we got input from at least one "NakedTransients" user.

I decorate transients,  but I  don't  think its  such  a good idea  to
change default behavior just prior to an official release.

My guess is we've had  at least a dozen "DecorateTransient"  questions
in the few years I've read this list.  I  don't remember anyone coming
back with a question as to why this isn't the default behavior.

Perhaps the fact that the option has been undocumented all this time
is the root cause of the problem.

Speaking as a novice here (I never cared about this setting until
I lookad at this because of the questions/bug reports) I find it
rather confusiong. I've never seen a window manager that has
transients undecorated by default. I'm sure the average user
does not even know the term 'transient window' and wouldn't know
where to start looking. And finally I don't want to make it the
default before 2.2.

Yes, I didn't explain it very well, but it should be the same bug.

Yes, this is intended to get the syntax consistent.

If you could try all your key bindings it might suffice.

I played with the new stuff seems to work but I can't quite remember
what the requirment was for the syntx change.

I ran this on a sparc 2, and the added looping doesn;t seem to slow
things down noticbley and all my bindings still work so I say keep it in
if it fixes the multi keysym problem. The code itself seems fine, not
crazy about the indentation style but, its fine.

That is because I didn't announce the reason in length :) The old
syntax just didn't allow to place a menu everywhere you wanted (e.g.
not 8 pixels above the mouse pointer). And there was a conflict between
the old syntax and negative offsets being interpreted like in a geometry.
You would have had to say +-8 or -+8 or so to get the mentioned
behaviour. And since the syntax was new in 2.1.x I saw no reason to
fix it after people are used to it.

I'd like to know if it is OK to try all modifiers until the first one
has no binding. Is this correct?

as for Transients a quick excursion to mwm or Solaris' dt should show
you some totally nude nude transients (Hey that would be a great subject
for a spam message). It doesn't really matter if yhe user knows the

if programmers use transients correctlly then the user shouldn't have

It my gut feeling that we should wait more than 3 days to see if anyone
has problems with 2.1.13.

I'm thinking officially announce 2.1.13 as a "golden beta".  Wait a week
or two.  "Ignore" any non crtical bug reports, then ship it out as v.
2.2.



During those weeks everybody gets busy and starts writing configuration
examples to put on the website to showcase FVWM2's functionality.  

Like you guys talk about stuff like "looping to try all modifiers until
the first one has no binding".  What the hell is that?  Sounds like
something neat, maybe even usefull.  But I never heard of it -- don't
know what it means.

I'm sure the developers and core testers all have one or two neat custom
things in their setups that would make great examples. (eg.  I use an
fvwmbuttons and two wharfs)

I know that what you say is right and I feel the same. But over the last
weeks we're all getting more and more frustrated because of all the work
that gets queued up. Personally I have just given up resistance against
making 2.2 fast.

This one is just an implementation internal, nothing the user can do
in his config file.

That's why I started to make this docs/configuration-hints.txt file.
I hope all the developers take a sweep at it and hack in their tips
and tricks.

I strongly disagree.  People have been waiting, literally, years for
this release.  What we have now is head-and-shoulders above any previous
release of fvwm2 in terms of stability.

The whole point of open-source software is to allow people to get their
hands on the code; these releases don't have to be 100%.  They never
will be!  If we find something horrible, no problem, we can spin a new
version in a matter of hours.  I know it sucks to have to do that but
it's better than _never_ getting 2.2.0 out.  Everyone familiar with OSS
will know not to jump on a .0 release unless they're willing to hop to
the .1 release quickly thereafter!

Besides, there's no question this release will be just perfect for the
_large_ majority of users, since it works great for all of us.  Only
those using odd little features will be affected, if anyone.

I say, ship it!!

I think you'd be surprised how trivial most of our config files are :)
Anyway, this is a great idea but we _certainly_ shouldn't hold the
release for it!

Dominik: I agree we need some better config examples since the config
language has both gotten a lot more complex, and we've deprecated
several old uses.

However, I also don't think a new file in docs is the way to go.
Personally, whenever I get a package that has 10-15 text files in a doc
directory I rarely if ever read them: it's too much.

I'd much prefer to see two things: (1) a much-expanded FAQ; I don't mind
seeing single, really big FAQ docs!, and (2) more sample configs!  One
thing we might consider doing before 2.2.0 is going through the existing
sample configs and either updating them to the "new" syntax we've added
(MenuStyle, Decors, etc.) or removing them.  I'd like to see maybe 4 or
5 sample configs: maybe an fvwm-basic, which is simple and fast and
doesn't use a ton of colors, an fvwm-fancy with gradients, etc., a
MWM/CDE-ish one, and a MS-Windows-y looking one.  Comment them
liberally, and use "best-practices".  Then people can look there or even
start with one verbatim (they should be _useful_, good-looking configs,
not just showcase configs with everything thrown in willy-nilly, I
think).  We can put screenshots on the web page.

I don't know what the licensing is on the fvwm95 pixmaps, but I was
poking around over there and they have a lot of nice pixmaps!  Esp. they
have a good selection of mini-icons.  I would love to steal some of
those, and clean out our pixmaps directory.

And I'd really like to see a nice "fvwm2" or "fvwm-2.2" side pixmap,
done in the style of the side pixmaps in fvwm95.  This may be too much
to ask before 2.2, though.

Also, we might try to decide on "standard sizes" for icons.  Normal
icons seem to be 48x48 or so, mini-icons seem quite standard at 16x16
but we should make that official, and we should take a look at various
side pixmaps and try to come up with a recommendation for those.  Put

Whew, what a long speech :) Some things I want to comment on:

1) As I said I don't care if we have a separate configuration-hints
   file or whatever. I just needed a place to put that stuff for
   the moment. I will take a shot at restructuring the FAQ and
   integrate that.

2) I'm not so sure all the maintainers' config files are so simple.
   I'm convinced at least Dan and Tim have some 'dirty tricks' in
   there.

3) I'd be willing to write a CDE-like config file. But what is
   needed most is a volunteer for a %$@#&$-like file.

On the FAQ, after looking at it again for the first time in a while, I
realize that 50 items in no particular order is pretty unhelpful... it
really invites grep'ing which in turn might lose to spelling errors or
incorrect keyword... I'd be willing to take a look at revising the FAQ
to do the whole:
1. About Fvwm
    1.1 What does FVWM stand for?
    ...
2. Compilation & Installation
    2.1 Where can I get XPM?
etc.
thing. Good? Bad? My preference is for single-file FAQs. Also like
HTML ones, to help go from questions to answers.

On the configs, couldn't agree more. Especially the emulation
configs, which could help convince fvwm2-95 users to use the One True
FVWM ;-)

Don't confuse transients with modal dialogs, they are not the same
thing.  Transients are just windows that are associated with another in
some sort of parent/child relationship.  They can be modal but only if
some hints are set (can't find it by looking in the source). In some
cases it is nice to be able to move the transients around.  In a later
email you refer to CDE, if you use dtpad you can open the search/replace
window (which is a transient) and after you've found what you're looking
for you can leave it open and edit in the main window.  It would be a
major PITA to have to close the search window before editing. This is
one of the nice things about X that M*soft Windows doesn't have.

I think there are hints other than Transient_For that mean modal.  I
can't find anything in the ICCCM though, it might be a Motif thing.
Changing the default to DecorateTransient does not break ICCCM
compliance as far as I can tell and I would prefer it as it won't
confuse novices.

Cheers,
Tim.

Motif and Open Look both have modal hints, and special hints to
represent lack of titlebars, borders, etc. Fvwm will respect these
by default (well, not necessarily the modal hints depending on
compile time options). You can override these hints explicitly of
course. ICCCM has no hints to specify particular decorations.

Excuuuuuse me!!! 8-) Nothing dirty in my config thanks very much.  My
functions are a bit hairy and I do use FvwmEvent to get around some
things I couldn't do with just functions. I have given over the keypad
to fvwm entirely (I don't type numbers if I can help it). I thought
about attaching it but it's 24K so here's just the keys and functions.

Cheers,
Tim.

There is a README in the "icons" directory that addresses just a little
of this.

I particularly liked qvwm's FAQ:

http://www-masuda.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kourai/qvwm/howto-en.html#faq

The overall organization is:

 1.Concepts 
 2.Installation 
 3.Functions 
 4.Configurations 

not that I think its perfect, just a whole  lot better than our linear
arrangement.

Well, I'm not sure I have anything anyone  else would want.  I'll take
a look again sometime soon.   At the risk of having  you all think I'm
completely out of my mind, I will share this.

Generally,  I  keep only one window  open  at a   time.  Usually thats
XEmacs,  but I do have  to log  onto  remotes.  I  have remotes called
"aurora", "cleo", etc.  I want to type in an "a"  to open the "aurora"
window, Ctrl-a to  create the window iconified,  and Shift-a to create
the window open.

Here are the functions to support that:

AddToFunc Rloginxvt "I" Exec exec rxvt $1 -name $0 -n $0 -title "$USER@$0" $2 -e rlogin $0  $3 $4

# Function to add a system to the "Systems" menu:
# arg 0 Letter
# arg 1 Desc
# arg 2 Command
AddToFunc AddToSystemMenu "I" AddToMenu "Systems" "%mini.xterm.xpm%&$0. $1" $2

# Utility func for rlogin key definintions to all our hosts:
# Defines key actions, and updates System menu.
# $0: key
# $1: system
# $2: Optional arg to rxvt (Eg. -pixmap or -e)
# $3: Optional system description for menu (with leading blank)
# $4: Optional arg to rlogin (Eg. -l username)
AddToFunc rloginrxvtkeys "I" Key $0 R N Warp "$1"
+ "I" Key $0 R S Rloginxvt $1 "" "$2" "$4"
+ "I" Key $0 R C Rloginxvt $1 -iconic "$2" "$4"
+ "I" AddToSystemMenu $0 "$1$3" "Rloginxvt $1 '' '$2' '$4'"

And then to use this mess:

rloginrxvtkeys a aurora "" " (HPUX 11)"
rloginrxvtkeys b aurora "" " (HPUX 11) as someone" "-l someone"
rloginrxvtkeys c cleo "" " (Sun 5.6)"

Seems to me that if we grab some of the fvwm95 icons and config file
info, we should be quite a ways there.  As I mentioned on the fvwm list
a few days ago, the major unknown (for me) is FvwmTaskBar; how does the
fvwm2 one compare with the fvwm95 one?

Actually,  after  I execute  the stuff in sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples
I'm as close to a %$@#&$-like feel as I want  to be.  The "mini.winXX"
icons that that  decor uses are already in  the distribution.  I don't
think we are missing any necessary icons.

Until you  start  digging deep,  its identical.   You  can  drag it to
either the top or  bottom of the  screen  (like %$@#&$), but  it won't
drag to the edges like it does in %$@#&$.

I've been having a problem with a program being written in java 1.1, having
to do with setting the icon name.  I've attached a sample java program
which displays the problem.

I'm not sure whether it's a problem with java, with fvwm, or with the
interaction between the two, so before I report a bug in java, I wanted
some input on the problem.  I've also only tested this on Solaris 2.7;
haven't yet run the sample program on my linux box.

Java has no provision for setting the icon name separately from the title.
They're both done via the setTitle() method on the frame.  This works just
fine if the method is called before the window is mapped.  After mapping,
however, fvwm seems to only recognize the setting of the title, not the
icon name.

Using xev, I see the following when the method is called:

    PropertyNotify event, serial 10, synthetic NO, window 0x6c00022,
    atom 0x27 (WM_NAME), time 159708856, state PropertyNewValue

I do not see a WM_ICON_NAME PropertyNotify event, however.  The underlying
call in the AWT code is

    XtVaSetValues(wdata->winData.shell,
                  XmNtitle, text_prop.value,
                  XmNtitleEncoding, text_prop.encoding,
                  XmNiconName, text_prop.value,
                  XmNiconNameEncoding, text_prop.encoding,
                  XmNname, ctitle,
                  NULL);

Where text_prop is the text property created from the string array of which
ctitle is the first element (fairly straightforward, as far as I can see).
XmN* is #define'd to be XtN*, according to Xm/XmStrDefs.h.

Unfortunately, fvwm never seems to find out that the icon name has been
changed.  I don't know if the PropertyNotify event was just never sent or
what, but the icon name in the pager, or in FvwmIdent, stays as it had
been, while the title changes.

This does not happen under dtwm -- the name underneath the icon changes
just fine.

Can anyone shed light as to what's going on here?  What program, if any, is
at fault?

Many thanks,
Danek

Actually, after digging deeper in the X source tree, I found something
quite surprising: Another sm-aware X client is twm ! It seems that
the sm-stuff was added to it in '94, after fwvm started a separate life.

So you could think of my patch as "going back to the roots".

To test icon and title changes, I have the following in my .kshrc:

  function shdr	{		# changes screen title
    print -n '\033]2;'$*'\07'
  }
  function setlabel {		# changes "icon name"
    print -n '\033]1;'$*'\07'
  }

I can then do "setlabel xxx" or "shdr yyy" in rxvt or xterm.
Both work fine under fvwm2.

                   ^^^^^^^^^^^

I noticed this on my test message, too; I sent to fvwm.org but the
address got rewritten somehow.  I think this is a bit confusing; can the
uh.edu systems be configured to keep the fvwm.org domain instead of
replacing it?

I'm sure I'm doing something dumb, but I don't seem to be able
to get menustyle matching working:

#MenuStyle   * SidePic side.fvwm2.xpm, SideColor black
MenuStyle   StartMenu SidePic side.fvwm2.xpm, SideColor black
DestroyMenu StartMenu
AddToMenu   StartMenu "--Start Menu--" Title
AddToMenu   StartMenu "%mini.xterm.xpm%&S. Systems"  	  Popup Systems
AddToMenu   StartMenu "%mini.window.xpm%&W. Window Operations" Popup Window-Ops
AddToMenu   StartMenu "%mini.cut.xpm%&U. Utilities"  	  Popup Utilities

The first, commented out, line works if not commented out,
but the second line is what I want, and so far, no joy.

HELP!

You have to use the ChangeMenuStyle command to apply a MenuStyle to a
Menu.  Kind of confusing, since that's not needed with normal Style.

Add this:

  ChangeMenuStyle StartMenu StartMenu

Another nice thing would be a UseMenuStyle so that one menustyle could
use another as a basis.

I think I found a minor bug with menu animation when menustyles change
from one to another or it may be that if you don't specify much in a
menustyle it gets something wrong.  My menustyle defns:

Emulate MWM
MenuStyle * Foreground Black, BackGround LightGrey, Greyed Grey,
ActiveFore Navy
MenuStyle * Hilight3DThick, Animation On, MenuFace TiledPixmap
PT_003.xpm
MenuStyle * PopupOffset -2 100, TitleWarp, TitleUnderlines1,
SeparatorsShort
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 3 Magenta 33 Yellow 34 Cyan 33
Magenta
MenuStyle StartStyle SidePic 100/side.fvwm2.xpm, SideColor Black

The start menu is defined:

DestroyMenu StartMenu
AddToMenu StartMenu
+ "&Host        %mini-term.xpm%"        Popup OnceMenu
...
ChangeMenuStyle StartStyle StartMenu

It's popped up with

Menu StartMenu Root 0 o100-24p

The result is that the start menu pops up in the right place but the
first submenu that prepops causes the start menu to be warped to the
right before the first submenu is mapped on the left of the start menu. 
What should happen is that the submenu should map half over the start
menu since I don't define a PopupOffset in StartStyle.  I've attached a
jpg of the result, ignore the colours, Exceed can't handle the server
having its own colormap.  I had to turn the quality down to 10% to get
it to 10K.

This is with 2.2.13. I have no problems when all the menus belong to the
* MenuStyle.

Cheers,
Tim.

I was never able to have this kind of thing work either; I just assumed
that menustyle's didn't cross over.  That is, the "*" menu style didn't
serve as a prototype for the ones defined later.

If I redefined each MenuStyle completely, then added new items, it
worked much better.  In other words, your StartStyle above is the basic
style plus some sidepic stuff, not the "*" style plus some sidepic
stuff.

Yes?  No?

I can't find anything in the man page that says "*" styles _should_ be
propogated like this, so I assume they aren't.

That's correct, but not Tim's problem.

No, they are not. I see that using '*' instead of 'default' was a very
unfortunate choice I made since everybody thinks the style is inherited
but other styles. I thought it would be less effort to type but it is
quite misleading.

I can understand what happens. I have mixed up the menu styles here.
The PopupOffset is a property of the parent menu, not the popup menu.
What happens is this:

The PopupOffset of the parent menu is:

  0 66

and of the sub menu:

  -2 100

When the popup menu is mapped it uses the PopupOffset of the parent's
menu style and thus overlaps the start menu at 66%. This is correct
so far. But now the code checks if it has to animate the parent out of
the way. To do this it checks if the menus overlap more than the
PopupOffset and position hints suggest under normal circumstances. But
accidentally it seems to look at the popup's PopupOffset which is -2 100.
So it expects the menus to overlap with only two pixels (which is not
the case) and animates the parent away.

I'll create a patch for it, but I don't think it's worth fixing for
2.2.

Bye

Dominik

Er, no, they are in the correct order: Recapture before Read.
Are you sure you're looking at the current manpage (correct manpath)?

Ah?  When I went to school Read came alphabetically before Recapture.
                             ^                               ^
Or am I missing something?

Are you sure menuPrior is always a valid pointer whenever menu is?  That

Yes, I'm absolutely sure since this lines are inside this
if-statement:

  if (menuPrior != NULL) {
  ...
    x_offset = prev_width * menuPrior->ms->feel.PopupOffsetPercent / 100 +
               menuPrior->ms->feel.PopupOffsetAdd;
  ...
  }

Er (stutter), you mean it's not 'CBADEFG...'? I'm shocked. Why did I
always think this was the correct order? ;-) Yes, now that you say
it. I've looked at it a dozen times and it alway looked right to me
this way... I'll change it.

If you mean the configuration-hints file: I have merged it
into the FAQ already. It's not really a file with configuration
samples anyway but with several hints for efficient behaviour
of fvwm2. Creating the configuration samples will be way more
work we should nonetheless start soon.

Since I saw no more reasons to hold back fvwm 2.2 I'm just
now building the fvwm-2.2.tar.gz file. I will even tag the
CVS tree and take the risk to re-teg it with the same
label. When it's ready, please try building and running it
to make sure the package is good. And everyone should make
a final sweep over the documentation.

Bye

(I just need to air my pain -- no need to take any of this too
seriously!)

I was just going to look at packaging 2.1.13 for Debian this evening,
but I just looked at the Debian source diffs for 2.1.10, and it's
about 21000 lines long!!  I think I'm going to leave reading through
that lot for another day when I am a *lot* less tired and have a *lot*
more time.  And I seriously hope that I can condense it by a factor of
at least 10.  'Cos I *really* don't want to have to maintain such a
large number of changes.  And I've still got some X books to read and
understand.  So Debian may be a little behind for the time being, but
I will catch up some time in the not-too-distant future.

Thanks for listening!

   Julian

That's it. I've been extra careful to do everything right
and compiled and installed the packeage several times. I
hope we can announce the first official fvwm release in
ages 8-).

(I'll put a bottle of sparkling wine in the fridge now).

Wait... how is this going to work?  We're going to modify docs and then
create another 2.2?

BTW, should it be 2.2.0 instead of 2.2?

Wow! I you're through this mess I'd appreciate if you can
find out if there are any buxfixes/features that are not
in the official release. We're always interested in this
kind of stuff.

Good lord!  What are they doing?

I build 2.1.x vanilla, with no changes at all, on my Debian system and
it works fine.

What hacks are they making to our lovely code! :)

I wonder if some of the changes they have are from 2.0.46 somehow, and
we've already added them?

If you put the diff file up for ftp (or you can email it to me
personally) we/I'll take a scan through it.

This means that your readline is compiled with ncurses instead of
termcap (or vice versa, I forget).  The first time it checks with one
and, if that fails, it tries with the other.

I take this risk since I believe we're *not* going to modify the
docs. I've been extra careful with the documentation so it's
unlikely something relevant comes up. I don't mind the effort
to retag a few files. The only concern might be the name of the
package. I propose we rename it fvwm-2.2.candidate1.tar.gz when
we move it to testingt.

> BTW, should it be 2.2.0 instead of 2.2?

Why? We're always talking about fvwm2 and not fvwm2.1 or
fvwm2.2.0. What would the additional zero give us (except
express that we don't really believe it's stable)?

Shouldn't this be reflected in the message somewhere?
It's a bit confusing.

Jason, when you put this into testing please rename it to

Hm.. I have a slight variation of this... It finds readline.a and
readline.h .. then tries to use readline/history.h but I don't have any
such... (the other readline stuff comes from gdb)

--without-readline doesn't work, I have to use
--without-readline-library to make it not use readline..

If I just give --without-readline-includes I get:
configure: error: argument must be a directory

And just as I'm speaking it I see two files that slipped through
my grep the first time: download.html and version.html. I'll update
them and spin a new tarball :)

Ideally, yes; however the macro that performs the check is generic and
there's no argument to it that allows you to provide any extra text like
"with termcap" or something.

You have to have history.h in order to enable readline support in
FvwmConsole.  Are you saying that configure decides you do have a proper
readline, and then the compile of fvwm fails because you don't have
history.h?

Or that configure says you don't have a proper readline?

If the former, that's a bug and should be fixed (post 2.2).  If the
latter, that's correct.

Hm.

  to> If I just give --without-readline-includes I get:

Hm.

These should be fixed, at some point.  Can you write a bug about this
into Jitterbug for us?

If/when we release 2.2.1 it might be more obvious how that relates to
2.2.0 than it is to 2.2.  Whatever, it doesn't matter to me.  "2.2.0" is
how the Linux kernel works; I thought that was our model.

Yes.

It accepts my readline and fails at compile-time.

It tries to link with readline, thinks it looks ok.. then tries to find
the headerfiles which I said I don't want to use...

I don't really understand why Fvwm insists on having me specify both lib
and include ... I haven't heard of anyone that keeps them in separate
prefixes.. Every other autoconf program I've seen uses

--with-foo=/usr/local

and looks for includes under /usr/local/include  and libs under
/usr/local/lib ...

Hi Dominik!

As I haven't yet begun to make sense of the package (although I will
in good time, no doubt), you might want to have a look at the current
bug reports yourself.  You can find them all at:

http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm.html  (fvwm 1.x)
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm2.html (fvwm 2.x)
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm-common.html  (part of fvwm 2.x)

If you do look at them, I'd be more than appreciative if you could
mail at least nnnnn@bugs.debian.org (where nnnnn is the bug report
number) with a comment to say that the bug is fixed in version 2.2,
for then I will not have to struggle with non-existent bugs.

Thanks,

   Julian

> Good lord!  What are they doing?

The current version in unstable is 2.1.10.

A quick glance at the diffs seems to show that all of the Makefile.in
files have been regenerated using automake version 1.3 instead of the
1.4 as distributed, and autoconf 2.12.2 instead of 2.13, which leads
to such huge diff files.  The important diffs are probably lost
amongst such noise :-(  Yet more work for me with a very low S/N ratio.

I'm sure it does 8-)

Probably very few by the looks of it (see below).

Perhaps.  You'll have to judge that one.

By memory:

  x11/fvwm2_2.1.10-2.diff.gz

Here are the possibly significant changes made in Debian's version of
2.1.10 (with some snippets of diff files).  The earlier ones seem to
be more significant than the later ones in general.

(1) In acconfig.h, and similarly in config.h

+++ fvwm2-2.1.10/acconfig.h
@@ -106,6 +106,9 @@

(2) configure.in replaces -ltermcap with -lncurses

(3) The fvwm2.1 manpage replaces:
-percent of pages, so "CursorMove 100 100" means to move down and right
+percent of pages, so "CursorMove 100 100" means to move down and left

    Am I meant to believe this correction?  I doubt it, somehow!

(4) The modules/FvwmIdent/FvwmIdent.1 manpage has the following
    correction: 
 
 .IP "*FvwmIdentBack \fIcolor\fP"
-Tells the module to use \fIcolor\fP instead of white for the window
+Tells the module to use \fIcolor\fP instead of black for the window
 background.

    Is this correct?

(5) Significant diffs to FvwmPager.c.  I don't know what these do.

(6) Two corresponding (?) changes to the FvwmPager.1 manpage:

(7) A few changes of #!/usr/local/bin/perl to #!/usr/bin/perl; not
    really significant in the larger view of things.

(8) A GoodStuff.man page is found in debian/GoodStuff.man in the diff
    file.  This may already be in the main distribution.

(9) Some example fvwm2rc files in the debian/ directory.  Maybe some
    of these will be helpful or worth including in the distrib?

(10) The dirhack.tar.gz.uue file contains a single directory
     extra-pixmaps with lots of xpm and a few icon files.

(11) An m4.fvwm2rc script in the debian/ directory.  This may already
     be in the distrib (it's attributed to Steve McIntyre
     <stevem@chiark.greenend.org.uk>).  If this is useful and not
     already added, maybe it could be?  There's no explicit
     copyright/left statement, so I could check out with him.

(12) A setup-background script in debian/ which does just that.

(13) A system.fvwm2rc in debian/.  Anyone who knows what they're
     talking about able to check over it?

(14) Some irrelevant Debian menu-system stuff in debian/, as well as
     the requisite installation scripts.

Thanks for all the help, guys!

Now for some sleep....

Swallowed window is centered, despite specification of Left option.
Comment in FvwmButtons/draw.c:MakeButton() says that this behavior is
temporarily hard coded.

This configuration used to work in FVWM 2.0.46 with a patch dated
1997-11-11.  (Sorry, I've lost other details of the patch but I do still
have it.)

For a long time, I have been bothered by not being able to type the
national characters of my language into FvwmForm forms.
This patch fixes it.

Subject: ClickToFocus + "Application Window" Key Bindings = Confusion

Full_Name: Larry Gensch
Version: 2.1.11
CVS_Date: 
OS: Digital Unix 5.0 (prerelease)
X_Server: X11R6.3
Submission from: (NULL) (192.208.46.245)


The following key binding:

Key F4		W	M	Close

I take this to mean, when Meta-F4 is pressed in an application
window, a WM-generated "close" function should be executed.

Alas, this does not always work with ClickToFocus.

When a new window appears, despite my having ClickToFocus set,
the new window automatically gets the keyboard focus.  While this
is in and of itself problematical, I have gotten used to it.
Anyway, normal key events are passed to the application as expected.
However, if I press Meta-F4, the window does NOT close.

To get the window to close, I need to "click" in the window
(which ALREADY has the keyboard focus!) and THEN press Meta-F4.

An example with Netscape (again, using ClickToFocus and the Key
binding shown above):

1.  Hit mouse button two to open a link in a new window.
2.  Notice that the new window has the keyboard focus:  PageDown
    will scroll down the page; PageUp will scroll up.  Cursor
    keys also work.
3.  Hit Meta-F4 (Key binding for Close) -- notice that nothing
    happens.
4.  Click the mouse somewhere in that new window (which ALREADY
    has the focus).
5.  Now press Meta-F4.  Window closes.

Now, I don't expect this to be fixed in 2.1.x or 2.2, but I would
like to see this fixed in a future release, as it seems that Fvwm's
idea of which window has the focus is inconsistent.

One of the following should happen:

1.  ClickToFocus should either ignore new windows unless I click on
    them.  This means that ClickToFocus will only focus on windows
    after you click on them.  (ClickToFocusRequiresClick?)

2.  ClickToFocus should give focus to new windows and ALSO process
    Key bindings for the application window that has the focus.
    (ClickToFocusFocusesOnNewWindows?)

I can accept either of these behaviors, and I'd like it even more if I
could decide for myself which of these behaviors happens.

But the current behavior of giving a window keyboard focus, but at the
same time not accepting Key bindings for the application window is
totally confusing and is, in my opinion, a serious bug.

The FvwmConsole.pl script (from the extra modules) uses the default of 
/usr/local/bin/perl to run the script. As a result of this, a warning
message is generated during the installation of an RPM and the script can
not be run without modification... (or creating a link)

Isn't that what the configure script is for ??? ;)

It's not something that is huge bug, more a cometic problem.

Keep up the good work!

I have 'allmasquerade' turned on (for those familiar with Sendmail).  I
will probably turn it off (since I've found that it's not the best idea for
other reasons), but I really can't see why this is an issue.

Jason, I was trying to subscribe the lists from another mail account.
I sent the subscribe messages to fvwm-workers-request, fvwm-request
and fvwm-announce-request (all three @fvwm.org). The workers and
announce list worked well, but with the plain fvwm list I get an
error message back:

I tried this several times with the same result. Then I tried
sending the message to hpc.uh.edu and it worked.

I think it's a bit more friendly to the eye, but I really don't
care. But since '2.2.0' would mean to change half a dozen files
I think we can stick with '2.2'.

I had a look once, but I was overwhelmed. I'm involved with fvwm2
development since October, so I can't answer most questions. I was
always hoping Austin would hack the bugs into Jitterbug someday.
This doesn't mean I'm not willing to help here, it's just that there
are *so many* old bug reports.

Is there a way to prepare the bug database for easy inclusion into
Jitterbug (our bug tracker)? Perhaps it's possible to generate
emails per script from the Debian database. That would save us a
lot of work.

Yeah, that's what I thought when I saw about 45 outstanding bugs.

What I will try to do in the next few days is to summarise the bugs in
a report to this list, with a 2-3 line summary of each.  It is
entirely probable that the majority of bugs will have the response:
"already fixed", so they don't need sending to Jitterbug.  Any which
people are not sure about, let me know and I'll send them to
Jitterbug.  But sending 45 reports to Jitterbug will not be very
useful, I'm sure.

Not "an issue", just "a bit confusing" :).

It's fine for now but over time as the old addresses really start to
disappear, people may begin to wonder why the address is wrong.

Also, of course, when you followup to a post you'll be sending to the
uh.edu address; that will work but again, slightly confusing.

And finally, people often sort or filter mail on From: addresses like
this; they may find it slightly confusing to need a different address in
the filter than they use when they send mail.

OK, sounds good.

PS. One thing I'd like to do for 2.3 is change the files that include
    version numbers to be constructed at either build or dist time.  In
    the GNU make dist I substitute version, date, etc. info into all the
    README's, etc. at dist construction time so I never have to change
    any files except configure.in to update the version number.

If you post a list of one-liners for all these bugs I'd like to add it
to CVS (temporarily) so that the people with commit privilege can just
edit it rather than everyone posting to the list and some poor soul
having to go through the responses.

Cheers,

	Hmmm...confusion, for sure. I just tried this with a (more-or-less)
2.1.13 FVWM and Netscape 4.0.8 under Solaris 2.6, and my script diverges
from yours at Step 3: mine goes like this:

  3. Hit Meta-F4 (Key binding for Close) -- window closes. Script ends.

I'll try it at home this weekend under Linux and see whether I get any
different results.

	There was some discussion a little over a year ago about this (check
the archives around Novermber, 1997, for a subject something like
"Wandering Scope"). After 2.2, with the GSFR  in place, I think we
should add a "StricklyClicky" style. It really needs to be a style,
though, rather than global, because there are some app windows you just
naturally want go get focus as soon as they open; with others, it's just
a royal PIA.

Yes, by all means, this would be great. You miss something
too often.

Subject: crash under AIX running Netscape

Full_Name: Greg Wooledge
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: AIX 4.3.2
X_Server: PC XWare 3.0 (Win3.1)
Submission from: (NULL) (206.31.49.254)


This is consistently reproducible on my system.  Running Netscape (AIX
fileset Netscape.nav-us.rte version 4.0.0.3) under AIX 4.3.2 on a "high
node" in an SP system, and displaying on a PC running PC XWare 3.0 under
Windows 3.1, I can crash fvwm.

I do this by starting Netscape, going to http://www.google.com/ and then
clicking the "More Google" link.  The new page is displayed, and then fvwm
catches a fatal signal and dies.

I can get a not-very-promising stack trace by running fvwm under gdb on a
nearby computer:

Breakpoint 2, CatchFatal (dpy=0x2000ce68) at fvwm.c:1529
fvwm.c:1529: No such file or directory.
(gdb) bt
#0 CatchFatal (dpy=0x2000ce68) at fvwm.c:1529
#1 0xd02b0270 in ?? () from (unknown load module)
(gdb)

I can also be reached at
ic5035%tss1crs.amgreetings.com@rose.amgreetings.com (which is the AIX
machine where I'm running fvwm).

  I am have problems with growing windows.  I see it the most when I start
elvis on a remote machine.  I just had it do this 3 times in a row.  The 
window will display, refresh and be a little bigger, refresh and be a
little
bigger etc.  If I resize the window it stops.  I just tried to get it to
do
it again and nothing after 3 tries.  I see that there is a bug report of
the same thing that is marked fixed.  Did something happen to change that
in 2.1.13?  I went to 2.1.13 to fix the problem with moving windows in the
pager with the center button.

FvwmTaskbar start button stays depressed.

It might be nice to notify AndreDeBoer@hot.A2000.nl when this is fixed,
as he originally reported the problem.

I forgot this one, another undocumented function:

       QuitScreen 
               Causes fvwm to stop managing the screen on which 
               the command was issued. 

Another thing: The man page still documents WindowsDesk, although
that command is no longer available (the corresponding entry in
functions.c is commented out). The man page *does* state that
the command is obsolete, but wouldn't it be better to remove it
completely from the man page (like other obsoleted commands, 
eg TogglePage) ? The FAQ has a dictionary for fvwmrc -> fvwm2rc
translation which contains the necessary inforamtion about 
WindowsDesk.

	As I suspected, I get the same result under Linux: the binding
works - first time, every time.

	I think we need to see your whole .fvwm2rc, to see what other
settings might be interacting unhealthily with the binding.

	Well, this is certainly discouraging. We did fix several
"growing windows" bugs, and I haven't seen a recurrence of mine in
ages. But Mike's description is the classic symptom I observed when
it was happening to me.

	I didn't think so. Does anyone else have any ideas?

	(I believe Mike upgraded from 2.1.10 to 2.1.13.)  Mike - did
you observe this squirrelly behavior at all in 2.1.10 (or any other
of the 2.1.x betas)? Or did you have one of the other betas long enough
to give a definitive answer?

	I slapped elvis onto a Solaris 2.6 box, and onto my Linux box at
home, and it behaves impeccably. But I haven't been able to duplicate
your remote setup - and won't have a chance to any time soon.

	We might need to see your whole .fvwm2rc, to see if we can spot
any unusual combination of settings that might give us some idea where
to look. I don't think any of the developers has seen a growing window
in a couple of months, and we believed in good faith that the disease
was cured.

gdb doesn't handle core files under AIX 4.3.x yet.  And there's no
core file; fvwm2 exits without segfaulting, unless I set a breakpoint
as I did when I generated that stack trace.

I'll try again with one of the unreleased "testing" versions when I
get back to work (probably Monday).

Subject: Menu positioning confusion
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


The explanation of the new positioning syntax should mention that
context-rectangle reverts to the default "Mouse", if the given
value doesn't make sense (at least that is the conclusion I reached
after some experiments - without looking at the code).

You might also want to emphasize that "current menu" means
the parent menu in the case of context-rectange Menu, but means
the one being popped up in the case of the "m" modifier.

I couldn't find out what some of the special flags try to achieve.
With

AddToMenu test3
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectInPlace
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectWarp
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectInPlace, WarpTitle
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectWarp, WarpTitle

I found when directly popping up test3, the first three entries
do what I think they should do, ie the first and third place the
menu title under the cursor, the second uses the position information.
But the last two seem to behave exactly like the first one, ie
SelectInPlace seems to be ignored when used with WarpTitle.
When using test3 as a submenu, I couldn't get SelectInPlace to
work at all, all five menus appeared with the title under the cursor.

By that time I was almost completely confused and added some more
enties

+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectInPlace, SelectWarp
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectWarp, SelectInPlace
+ sub Popup sub Context 100 100  WarpTitle

and was surprised to find that the first two work like no special
flags at all, while WarpTitle alone has a quite different
effect, namely it warps the pointer to the submenu immediately, ie
before selecting the item which pops the submenu up.

So I guess I should ask you for a little essay on how these
special options are supposed to work alone and in combination.

Little things I noted while skimming over the docs:

docs/fvwm.lsm:  s/distributied/distributed/

man page:
There are a few command prototypes (ColormapFocus, Emulate,
EdgeThickness), which use [ x | y | z ] to denote a required
argument with possible values x, y or z while all others use
[ opt ] to denote an optional argument. This is inconsistent
(although it is never explicitly mentioned that [ ] means
optional args).

Popup: the command prototype has double-click-action,
but the text speaks about default-action.

Read: the "option" argument is optional, thus it should be
put in brackets in the prototype. Its occurrence in the text
should be highlighted.

SetAnimation: put the optional fractions-to-move-list in brackets

SnapAttraction: put the optional behavior in brackets. The text
mentions a "SnapGrid option". That would better be a "SnapGrid command".

UpdateDecor: put the optional decor in brackets

With the fvwm version being 2.2 now, why is the man page still
named fvwm2.1 ? :-)

Is the thought to number the version after 2.2 as 2.2.1 or 2.3?  The
latter doesn't sound very sensible -- it would represent a jump from a
three-part numbering scheme to a two-part one -- most confusing.

And if the next release (patches to 2.2?) will be 2.2.1, then it
hardly matters if the version number is 2.2.0 or 2.2, I would guess.

Any critical bugs in 2.2 that need to be fixed will be made in an
official release 2.2.1 (and 2.2.2, etc., if necessary).

In the meantime, development versions for the next real release will be
made as 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, etc.

The next official full release after 2.2 will be 2.4.

Essentially, we're following a common release numbering scheme
introduced by Linux, where odd-numbered versions are development
versions and even numbered versions are released stable versions.

While adding some shortcuts to my .fvwm2rc I was looking
for a feature in WindowList that will allow you to only
include windows which match a certain title. "*XTerm*" in
this case. 
If noone else feels the need for this feature, I'll
probably code it myself, but I fear that my version will
be pretty ugly since it was a long time since I poked
around in the fvwm2 source.

FvwmEvent's manpage incorrectly states that commands like /rsynth/say can
be
invoked by giving:

*FvwmEventCmd /rsynth/say

which is untrue, since the Cmd expression gets passed to the fvwm2 core
for
handling. Hence the correct syntax for external execution would be:

*FvwmEventCmd Exec exec /rsynth/say

I updated the manpage to reflect this. I also cleaned up things to use the
current canonical exec form, 'Exec exec'. Here's a diff -c that corrects
this:

I have PopupOffset 1 100 (as suggested in the manpage) and Animation
specified
for all my menus. If I popup a menu (A) that needs to be animated, it still
overlaps
the parent menu. This behavior persists for all menus that are narrower
than menu
A. Once I popup a wider submenu, all the narrower menus work perfectly.

Before I tell you the (rather simple) solutions to your problem
let me comment on some of these:

You're absolutely right. I'd be *very* grateful if someone would
rewrite the position hints part of the manpage. I'm unable to say
what has to be said in a simple way :(

This is absolutely useless. SelectWarp is ignored if not used
in conjunction with SelectInPlace.

> + sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectInPlace, WarpTitle

Another useless combination. You can't select a menu item
that has WarpTitle since the pointer is moved to the popup
menu as soon as you enter the menu item. Well, come to
think of it, if your popup delay is long enough you may
be able to do so.

> + sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectWarp, WarpTitle

Again, SelectWarp is (correctly) ignored here.

The solution is simple. You used 'SelectWarp,' and 'SelectInPlace,'
where you should have said 'SelectWarp' and 'SelectInPlace'. You
must not use commas to separate the options. The parser stops
reading tokens as soon as it find an option it does not understand
so not only the option with the comma is ignored but all others
after it too. This has to be changed in the future of course.

See above comment. Actually there really is no special option.

That's exactly how it's supposed to work. WarpTitle and NoWarp
are used when the submenu is mapped while the pointer is still on
the parent menu. SelectInPlace and SelectWarp are used when
you click on the menu item (i.e. when you select it).

As I said before, anyone who can improve the manpage on this
topic is very welcome. After six years studying maths I'm
sometimes unable to explain the most simple things (OK, it's
not simple, but that doesn't make it easier).

Before I tell you the (rather simple) solutions to your problem
let me comment on some of these:

You're absolutely right. I'd be *very* grateful if someone would
rewrite the position hints part of the manpage. I'm unable to say
what has to be said in a simple way :(

This is absolutely useless. SelectWarp is ignored if not used
in conjunction with SelectInPlace.

> + sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectInPlace, WarpTitle

Another useless combination. You can't select a menu item
that has WarpTitle since the pointer is moved to the popup
menu as soon as you enter the menu item. Well, come to
think of it, if your popup delay is long enough you may
be able to do so.

> + sub Popup sub Context 100 100  SelectWarp, WarpTitle

Again, SelectWarp is (correctly) ignored here.

That's exactly how it's supposed to work. WarpTitle and NoWarp

I think this is because there is no way to say 'x or y or z'
without the braces. In the standard manpage terminology you
can't say 'command x | y | z'. Is this right? How should it
look like?

I'll take care of these when 2.2 is out.

I'm not sure if we should promote fvwm from 'Executable programs'
to 'System calls' ;-)

I'm aware that not everybody had a chance to look at
the 2.2 candidate2 over the weekend. Some things have come
up in the documentation that I'm willing to ignore. So,
unless something critical is found I'd like to announce
it as 2.2.

Jason, please take care of announcing 2.2 tomorrow when
everyone had enough time to comment on candidate2. The
ANNOUNCE file is ready for posting in the package and I
trust you know where to send it (I've long lost track
myself). fvwm-2.2.candidate2.tar.gz should just be
renamed to fvwm-2.2.tar.gz before moving it to version2.
The candidate1 file should be thrown away since there
isn't a way to retrieve it from CVS anyway.

Bye

Hmm, yes. Animation moves the parent menu only until it's
unobscured. It doesn't honour the PopupOffset, and I don't
think is should. It's more a a bug in the manpage. Anyway
the passage suggesting to use 'PopupOffset' is a bit out
of date. Do you have any problems with the gradients or
did you just try if this changes something?

Hi, has anyone else noticed that inserting whitespace after the open
paren in a complex multistyle line (ButtonStyle, TitleStyle, etc.)
causes a segfault? I never noticed it before but was working on a new
.fvwm2rc (for Windoze users) from scratch and tripped this one up...
The code gets too hairy for me to follow, but it looks like at
fvwm/builtins.c:3361 fvwm2 tries to free(spec)... It's definitely
caused by the whitespace leading the block in parens.

Here's a trivially short .fvwm2rc that demonstrates the problem...
Should segfault fvwm2:

<<Clip
# Seems fvwm2 doesn't like the WS on the inside of the parens.

TitleStyle ActiveUp ( HGradient 32 NavyBlue "rgb:10/84/d0" -- flat)
Clip

Hi Dominik, everyone,

I apologize for dissappearing for awhile, I've been away.  I have a sample
fvwmrc file that shows off a little bit more of the fvwm2 options and
explains the configs line by line ... I think it would be a great addition
to 2.2... Should I forward it or is it too late for the release?

Jay

Done.  It's still in the testing directory.

By all means, post it. Adding a file is easy and can be
done without checking anything (except if the tarball still
builds of course).

I'm not entirely sure I understand the last part of the last
sentence. I don't have gradients on my menus (pixmap backgrounds), so
I don't know if there's a problem there. The issue is mostly cosmetic, 
I suppose. I'm curious as to why you think it shouldn't honor the
PopupOffset -- it's not like the variable doesn't apply in that
special case.

Ok... Here it is... attached.  It is also available at:

http://oneway.com/jay/fvwm/fvwmrc-sample-jk.tar

and a screenshot of what it looks like (on an 800x600 display)

http://oneway.com/jay/fvwm/screenshot.jpg


Please feel free to look over the comments and correct any mistakes I
might have made.  I was a little lax in menu-definition documentation..
but I think it turned out well nonetheless.

Oh.. the tarball includes 6 xpms.  (buttons and a single icon)

Any feedback you guys give would be appreciated,

'Til Later,

Jay

Sorry for the late notice on this, but I just uploaded a tarball which
contains several nice icons, mini icons, and shaped buttons for
FvwmButtons to my tripod account.

It also includes a README file that explains in great length how to use
these icons.

Please proof the README and make sure I didn't mess anything up! :)


you can find the tarball at:

  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/fvwmiconpack-pat.tgz

and a preview image at:

  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/fvwmiconpack-pat.gif


I hoped this could make it into the 2.2 distribution, but I'ts my fault
for not getting it out sooner!

Enjoy!

Looking at the Manpage ColormapFocus is the only one I see that uses

I've trimmed the  reply list  to just  fvwm-workers, and the  original
reporter.

If I'm  not mistaken, the logic  in fvwm/fvwm.c  SigDone() only passes
the "-s" argument into the  restarted fvwm2.  Since the "-f"  argument
is not passed along, "Restart" is doomed not to work.

Am  I  missing something?  Wouldn't  restarting  trying to  use "-cmd"
suffer the same fate?

In Paul's case, copying or linking /home/ahplop/fvwm/fvwm2rc to
~/.fvwm2rc is a workaround.

I use -cmd to run FvwmM4 and pass it a ton of args and in my rc
is just do
Restart <path>/fvwm2
and everything gets parsed and I since i give M4 -debug I do get 
another fvwmrc$@#$!@!#$ in /tmp so I know it is running m4

If you don't have gradients I wonder why you use
PopupOffset 1 100 at all. Excerpt from the manpage:

    If you encounter performance problems with gradient
    backgrounds you can try one or all of  the  follow
    ing:

    ...

    Make sure submenus do not overlap the parent  menu.
    This  can  prevent menus being redrawn every time a
    submenu pops up or down.


         MenuStyle <stylename> PopupOffset 1 100

Well, it has to be honoured if your PopupOffset makes your menus
overlapping by default. But what would you do if you use
'PopupOffset 50 100'. Surely you wouldn't want the parent menu
animated when the gap is only 25 pixels instead of 50? I've
optimised the code to do no unnecessary animation (e.g. if the menus
overlap only a few pixels) since it takes time.

Now I fix a few manpage problems. Th third candidate
will be ready in half an hour or so. Jason, please
proceed with candidate3 as agreed for the last one
(i.e. *ANNOUNCE IT*).

Bye

Dominik

P.S.: Dan, you forgot to update the Makefile.am when
you added that side pixmap. It wasn't in the tarball.

When I installed canidate2, then killed and restarted fvwm2, the mouse
postion moved diagonally toward the south-east position of the screen be
several inches. When I restart fvwm2 with the cursor less then those several
inches from the south-east corner, I come up in the wrong virtual window.

The same thing happens when I "restart fvwm2" from the menu.

An annoying little bug.

FYI,
Randall

hmm... good point... Well, it's for "personal use", right?

Yeah, that icon's gone.

Say, if anyone has the original of my netscape4.xpm, I'd be very
appreciative if you'd email it to me!  Thanks :)

Oops, I had just uploaded candidate3 when I got this. Paul,
it's your turn now. I've to go shopping now before the shops
shut. If you think the changes should be in 2.2, please make
the package fvwm-2.2.candidate4.tar.gz now. If not, just inform
us of your decision so Jason knows if he can announce candidate3
or not. I want it out this very evening. BTW, please tag your
changes as version-2_2 and as version-2_2_0.

Bye

Dominik

Sorry.  Just noticed them.

The only one I think is important is the new version.html.  The old one
really wasn't right at all.

And, it doesn't matter to me if it goes into the tarball, as long as the
new one is the one that Jason gets up on the web.

Subject: modifiers, locks and mouse/key bindings

Full_Name: Benoit TRIQUET
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: linux 2.0.34 (rh 5.1)
X_Server: xfree86 3.3.3.1
Submission from: (NULL) (216.100.248.201)


I finally found why my window buttons would stop working after "some time",
and why
windows couldn't be activated when using click to focus.
Actually "some time" is "once i have engaged num lock".
It seems to me that locks shouldn't be taken into account when matching
mouse or key
bindings, or checking for focus change.
I have little knowldedge in X or xf86, but it seems there is no practical
way to
know which modifiers are actually locks. And patching fvwm/events.c to
remove Mod2
through Mod5 from the used_mods mask is not very machine-independent.
So i wrote a new fvwm command, ModifierLocks. Here is my addition to the
manpage :

     ModifierLocks [Modifiers]
              Tells  FVWM  which modifiers are actually locks and
              hence should be ignored when matching Mouse or  Key
              bindings (if any binding actually have one of those
              modifiers, they will never be matched).

              Modifiers has the same syntax as in  the  Mouse  or
              Key  bindings,  with the addition of L meaning caps
              lock. The default is L25 (this  means  ignore  caps
              lock, num lock and scroll lock for XFree86).  Modi-
              fiers can be  omitted,  meaning  no  modifiers  are
              locks.

here are the context diffs for the stock 2.1.10 tgz archive i got from
your
web site :

Sorry for the delay in answering this; I've been out of commission for
a while with a terrible cold/flu combination.

I've seen this behavior on both my Digital Unix system as well as my
home Linux system.  I'll send a copy of the relevant parts of my
.fvwm2rc files and the version numbers of Netscape (4.5-something) that
I am using on each platform ASAP.

BTW, Dom, I'm seeing some interesting things regarding your email
addresses.  On an earlier message I forgot to trim out additional CCs and
sent a message to dominik_vogt@gmx.de.  It bounced (user unknown):

In the logs for the primary MX for fvwm.org, I see several of the following:

Feb 21 19:17:54 karazm sendmail[25892]: TAA25892: ruleset=check_mail, arg1=<avatar@DarkSun.planet-interkom.de>, relay=[195.182.114.13], reject=501 <avatar@DarkSun.planet-interkom.de>... Sender domain must exist

Is that you?  Don't put non-resolving addresses as your envelope sender;
most modern MTAs will reject the messages and if I actually ever finish
upgrading all of the servers, you won't be able to send any mail at all to
the FVWM lists (which would be a bad thing).

Host not found.

XYX:karazm:/var/log> host -a planet-interkom.de 
Trying null domain

The following answer is not authoritative:

Using domain server:

So it's really not in DNS anywhere, even on the primary nameserver for your
domain.

OK, a last (!?!?) candidate tar file is available in incoming.

This is identical to candidate3 except for some updates to the AUTHORS
file (new mailing list addr), and the download.html, version.html, and
index.html.  I changed the order of the download links in the first two,
and I added a 2.2 announce blurb to the homepage (index.html).

I did a diff between c3 and c4 and there are no significant differences
except for the above.

I moved the version-2_2 and version-2_2_0 tags appropriately.

As far as I'm concerned, this one's a go.  Anyone else? :)

PS. It turns out version.html it vestigal.  I can find no reference to
    it in any of the other HTML pages; it should be removed (post-2.2).

I still say its a go.  I see little point in waiting any longer.

I wonder how they managed to use autoconf 2.12?  We have some stuff in
configure.in that requires 2.13.

automake 1.4 isn't so important: we moved there mainly to fix a bug with
the "make install-strip" rule... but unfortunately it only partially
fixed the problem.  Still, it's better.

Anyway, you can easily avoid this by using the --exclude option to GNU
diff to tell it to ignore all the Makefile.in's, configure, etc.:

  $ diff -r --exclude=Makefile.in --exclude=configure fvwm-old fvwm-new

or whatever.

I think this is an autoconf version difference.

I assume you mean in the readline lib check.  The latest configure.in's
test for _both_ termcap and ncurses so you should be able to ignore this
change.

Yes, that change seems wrong to me, too.

Not sure.  Someone will have to go look at the FvwmIdent code to find

There's a man page FvwmGoodStuff in the extras/FvwmGoodStuff directory.

Possibly; we should take a look.

I disagree that fvwm should ignore the locking modifiers. They are
defined to be modifiers and should be treated as such. On the other
hand this causes so much confusion that a command to configure this
might help quite a few people. The command in your patch should be
renamed to IgnoreModifiers. The description in the manpage has to
be modified too (it shouldn't talk about 'locking').

I don't think meta and modifier 1 are necessarily the same. Correct?

Should be 'unsigned int ignore_modifiers_mask;' then.

F_IGNORE_MODIFIERS ?

Heck! Yes, that's me. So this is the reason why I can't send to fvwm.org
from home. This should be dominik.vogt@planet-interkom.de. 'avatar' is my
login name and 'DarkSun' the hostname of my machine. I've no idea why
these are used when I send to fvwm.org. This seems to work when I send
to hpc.uh.edu. Any hints what I have to change here? Is it some
misconfiguration in sendmail.cf? I'm rather helpless here, never tried
to configure anything related to email.

Of course. This can't work. Nobody knows my hostname.

Something that has always bothered me: I have this
function bound to my window titles:

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
   + "Click"         Raise
   + "Motion"        Raise
   + "Motion"        Move

Why does the pointer change to the move cursor when I click
on a title and hold it down? I haven't moved the mouse so
why is it interpreted as a motion? It could still be a
click or even a double click. Is there anything I didn't
consider? If not that will probably be my first patch in
2.3.x 8-)

Bye

Well thanks for pointing that out now that ones going to bother me too
:) If you watch carefully you'll notice your cursor goes from a circle
(Raise) to the move cursor, this suggests that both of us either have
shacky hands and sensitive mice or that somewhere in the descision to
say the mouse is in moition there is some time out.  No real help here
just thought I would commiserate.

Besides doesn't it feel could that that the only thing you need to worry
about is that your cursor isn't quite right when you hold it down for a
while?

Of course, if someone wants to  ignore modifiers, xmodmap is the right
tool to use.  I don't think the patch is the right way to go.

Oh, it's surely not my shaky hand since I use a trackball and can
press any button without any risk to move the pointer. I've looked
into the code (IsClick function in complex.c): The 'Scr.ClickTime'
is used here. So if you hold the button down long enough is assumes
it cannot be a click anymore. In a function the has only 'click' and
'motion' actions the code assumes it has to be 'motion' now.

Could you rephrase that please? Either my English isn't good enough
or you didn't write what you were thinking ;-)

> about is that your cursor isn't quite right when you hold it down for a
> while?

If you wanted to ask if it was only the mouse cursor that bothers
me then the answer is no. The 'move' is really initiated (I get
the move feedback window too). And there is no reason why the
decision between click and motion has to be made at this point. I
may still either start moving or just release the button. It can
become really bothersome with a small ClickTime.

Yor're right, of course. We should write a short explanation in the FAQ
on how to do this (there already is a question about this, but only
a rather unhelpful answer).

I think we're already starting to lose our resolve a bit here :)

We just had button-close.xpm, button-horiz.xpm, etc. added to the icons
directory, and to me those look like mini-icons and should be
"mini.something.xpm" by our naming convention... right?  If not, what's
the distinction being made here?

Post 2.2 we should clean out the icons directory and merge as many of
the fvwm95 icons as we think are interesting, esp. the miniicons.  Also,
some of the existing ones can be removed, I think.  We don't want to
provide the be-all, end-all icon library, we want to provide a suite of
basic window-manager-y icons; things you'd see on window buttons, button
bars, side pixmaps, etc.

For example, is world.xpm something we really want to see distributed
with fvwm?

Also, we have a few dups.  Do we really need _both_ mini.bomb.xpm and
mini.destroy.xpm?  And there are a few more bombs, too.  Etc.

We can add some pointers to other archives of pixmaps, like AIcons,
etc.  And if/when the themes stuff takes off, they can either include
their own pixmaps or reference where they can be found.

Looks like we have a quorum on candidate4 as the official fvwm-2.2!

Jason, when you get a chance you can rename and move it appropriately,
and install the newest web pages.  I don't remember who took on which
tasks for announcing, but if it wasn't Jason then let the list know when
things are set up and folks can start spreading the word.

And, hey, big congratulations to all involved!  I think we done good!

I'm off to start installing it all over here :)

Yes, I know. The reason I didn't rename them was that they are even
smaller than 'mini' (which usually is 16x16 pixels). I didn't want
to start a discussion about that for 2.2 anymore.

Yes, agreed.

If someone were going to ask me: I have *so many* icon packages on my
machine/distribution. I can live comfortably without most of them. I
need no icons at all in the fvwm distribution.

Congratulations to you all on a really nice job in getting a new version
of fvwm2 together!  Though I'm not very active with fvwm2 development
now (due to Scwm), I'm glad to see it improving.  Candidate4 built for
me w/o any problems.  I'm now more convinced that there'll always be an
important place for fvwm2 (and that trying to merge fvwm2 and Scwm
would've been a mistake) as I'm now stuck using a heavily-loaded older
box across a network and Scwm is a bit too unresponsive to use
pleasantly.  I'm back to fvwm2 until my computing setup improves to
mid-90s power!

Thanks for keeping a good wm going.  My fvwm-workers entry for the
AUTHORS file is below (mostly written by grep-ping for me in the NEWS
file, and looking for my comments in the source).

Greg J. Badros:
Substantial rewrite of fvwm2.0 menuing code to support arbitrary depth
menus, animated menus, Win95 look, better logically-based shortcut keys,
auto-splitting of long menus, check for re-used hot-keys, integrated
LEFT_MENUS option.  Added primitives: animated-moves, SetEnv, fix to
Echo. Improve modules: Make FvwmM4 pass args on to m4, font-related
seg-fault bug fix in FvwmButtons


Thanks,
Greg

Now that the 2.2 announcement is imminent (heck, I'm
going to stay awake until I see it - it's past 2am
already) I want to thank everybody on the workers list
and especially my co-maintainers Dan, Tim, Bob, Paul,
Steve and - of course - Jason for all the help and
encouragement, energy and all the hard (and excellent)
work.

Back in October when Brady was forced to quit his job
I believed fvwm would gradually fall into oblivion
(at least for a brief moment). I knew little about fvwm
when I took up responibilities for this release and
still the list accepted me. I think very highly of
all of you for this.

Well, after only two months we got things straight
and running smoothly and since then I think of myself
merely as a member of the team without a special role
and I'm happy because I know, if I drop dead now fvwm
will live on.

And now, only four months after the lowest low we're
ready to release the best fvwm ever. Wow, I'm so
excited!

Bye

Dominik

No worries your english is fine, its just that american "edumacation o
mine" that keeps me from proofreading. I was shooting for: " Besides
doesn't it feel good, that the only thing you need to worry ..." (could,
good its all the same word if you think it fast enough)

It is even worse if you start using the vnc viewer (gives a second x
server that you can run as an xwindow on any other display) over a 14.4
modem and don't want any screen redraws that you didn't really want.  I
was going to take a look in the source but it sounds like you already
have a handle on the problem so have fun and I'll be glad to test when
you are done.  But first but your feet up, play with the cats and relax
for a while.

Dom, you're insane.  Unfortunately I decided to leave work and go buy a
pile of CDs before I saw that we're sure that everything's final, so I'm
just now getting back to the computer.  Anywhere, here goes.

In an ideal world, all software would come with at least a "normal" size
icon and a mini-icon.  Then we could do away with most of the current
fvwm icons and just distribute a collection of "window-manager-y" icons
(window border buttons, side pixmaps, etc.)

As it is, though, I think it's appropriate for fvwm to come with a wide
range of "application icons", too.  However, we don't need a huge
selection in any given application category: a couple of editor icons;
one calculator icon is plenty; a variety of terminal icons is nice (but
that BSD icon we have is really bad! ;), etc.  Also, we seem to have a
few styles of min/max/move/etc. pixmaps.  I must confess some of those,
to my eye, look kind of ... cheezy :).

If we can come up with a nice new logo, some of the existing "fvwm"
pixmaps should be punted, too: how many do we need, really?

At any rate, we at least need enough icons to provide for our nice set
of sample config files, right? :)

Recently we were discussing the organization of the fvwm2.1 man page,
ensuring that the commands were correctly listed alphabetically.

I've been thinking about this, and I think this is a bad way to structure
the fvwm2 man page, and it should be reworked completely.

As it is, it's much too confusing and difficult to find the things you
need.  The commands aren't named such that they naturally group together
the way you'd like (and why should they be?)  For example, the menu
handing commands AddToMenu, DestroyMenu, MenuStyle, ChangeMenuStyle, Menu,
and Popup (?) are scattered all over the place.  Searching man pages is
usually a tedious process of text-based search, and it can take a while.

I think the man page should be rewritten to organize the config commands
into related _sections_.  For example, we can have a section "MENUS" that
introduces the concept of menus, describes how to create/destroy them,
introduces the idea of a menu style and describes how to manage and apply
them.  We also could have sections on "WINDOW DECORATION", "MOUSE/KEY
BINDING",
"RUNNING PROGRAMS/MODULES", etc.  I don't know all the best categories and
some things will be hard to categorize; we'll definitely need a few
iterations.
And probably a "MISC" category :).

But, I think an arrangement like this would make it significantly easier
for
users to understand and create configuration files.

This came up on the worker's list in reference to FvwmForm a few months
ago.  I wanted to get it written down so we wouldn't forget it.

Something that I think would be a great help for simplifying configuration
of FVWM and giving it a professional, consistent look is the need for
a "global style"; I call it FVWMStyle.  There would be only one, and it's
not immediately clear exactly what kind of options it would have.

_Ceertainly_ it would have at least a foreground color, background color,
and font.  Maybe there would be some kind of "highlight color", maybe
a pixmap tile or gradient.  Maybe some other stuff.

The idea would be that fvwm itself and _all_ its modules would use these
style values wherever possible, unless the user overrode them explicitly.
So, for example, all the modules would use the same foreground,
background,
and font--and this is trivially changed just by changing the global
FVWMStyle.

Obviously all the modules would keep their individual configuration
options; this would in effect replace all the "default" values currently
hardcoded in various modules, and make it easy to create a unified
"theme" to the desktop, at least on a very basic level.  We may need some
new module operations or module command-line options.

There're lots of places to go with this (maybe we _do_ want multiple
"global styles", then you can say this FvwmForm, FvwmWinList, and set
of menus should use one "global style", while these should use another,
for example), but I wanted to get it written down so people can start
thinking about it.

Am I being dense? What's wrong with increasing your ClickTime to a
"reasonably" large value? What you describe is exactly what ClickTime
is for, isn't it?

I'm currently downloading the 2.2 source which I'll merge my GNOME patch
in with.  It currently supports the GNOME pager and root menu clicks.
Session management and layers are still pending, but I remember seeing a
patch for layers posted to this list about a month ago, if an update of
that patch is available it would make my life easier.

Regards,
Jay

Jay, I posted the layers and session management (and some more) patches. 
Give me a few days and I'll repost updated versions of my stuff.

I can vaguely remember that both Paul (PDS) and Steve had
ambitions to become the 'pumpking' one day. I will be
happy with any. Of course there are no reasons why Dan,
Tim or Bob shouldn't be it either. So who wants the job?

I have changed the version number in configure.in to 2.3.0.
With the code freeze past we can start to make up all the
patches from the last months. Let the work begin :)

Not really. I rarely go to bed before 3am and during a holiday
like now it's often 5am or later. BTW, I didn't stay awake.

No that's fine. Someone has to stay level-headed when all others
(OK, perhaps it's only me) go into a frenzy

Whew! It's hard to believe it's really out. Congratulations and thanks
to all who participated, and especially (though he shuns being singled
out) to our erstwhile Pumpking! Enjoy a well-earned break, Dom!

	We never actually decided who would notify whom...though I think the
word is getting around without our doing anything special.

	Jason, what will you be doing, as far as notifying 3rd parties -
Freshmeat, etc.? Or should we just wait and see how many hours it takes
for an item to show up on Freshmeat all by itself?

	Do you want to handle uploading to Sunsite, or shall I?


- Bob

I'm not paying close attention,  but I'm getting the impression  there
is some  relationship between Jay's Gnome  work, and Matthias's layers
and session work.

The unfinished business  I referred to in the  subject line has  to do
with post 2.2 development.  I vaguely remember  someone saying that we
would be granting more CVS update access after 2.2 shipped.

I think we have at least 2 likely candidates.

In my  opinion, this should not a  an exclusive  club.  The current 5?
updaters is not nearly enough.  Any other opinions?

A while ago, I  happened to look thru  some old fvwm e-mails including
Brady's announcement, followed by the "You have to  hit me pretty hard
before I quit" thread and the events that ensued.

And now Greg comes up with this...

This has to   be the most  rewarding software  project I've  ever been
involved  in.   Its just plain  overwhelming.  My   thanks to EVERYONE
involved.

Oh, oh.  Let's squelch this rumour right now.  

Way back last autumn, I was agitating to get the sources autoconfiscated
sooner rather than later.  In that context, I may have offered to be
pumpking temporarily.  Since fvwm is autoconfigurable now, and I have no
ambitions beyond portability & stability, I do *not* wish to be pumpking. 

As I recall, the idea is that a concrete goal for the next release is set,
and the pumpking is there to make editorial decisions, especially when a
code freeze is nearing.  So perhaps the first thing to do is kick around
goal ideas? 

For me, the major goals in the near future are related to portability
fixes, and rationalising the distribution: 

	* remove auto*-built files from CVS
	* remove modules/extras distinction
	* remove icons to a separate distribution
	* move code duplicated in many modules into a library
	* experiment with shared library for libfvwm

	I'd say there's a good case to be made for it. I don't know who will
next accept the Pumpking mantle, but I think most of us probably have
our own pet modifications we'd like to be working on rather than
fielding version after version of test patches that the patch developers
themselves are quite competent to apply via CVS - unless they're unable
to access CVS because of a firewall.

Hiya all!

As promised, here is a very brief summary of all currently open Debian
reports against the FVWM software.  I have even Debian specific ones
for my sake.  If you have any knowledge about the status of any of
these "bugs", please let me know by (personal) email.  My intention is
to report back to this list in a few days time listing just those bugs
which are apparently still relevant, with the intention of then
submitting them to Jitterbug.  (It just seems unhelpful to submit 45
bugs, mostly irrelevant, at this point.)  Even comments such as "This
is not part of FVWM itself" would be really helpful to me, and
therefore ultimately to us all.  Every report is preceded by its
Debian number; please use this when replying back to me as otherwise I
won't know what you're talking about ;-)  My intention is to gradually
work through the remaining bugs over the next few weeks to see which
ones are reproducible in version 2.2 and close those which aren't.
But if there are 20 fewer bugs to test, it'll be much easier!!

Also, some of these bugs are *very* old, so may no longer even make
sense.  That's OK, too.  More details on individual bugs can be found
on the bug tracking system; the relevant URI is given at the beginning
of each section.

And I'm now working my way through the Xlib manual, so I'll be even
more constructive soon 8-).

Thanks for everyone's help!

   Julian

P.S. This took ages to compile -- whew!!

P.P.S. There are some great examples of crazy .fvwm2rc's hanging
around there: one was created by a Perl script, and another was
created by the C preprocessor!!

11835  (Debian local bug)

16142  GoodStuff problems: (1) If GoodStuff was running when FVWM
       exited, then FVWM doesn't restart properly; (2) if X is exited
       with ctl-alt-bksp, then GoodStuff doesn't die & eats all CPU

Open Debian bug reports against fvwm 2.x
========================================
(http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm2.html)

Normal bugs outstanding
-----------------------

 5736  "Restart  /usr/bin/X11/afterstep" with two spaces doesn't
       work. 

10862  Window order messed up on restarting fvwm; patch available
       (already forwarded?)

11174  Bizarre bug involving a window changing title as fvwmbuttons
       becomes active causing the latter to crash.  You just have to
       see the bug report for full details.

11355  Want some MiniIcon lines in example config file.

11356  Iconified programs ignore TitleStyle, so colours may lead to
       unreadable titles on icons.

11463  Race condition in IconBox: if box window is created after icon,
       then icon ends up out of box, e.g., after restarting fvwm.

11824a Give focus to a window (Sloppy focus) and immediately call up a
       menu in window => menu ends up buried as main window gains
       focus (FvwmAuto too slow or something?).

11824b Want FvwmPager configurable so can click left-mouse once to
       both change viewport and focus.

11845  FvwmAuto and unclutter don't run when called from init.hook or
       init-restart.hook.

11861  (Debian specific)

11886a Sometimes the pager does not display a mapped window until it
       is moved.

11886b Sometimes iconifying programs leads to the icon being mapped
       only very briefly and then disappearing.  (??)

11886c RaiseLower sometimes lowers not fully-raised windows instead of
       raising them.

14163  When moving a window far enough to make the desktop view move,
       it starts flickering in its original position.

14172  Starting elvis in X caused fvwm2 to fail with BadWindow and
       BadDrawable errors in X_DestroyWindow and X_CopyArea requests.

16143  Apparent interaction between WinList and having handles/
       non-zero BorderWidth causes WinList to drift.

18576  FvwmButtons doesn't exit and eats all processor time when
       leaving X with ctl-alt-bksp.  (Similar to 16142 in fvwm1?)

20444  Restarting fvwm seems to shift some windows slightly; perhaps
       to do with miscalculating the save set?  Something to do with
       non-zero border width?

20831  Pager balloon patch: shows balloons when over a window in the
       pager.  (Wishlist; patch included.)

22102  Various config problems, eg can't configure colours of title of
       window with input focus in WinList -- appropriate option has no
       effect.

22286  Problems with colourful menu icons on an 8-bit display; should
       fvwm2 be responsible for filtering them to a small colour set?

24135  (Debian specific)

25751  see #25417

32796  (Debian specific, I think)

32939  (Debian specific)

33109  (Debian specific)


Wishlist items - outstanding
----------------------------

18003  Irregularities for key bindings for Tab etc; C-M-Tab doesn't
       seem to work properly; want Mouse 2 I A Iconify in
       system.fvwm2rc; what happened to C/M-<arrow key>?  (Debian specific?)

21097  Gravity patch for IconBox wanted in main fvwm2.

32795  FvwmPager should be started before user's post.hook in
       system.fvwm2rc.  (Debian specific?)

32923  WindowOps menu should display key bindings (pseudo-patch
       included)


Normal bugs - forwarded to fvwm-workers (!)
-------------------------------------------

 8774  WindowList shouldn't behave same way as other windows(?) in
       respect to resources such as *scratch*.  (I don't quite
       understand this one yet.)

 8785  FVWM unaware of ability to drag windows around by using their
       static areas if they are Athena widgets.

 8954  FvwmPager should allow windows to be moved in it => windows
       moving in main window.  Also, could wordwrap titles in Pager.

 9769  ClickToFocus and SkipMapping don't interact properly.

14791  MenuStyle should default to fvwm, not mwm.  The behaviour of
       menus at the right side of the screen could do with
       improvement.

16040  PipeRead problems: should set env vars and should search for
       missing files in standard places.

21547  Root menu bound to button with "Mouse 0 3 A Menu /Debian Nop",
       but then submenus' positions depend on where button clicked --
       may end up too far left/right.  Only problem with MWM style?

23759  MWMButtons and MWMDecorMax don't work together properly.


Wishlist items - forwarded to fvwm-workers (!)
----------------------------------------------

25601  Would like a possibility of keyboard mouse button emulation.

27276  Internationalisation patch (included) -- from fvwm-users-jp
       mailing list.

The CVS club should absolutely *not* be exclusive.  I think the consensus
was something along the lines of, "you can get CVS write access by
continually posting good patches to the list."  

This begs the question of how to evaluate the "goodness" of the patches. 
I suppose that would be done by the current CVS writers.  I haven't been
paying attention to the patches in question, so I can't make any comment
on that.

My feeling is that if we trust you to write to the CVS repository, we
should also trust your judgement about giving others commit access.

Log message:
Bug #117: InitFunction called too early.  It used to be called after the
first Read/ReadPipe (which meant "fvwm2 -cmd FvwmBanner" would hang).
Now it waits until all reads and modules started by the command line
have finished before doing the initial capture.  This should fix the
problems with reading multiple config files not getting the style right until
a Recapture.  A timeout is provided in case a module is started that creates
a window.

These should be gone; GoodStuff doesn't exist anymore, and while
FvwmButtons (its replacement) had some similar-sounding issues I believe
we've solved all those problems.

  jg> 10862  Window order messed up on restarting fvwm; patch available
  jg>        (already forwarded?)

This is fixed in 2.2.

  jg> 11824a Give focus to a window (Sloppy focus) and immediately call up a
  jg>        menu in window => menu ends up buried as main window gains
  jg>        focus (FvwmAuto too slow or something?).

I believe some changes were made to 2.2 to alleviate this.  Not sure
there's much that can be done to solve it 100% if you're using FvwmAuto
(like I do), but it should be much better in 2.2.

  jg> 18576  FvwmButtons doesn't exit and eats all processor time when
  jg>        leaving X with ctl-alt-bksp.  (Similar to 16142 in fvwm1?)

I think this is fixed.

  jg> 20444  Restarting fvwm seems to shift some windows slightly; perhaps
  jg>        to do with miscalculating the save set?  Something to do with
  jg>        non-zero border width?

Good lord, I hope this is fixed but I suspect there may still be some
shifting probs lurking :(.

  jg> 20831  Pager balloon patch: shows balloons when over a window in the
  jg>        pager.  (Wishlist; patch included.)

This is in 2.2.

  jg> 22286  Problems with colourful menu icons on an 8-bit display; should
  jg>        fvwm2 be responsible for filtering them to a small colour set?

You can specify ColorLimit in your config file in 2.2, to do exactly this.

  jg> 14791  MenuStyle should default to fvwm, not mwm.  The behaviour of
  jg>        menus at the right side of the screen could do with
  jg>        improvement.

I think the latter improvements are done.

  jg> 11495  All sorts of copyright problems which need to be addressed.

I believe this has been done (thanks Dominik!)  See the COPYING file in
the root directory of the fvwm 2.2 dist.

I think a lot of the other problems are also fixed, but I leave it up to
others more knowledgeable to comment further.

Let's make this one a new thread.

	Paul's suggestions:

>  * remove icons to a separate distribution
>  * move code duplicated in many modules into a library

	Some of mine:

	* Turn on the GSFR code and fix whatever it breaks.
	* Evaluate the backlog of new style ideas.
	* Add animated windowshade.
	* Reuse FvwmWindow struct on Recapture.
	* The GNOME hint stuff.

	Sorry, Steve...got in too big a hurry. Of course, it's a minor miracle

One thing I'd like to see for the next version is another quick release
cycle.  I think the user community would still like to see rapid
improvements and another official release sooner rather than later, to
give them warm-fuzzies that fvwm is _really_ under active development,
and the last version wasn't just a fluke.

Obviously not like a month or something, but say 4-6 mos.?  Sometime
this summer?

We might examine the list of "big features" for 2.4 with this in mind.

Thoughts?

	All the reported instances I know of should be corrected by the fix (in
2.2) to keep FVWM from raising FVWM-managed windows above
override_redirect windows.

	There are. Position the pager exactly in the lower right hand corner of
the screen, do a few restarts, and watch it wander upward and leftward.

This graphs traffic, not hits.  Of course, very little is actually served

anything useful.  The spike after midnight is the backup.

That was the case.  I think that at least Matthias' patches have been of
quite high quality; I haven't read over Jay's patches.  (Or have we only
seen work on fvwm1 from Jay).

Matthias seems to me like a code hackin' fool; I think it would benefit the
laziness of others greatly if we gave him access and let him do all of the

Exactly. You lot did it to me (and you will pay for it 8-) so I think we
should inflict CVS access on him (and Chris Rankin).

I think three months is about the minimum you can do and not exhaust your
developers.  (Immediate pre-release 'crunch time' is stressful.)  The key
is to limit the work to what you can do in that time.  This is what the
Linux kernel folks don't seem to understand.  Six months is a fair figure.

Important to this is keeping the stable branch stable (i.e. bug fixes
only).  If there is a lot of pressure to backport things, the release cycle
is too long.

However: I would like to suggest that there are two things that are
"necessary" (my opinion, probably not yours) for continued "popularity" of
fvwm.  I feel that these are important enough to alter the common notion of
a release cycle:

  Gnome support (hints and session management)
  KDE support (ditto)

Why?  Gnome at least needs a lightweight to alternative to Enlightenment; I
see icewm filling that gap if fvwm doesn't make the next RedHat release.  I
think it's an important goal for fvwm to have Gnome support by the time
RedHat 6 freezes even if that means that other things are stalled until
it's done.  If Debian has plans for a desktop then we should try to meet
them now.  It doesn't really matter if it comes in 2.2.x or 2.4.

Keep in mind the push by the Gnome developers and the Mexican government to
get Gnome on some huge number of small machines in schools in the near
future.  I don't know if they've already decided what WM to use, but what a
crowning achievement it would be if they used fvwm!

As for KDE, this is more vague to me but I know many folks like KDE but
detest kwm.  Some WM (Blackbox, I think) already has KDE support.  I don't
know what's required here, but it would be nice if fvwm was an alternative
here, too.

One other thing that folks seem to want is themes; I admit to not being big
on flash so I can't say whether this is seriously important.  I have a
feeling that we can get themes just by suggesting a default config file
structure and not changing much code at all.

Word gets around fine; freshmeat at least just gets the announcement from
fvwm-announce.

I find it better from a load-balancing perspective at least to let the news
travel on its own.  If it hits everywhere at once there's more chance of a
crunch.

BW> Jason, what will you be doing, as far as notifying 3rd parties -

I didn't have to do anything; they've already picked it up.  Remember that
some folks at least get their jollies by reporting news like this so they
can do it even faster than I can.

BW> Do you want to handle uploading to Sunsite, or shall I?

Go ahead; I can't say that I remember where to put it.

OK but... someone needs to take explicit control of the newsgroup
announces:

  comp.os.linux.announce
  comp.windows.x.announce
  comp.os.linux.x
  comp.windows.x.misc
  comp.windows.x.i386unix (?)

Those aren't like freshmeat, etc.; probably no one will forward the
announce there, expecting someone official to do it.

I think I can afford the luxury of *not* thinking about it
in the next two weeks :) One thing I want to be considered
is the large number of outstanding patches and bugfixes that
have queued up.

I hope you can present me a list of goals that has been
agreed upon when I'm back.

All valid. One addition:

All 'multiple whitespace' bugs should be fixed. Close this bug and
wait for it to reappear (I do not believe that will happen).

I doubt this one is still valid. I can't reproduce it myself.
FvwmAuto can't raise windows while a menu is up with the current
code.

Yes!! We need that!

Seems to be outdated. FvwmRearrange works fine in the RestartFunction.
Perhaps a Debian specific issue? Fvwm2 does not use these 'hooks'.

I've never seen that.

Fixed. This occured when only a part of the border/title was obscured.

I think this is fixed, but ask our WinList experts here.

Should be fixed with 'ColorLimit' command.

Close this bug report as fixed. There has been so much
trouble with bindings that nobody can tell you what has
been fixed and what has not.

Probably debian specific. What's a 'post.hook'?

Key bindings can be displayed. If this is a problem it is a
Debian issue.

Neither do I. Please tell us when you understand it.

Hmm, if this is about being able to drop windows into the pager
then the answer is not, not in the code at the moment. Of course
you can move windows in the pager. Word wrapping is clearly an
enhancement request.

	I think this is the old request to have the pager window icon updated
in real time as you drag the window that it represents on the desktop. I
believe it used to do this, and somewhere along the line the feature was
removed; I don't know why. Frankly, I could probably do without the
extra overhead of this feature, so, if it's reinstated, I think it
should be an option. In any case, I'd call it an enhancement request,
not a bug.

It might be nice if there was a link to fvwm-2.2.tar.gz at the "top
level" of the ftp site:

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.tar.gz

That way people don't have to search through all the beta releases in
the version-2 directory to find it (if they use ftp and not the web
link).

I feel that I have no right to voice my opinion as I have contributed nothing
but a couple of found bugs, but I do have a large user base (somewhere between
200 and 500 users at least), so here it goes.

A large majority of users would like to have some type of GUI interface with the
window manager where by they can change settings and see the results
immediately.  Something like the animation form.

Instead of just having one controlling file, why not have fvwm2 and it's modules
use separate controlling files.  What I do for most of my users is have a
directory called $HOME/.fvwm2 and in this directory I have files named for the
module or task.  maybe it would be best if I showed you an "ls" of my
$HOME/.fvwm2 directory:

Audio                   Identify                Wharf
Backgrounds             KeyStyles               WinList
ButtonStyles            MouseStyles             lab-forms
Functions               Pager                  [menus]
Fvwm2-menus             Styles                  misc-forms
FvwmButtons             TaskBar                 pss-forms
IconBox                 TitleStyles             restart-menu.form

Each file then has an associated "read" (except for FvwmButtons) in my
".fvwm2rc"

If fvwm2 used some type of structure like this, all controlling files located in
one sub directory (not individual "dot" files under the users $HOME) then this
might make it easier to have some type of GUI interface with fvwm2 that could
run the appropriate destroy or kill the old settings and restart or add the
requested changes.

I am not very knowledgeable about these type of things and I don't know if
something like this is even possible, but it sure would be nice to able to bring
up a form/menu/some-type-of-GUI and make changes on the fly, sort of like (I am
very sorry for mentioning it here) AfterStep.


98% of my users are still using fvwm-2.0.45, I have been installing a private
copy of the development stream to test things.  The one problem I am having is
that fvwm-2.0.45's module FvwmBacker used a construct like this:

	*FvwmBackerDesk 0 xpmroot /home/misha21/icon/bg/spacebg.xpm

Now fvwm-2.2's FvwmBacker module needs at least an Exec after the desk number.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I can update my users files so the
upgrade in version will be seamless?  I could create a front end script that
could look for the use of that module and then edit the users files before
invoking fvwm2, but I was hoping for something different then that.

I would also like to send a big "Thank You" to all the developers who have taken
the time to make fvwm2 the window manager of choice and quality.

I made that link, but I actually want to restructure the site a bit.
Having version-1 and version-2 directories is now seriously less useful
since we have a real, released fvwm2.  I'm thinking of just moving
version-1 to old/version-1, moving fvwm-2.2 up to the top level and moving
everything else into old/version-2.  But I have to leave things mostly as
they are (or make a bunch of symlinks) so that old links still work.

I've already moved everything in unofficial-patches to
unofficial-patches/old, since I don't think any of them will apply to 2.2
(or they were subsumed).

I noticed that we've tagged 2.3.0.  It's some for someone who understands
CVS to explain how we should split off the stable branch so that we can
have 2.2.1 and 2.3.0 going in parallel.

The following awesome piece of work might come in handy:

I took a fvwm'95 side pixmap from the Fvwm95 dist. and made a trivial
cut/paste change to get this one.

Simple, but it looks OK IMO.

Subject: FvwmButtons: containers don't preserve focus style of their contents

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux
X_Server: XF86 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (209.128.28.62)


Consider the following code:

--- begin snippet ---
Module FvwmButtons XtermButton

*XtermButtonRows 1
*XtermButtonColumns 1
*XtermButton(Swallow (Respawn) BXT "Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T BXT")
--- end snippet ---

I want the xterm (BXT) in the button to have the focus when the pointer is
over it.
I also want the xterm in the button to maintain the focus as the pointer
moves:
(a) from the "BXT" xterm to the "XtermButton"'s outside parts and then
(b) from the "XtermButton"'s outside parts to the root window

In other words I want BXT to act just like any other SloppyFocus xterm.

To achieve this purpose I put the following code in my configuration file
but it does not work. 

Style XButton SloppyFocus
Style XtermButton ClickToFocus

I then try the following instead which partially works except for parts (a)
and (b)
above do not work.

Style XtermButton SloppyFocus
Style XButton SloppyFocus 

I don't think there's currently a way of achieving the effect in Fvwm as
it
seems that buttons don't preserve the focus properties of the things they
contain.

To summarize, buttons destroy the focus property of objects within
buttons.

Shouldn't this be:

?

I'm not saying it'll work like you want to, but this seems a natural
first thing to try...

How about something like this:

  /pub/fvwm/
        README, etc.
        fvwm-2.2.tar.gz
        beta/
          testing/... for developers only
          version-1/
          version-2.0/
             fvwm-2.0.*
          version-2.1/
             fvwm-2.1.*
          version-2.3/
             ...soon enough :)...

Maybe we can put a link to fvwm-1.24r.tar.gz at the top level, too.
It was an official release, and people do still use it.  I don't think
anyone'll be confused about which is the newest thing :)

When we get fvwm-2.2.1.tar.gz, fvwm-2.4.tar.gz, etc. those'll go on the
top level, too.

Do we need a "current.tar.gz" link?

This "feature" is not possible with the pager being an external program
since fvwm has a grab on the server while it moves the window. It may have
been possible some time, when the pager was a part of fvwm proper.

Subject: Layers
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


A layered stacking order for fvwm-2.2:

The patch below replaces StaysOnTop with the concept of layers.
Every window is in a layer. Fvwm arranges the layers on top of 
each other with layer 0 being the bottommost. The default layer is 0.

The following things are added by this patch:
 * a new style option "Layer n", where n can be any 
   nonnegative integer. Use of this option causes a window to be 
   placed in layer n.  
 * a new command "Layer rel [abs]" to move a window to another
   layer. It interprets its arguments in the same way as "Desk".
   As a special case, "Layer 0 -1" will move the window to its 
   "default" layer, ie the layer indicated by its style. 
 * a "Layers m [n]" WindowList option with the meaning that only 
   windows in layers between m and n are listed. n defaults to m.
 * a "Layer [n]" condition (for "Current" and related commands) 
   which is satisfied if the window is in layer n. n defaults to
   the layer of the focus window. 
 * a layer variable in the FvwmWindow struct.

The following things are removed by this patch:
 * the StaysOnTop/StaysPut style options (can be replaced by
   suitable "Layer" options)
 * the WindowList options NoOnTop/OnTop/OnlyOnTop (can also
   be replaced by suitable "Layer" options)
 * the Raised/!Raised conditions (didn't make sense to begin
   with)

assumes that it will only be called from a ButtonPress

The GetArgument function in libs/ModParse.c doesn't properly
update the pstr pointer, if the token contains quotes. 
This can be seen in FvwmEvent:

*FvwmEventCmd Echo
*FvwmEvent "focus_change" "bla bla"
FvwmEvent
 
prints e" instead of bla bla

OK, so now I have tu hurry to get my patches posted before I have to check
them in myself :-)


Session management functionality for fvwm-2.2:

If a session manager is running and has 
announced itself through the environment variable
SESSION_MANAGER, fvwm will connect to it. 

If you initiate a checkpoint for your session, fvwm 
saves much of its state to a file with a unique name
of the form .fvwm<unique suffix>. This file is 
created in the directory SM_SAVE_DIR, if that
environment variable is set and in the users
home directory otherwise. 

Fvwm currently saves and restores the following 
per window state:

* window geometry including desk and page
* focus style
* iconification and icon position including
  desk and page
* maximization plus maximized geometry
* shadedness
* various other window flags: sticky, ontop,
  windowlistskip, suppressicon, noicontitle,
  lenience, stickyicon, circulateskipicon,
  circulateskip

Additionally, fvwm saves and restores the following
global state:

* stacking order
* current desk, viewport and desktop size
* edgescroll amount, scroll and move resistance,
  edgescroll wrap
* snapattraction including mode and grid
* clicktime, colormap focus style, color limit,
* several global options: smartplacementisclever,
  clicktofocuspassesclick, clicktofocusraises,
  mousefocusclickraises, stipledtitles, modifyusp,
  capturehonorsstartsonpage, recapturehonorsstartsonpage,
  activeplacementhonorsstartsonpage
* mwm or fvwm emulation

Note that fvwm doesn't save any information regarding
styles, decors, functions or menus. If you change anything
wrt. to these resources during a session (eg by issuing
"Style" commands via FvwmTalk), these changes will be lost
after saving and restarting the session. To become permanent,
such changes have to be added to the config file.

Note further that the current implementation has the following
anomaly when used on a multi-screen display: Starting fvwm
for the first time, it will manage all screens by forking a copy
of itself for each screen. Every copy knows its parent and issuing
a "Quit" command to any instance of fvwm will kill the master and
thus all copies of fvwm. When you save and restart the session,
the session manager brings up a copy of fvwm on each screen, but
this time they are started as individual instances managing one 
screen only. Thus a "Quit" will now kill only the copy it was sent
to. I don't think this is a very serious problem, since with session 
management, you are supposed to quit a session through the session 
manager anyway. If it is really needed, "Exec exec killall fvwm2" 
will still kill all copies of fvwm.

To apply the patch:

cd fvwm-2.2/fvwm; patch -p 1 < this-mail

Note that you will have to tell patch that the files 
configure.in and config.h.in are in the parent directory.

Subject: hiding windows from FvwmPager

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2.3
Submission from: (NULL) (134.153.98.174)


It would be nice if Fvwm2 had a built in mechanism for hiding certain
windows (eg. FvwmButtons and other sticky windows) from the FvwmPager.
This mechanism would probably be best implemented as either a Style
option or a list to a "*FvwmPagerHide(a,b,c,d,e,f,...)" directive where
"a,b,c,d,e,f,..." are the X resource names of the things to hide.

The man page for VirtualBindings(3X) says:

  Mod1 refers to the first modifier key.  OSF/Motif requires that it
  correspond to either Alt or Meta.

When you do Emulate the position of the feedback window is
recalculated.  Before it was only recalculated by a DefaultFont.  I have
DefaultFont before Emulate in my .fvwm2rc so even with Emulate MWM the
feedback window was in the top left not the centre.  Now it's moved to
the centre by the Emulate command.

Cheers,
Tim.

I disagree.  For most people, the intuitive action of NumLock is to
affect the numeric keypad only.  It is a feature of X that NumLock is
the same as other modifiers and affects all keys.

AFAIK there is no way to use xmodmap to get NumLock to work in that
way**.  You can map the numeric keypad so that it is always numeric or
always cursor.  You cannot get the state to depend on NumLock without
that modifier showing up on the other keys.

It ought to be up to the applications, including fvwm, to ignore
NumLock on the other keys.  That, for better or worse, is the X way of 
doing it.


** I can suggest a method of doing that.  Bind the NumLock key to a
   program that calls xmodmap to toggle the bindings of the numeric
   keypad.  But this may confuse X applications that currently handle
   the numeric keypad appropriately.  It is generally a bad idea to
   use xmodmap to fix one client's problems as it affects all
   clients.


BTW, a trick I used to work around mwm's limitations was to bind the
mod2 buttons to a menu which consisted solely of the title "Please
turn off the Num Lock".

Hello everyone.. Just yesterday joined this list and blablabla..

.. and I successfully managed to add something.. (!)

Well. What I did was a "smoother" version o the MoveResistance feature. I
was annoyed by the fact that the MoveResistance caused the windows to
"jump" when they were moved over the border. So I started looking at the
source (I haven't looked at it at all before, so this patch could be
really stupid etc etc). Anyway, I got it working quite well. I thought
someone else could shout their opinion about whether it is useful or just
useless additional bytes of consumed memory, before I develop it any
further.

I only modified move.c, and I put everything I modified inside #if ..
#else .. #endif parts, so one could easily leave that part out. This
inserting of #if directives might be the worst idea of all, but I'm not
all that familiar with the diff, patch & cvs stuff, so I wanted to make
sure the modified parts could be easily disabled. 

The bugs are (because I didn't want to waste time on it if it is to be
rejected anyway) :

 - the MoveResistance parameter value of the EdgeResistance command
   should be greater than zero to avoid funny-looking behaviour
 - windows bigger than the screen (in either direction) don't work well
   Shouldn't be too hard to fix, though.. 

If to be used any further, an optional field of EdgeResistance would
probably do ok

EdgeResistance scrolling moving ["smooth"]

The smooth would, when specified, just switch from the ordinary to my
version of the thingy..

---

Some other ideas I've had:

Styles:
  ExtraSmartPlacement : place new windows such that as few layers of
             windows as possible (not necessarily as few windows as
             possible) get hidden

  NoSnapAttraction : Windows with this style wouldn't be taken into
             account when doing SnapAttraction

  AutoPlaceSkip : Windows with this style wouldn't be taken into
             account when deciding where to place a new window with
             SmartPlacement (or ExtraSmartPlacement :)

And then I think the required parameter for the "Restart" command is plain
stupid. In my opinion, it should be optional, and when not specified, the
default would be to restart itself without thorwing error messages. At
least personally I use the Restart command to reload the configuration
files, not to switch to another window manager (as I see no reason to..)
But of course, I could just ignore the error messages. Still I think it is
stupid..

And the fact that fvwm tries start up in a normal fashion when the
-version parameter is supplied, I find quite odd. If one uses the -version
parameter, I couldn't find much other reasons to it than that the user
just wants to find out the version and not really start the window
manager.

Finally, it could be practical to have a bit different macro specified
(when precompiling with cpp, probably m4 too) than the current
FVWM_VERSION (or actually, in addition to). I use the same configuration
files with different versions all the time (2.0.46 and up), so directives
like this are really more or less a must:
(I did it externally via the -version parameter)

#if FVWM_VERSION_INT >= 201013 /* 2.01.013 = 2.1.13 and never*/
blaablaa
#elif FVMW_VERSION_INT < 201000 /* older than 2.1 */
blaablaa
#else /* 2.1.0 .. 2.1.12 */
blaablaa
#endif

Ok enough comments from me, some of these could probably have been thrown
into bug reports, but oh well.

---

I look forward to comments about the behaviour of the "smooth" (or
whatever) version...

Now let's hope I at least got the format right (cvs diff -uc move.c)

	Now it's coming back to me. There used to be two pagers, way back in
the latter days of version 1: an internal one, that only showed the
current desktop, and did the real time movement tracking, and the
FvwmPager module (which didn't, for the same reason it doesn't today).

	I don't know when the internal Pager command was dropped, but it was
long ago. The answer to this one is that the feature is not supportable
within FVWM's current architecture.

Ahem. Not only is it possible, it is in the latest CVS, but only for
opaque moves (and AnimatedMove's just for fun). You are right that it's
impossible with rubberband windows. We could ungrab the server between
undrawing the rubberband and redrawing it and assume the XServer will
let the pager catch up but I don't think it's worth it.  With rubberband
moves the window stays put until the end of the move and this is what
the pager displays.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think this means that the icon label only gets some of the titlebar
settings i.e. it gets the font colours but not the background
colour/gradient/pixmap.  I think the bug is that it gets the font
colours and it shouldn't, not that it should look like a short titlebar.

It's probably messing up with FvwmBorder windows.  I'm going to get rid
of FvwmWindow.bw soon which may fix this.  Just as soon as we agree on
if XDrawLine(x1, y, x2, y) should draw the pixel at (x2, y).

If this means where icons are placed on the root window it's fixed
(IconGrid,IconFill). If it refers to FvwmIconBox it's not.

Won't be fixed, too widget specific.

If this means that moving a window in the pager should cause the main
window to waggle then it's a enhancement request.  No reason why it
shouldn't happen as long as it's an option to the pager.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi guys,

first of all: Good work, keep it rolling.

The enclosed patch adds formating for the labels in the pager. The
format is the same as in FvwmIconMan (%i for icon, %c for class, %r
for resource and %it for the window title). This change affects
ballons and the labels in the mini-windows.

This patch applies to 2.2. It although has a manpage-update.

The next thing I will try to integrate into the pager is a mechanism for
specifying different colors for different windows. Let's say, all
Gimp-Windows should have a red background inside the pager. I'm not
quiet sure if I should use a style options or specify it with a new
option for the Pager (something like
'*FvwmPagerWindowColor("patter",inactive,active,fore)')

So long,
	Andreas

It's not exactly the same thing, but in terms of being simpler to do,
I imagine *FvwmPagerUseSkipList might be a good idea.

Full_Name: Gary Swearingen
Version: 2.2 & 2.0.46
CVS_Date: 
OS: RH 5.2
X_Server: XF86_SVGA
Submission from: (NULL) (206.125.79.30)


I have two desktops and use backgrounds of red and darkblue using lines
like

*FvwmBackerDesk 1 Exec xsetroot -solid red

This works, but is slow when changing desktops with key commands. (For some
reason
it is fast when clicking on the pager.) I used to use

*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid red

but this stopped working when I switched to my current motherboard
(ASUS-97V)
and X server last summer.  It just makes the background black.

Other things work OK as far as I know.

Same problem with Red Hat 5.0, 5.2 (fvwm 2.0.46), and just-installed fvwm
2.2.

A description of the FvwmPagerUseSkipList seems to be missing from the 
FvwmPager man page so I don't know about it... is this a new feature of
2.2 (which I have installed)?

Sorry, what I meant was that if there's going to be a new command, the
syntax and complexity you propose adding seems pretty heavy-duty, and
that implementing UseSkipList, which is supported in other modules
like IconMan and WinList seems a simpler approach. Consistent with
existing modules/syntax, simpler to do, etc. But it doesn't yet exist.

As far as documentation goes:

I now recall seeing the UseSkipList option in the FvwmWinList manual (as
I was just able to verify, FvwmWinListUseSkipList is documented). I don't 
think the feature exists for FvwmIconMan either though (again, nothing 
in the manual).

As far as the feature and its syntax goes:

I agree with you that it would be a better approach to integrate a 
FvwmWinList like syntax for this feature.
The feature I am suggesting for the FvwmPager used to be present in Fvwm1:
it used to be integrated into FvwmWinList so that adding the
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList directive would not only hide window x from the 
window list module but it would also hide it from the pager. This was a bit 
cumbersome as I wanted to have FvwmWinList show all windows while I
wanted the pager to show only a subset of the ones appearing in the 
window list.

Could we please get this patch into the code.  Pretty please with
sugar on top, if that's what it takes.  I have updated the patch again

I have extended BuildXLockMenu, which is part of FVWM. Now you can define
your own menu name, title and optionally mini-icon. Also some
documentation is written.

Without arguments modified BuildXLockMenu prints the same output as it
did before, except one space replaced by TAB, so descriptions are now
propertly justified. The details are in inline pod, as usual you can
generate man page from pod using pod2man utility.

The original author says he is not active on fvwm any more, so I send
modified script to the list.

Migo.
-------- >8 --------

#!/usr/bin/perl

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head1 NAME

BuildXLockMenu - builds xlock menu definition for Fine Virtual Window Manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<BuildXLockMenu> [B<--menu-name> name] [B<--menu-title> title]
[B<--menu-icon> icon] [xlock params]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple perl script which parses xlock's output to build an fvwm 2.xx
menu definition of all xlock's modes.

=head2 Argument list

Arguments used by the script (must be first):

B<--menu-name>, B<--menu-title>, B<--menu-icon> - define menu name, title
and mini-icon acordingly given in the following argument. Default is name
"XLockMenu", title "XLock Modes" and no mini-icon.

Additional arguments will be passed to xload.

=head1 USAGE

 # add these lines to .fvwm2rc:
 PipeRead 'BuildXLockMenu --menu-name Screensaver --menu-title \
   "Screensaver" --menu-icon mini-bball.xpm -nice 20 -nolock'
 PipeRead 'BuildXLockMenu --menu-name Screenlock --menu-title \
   "Lock Screen" --menu-icon mini-rball.xpm -nice 20'
 AddToMenu "Utilities" "Screensaver%mini-monitor.xpm%" Popup Screensaver
 AddToMenu "Utilities" "Screenlock%mini-lock.xpm%"     Popup Screenlock

=head1 AUTHORS

 Charles K. Hines <chuck_hines@vnet.ibm.com>, initial version.
 Mikhael Goikhman <migo@homemail.com>, 24 Feb 1999.

=head1 BUGS

Depends on the output of 'xlock -h'. Will produce an empty menu, if the
structure of the output is changed.

=cut ========================================================================

$name  = "XLockMenu";
$title = "XLock Modes";
$icon  = "";

while ($ARGV[0] =~ /^--menu-/) {
  $_ = shift;
  /^--menu-n/ and $name  = shift;
  /^--menu-t/ and $title = shift;
  /^--menu-i/ and $icon  = '%' . shift() . '%';
}

$params = @ARGV? ' ' . join(' ', @ARGV): '';
$dscLen = 35 + length $icon;

$start = 0;

open(XL,"xlock -h 2>&1 |") || die "couldn't run xlock";

print "DestroyMenu $name\n";
print "AddToMenu $name \"$title\" Title\n";

while (<XL>)
{
  chomp;
  
  /where mode is one of:/ && do
  {
    $start = 1;
    next;
  };
  if ($start && $_)
  {
    @foo = split;
    $mode = shift @foo;
    $mode =~ /^-.*/ && next;
    printf "+ \"%-9s\t%-${dscLen}s Exec xlock$params -mode $mode\n",$mode,
      "(@foo)$icon\"";
  }
}

close XL;

#print "Beep\n";

Upon downloading FVWM v2.2 and trying to compile the program I received an
error where the C compiler could not locate __libc_attr__.  I re-ran the
configure program and still no luck.  Eventually I re-ran the configure,
did
a make clean, and then a make and everything compiled.  The following is
the
entire make along with the warnings which I thought I'd pass along.

PS: If you need to have this compiled again let me know and I can download
your update and try compiling it again.  :-)

Later.

Subject: "Scroll" function doesn't wrap correctly

Full_Name: Keith Pomakis
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.0.35
X_Server: XFree86
Submission from: (NULL) (207.236.16.95)


The fvwm2 man page states:

    Scroll horizonal vertical
        Scrolls  the virtual desktop's viewport by horizon-
        tal pages in the x-direction and vertical pages  in
        the  y-direction.
        [...]

        If the horizontal and vertical percentages are mul-
        tiplied  by 1000 then scrolling will wrap around at
        the edge of the desktop.

So I decided it would be a great idea to set the following navigation
ability for my 2x2 desktop:

    Mouse 1   A   M   Scroll -100000 0
    Mouse 2   A   M   Scroll 200000 0
    Mouse 3   A   M   Scroll 100000 0

This enables me to get from any page to any other page of my desktop
in just one mouse click.  I find it very convenient.  However, without
the partial fix that I'm supplying below, it doesn't work as expected.
The "Scroll 200000 0" command fails in half of the cases.

    Expected behaviour     Actual behavior
    ------------------     ---------------
    page 1 --> page 3      page 1 --> page 3
    page 2 --> page 4      page 2 --> page 3  *** FAILS ***
    page 3 --> page 1      page 3 --> page 1
    page 4 --> page 2      page 4 --> page 1  *** FAILS ***

This bug has been around for at least a couple of years.  I've finally
decided to go into the code and fix it myself.  The problem is in the
scroll() function of the file "virtual.c".  The following statements are
incorrect:

  if(((val1 <= -100000)||(val1 >= 100000))&&(x>Scr.VxMax))
    {
      x = 0;
      y += Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
      if(y > Scr.VyMax)
        y=0;
    }
  if(((val1 <= -100000)||(val1 >= 100000))&&(x<0))
    {
      x = Scr.VxMax;
      y -= Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
      if(y < 0)
        y=Scr.VyMax;
    }
  if(((val2 <= -100000)||(val2>= 100000))&&(y>Scr.VyMax))
    {
      y = 0;
      x += Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
      if(x > Scr.VxMax)
        x=0;
    }
  if(((val2 <= -100000)||(val2>= 100000))&&(y<0))
    {
      y = Scr.VyMax;
      x -= Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
      if(x < 0)
        x=Scr.VxMax;
    }

They basically say that if a scroll "wraps", it merely sets the coordinate
to zero.  That's not what wrapping is.  Wrapping is a modulus operation.
I've fixed the first and third of these if statements to perform
the correct operation.  See below.  The other two have to be similarly
modified in order for the fix to be considered complete, but I don't have
the spare brainpower at the moment, so I'll leave that to you.

  if(((val1 <= -100000)||(val1 >= 100000))&&(x>Scr.VxMax))
    {
      int xpixels = (Scr.VxMax / Scr.MyDisplayWidth + 1) *
Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
      x %= xpixels;
      y += Scr.MyDisplayHeight * (1+((x-Scr.VxMax-1)/xpixels));
      if(y > Scr.VyMax)
        y %= (Scr.VyMax / Scr.MyDisplayHeight + 1) * Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
    }
  if(((val1 <= -100000)||(val1 >= 100000))&&(x<0))
    {
      x = Scr.VxMax;
      y -= Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
      if(y < 0)
        y=Scr.VyMax;
    }
  if(((val2 <= -100000)||(val2>= 100000))&&(y>Scr.VyMax))
    {
      int ypixels = (Scr.VyMax / Scr.MyDisplayHeight + 1) *
Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
      y %= ypixels;
      x += Scr.MyDisplayWidth * (1+((y-Scr.VyMax-1)/ypixels));
      if(x > Scr.VxMax)
        x %= (Scr.VxMax / Scr.MyDisplayWidth + 1) * Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
    }
  if(((val2 <= -100000)||(val2>= 100000))&&(y<0))
    {
      y = Scr.VyMax;
      x -= Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
      if(x < 0)
        x=Scr.VxMax;
    }

	This, of course, is nonsense. The pager can't wander on a
restart, since it's killed and a new one is spawned. It's misplaced
initially, with a geometry of -0-0 or -1-1. I've been ignoring this
quirk for so long that I automatically drag it into place without
thinking. I'd just done a restart shortly before I wrote that, and the
image of a seemingly wandering window was fresh in my mind.

	So, there may be some shifting problems lurking, but I don't
know of any. In any case, the one that prompted this bug report in
the first place has probably been corrected.

	My, it's amazing what you miss when you only superficially scan
the CVS logs for one day!

	I gave that a quick try this evening, with no success. I don't
think it's worth pursuing further. Actually, I like the aesthetic of
not moving the pager icon while doing a rubberband move - to me, the
pager seems to mirror the actual appearance of the desktop better this
way.

	I wonder if we should make this feature optional...? When you
move the pager itself, it looks a mite jittery now.

Here is the stuff I have patches for:

* Layers (already sent)
* Session management (already sent)
* window group support (needs some work, but basically works)
* Misc new commands in analogy to Current: All, Pick
* change Maximize to stay on the same page 
* ICCCM 2 support (this is perhaps mostly academic, since
  the world seems stuck at ICCCM 1.1, but fvwm could still
  be the first ICCCM 2-compliant wm)

I created a branch-2_2 branch in CVS off of the 2.2.0 release, and I
checked in some changes to update the version to 2.2.1.

If you want to work on the 2.2.x releases, what you need to do is check
out a copy of the tree with the "-r branch-2_2" option.  Alternatively
you can switch a current workspace to the branch by using "cvs update -r
branch-2_2".

Note that once you move to this, that workspace will always be checking
out and in from the branch (since that workspace now has a "sticky
branch tag").  See the CVS docs.

In general I recommend keeping two workspaces, one set to the latest
2.3.x development and one to the 2.2.x branch.

I suppose any changes we make that are real bugfixes (core dump fixes,
etc.) definitely should be made to 2.2.1 as well.  As for some of the
minor feature enhancements... I'm ambivilant :)

	Hello all.

	I've successfully installed 2.2 on OpenVMS.
	I'd like to have the stuff included in the original code, if everybody 
is ok. Who wants to be the one who will help VMS users join the good side of the 
force ? :-)
	Basicaly, I have 2 specific sources (vms.c and vms.h), 3 files for 
building (vms_config.h, vms_shareables.opt, make_fvwm.mms) and some fvwm 
modifications. I can post the stuff in a zip attached file (well attached :-) 
tonight for someone to have a look.
	Fab.

This got me thinking that maybe the pager shifting wasn't on restart but
on recapture.  Good news is that it isn't the pager misbehaving, bad
news is that recapture and restart shift north-west gravity windows up
and left by one pixel.  It happens to both MWMBorder and FvwmBorder
styles so it's not the dreaded ->bw and it only happens once. It feels
like something in the uncapturing logic is getting the screen size wrong
by one, or it could be in the initial capture logic as if you move the
window back to the edge after a recapture has shifted it it then stays
put after another recapture.

Cheers,
Tim.

Everyone has the right to voice an opinion.  Reporting bugs is much
better than not reporting them.

The module FvwmAnimate does a lot of this already, it maintains it own
rc file and creates some menus and forms that make it GUI configurable. 
It's blazing a path for the other modules to follow.

I'd like to see a .fvwm directory rather than have a version specific
name but I'm willing to be convinced the other way.  I don't have lots
of users or old versions to worry about.  It might be a good idea to
have an env variable that fvwm and the modules use to look up their rc
files that would default to ~/.fvwm$VERSION/$MODULErc so that I could
have VERSION="".

If you can get a function definition into their config you could fake it
with

AddToFunc xpmroot I Exec xpmroot $0

but it depends on them all using xpmroot and not something else.

This feature probably existed in fvwm.1 when fvwm had a built in pager, so now we need to just port the skiplist stuff into yet a nother module.  Sigh, yet another argument for for a common module library.

Hi,
I've spent some more time enhancing the pixmap background features for the
pager, that I sent to the list a month ago. The pixmaps specified as
desk backgrounds no longer "spills" over into the labels and it is now
possible to specify a pixmap for hilighting the desks. 
During this I also fixed a small bug: A pager only showing the current 
desk did not update the color of its label when changing between desks 
with different background colors.

This patch also provides an option to put the labels below the desks,
and an option to hide the label of inactive desks using shape
extensions.

Comments ?

+	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c:
+	(initialize_pager): Added test that turn off ShapeLabels if the X
+ 	server don't support shape extensions.
+  	  If a pixmap background is defined for a desk it is installed
+        instead of a background color.
+	  If a hilight pixmap is defined, it is used instead of a hilight
+	color.
+	(UpdateWindowShape): Added a function adding a shape mask,
+	containing the defined desks and the label of the current desk, to 
+	the pager window if ShapeLabels is on.
+	(DrawGrid): Modified to hilighting code to turn off hilighting of
+ 	the label of the current desk if ShapeLabels is on.
+          Modified the label drawing code to draw the desk label below the 
+	desk if LabelsBelow is on
+	  Added call to UpdateWindowShape at the end of the function.
+
+	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.1: Added sections for the new
+	configuration options.

I'm struggling to find time to achieve my own agenda.
The number of patches coming into the list begging for someone
to apply is already too high.

Unless someone else with update access volunteers,  I vote for giving
Fabien update access.

I'm a little concerned that this  change breaks existing config files.
When I   check  my  config files, I    find 2  things  with  styles of
StaysOnTop.   Both have comments about it  not really working.  (I was
trying to force icons to stay above a window.)

I haven't examined your patch closely, or applied it.

I see the  bottom layer  is  zero, I guess  there  is no limit  to the
number of the top layer.  If there was, perhaps the current StaysOnTop
command could be shorthand for Layer 9, or 99?

Perhaps there should  be an upper limit  on the  layer number, besides
the maximum  value  of an  int, or  at least a  convention.  I've been
trying to reduce the   amount  of configuration tweaking  that   fvwm2
needs.  I would  expect that some of our  components,  for example the
Pager, will have built in default layer numbers.

Did you put the Pan Frames in a layer?  Which one?

Well, I sort of assumed everybody would use one of the preprocessors
do eg define(`StaysOnTop',`Layer 99') or somesuch.

I think the Gnome hints have some predefined layers which go up to
10 or 12 or so. Having 2^32 layers is perhaps as useful as having
2^32 desks...

> Did you put the Pan Frames in a layer?  Which one?

No, the pan frames are floating above the whole layer hierarchy. This
is achieved by issuing raisePanFrames() at key points (That shouldn't 
strictly be necessary, since I tried to remove any direct calls to 
XRaiseWindow from fvwm - it should only rearrange the windows it is
managing, leaving panFrames and override-redirect windows floating above.)

I'd like to help integrate this.  Not that I have a VMS system, but I'm a
bit concerned about how it will interact with the configure & build
process.  Any chance that the configure script will run under VMS?

I've avoided using any of the preprocessors up until now.

2^31? but why quibble over a couple of billion desks or layers.
I think the number of desks is completely out of control,
which is what  led me to suggest a limit.

configure won't run under VMS, I don't think.  Plus the "makefiles" are
quite a bit different.

In my support for VMS in GNU make, I just include extra files like a
make script, etc. and a README.vms describing how to build it.  Those
systems are typically a lot more homogeneous than *nix systems, so
something the size of configure isn't needed.

I make a "config.h.vms" which is basically a "normal" config.h, but with
the VMS #defines, etc. hardcoded; then the README tells people to rename
it to config.h.

Also, you can convince automake to generate the dependency list stuff
separately, then append it to special makefiles for other architectures.

Nothing to do with the screen size, it's the border width of the client
that is stashed as ->old_bw that is causing the wander on recapture. 
Try xclock -borderwidth 20 followed by Recapture.  I think it's
something in misc.c/RestoreWithdrawnLocation() that's going wrong.

Cheers,

	I've heard of a port of configure. But probably an old version. And i'd 
prefer not rely on it for a lot of potential VMS users won't go in the pain of 
using it.

	That's true. I've done exactly that for Fvwm.

	Well I also have a carefully written (I think, but users will tell :-) 
readme.vms explaning how to build and install, what to do in case of fail, and 
what I thought have to be change in the code to have it run.

>Also, you can convince automake to generate the dependency list stuff
>separately, then append it to special makefiles for other architectures.
	I've built an archaique dependency MMS file (MMS is the functionnaly 
equivalent of make, less powerfull).

Don't force people to use preprocessors.  I don't use one, no one should
have to.


Please, "alias" StaysOnTop & StaysOnBottom to "Layer 99" & "Layer 0",
respectively.    This makes it user friendly and backward compatible. 
Don't devalue StaysOnTop, keep it as a convenient shortcut.


Also, Yes, limit the number of layers just so people can easily
conceptualize how they work & how they can be used.  

Make sure in the docs that you clearly say what layer new windows go
into by default  (Layer 1 ??, Layer 50 ??).  

If new windows go into Layer 0, you couldn't have an automatic
StaysOnBottom command.  You'd have to screw around with it instead of
just saying "StaysOnBottom" and getting on with your work.

Yes, I like what has been done here.  It would be even more cool, as
I've mentioned to Dan in the past, if he used mini-icons in the menus:
he could mark the "currently selected" item in the "Iterations",
"Effects", etc. menus with a check mini-icon or something.  That would
be neat... of course FvwmAnimate would have to destroy/recreate the menu
each time the value was changed...

Also, I know Dan is working on enhancements to FvwmForms; these will be
critical if it's to be used in any kind of "self modifying config"
environment.

Nope, definitely you're right.  We already changed the original
${prefix}/libexec/fvwm2/${VERSION} modules directory name to just "fvwm"
for similar reasons; no need for the "2" there.

Hmm.  You make a compelling argument, Jason.  I would love to see fvwm
move back into the "mainstream" like this, and since we already have
GNOME (at least) patches imminent, plus the session management stuff, it
shouldn't be difficult to get a release out (I favor a 2.4 release over
a 2.2.x release) fairly rapidly with these enhancements.

Then the question becomes what, if anything, else "big" do we do for
2.4?  For example, if we decide to try to target the next fvwm release
at integration with GNOME and KDE, do we push off the GSFR until 2.6?

I've seen many people post their "should be in 2.4" lists, but I wonder
if maybe a good next step wouldn't be to go through the TODO list and
clean it out and make a "should be in _SOME_ future release" list.
Maybe we can sort the TODO list by expected difficulty or size of the
project.

Then we can examine that list and decide what the goal and timeline for
2.4 is, and what projects are needed to meet the goal.

So far I've been an advocate of taking a "wait and see" approach to
themes.  What I'm looking for is for some people who really want themes
to try to get some kind of "theme scheme" working with fvwm as-is.

Then, have them come bitch to us about all the pain and torture they
suffered and the hoops they had to jump through to get it working... and
see if we can't smooth the rough edges in a way that both (a) doesn't
require tons of work and yet (b) addresses 90% of the "hard parts" of
setting up themes.

That being said, I think there is definitely room for improvement in the
consistency of fvwm itself.  For example, see the bug report I made
recently as a placeholder for the idea of having a unified "FVWM Style"
which would provide default information to all parts of FVWM _AND_ all
it's modules, like basic foreground/background colors, font(s), etc.
This would give a "single point of change" for modifying fvwm and all
its modules, _and_ ensure a consistent look and feel amongst them.

Subject: move/resize info window not in center

Full_Name: Stefan Illy
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: HP-UX 10.20/Linux-Alpha Redhat 5.1
X_Server: X11R6
Submission from: (NULL) (141.52.61.104)


Since I use a virtual screen, I prefer to have the move/resize info window
in the center of the screen, not in the top/left corner (where it is not
always
visible).

I tried 'Emulate mwm' in my .fvwm2rc, but it had no effect.
After looking through the source code and a little bit of debugging
I found that the move/resize window `Scr.SizeWindow' is created before
.fvwm2rc is read.

I was able to confirm this by starting fvwm with the command
`fvwm2 -cmd "Emulate mwm" -cmd "Read .fvwm2rc"'.
In this case Scr.SizeWindow indeed appears in the center of the screen.


Best wishes, Stefan

Yes, please do.  Run the bit of Perl from http://www.fvwm.org/cvs.html to
generate a password and mail it to me.  Then you'll be able to commit
(after you do 'cvs login' with the new password) and you'll be able to

I'll see about getting an expanded version of this into cvs.html.

BTW, would anyone object to some .cvsignore files?  If you get any question
marks during a cvs update then you've found something that needs to go into
.cvsignore.

In the mean time you can move it to the centre by having DefaultFont
after Emulate.

     Seconded.

Yep.  If you are wondering why you haven't seen it yet,  I got tired
of waiting for 2.2 and launched into another round of enhancements.
Right now I'm working toward stability again.

They are not in the current CVS sources.

We seem to be somewhat of 2  minds on icons.   We currently don't even
automatically install the ones we have.  But I'll bet a window manager
with pretty icons is high on a lot of users lists.

The look like good icons to me.

What are the "tiny." files in the "root" subdirectory for?

Firstly, thanks for your comments.  Now that I've looked through the
package a little more, I have a few more comments to make on some of
this stuff.  In order not to bother everyone with too much junk, I'll
only talk about still open stuff.

They do three things:

  (i) They reset the default geometry stuff before reading a Geometry
      resource, in case there is more than one such resource; this
      makes the second (?) one take effect and ignores the first,
      rather than having them become confused with each other.

 (ii) Implements a NoStartIconic resource to complement StartIconic.

(iii) Two bug-fixes: the Geometry resource case of Flags & YNegative
      has had an extra line (window_y=g_y;) removed, and the Font
      resource case has had an 'else' clause added (else use_label=1;).

It turns out that it is just an example .fvwm2rc configuration file
which makes heavy use of M4.  That's all.

Onto the next bugs....

I guess.  The original bug report read:

  The iconified program use the default colors for normal windows,
  EXCEPT they ignore the TitleStyle!  So, because the title style may
  change the background for the title bar, the colors may look good
  for normal windows but may be totally unreadable for icons.

The report refers to the URI:
ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/unofficial_patches/iconboxes.patch
That probably helps....

What's "waggle" mean?!  He means: just as moving the window on the
screen causes them to move in the pager, the converse should also be
possible.

No, it's a request to have the ability to move windows on the desktop
by moving the icons in the Pager.  It's probably already been
implemented.

I applied this patch, pretty cool.  Is there anyway for a pixmap to be
automatically shrunk to fit the background of the pager?

I have some large pixmaps 1280x1024 that I wanted to use as the background
images, but I had to shrink them before I could use them.  I know that AfterStep
will use whatever image is on the desktop's background as the image for its
pager's background, and the image will be sized correctly.  This would be nice.

Also, how can I get the highlight color/pixmap to be the same one as the current
desktop's color/pixmap?  Here is a copy of my pager settings:

*FvwmPagerColumns 1
*FvwmPagerBack grey76
*FvwmPagerFore black

I tried commenting out "FvwmPagerHilight" and "FvwmPagerHilightPixmap" but then
the current desktop is highlighted as black.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

The files in the root directory are for my fvwmbuttons (if you read the
README...)

They're "tiny." because i had to shrink down the original icons to fit
on the blob.

See the second screen shot on:

  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/linux.html


(You'll note that i refrained from including my "FVWM-Step" icon in the
icon pack... :)

I have F2 bound to a function in my .fvwm2rc.  When I upgraded to Fvwm 2.2
my binding stopped working.  When I check my .xsession-errors file I found
the following error for each time I hit F2:

/tmp/.wm_pid: No such file or directory

When I load up xev, it seems that F2 is being grabbed by the window
manager.
If I remove all F2 bindings, F2 is still being grabbed by the window
manager
and the messages still appear in .xsession-errors.

Hi, I've seen quite a few messages concerning the strange behavior of
FvwmButtons. 
Mine is quite interesting and I really cann't figure out what makes the
difference
here (when it worked or failed):
I have a ButtonPanel in my FvwmButtons:

*FvwmButtonsPanel Chinese							
*FvwmButtonsGeometry +0+0							
*FvwmButtonsRows 1								
*FvwmButtonsBack #d6d5fe							
*FvwmButtonsFore red
*FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#*FvwmButtonsFont -hku-fixed-medium-r-normal--0-0-72-72-c-0-big5.et-0
#*FvwmButtonsPixmap pattern14.xpm
*FvwmButtonsPixmap blue1.xpm

*FvwmButtons(Title GB,Icon gb.xpm, Action  `Exec cxterm -name cxterm -T
"CXterm (GB)" &`)
*FvwmButtons(Title Big5,Icon b5.xpm, Action  `Exec /usr/local/bin/cxterm
-name cxtermb5 -T "CXterm (BIG5)" &`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title HZ,Icon hz.xpm, Action `Exec /usr/local/bin/cxterm -name
cxterm  -T "CXterm (HZ)" -e /usr/local/bin/hztty &`) 


This caused FvwmButtons to dump core. I have located the problem to be at
the last 
setence (if I comment it out, FvwmButtons worked). Now, the strange thing
is,
if I change the last setence to :
*FvwmButtons(Title HZ,Icon hz.xpm, Action `Exec cxterm -name cxterm  -T

just getting rid of the absolute path "/usr/local/bin", it would work!!!
Anyone has an idea why?

If you can get the latest CVS there is a bit of code in
fvwm/resize.c:AnimatedMoveFvwmWindow() that sends modules messages
during the move. It would be nice if you adapted this for AnimatedShade
so the pager could follow the motion.

Cheers,
Tim.

I have thought about adding that feature, but right now this is not
implemented. If I get the time, I might look in to this during the
weekend.

Oops. I never thought about this case. Right now this is not possible, 
but I will add this during the weekend.

There is  a  problem  here.   The   Titlestyle command  controls   the
background  for the   3   titlebar states:  activeup,  activedown, and
inactive.

The HiLightColor command  controls the  foreground and  background  of
icon titles with focus, and only the foreground of the titlebar.

The  Style ForeColor and  backcolor controls icon titles without focus
and the foreground only in titlebars that are inactive (unfocused).

Is a  confusing  mess, and  quite difficult to  work out  schemes with
contrast.

Just to make things  even less consistent,  the icon titles don't even
have  the state "activedown" like  the titlebars  do, instead the icon
title disappears as the icon is being moved.

Never heard the iconboxes patch refered to as the "Gravity patch".
This patch is definitely already in 2.2.

The FVWM_MODULEDIR seems to be hard-wired into the configure.in script
in 2.2 as ${libexecdir}/${PACKAGE}/${VERSION}.  Why is this?  Can it
be made configurable?

Firstly, thank you and wow!!  And on specific points:

Is there an automatic way to display key bindings?

OK, I think I understand what's going on here.  This person had a
window entitled "*scratch*".  He also had a file called "scratch" in
his pixmap path.  So when the window list was displayed, it saw
"*scratch*" and went looking for a pixmap called scratch.  Moral: the
searching for pixmaps and stuff when seeing a window entry such as
"*scratch*" should be turned off when displaying window lists.

I haven't been able to move windows in the pager.  Is there an option
to do this?

> >  9769  ClickToFocus and SkipMapping don't interact properly.

To quote the original report:

  The ClickToFocus and SkipMapping styles don't interact properly.
  Replace your ~/.fvwm2rc with these two lines

    Style *     ClickToFocus
    Style test  StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping

  then start an xterm as "xterm -name test".  The display stays at
  desk 0 as it should, but the current window loses focus.

> > 16040  PipeRead problems: should set env vars and should search for

> What is the problem?

Again, to quote the original report:

  When I do a "PipeRead" fvwm2 should set environment variables like
  it does when using FvwmM4 (Ie: TWM_TYPE = fvwm2, WIDTH = 1152,
  HEIGHT = 900, etc)

  From what I can tell, the child inherits fvwm's environment.

  Also, when doing a PipeRead, specifing ".fvwm2/program" doesn't read
  ~/.fvwm2/program nor /etc/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2/program.  Fvwm should
  treat PipeRead the same way it does Read, but also search the path
  if the program wasn't found.

Is there any intention ever to do so?

   Julian

Firstly, I want to say a HUGE THANK YOU to all of you for creating
and maintaining FVWM in the first place, and secondly, for the amazing
number of emails which have arrived from you all helping me to wade
through the mass of open bug reports against Debian.  I have done some
collation and also some work on figuring out the mess which was left
for me, and have made some significant progress on some of the Debian
internals, although I have not dared to yet release a Debian version
of 2.2 -- there are still too many serious Debian-related problems
which I have yet to fix.  But I will continue to work on it, and
hopefully get out a version within the next week.

Anyway, as promised, here is the list of still open non-Debian bugs.
As I get the Debian version working, it will be easier for me to test
some of these myself, but in the meantime, here goes.  There's only
about 20 left, which is a fantastic improvement!

And as before, I'm really grateful (spelled correctly this time!) for
all of your help.

   Julian

Open Debian bug reports against fvwm 2.x
========================================
(http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lfvwm2.html)

Normal bugs outstanding
-----------------------

11174  Bizarre bug involving a window changing title as fvwmbuttons
       becomes active causing the latter to crash.  You just have to
       see the bug report for full details.

11355  Want some MiniIcon lines in example config file.

11356  Iconified programs ignore TitleStyle, so colours may lead to
       unreadable titles on icons.

11463  Race condition in IconBox: if box window is created after icon,
       then icon ends up out of box, e.g., after restarting fvwm.

-> WISHLIST
11824b Want FvwmPager configurable so can click left-mouse once to
       both change viewport and focus.

OUTDATED OR DEBIAN-SPECIFIC?
11845  FvwmAuto and unclutter don't run when called from init.hook or
       init-restart.hook.

NOT OBSERVED UPSTREAM
11886a Sometimes the pager does not display a mapped window until it
       is moved.

11886b Sometimes iconifying programs leads to the icon being mapped
       only very briefly and then disappearing.  (??)

14163  When moving a window far enough to make the desktop view move,
       it starts flickering in its original position.

14172  Starting elvis in X caused fvwm2 to fail with BadWindow and
       BadDrawable errors in X_DestroyWindow and X_CopyArea requests.

22102  Various config problems, eg can't configure colours of title of
       window with input focus in WinList -- appropriate option has no
       effect.

(NEW DETAILS)
25751  When changing fonts in emacs19, seems to take a long time.
       Problem with ConstrainSize(Tmp_win, &width, &height); in 
       HandleConfigureRequest() in fvwm/events.c, apparently.


Wishlist items - outstanding
----------------------------

21097  Gravity patch for IconBox wanted in main fvwm2.  Found at
       ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/unofficial_patches/
       iconboxes.patch

DEBIAN-SPECIFIC??  OR IS THERE AN OPTION TO DO THIS?
32923  WindowOps menu should display key bindings (pseudo-patch
       included)


Normal bugs - forwarded to fvwm-workers (!)
-------------------------------------------

(NEW DETAILS)
 8774  If a window is called something such as "*scratch*", this
       should not be interpreted as meaning "look for a pixmap called
       scratch.xpm, etc."

 8954  FvwmPager should allow windows to be moved in it => windows
       moving in main window.  Also, could wordwrap titles in Pager.

 9769  ClickToFocus and SkipMapping don't interact properly.

16040  PipeRead problems: should set env vars and should search for
       missing files in standard places.

IS THIS STILL A PROBLEM?
21547  Root menu bound to button with "Mouse 0 3 A Menu /Debian Nop",
       but then submenus' positions depend on where button clicked --
       may end up too far left/right.  Only problem with MWM style?

23759  MWMButtons and MWMDecorMax don't work together properly.


Wishlist items - forwarded to fvwm-workers (!)
----------------------------------------------

This has not been incorporated -- will it be?
27276  Internationalisation patch (included) -- from fvwm-users-jp
       mailing list.

Perhaps you haven't seen my mail from this AM, or you just missed
my comment.

This is already in 2.2.

	If you drag the little window icon with mouse button 2, the window it
represents will be moved. You can drag a window across page or desktop
boundaries, or even out of the pager and onto the current page.

	Just try to reproduce this; go on, I dare ya'! (It's fixed.  :-) )

Well, I think I fixed it, but I'm not sure how! I think the problem was
with non-active placement and it was not stashing the correct value for
xdiff & ydiff. This meant that on a recapture/restart windows that have
an old_bw > 0 were placed back on the screen wrongly.  When fvwm
recaptures/restarts it goes through a different bit of code to place
windows and that bit works.  What I've done is to take the code from the
recapture placement and copied it to the smart/dumb placement section.

Does this make sense to anyone? Does it break anything? I've tried it
with xclock and it fixes the problem with all four corner gravities.

Cheers,
Tim.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.202.174.12)


Enhancement request:
 The None etc. commands should take a direction option so that
 the failure of a Direction command can be predicted and
 catered for. This is not the same as Direction, I just want it
 to return true if the Direction command would consider it

 I have my keypad keys bound to direction functions that change
 focus.  If the current window is normal it looks for other
 !Iconic windows in the given direction, if the current window is
 an icon it looks for other icons.

DestroyFunc my_go
AddToFunc my_go I Current (!Iconic) Direction $0 (CurrentDesk !Iconic)
FlipFocus
AddToFunc my_go I Current (Iconic) Direction $0 (CurrentDesk Iconic)
FlipFocus

 What I would like is for the functions to switch from icons to
 windows when there aren't any icons in the given direction and
 vice versa. I'd like the following to work

DestroyFunc my_go_north
AddToFunc my_go_north I Current (!Iconic) None (CurrentDesk North !Iconic)
Direction North (CurrentDesk Iconic) FlipFocus
... (the rest if this func is left as an exercise for the reader 8-)

Just some thought re: making it easier to add themes/Gnome/KDE/CDE
support.

What if fvwm were to send a list of graphics contexts to modules to use
a defaults together with a refresh command (not xrefresh) whenever any
of them change?

What I mean is:
1) change fvwm so it keeps the same CG's instead of destroying/creating
them whenever a colour changes

2) send a list of CG's when a module starts

3) the modules to use these GC's by default

4) a module message - refresh - to get a redraw, can't rely on xrefresh
as backing store may be in effect

The GC's I am thinking of are:
Foreground suitable for XDrawString
Background suitable for XFillRectangle (maybe XSetBackground)
Relief suitable for XDrawLine
Shadow ditto

FocusForeground, FocusBackground, FocusRelief, FocusShadow for the
current window
NormalForeground, NormalBackground, NormalRelief, NormalShadow for
others
IconForeground, IconBackground, IconRelief, IconShadow for icons

Is it possible to share GC's like this? It would mean changing all the
modules to not create their own, but it would mean that by default all
the modules have the same colour scheme as fvwm and changing themes
would only require fvwm to modify the GC's and then broadcast a refresh.
Ideaaly I'd like the backgroundGC's to be able to be a pixmap rather
than just a colour.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Tim.

It is the right line of thinking but we can't share graphic contexts or any other structure because the modules are in a seperate process space, we would basically need to pass via pipes the updates to the graphic contexts.  That is, if you chnage the background to blue, all running modules would get a messge Background=blue then they could reset their background values and repaint.

This type of code of course screams to be put in a generic module library along with all the parsing and possibly the error handlers.

You can override it by setting a new value on the make line:

  $ make FVWM_MODULEIDR=/my/special/module/dir
  $ make install FVWM_MODULEIDR=/my/special/module/dir

We should fix this so you can do it at configure time, like this:

  $ FVWM_MODULEDIR=/my/special/module/dir ./configure ...

too, but right now you can't do that... :(

OS: RH5.2 (2.2.2)

Submission from: (NULL) (171.68.117.195)


The task bar process suddenly started hogging CPU cycles.  
The "Start" button was not visible.
'top' shows FvwmTaskBar...
Left-click on desktop still brings up menu.
Selected System Utilities/Task Bar
Start button reappeared -- CPU still busy.
kill -HUP <FvwmTaskBar.pid>
Everything appears normal again...

I have no idea why the process would have started spinning...  
I was just working on a a few nxterms in DT0(0,0)...

The problem only lasted about 2 minutes until the kill...

Sorry I have no additional info. 

Pierre

/u/tools/dane/fvwm/version-2_3_1/modules/FvwmForm> cvs commit ../ChangeLog .Form* DefineMe.c FvwmForm.1 FvwmForm.c FvwmForm.h Makefile.am README ReadXServer.c
cvs server: Up-to-date check failed for `FvwmForm.1'
cvs server: Up-to-date check failed for `FvwmForm.c'
cvs server: Up-to-date check failed for `Makefile.am'
cvs server: Up-to-date check failed for `README'
cvs [server aborted]: correct above errors first!
cvs commit: saving log message in /tmp/cvsBAA0Mppml

What is it checking that makes this fail?

I thought that might be it, so I touched each of the files and
got the same result.

	Don't know what happened to the text of that last message. It
seems to have been a bad week for e-mail in Connecticut. I've had trouble
sending from home to the list all week, and now the system at work is
acting strangely, too.

Might this have something to do with it?

Given the level of Spam controls these days, no system is going to accept
mail from a host that it can't send bounces to.  If your envelope sender
doesn't resolve, you can't get bounces and my machines will reject mail
from you.

Full_Name: Timm Reasbeck
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: linux 2.0.35 libc
X_Server: X11R6
Submission from: (NULL) (208.29.101.4)


I find man files for xpmroot, and modules but I can not find a fvwm.1 man
page. I assumed it would be
in the /doc directory for use by shell scripts there but like the socks in
my drawer
I just can't find it.

I guess I must be pretty dense because last night I didn't see the button
to submit
a bug report, so I sent an a-mail off to fvwm.org and got a curt response
from somebody there.

It is in fvwm/fvwm2.1 and should be installed along with everything else.

I'm the author of the "curt" response; sorry if you thought it offensive in
some way.  I did point you to the source for all of the man pages, didn't
I?  Why submit a bug report when I've already given you the answer?

	Hmmm...I suspect you'll be rejecting a lot of mail from folks
with only a ppp connection through an ISP.  :-(

	Can you give me a couple of pointers on how to persuade sendmail
to construct an envelope you'll accept?

	Steve...Help!  I updated my CVS directory shortly after you did
the great autoconf change, and now I'm at a loss to know how to build
Fvwm.

	I have autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.4 - never used them before.
Per the instructions in docs/DEVELOPERS, I issued the command

	automake --add-missing 

and got the following:

>>  automake: configure.in: installing `./install-sh'
>>  automake: configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
>>  automake: configure.in: installing `./missing'
>>  configure.in: 6: required file `./config.h.in' not found

It went downhill from there, of course. Copying in a config.h.in from
yesterday's CVS update, just to see what would happen,  didn't produce
stunning results. Automake and autoconf ran; autoconf gave these
warnings:

>>  configure.in:159: warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow
>>  cross compiling 
>>  configure.in:215: warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow 
>>  cross compiling

and then attempting to run ./configure yielded this:

>>  ./configure: line 532: syntax error near unexpected token `AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(fvwm,'
>>  ./configure: line 532: `AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(fvwm, 2.3.0)'


	So how does one *really* get this thing to build with autoconf?

You need to run multiple tools the first time (after that the makefile
will keep things up-to-date).

I think the right order is:

  aclocal
  autoheader
  autoconf
  automake

Hm.. I found that, yes.. but I found a different, pretty nasty thing..
can anyone confirm this:
Shade a window
Move the remains

Does it disappear with a X_ConfigureWindow - BadValue (integer parameter
out of range) ?

I thought that 'autoreconf' does all of the above for you.  No?

In any event, it is important to *also* run automake --add-missing at some
point, to get the COPYING, install-sh, and some other file.

Yeah, these you can ignore.

Did I forget to mention "autoreconf" in docs/DEVELOPERS?  Aigh!  Sorry
about that!  (I did mention it other places: cvs.html, and the ChangeLog,
I think)

Anyone who does a "cvs update" will find a bunch of files deleted out from
under them.  Do this:

	automake --add-missing
	autoreconf

Then "make" will take care of things.

Is it possible that someone snuck in a new version of one of those files
between the "update" and "commit" steps?

Did you try doing "cvs update" again before committing?

Re bug 208:

This was not the original process that started looping.  I'd restarted 
fvmw2 several times.  On later occasions, there were two processes running

at 47% CPU each.  In these cases, I used 'kill -9'...  Now, when I'd 
restart fvwm2, it only required that I move the mouse to the taskbar to 
put it back into a loop.  As the mouse moved into the taskbar area, I did
notice that the bar moved down (and left?) a pixel or two at the same time

the looping started...

Was in the process of entering this information yesterday when I first
tried 
killing fvwm2...  I didn't think that would take down the entire X
server...
Live & learn... :^)  After restarting X, I have not yet seen this problem 
repeat itself yet.

In the early stages of the looping problem (before I noticed the dual 
processes and kill) I used "System Utilities -> Task Bar" from DT to 
restart it), I thought I saw a pattern developing:
- have lots of windows open (I had 19)
- have a program which generated a wide bubble (Netscape w/long URL)
- move mouse over NS whose bubble would overlap several rightmost
  task buttons (3)
- looping starts
In this early stage, I found that I could get to NS and avoid the 
looping by switching between desktops without invoking a large 
bubble and carefully maneouvering the mouse around the vdt to the 
edge of the screen to get at NS which was in the bottom-right pane.

This was after the initial start of the problem, when the task bar 
had been restarted each time; so, I can't confirm that the original 
looping started this way.  Once looping starts, restarting the taskbar 
provides only very temporary relief; the X server must [apparently :^] 
be restarted to resolve the issue completely...

I will keep an eye out for this problem and try gdb (not very familiar 
with it; but had a quick glance at the info pages).  Please let me know
there are specific commands I should try...  

I saved the core dump in case it might be of use.

HTH,
Pierre

Only those with seriously broken connections.  If you persist in this, you
will find that your mail doesn't get to a lot of places.  Of course, you'll
never know since _you can't get the bounces_!

If you use the hpc.uh.edu addresses for the time being you won't get
blocked there, but I can't say how long that will continue to work.

I suggest you relay all mail through your ISPs mail server (they should do
proper envelope rewrites) and if you are and they're not, then complain.
Note that if you aren't relaying through your provider then you're breaking
anther cardinal law and may be blocked by anyone running DUL checking (see
http://maps.vix.com/dul/) which is soon to be me in an attempt to crack
down on more spam.

I can't really suggest how to make your MTA cope with this situation.  The
bottom line is that you can't just make up a hostname and expect the world
to cope with it.

	I've been thinking about theme capabilities of fvwm for awhile
now.  I like the way that fvwm.themes.org lays things out (for the most
part anyway ) and I agree that we don't need to crunch on fvwm itself to
implement themes.

I think that themes can and should be handled in a module (say FvwmTheme)
that allows you to have multiple themes installed, and allows you to
select your 'theme' from a menu (as FvwmAnimate does it) rather than
editing / symlinking files.

I intend to write such a module... But I am not too familiar with the
module interface so I have a little bit of learning to do.  My main goals
are as follows:

	* Provide easy-to-use theme selection mechanism
	* Use 'standard' fvwm config options to achieve themes

I would also like to do the following, but as an added bonus, not as a
main development goal:

	* Provide for the ability to use other wm themes (ie: windowmaker)
	   (obviously, not 100%, but we could probably get pretty close)


Are there any other capabilities that any of you are interested in (or
aware of other people being interested in)? 

I think that I could have this together by the 2.4 release time-frame...
What is the procedure for adding a module to the distribution?  

Thoughts on this would be appreciated,

Jay

Maybe... the docs are quite unclear about it.  They only mention running
autoconf: it seems to be more geared towards deep packages where you
have lots of configure.in's; autoreconf will autoconf all of them.

Maybe it does the other stuff, too.

Now I'm confused.  Over on the Gnome list they're talking about Fvwm with
Gnome support and Jay (one of them...) is distributing a tarball.  Is this
stuff in CVS?  It needs to be, even if it's on a private branch.  The whole
point of CVS is so that we don't get a bunch of tarballs and odd patches
floating about which confuse the users.

	                  ReadXServer.c 

Log message:
- Removed form limitations including:
number of lines in a form.
number of items in a form.
number of items in a line.
number of selections in a choice.
number of commands on a button.
Colors can be changed anywhere in a form.
Fonts can be changed anywhere in a form.

- Changed the general organization of the module to match FvwmAnimate.
See comments in FvwmAnimate to see what it mimicks.
Some parts of this module have comments containing "FvwmAnimate"
are common module/macro candidates.
Changed debugging technique to match FvwmAnimate with the
additional ability to Debug to File.

- Configurability updates:
Form appearance can be configured globaly:
Form defaults are read from .FvwmForm.
There is a built in Default setting/saving dialogue.
Forms can be read in directly from a file.
The file is the alias with a leading dot.
The file is in $HOME or the system configuration directory.
Comes with forms installed in the system configuration directory.

- Operability:
You can tab to previous input field with ^P, Up arrow, shift tab.

- This module now has a configuration proceedure:
AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "FvwmForm Defaults" FvwmForm FormFvwmForm

- Use FvwmAnimate command parsing.
The part of the command after the module name is no longer case sensitive.
Use command tables instead of huge "else if".

- Misc:
Avoid core when choice not preceeded by a selection.
Rename union member "select" so it doesn't conflict with the function.
You can now control vertical spacing on text.  By default text is spaced
vertically the way you would want it for buttons.
This is for compatibility.  Now you can change the spacing to zero as
you might want for a help panel.
A button can execute a synchronous shell command.  The first use I
put this is a form that writes its new definition to a file and
reinvokes itself.
Use SendText instead of writes to pipe.
Changed button press-in effect from 1 sec to .1 sec.  Didn't seem to
do anything on a slow machine...
Added preload arg, and Map, Stop and UnMap commands for fast forms.
(FvwmForm is now parsing commands during form display.)
Add "Message" command, display "Error" and "String" messages from fvwm.
Removed CopyNString, strdup replaces it.

Yes I did.

Just now, I tried again.   It looks like my changes  got in this time.
I first did "cvs update  -dP", then a  "cvs commit" from the "modules"
directory.  I have a vague memory of being told not to try to commit
with ../ChangeLog type file references.  I don't know if thats
what was behind this.

After the "update", I noticed   that not all the "Makefile.in"   files
were gone from the source tree.  After the commit, I saw lots of stuff
like this:

Checking in FvwmWinList/Makefile.in;
/home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm/modules/FvwmWinList/Attic/Makefile.in,v  <--  Makefile.in
new revision: 1.20; previous revision: 1.19

which doesn't look too good.  Sorry if I'm causing a mess, but between us,
I figure we will sort it out.

I'm going to get some lunch, I'll check in later...

I neglected to mention, the "preload" and "message" features
are not documented, since I'm not satisfied with the way they currently
work.  Consider them prototypes.

It does.  I just tried it from my machine at home.  After "cvs update",
all the stuff I removed last night got deleted.  Then

	automake --add-missing
	autoreconf

was enough to restore all the generated files.  

[It is too bad that autoreconf doesn't support passing the "--add-missing"
on to the automake it spawns.]

I don't understand this.  My advice is to do 

	find . -name Makefile.in -print | xargs rm
	cvs update
	autoreconf

from the top of the source tree.

Hi,

Is there any real reason to have separate pixmap & icon paths?  They are
by default set to the same value, but the code seems of several minds on
their use. 

LoadPicture() takes only one path parameter; it tries to load first as an
XPM (if support enabled), then as a XBM.

GetPicture() takes two path parameters, IconPath and PixmapPath.  It
searches for the picture on pixmap path, then icon path, and takes the
first found. 

CachePicture() also takes two path parameters.  However, if XPM is not
available, it will NOT search pixmap path.


To my mind, having two paths is confusing and annoying.  I think
LoadPicture() takes the right approach.  Should we move (back?) to a
single icon path, or is there a compelling reason for separating them that
I am missing?

Jay posted some patches to a beta of fvwm that added GNOME support, as I
recall.  I don't think he's posted anything the applies to 2.2 or 2.3.
Certainly it's not in the tree.

I agree.  In fact, without seeing the patches, I'd say they should go
into 2.3, not a private branch.  I didn't look at exactly what he'd done
last time, so I can't say how extensive the changes were.

If you are subscribed to the list, maybe you could post a note asking
them to send us the changes if they have them ready for 2.2?

I wonder if a better idea, now that you've checked in all those fvwmform
changes, might not be to release the checked out module and check out

I'm fairly sure that it is not possible to share X abstractions
across different connections, since the server allocates disjunct
ranges of 32-bit values to use for abstractions for every connection
(this is so that creating abstractions doesn't need a round-trip)

After 2.2, Jay asked on the list for updated patches for layers/
session management, which i provided a bit later. He then posted a
pointer to a tar file of fvwm-2.2+gnome+layers+session to the list
if i remember correctly. 

I will commit my part in this to cvs as soon as I am allowd to do it.
But before I do so, i'd like to ask about the general policy wrt to
cvs commits: Should changes of this size go to a private branch ?
Or is it ok to put them in the main trunk ?

If a window is shaded and moved, the window will be killed right now
since it gets a configure event with height == 0.

With this patch this won't happen, and I don't see the reason for
non-visible windows to know that you've been moved.
(Should go into the stable branch as well)

Animated shading coming to you within a few minutes...

I guess it goes on a case-by-case basis.

If it is one of the goals --- and I think that GNOME support is --- for
the next release, then to my mind the main branch is appropriate.

Well, we're unstable again so I say commit them to the mainline.  That's
the whole point.  If we were farther away from the unstable split we would
have to be more cautious but the purpose of splitting off the stable branch
is so that we can break the mainline.

The only stringent requirement now is that we agree that the functionality
is something we want in there (it is) and, of course, that the commit
message explains what's going on (since we all read the commit messages).
And of course, for good ChangeLog entries.

So let's have it!

Here goes..

It adds a new command, WindowShadeAnimate <steps> , which says how many
steps there should be in the animation. Default is 0 (or should that be
changed?).

I've tried to crash it with all kids of weird stuff.. like shading a
window while fvwmbutton grabs it to place in it's own window.. It even
survived that.. 8)

Right.  I think the deal is this:

  * Bug fixes may be committed at any time (unless we're in code freeze
    for a release) usually without much review (unless you want someone
    else to look at it).

  * New features should be discussed on the list to ensure everyone
    thinks they're "appropriate" (one of the goals of fvwm is to be
    relatively efficient, remember, which means we don't necessarily
    want the kitchen sink).

  * If the new feature is large enough, unstable enough, or not
    targetted at the next release, it should go on a private branch.
    Otherwise, concensus will probably have it installed on the main
    branch.

That's my understanding, anyway.

Any nominations to give Tomas commit access?  Both patches look clean
although there are no ChangeLog entries.

BTW, should 'NO_ETERM_SUPPORT' be a runtime variable
(AnimatedMovesSendEvents or something)?  What's the tradeoff here?  Even
more round trips if you're doing Opaque or Animated moves?  I suppose that
if you're doing those you already don't care about bandwidth but it's
possible that you can handle an opaque move while your machine just falls
over with Eterm re-transparentizing itself every frame.

Hi there,
  After fvwm-2.2 was released, I updated my GNOME support patch to
fvwm-2.2; I then intigrated it with the session managment + layers patch
really, really late one night (I finished at about 3:00am on a work
night).  I wanted other GNOME people to look at it and see if I had done
anything wrong, so I made a full tarball and posted the URL to
gnome-hackers; it was extreamly popular and got forwarded to
gnome-announce.  It seems there are pleanty of people willing abandon E
and WindowMaker ;)  Anyways, I have gotten a list of bugs I need to fix,
plus I've already ran into one stack smash crash.

  I'm sorry for making a separate distribution instad of a patch; I was so
tired the night I worked on it all the energy I had left went into typing
'make distcheck'.  The dist tarball is at:

http://www.serv.net/~jpaint/download/fvwm-gnome-2.2.tar.gz

  I'll try to type up a e-mail to this list tomorrow of all my pending
issues with implimenting full GNOME support.  I'll definately need help
solving some of them.

Regards,
Jay Painter

That's encouraging.  I didn't realize that Miguel was an Fvwm user; we may
have a good shot at getting on tens of thousands of desktops (or perhaps
even more) in Mexico.

No big deal, I was just confused about seeing it forwarded to gnome-list
when I hadn't seen it here.

Ahh, good.  Note that Matthias can commit now; I think we should probably
move to get you committing directly to the tree as well.

Good Afternoon,

	I just finished converting the Module-writing web-pages into a DOC
file for palm-pilot users.  I don't know if anyone developing uses a
Palm-Pilot... but here it is anyway...

It might be a nice thing to add to the web-site in the module area.

On 27 February, 1999 - Jason L Tibbitts III sent me these 0,7K bytes:

Some ChangeLog stuff:

1999-02-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

* move.c (AnimatedMoveAnyWindow, moveLoop): Added a check for shaded
windows, since sending configure events with a 0 pix high window is
disliked by X.

1999-02-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

* builtins.c (WindowShade): Enhanced WindowShade() to do animation, with
the number of steps configured by the command 'WindowShadeAnimate
<steps>'
* builtins.c: New function 'setShadeAnim()', called by the Fvwm command
'WindowShadeAnimate', sets the animation steps used in WindowShade().
* parse.h: Added F_SHADE_ANIMATE
* misc.h: Function prototype for setShadeAnim().
* functions.c: Added Fvwm command 'WindowShadeAnimate <steps>'

> BTW, should 'NO_ETERM_SUPPORT' be a runtime variable
> (AnimatedMovesSendEvents or something)?  What's the tradeoff here?  Even

I have butt-slow machines (~ 486/25) and it's no problem what-so-ever
over here.. so unless someone uses transparent Eterms and full opaque
movement on a 8086 I don't see much of a problem with it.. 8)

Btw, I attached a new diff since setShadeAnim didn't work if there were
no args at all (segfault, stupid me), also this is without the other
patch included.

I don't think you  are missing anything.  I think  this is in the TODO
list somewhere.  You probably want to make  both commands point to the
same function, and document one of them as obsolete.

I believe the other objective we had in this regard was to install the
icons somewhere,  and have that directory at  the bottom of the pixmap
path, regardless of user settings of pixmappath.

	I'll vote yea.

	I wish I'd pushed for including animated windowshade in 2.2.
My idea of putting it into a module ran into a few problems that I
never had time to try to resolve (if they can be resolved). But I miss
the feature; I used the 2.0.46 version of the patch for a long time,
and never had any problems with it.

	I think a runtime variable would be best. But, then, I'll vote
for runtime configuration of most anything (where feasible) over static
build-time configuration.

It's nice to see more folks adding good code.

I would just like to remind people of a few "rules of the road":

 1) _Every_ change must be properly ChangeLogged.  If you use Emacs, you
    can do this oh-so-trivially with the C-x 4 a command; it will add a
    header (if it's a new day), the name of the file, and even the name
    of the function you're currently in.

    If you start adding them as you change functions, it'll soon become
    second-nature and we'll get proper changelogs.

 2) If you add a new user-visible feature, please add a blurb about it
    to the NEWS file.  A couple sentences is fine; don't repeat the
    documentation but give folks enough of an idea so they can decide if
    they want to learn more.  Bug fixes (unless they're _really_ user
    visible) shouldn't be noted in the NEWS file.

 3) If you add a new user-visible feature, please don't forget to update
    the appropriate man pages at the same time.

 4) Of course, compile and test before committing!

Welcome!

>From reading the source, it sends move events to the client as the window is
moved either by an animated or opaque move.  In both of these the window is
moving but previously fvwm didn't tell the client about it.  Thus the client
couldn't take notice of the fact that the window was changing position
until after the whole thing was done.

This only matters if the client cares where its window is at all times.
One such client is Eterm, which has extra knowledge of what's in the root
window and displays a darkened version of it as its window backgrounds.  It
makes for a cool effect if you prefer flash to readability.  With this
switch on it makes for a cooler (albeit mega-cpu-sucking) effect because
you can see things sliding over the root window.  Without it, it looks a
bit odd.

I think at this point it's pretty much redundant.  I only use pixmap
path in my .fvwm2rc, and it's loaded with icons.

Sorry for the confusion. You are right about the notation...
and as you probably guessed, the following does not work as I wanted:

Style BXT SloppyFocus
Style XTermButton ClickToFocus

No matter what I do, the BXT is not able to get the focus unless the mouse

pointer is located directly above it.

Yes.

If that is the case, then oughtn't the switch be called something more
descriptive than "NO_ETERM_SUPPORT"?

Sorry, I answered too quickly...
I was wrong, it is in fact possible to use abstractions
created via other connections. To cite the X Protocol
Reference Manual:

X does not provide any protection from unauthorized access
to individual windows, pixmaps or other abstactions, once
a connection has been made. For example, if an application
gets (or guesses) the abstract ID of a window it did not
create, using the QueryTree request, it can manipulate or
even destroy the window. This property was necessary so that
window managers could be written independently of the window
system. It is a matter of courtesy that applications other
than window managers do not attempt this sort of antisocial
behavior.

The only caveat is that the lifetime of an abstaction is
determined by the lifetime of the connection it was created
by (unless SetCloseDownMode is used). But this should not
be a problem in the case of fvwm and its modules.

I've just been reading through the fvwm2.1 manpage in the 2.2 release,
and have observed a concerning number of problems.  In essence, they
seem to be related to the fact that this release was called fvwm2 at
one stage and fvwm now.  I'm really confused.  When should the manpage
talk about fvwm and when about fvwm2?

Some examples:

- The title is wrong (.TH line): it talks about FVWM (2.xx), with date
  "late 20th century".

- Is the program called fvwm or fvwm2?

- What are the filenames and directory paths used?  Do they have fvwm2
  or fvwm components?

- The documentation for Restart appears to say that fvwm will restart
  itself if Restart fvwm2 is called, but fvwm/fvwm.c seems to restart
  itself if Restart fvwm is called.

Please could someone "in the know" have a good read of the manpage and
update it for FVWM 2.2, then let us know that it's been done?

Thanks,

   Julian

Hmm.  Yup, you're right:

  - Go to just one IconPath instead of PixmapPath too?

OK, I've implemented this and it compiles.  After testing a bit, I'll
commit.

One comment on headers:

Right now, there are some foo.h headers with declarations for stuff in
foo.c, but there are also conglomerations like misc.h and fvwmlib.h that
declare functions from several different .c files. I will say that I
vastly prefer the foo.c/foo.h paradigm, so I've moved some stuff from
fvwmlib.h to a new Picture.h.  Yell now if this is the wrong way to go!

I did.  PixmapPath will give a warning, then invoke IconPath.

About installing icons: there was also some interest in splitting the
icons into a WM-independent package.  I haven't heard any more on that
recently, but since

	* most of the icons have nothing to do with fvwm
and
	* few icons change between code releases

it doesn't make sense to have them ALL distributed with fvwm.  Sure, some
of the fvwm-specific ones should be included.  And it would be nice to
have a MINIMAL set of icons, for some generic stuff like xterms.  But
beyond that, I'd say the installer should just go and get a good icon
package independent of fvwm.

Anyway, I haven't done anything either way about this.

Hmm.  The "icons" directory holds "xpms" (Pixmaps).
Fvwm2 uses them for icons, and pixmap backgrounds.

I think I lean toward making "IconPath" the obsolete command,
but I can see reasons for using either one...

It is called fvwm2.  It *should* be called just fvwm, in my opinion.  It's
a trivial change that I'm MORE than happy to make.

Correspondingly, the config files should be named .fvwmrc NOT .fvwm2rc.

The module dir is by default /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/VERSION.  See
INSTALL.fvwm.

With my session and layer stuff in the tree,
I'd like to ask how the team thinks about
the following items:

 * Pick command (to avoid annoying multiple selections 
   with complex functions from root context) - TINY PATCH
 
 * All command (to execute a function for all windows
   matching certain conditions) - TINY PATCH

 * the "cube of wm-private states" (cf a thread back in jan.)
   ie shaded maximized windows and resizing of shaded windows.
   - LARGER

 * ICCCM2 compliance (the most visible thing here is probably 
   the ability to "take over" from a running ICCCM2-compliant WM)

Should I commit any of these to the main branch now ?

I was just gonna test that one..
Btw.. is it so wise to use layer 0 and 1 for "normal" and StaysOnTop
windows? There's no room for "StaysOnBottom" styled layers then...

I'd like more like this:
0 - Bottom
5 - Normal
9 - Top

Ideas?

Hm.. I don't really get it...

Sounds like a nice thing..

The ability to shade maximized windows would be very nice..

How large is it? Anyhow, I think it would be nice to be more compliant..

Do a 

DefaultLayers 9 5

0 and 1 are just the  "factory preset " values which are good
enough for backwards compatibility with old rc files.

Well.. with 5 and 9, it's like the old values (almost) but shifted up a
bit to allow room beneath... I think it's bad for the defaults to have
no room under the default layer...

On a slightly different issue, it would be nice if WinList and/or
Identify could tell me which layer a window is at now...

Shouldn't be too hard to hack in tho..

And it would be nice if 'Layer' supported
+number   - relative, higher layer
-number   - relative, lower layer
number    - absolute

I won't fight about this. But 0 and 1 are somehow canonical choices if
you want to cater for the old StaysOnTop/StaysPut model (there is *no*
StaysOnBottom to support there)

This is already there:

Layer number  is a relative layer change,
Layer 0 number  is absolute
Layer 0 -1  is a special case (goes back to the
            layer the window started in)

At least this it what it should do. Tell me if it doesn't
or if I failed to describe this understandably in the man page.

With regard to the layers stuff, GNOME already defines the meaning of the
layers.  As long as it's configurable we don't have any problems, but if
you want to go with what is already in use here are the definitions:

#define WIN_LAYER_DESKTOP                0
#define WIN_LAYER_BELOW                  2
#define WIN_LAYER_NORMAL                 4
#define WIN_LAYER_ONTOP                  6
#define WIN_LAYER_DOCK                   8
#define WIN_LAYER_ABOVE_DOCK             10
#define WIN_LAYER_MENU                   12

normal windows get set to layer 4 under this scheme.

Regards,
Jay

Ok.. after using layers a bit now, I have some reports about it..

It doesn't actually seem to make use of/care about the layers until
you've tried to raise/lower (non-layer raise/lower funcs) the windows.

My scenario:
Startup (in order of start/appear):
Style stuff read.
FvwmButtons        (Layer 4)
2 xterms           (Layer 5)
xconsole           (Layer 3)
FvwmPager          (Layer 6)
transp. Eterm      (Layer 0)
transp. xdaliclock (Layer 0)

After startup, the stacking order looks like this (bottom -> top):
FvwmButtons (L4)
xconsole (L3)
one of the xterms (the first started) (L5)
xdaliclock (L0)
the other xterm (second started) (L5)
FvwmPager (L6)
Eterm (L0)

After applying 'Lower' to all windows they are in the correct order.

It definately looks like all windows are actually in Layer 0 (or
something) when starting, because when I 'Lower'd one of the xterms
(that was behind the other) it actually popped UP, above the other.

After that is done, it's all great and wonderful (for those windows).
When adding new windows, they seem to end up in some random layer(?) ...
I started a new xterm, and it ended up above the fvwmpager (shouldn't
happen), and Raised the xterm. Plopp, went below the pager (as it
should).

Hello,

The "extras"  directory was, historically, a place to dump modules that
didn't configure or build with ease.  The extras now all -- in principle
-- configure and build with ease.  Now that we're back in "big change" 
mode, I'd like to propose erasing the distinction between TRUE modules and
SECOND-CLASS "extra" modules. 

In other words: let's change the "extras" into "modules", and get rid of
the --enable-extras configure switch.

During the reorganisation, we might also drop old and obsolete code.  My
proposal for promoting or droping the extras is as follows:

* Promote the following to modules: FvwmCommand, FvwmConsole, FvwmDebug,
  FvwmScript, and FvwmTaskBar.

* Drop FvwmConfig because the author's documentation says it is
  "braindead" and he "discourages its use".

* Drop FvwmGoodStuff: obsoleted by FvwmButtons.

* Drop FvwmPipe: similar functionality is obtained using FvwmCommand.

* Possibly drop FvwmWharf: the README included suggests it is not at all
  stable, and it hasn't been maintained for a while.  I lean towards
  dropping it.

Erm, the manpage NAME section calls it fvwm2, but the SYNOPSIS
section says fvwm [options].  There are also a bewildering mixture of
occurrences of both fvwm and fvwm2, sometimes within the same
paragraph.  I'd be more than willing to help rewrite the manpage if
that's wanted.  There are also some references and fvwm-2.0.

Also, the INSTALL.fvwm doc talks about version 2.2.0, whereas the
current version is released as 2.2.

> Correspondingly, the config files should be named .fvwmrc NOT .fvwm2rc.

OK.  But one has to account for the possibility that .fvwmrc might be
the OLD config file.

Oh, yes.  Duh!

So, if you get rid of PixmapPath, is it obvious where i'm supposed to
put pixmaps for titlebar gradients & menus?

I would REALLY like to have a "StaysOnBottom" style that places windows
in Layer 0 as a user-friendly shortcut.  Let's not use layer 0 as a
"factory preset " value.

	I use FvwmCommand and FvwmConsole constantly, and would certainly vote
for their promotion. The other three I don't really use, and don't have
an opinion on them.

	I'll second these two.

	I'll defer to others on this one, since I don't use it.

	If the README statement is indeed accurate, that's a persuasive
argument for dropping it. Does anyone actually use this? And is
AfterStep officially a dead horse?

Sounds like this is what we want to do, or at least follow internally. 
Especially if we're moving towards "Gnome Compliance". 

Also, Matt, "Backwards compatible" != ignoring future enhancements. 
Using layers 1 and 2 by default are just as backwards compatible as 0 &
1, while letting us automatically take (nearly) full advantage of
/having/ layers.  

Let's not grow an extra leg and then chop off the foot here.  We need to
make it as easy for novice/intermediate users as it is for experienced
ones.

The one "pixmap" directory that *should* always be included in any fvwm
compile is is /<path-to-x-tree>/include/X11/pixmaps. Besides that, *maybe*
an fvwm specific one like /<path-to-fvwm-tree>/icons.

Anything local should be added to those. If it had the same soft of variable
substitution that was suggested for ModulePath it would be very helpful when
using the same .fvwm2rc file across platforms with different versions of X
installations.

>> is AfterStep officially a dead horse?

Afterstep isn't dead, they just released v.1.6.

The FvwmWharf is the same version as the Wharf from AS 1.0, and it is
STABLE.  Remember this is from the old days where they actually _fixed_
bugs over there.

There is a new version of the Wharf distributed with AfterStep 1.4+, but
the last time i looked at that, it didn't work on my older linux
system.  The only new enhancement was the ability to nest buttonbars as
deep as you wanted.

FvwmButtons has to include the following features to completely
supersede the Wharf:


1) Be able to layer several xpms together on one button. 
  
   I may indicate that a button opens another buttonbar of computers 
   to telnet to by overlapping a monitor, networkcable, and arrow xpm, 
   then reuse the same monitor xpm on each of the telnet buttons.  
   The Warf's Icon parameter can take a comma separated list of icons.


2) Have some sort of "hide" feature where middle clicking on the main
buttonbar shrinks it down to just one button in the nearest corner of
the screen.  

    This differs from current functionality because the one button 
    displayed still performs the same function as it did before. 
    This could be tricky when the buttons can be different sizes as
    they can be in fvwmbuttons.


These are the two reasons I still use the Wharf, they are very useful
features.  FvwmButtons has all the other Wharf functionality and then
some, which is nice.

Subject: Removing Titlebar buttons... Is it possible?

Hey everyone,

	I've been working on theme-support (a sorta proof-of-concept /
prototype program) and I've noticed something interesting.  

You cannot remove a button from the title-bar once it has been added.

As I understand it, buttons are added to the titlebar once an action is
bound on them (via Mouse)...  However, there doesn't seem to be a way to
remove them once they are there.  You seem to be able to remove the
binding by specifying '-' for the action (the way you do for a Key
binding).  If you do this, the binding goes away, but the button is left
on the title-bar... there doesn't seem to be a way to remove it.  Not even
a recapture does it. Am I just missing something or ... ?

The reason I ask is that in order to switch themes without restarting
fvwm, the theme-module needs to be able to remove the old bindings (and
hence the buttons).  Otherwise, when we switch from theme A, which uses
all 8 buttons, to theme B which only uses 3, the 5 from the original theme
A are still hanging out on the title-bar.  This is the behavior that I
have noticed.  

Can someone shed some light for me?

Thanks,

Jay

OK, that's good news.  I don't use it, and was just going by the README.

I'm happy to keep anything that is useful.

	Then I think we should keep it.

	I'm fairly ambivalent about the issue of getting rid of the extras
directory. I really don't see it as a problem, and certain modules taken
from other WM's would seem to be logical candidates for placing there -
like the Wharf and the TaskBar.

	I do think FvwmCommand and FvwmConsole should be promoted, however.

Log message:
Backed out of yesterday's patch to allow setting FVWM_MODULEDIR at
configure time.  The problem is: if you DO NOT set it, and run
configure from an xterm started by fvwm (and who doesn't ? :) then
you're hosed because fvwm exports FVWM_MODULEDIR itself.

Sorry, Julian.
