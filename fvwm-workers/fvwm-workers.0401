Hitting F11 makes the browser window randomly disappear.. it even disappears
from the windowlist.. but the process is still running.

With MozillaFirebird(0.7) there was a disappearance rate of 100% on 2.5.7 ..
didn't file a bug report then because I thought it might be a Firebird
problem.. but after upgrading to 2.5.8 it randomly disappears.

And the problem also exists on Mozilla 1.4 + fvwm 2.5.8

Plus the titlebar/borders don't disappear in fullscreen mode.(the border is
only visible on the left so it looks ugly)

(I think on 2.5.8 the window mostly disappears while resizing back to normal
size.)

These are the messages I found in the xsession logs...

For Firebird....

I have the following style for gkrellm ...

Style "gkrellm" Sticky, WindowListSkip, StaysOnTop, CirculateSkip, BorderWidth 0, NoTitle, NoHandles, ClickToFocus

Under 2.5.7 both mplayer and tvtime went to fullscreen perfectly okay.(ie.
fullscreen and on top of all other windows)

Under 2.5.8 the gkrellm window ends up on top of tvtime even when it's on
fullscreen. But mplayer works perfectly as before.

I've not made any changes to the config.. and the only layer related note in
the changelog is about the !Layer condition.

What could be the issue and how do I get tvtime to go fullscreen ?

Just to let you know that I can't reproduce this with MozillaFirebird
0.6.1 (no time to upgrade now) and Mozilla 1.4.

When I press F11 the browser windows go into the fullscreen mode without
decorations and never disappear.

I can see some weird problem with Mozilla (but not MozillaFirebird)
that is not what you describe, i.e. when returning from fullscreen mode,
after receiving the original geometry, Mozilla immediattely moves itself
into +0+0 position.

If you press Alt-Tab (WindowList) do you see "disappeared" windows?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I downgraded to 2.5.7 to test .. and Mozilla1.4 goes to fullscreen as
expected without any visible borders. Firebird though disappears the moment I
hit F11.

Mozilla1.4 takes around 6-7 hits of F11 before it disappears.

Pressed F11 100 times in Mozilla 1.4, it does not disappear.

Just a bad repositioning/jump to +0+0 on un-fullscreen.

Pressed F11 100 time in MozillaFirebird 0.6.1, there is no any problem.

Then we use either different fvwm or mozilla versions.

Do you see empty output or a line with _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN when you
run the following in xterm:

  xprop | grep _NET_WM_STATE

and select a full-screen mozilla?

It seems that currently a window in FULLSCREEN state is simply raised, I
think it may be placed into layer 10 too, or this may be configurable.

So, it just quits (or dumps core)? What does "ps" say?

Ok, I will let Olivier to continue this thread.

I notice that too (the titlebar gets placed outside the screen).

There is no output on both Mozilla and Firebird.

This functionality has changed between 2.5.7 and 2.5.8 .. in 2.5.7 both
mozilla and tvtime go fullscreen and on top... but in 2.5.8 gkrellm stays on
top of both the apps.

It neither quits nor dumps core!! You can still see it running in the output
of top/ps .. and it seems to be working okay.. because starting a second
instance of Firebird causes a "new window" to be opened.(It's not a fresh
instance of Firebird because it doesn't load my home page.)

Hello,

First some clarifications. 2.5.8 support the ewmh way to go full screen
(_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN) and 2.5.7 does not. I can reproduce the
mozilla disappearing problem with 2.5.7, I cannot with 2.5.8.

One point is that an application (here mozilla) can use different
method to go full screen regardless the fact the wm support or not the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN state. If you switch from 2.5.7 to 2.5.8 with
a restart, mozilla can think that 2.5.8 does not support the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN state.

About layer. It will be good to have fullscreenLayer style, we have
not. But you should try:

	Style * EWMHUseStackingOrderHints

which puts (ewmh) full screen window at the default top layer.

Yes, when I test this my conclusion was that this is a mozilla bug
(mozilla ask this, maybe there is a style workaround).

This is what I was doing until now... I now added "fvwm2" to the last line of
my .xinitrc and exited fvwm... and a new instance started up.

Now Mozilla/Firebird disappear more frequently than before... and even when
they do go full screen they still have the border and titlebar.

This helped fix the problems of gkrellm staying on top of other full screened
applications.
[ie., tvtime now runs on Layer 4 in windowed mode, and Layer 6 in full screen.]

But is it really necessary to add that line because everything was working
fine on 2.5.7 even without that extra line. Since this is "expected behavior"
wouldn't it be better if it was turned on by default ?(ie., not having to
turn it on in the config.

Neither Olivier nor me may reproduce decorations and disappearing.

Are you sure you run the final 2.5.8 or later and not something else?

Please start FvwmConsole and report what is the FvwmConsole version
you see, then execute this command in FvwmConsole and report what is
the fvwm version you see:

  Exec xterm -e 'echo "$[version.line]"; sleep 30'

Please use "fvwm", not "fvwm2" to start fvwm, and verify your $PATH.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does someone else that is sure to run 2.5.8 and mozilla 1.4 or
a recent Firebird can reproduce this?

It does not work fine with 2.5.7. For example, with gnome-terminal 2
and others gnome2 apps full screen does not work at all. Also, mozilla
some time disappeared :o/

I do not know what is the "expected behavior" about layer of
fullscreen window. I do not think that there is an expected behavior
at all about layer of windows regarding theirs type. This depends on
the apps and of your general setup. Here, everything is configured so
that every windows has layer 4. For example, when I use mozilla in
fullscreen mode I may want to take a look to my download manager or to
gkrellm. As everything as layer 4 I just have to raise/lower.  There
is also an interesting complaint from a gimp developer and gimp
fullscreen with some wm which use the "expected behavior" (moreover as
it is the/a non configurable wm you cannot "fix" the problem).

I am sure that you can configure fvwm to use layer and get a
functional desktop. Typically, one want to have certain app as the
TaskBar or gkrellm on top. This is fine for me.  However, I do not use
layers because I think that there is a more powerful method which is
conditional auto-raise:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: *
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: PassId
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: enter_window FuncFvwmEnterWindow
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: leave_window FuncFvwmLeaveWindow

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmEnterWindow
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmEnterWindow
+ I WindowId $0 (gkrellm) Raise
+ I WindowId $0 (FvwmTaskBar) Raise
+ I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager*) Raise
# ...etc

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmSpecialRaise
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmSpecialRaise
+ I All (gkrellm) Raise
+ I All (FvwmTaskBar) Raise
+ I All (FvwmPager*) Raise
# ...etc

# a key binding for FuncFvwmSpecialRaise

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmLeaveWindow
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmLeaveWindow
# one may want to auto lower certain app (or cancel scheduled
# cmd)

This is just the idea, one may use the schedule cmd to get a delay.

When you have no layer you have your full desktop to work with normal
applications. With conditional autoraise some special apps are easy to
access/view.

This is just the way *I* work with my computer. Again, one can prefer
layers. The good point is that I hope fvwm can be configured to fit
the needs of most users. Also, I think that using a non configurable
wm has some advantage for some users.

xterm: Can't execvp echo "fvwm 2.5.8 compiled on Jan  4 2004 at 03:53:03";
sleep 30: No such file or directory

fvwm2 is a symlink to fvwm.(created by the fvwm rpm.) and the PATH is okay.

IAC I tried with fvwm... still no change..

I also tried out the latest snapshot... 

*FvwmConsole version 2.5.9 (snap-20040104)

with no change in the issues.

Tried this with the latest snapshot 20040104 ...

Mozilla and Firebird in full screen mode come up under gkrellm .. and there

Indeed, old xterm versions (with XFree86 4.0.x or older) do not support
this -e syntax, but newer xterms support.

Ok, then I have no explanation why your mozilla does not use the EWMH
method of fullscreen, maybe it is built without EWMH support (unlikely).

There is one more speculation. Restarting fvwm (and even X) does not
guarantee that mozilla [server] is killed, so you may still run the old
mozilla that thinks fvwm does not support _NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN.
I do not want to suggest reboot, but you may try to kill all mozilla like
browsers listed in "ps" and start them again in fvwm 2.5.8.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Maybe EWMH support is disabled in fvwm?  What is the output of

 $ fvwm --version

?

Or some or all of the EWMH hints may be disabled in the fvwm
config file.

No... the problem is with the quotes... xterm is trying to exec a file named
``  echo "fvwm 2.5.8 compiled on Jan  4 2004 at 03:53:03"; sleep 30  ''

I'm on XFree86 4.2

I'm using the contrib gtk2 rpms from mozilla.org(1.4) and fedora(firebird)...

Have been doing that throughout "ps ax |grep -i moz" returns only itself!
(You can't start an instance of Mozilla/Firebird if the other is running.. it
opens a new window of the existing browser!)

fvwm 2.5.9 (snap-20040104) compiled on Jan  5 2004 at 15:38:24
with support for: ReadLine, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Xinerama,
XRender, XFT, NLS

The only ewmh related line in the config file is 

Style * EWMHUseStackingOrderHints

which I had to add now to get tvtime to full-screen on top of all
apps(gkrellm)

And that worked.. so I'm assuming that EWMH support is enabled.

xprop on a fullscreen tvtime window gives...

_NET_WM_STATE(ATOM) = _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE, _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN, _NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP

It looks like EWMH full screen support works fine in fvwm-2.5.9,
but mozilla and firebird do not use it for some reason.  If they
did, fvwm would set the _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN property.  That
explains why you still have borders on the browser windows.

In the past, fvwm did not announce that it supports the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN protocol, but that is fixed in 2.5.9
(and 2.5.8, I think).

All I have is a wild guess:  maybe mozilla/firebird remember that
the WM does not support _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN and does not try
to use it.  Try to kill all running instances of the browsers,
then move their config directiories and restart them with an
empty config.

On 2.5.7 it goes into fullscreen without borders!(Mozilla 1.4 does...
Firebird just disappears)

Just created a new user on the machine.. and launched Mozilla/Firebird as
that user... still face the same issues.

I was having the same sort of problem until I finally noticed that gkrellm was setting its own layer.
If you bring up the config windows for gkrellm and select General->Properties uncheck 'Set on top' and 'Set below'

xterm from XFree86 4.3 is smart to pass this command to the shell.

What I mean is that it is likely that mozilla has 2 ways to go to
fullscreen, one is for window managers that do not set
_NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN on windows and one for window managers that do.
It is possible, you should quit mozilla completely for it to switch its
way of doing fullscreen.

But since you get the same results with a new user, this does not seem to
be relevant.

If nothing else helps (try to install rpms from mozilla.org), then
use Ctrl-Shift-F11 to fullscreen any window similarly to fvwm-themes:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) WindowStyle Title, Borders
  + I TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title, !Borders
  + I TestRc (!Match) Raise
  + I TestRc (!Match) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize ewmhiwa

  Key F11  A  SC  Pick FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen

Regards,
Mikhael.

I like gkrellm to be on the top of all regular windows... only the fullscreen
windows should be over gkrellm... everything worked this way in 2.5.7 but
something changed between 2.5.7 and 2.5.8 is.. mplayer goes over gkrellm ..
and tvtime doesn't!

Olivier's suggestion of adding ...

Style * EWMHUseStackingOrderHints 

fixes the issue... so for now my desktop is back to normal.

Congratulations, Felix.

The submitted logo is black-on-white:

  http://www.fvwm.org/logo-competition/logos/Felix_E_Klee/feline.png

I would like to ask you to convert it to some useful formats:

  * make the logo variant that is colorful by applying some nice texture
  * make the logo variant that is transparent
  * make the logo variant sutable for FvwmBanner (no white background)
  * make the logo variant looking well on the dark background
  * make the logo variant sutable for the side image in menus

Here is an idea for a nice texture (this image is used by FvwmBanner
in fvwm-themes):

Regards,
Mikhael.

Felix, could you please send to us the logo in a
(linux-compatible) vector format so that we can play around
with it? I would like to create a version for the web page
and also provide some versions for download on the web page.

Cheers, Uwe

If possible, I will take care of that this evening. I might, however,
not find the time to create all the variations right away because I'm
currently very much under pressure.

   Hi.  I'm having a slight problem I can't figure out with
respect to running something from near the head of the CVS
tree, which reports itself as 2.5.9.  On 2.4.4, FvwmPager
seems to take the Color (call its argument "A/B") that I
have specified in 'Style "*"' as the background color of
non-highlighted windows.  But, under 2.5.9, this doesn't
work.  They are currently white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds, with
a B foreground color.  So, it's clearly getting *something*
from the Style * Color arg, but not getting it right.

   It should be noted that this is not a problem in the inactive
window borders and titlebars, just in FvwmPager.

   Is this a FvwmPager bug?

                           - Chris

   Doh.   Ignore this.  It was my fault.  It was running
the old Fvwm 2.4.4 FvwmPager module, not the current
one.  It works just fine with the current module.

   Sorry for the excess email...  :-)

   Hey there.  I'm trying to add a new feature that I'd been
looking for, and have it mostly working.  I would like to
be able to bind certain menuitems to react differently if
you're holding down a modifier.  I've developed a syntax
for this, by way of a whole new menuitem type.  And, when
I open the menu, it maps correctly.  And when I hold down
the "shift" key, it adds the suffix to the normal menuitem
label ([0]).  However, when I release that modifier, it doesn't
revert as it should, until I pass over it with my mouse
thus highlighting and dehilighting that item.

   Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

   I'm modifying things in the MenuItem* directly, and then
calling:

get_menu_paint_item_parameters(&mpip, mr, mi, NULL, NULL, False);
menuitem_paint(mi, &mpip);

   As noted, it works just fine when I'm appending to
the previous label, but not when I changing the label
to the previous shorter string.

   Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the array of labels
are to be used for?  Why are there an array of labels?
In what situation would they be used?

   Thanks.  Any help would be appriciated...

                       - Chris

OK, I put together some stuff and made it available on
    http://sites.inka.de/klee/fvwm/logos
As mentioned on that page, I plan to provide more versions in the next
couple of weeks, as soon as time permits. But I think the images on that
page are already usable.

BTW, what about the other logos that were submitted for the competition?
I think they should get some permanent web space (maybe in some section
concerning themes). After all people contributed a lot of time and many
logos look very good. It would be a pity if they were lost.

Hi there, using FvwmTaskBar in fvwm-2.5.8, I am unable to get a right
margin if I disable the Start button. 

I have a ButtonBar that stretches the entire Right side of my screen and
sits on top of the TaskBar, covering the "Clock" area (which I have
disabled), I would like to make sure that buttons on the TaskBar dont get
obscured by the ButtonBar by using a WindowButtonsRightMargin, but I cant
get it to work with my configuration, this patch gets it to work:

   Well, as it happens, I figured out the problem with
modifying the menu item.  It was just an issue of
the code not clearing the menuitem window area before
drawing a substring.  I got that fixed now, so it clears
the whole area before drawing in the case of the new
feature I added.

   Okay, included here are a description and patches for
the new keyword I added.  This keyword will allow me
to define menuitems that change based on modifier
key-presses.  The patch is based on the HEAD of the
CVS tree as of today (14-Jan-2004).

   Much feedback welcome from all!  Please, let me know
any thoughts you have!  Thanks!

                            - Chris

The new ModSwitch keyword
-------------------------

  This is intended to solve a problem I've been looking to
solve.  I sometimes have menu items duplicated, with only
one minor change (as an example, ssh'ing into a remote host,
one without X port forwarding, one with.)  What I decided
the cleanest solution would be, to reduce the size of my
menu's, would be to have menuitems that would have different
labels and/or actions when you held a modifier key.

  To implement this, my first pass was the here-described
ModSwitch keyword.  When used as follows:

AddToMenu RemoteLogins	"Menu"	Title
+ "Tomcat"	ModSwitch N ( "" Exec exec xterm -e ssh tomcat ) \
			S ( " w/ X fwd" Exec exec xterm -e ssh -R 6000:127.0.0.1:6000 tomcat )
+ "Sphynx"	Exec exec xterm -e ssh sphynx

  Would cause the top [non-Title] menuitem in that menu
to ssh in without extra command line args, unless you
hold Shift, in which case it will do X forwarding
through 127.0.0.1.

  This syntax is just what I came up with.  If anyone
has any better ideas for syntax, then please convince
me.  I'd be happy to change it if a better option
presents itself.

  Caveats/ToDo's:

  - When the menu draws, the correct string isn't
displayed until you move the mouse into the menu.
I must be missing a place where I should put a
call to dink with the menuitems.
  - When you hold modifiers that don't match any
listed ones, it maintains the previous state,
instead of doing "something else".  Should there
be a concept of a "default"?  Same as N?
  - I only mess with label[0].  Why do MenuItems
even have an array of labels?  I couldn't figure
that out while I was in there...
  - I don't pre-initialize the label or action
when the config is parsed.  So, for a little while,
ModSwitch is the action.  I've got it mapped to
CMD_Beep right now, since it shouldn't really do
anything as an "action" or "command", but.  Perhaps
I should just ensure that it can never be called
in the first place by reconfiguring action and
label when it's initially scanned.
  - I'm not careful to figure out how to initialize
or not, and free if necessary, the copies of the
original label and action.
  - Right now the top-level label (before the ModSwitch
keyword) is a base, and the other string it appended
to it.  You could do "" at top, and use the new string
in each mod-switch-spec, to do whole replacement.
Should I code it to work that way instead?  This
falls back under syntax...

  Anyway.  Lots of questions, and I'd love to
hear opinions...

Subject: Boost Protein Expression by Codon Optimization

Dear Colleague,

Happy New Year!

As we know, codon preference among different species could be dramatically =
different.  To enhance the expression level of a foreign protein in a parti=
cular expression system (E.coli, Yeast, Insect, or Mammalian cell), it is v=
ery important to adjust the codon frequency of the foreign protein to match=
 that of the host expression system.  One classic example is GFP (green flu=
orescent protein) which was optimized to achieve high-level of expression i=
n mammalian cells.=20

GenScript has developed a proprietary algorithm for codon optimization.  Th=
is algorithm can optimize sequences for protein expression using either you=
r own codon usage table or those from publicly available codon usage databa=
se.  It can converts your amino acid sequence into a DNA sequence with over=
all codon usage similar to a specified organism, and also optimizes the RNA=
 secondary structure, GC content, repetitive codons etc. Using Genscript op=
timized synthetic genes, many of our customers have reported dramatic incre=
ase on protein expression.=20

The optimized gene can be synthesized by GenScript gene synthesis technolog=
y with 100% fidelity.  The cost is as low as $2.35 per base pair.  Our serv=
ice is very flexible, we can clone the optimized gene into our standard vec=
tors (without extra charge), or any expression vector that you provide (for=
 $400 extra charge).

Gene synthesis is a powerful technology and it has many other applications.=
  Another application example is to replace PCR Cloning.  Please visit our =
web (http://www.genscript.com/gene_synthesis.html) to learn more about this=
 technology.=20=20

Besides Gene Synthesis, we also provide custom vector-based siRNA, siRNA ca=
ssette, peptide, oligo, cloning and protein expression, biochemical reagent=
s, and labwares.  Please visit our web site (http://www.genscript.com) to l=
earn more about our services.

Hi there,

A couple of weeks  ago  I  reported  an  nerving  beep  when
opening  FvwmWindowList  or  menus  of some programs. In the
last days I used FrameMaker which shows this behaviour quite
often  when  a  submenu  is  opened and closed. I added some
debug statement to 2.5.7 to see where the beep  comes  from.
It says that the beep comes from functions.c [987]: 

	/* we have to grab buttons before executing immediate actions because
	 * these actions can move the window away from the pointer so that a
	 * button release would go to the application below. */
	if (!GrabEm(CRS_NONE, GRAB_NORMAL))
	{
		func->use_depth--;
		fprintf(stderr,"*** FVWM Bell: %s line %d ***\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);
		cf_cleanup(&depth, arguments);
		return;
	}

I have no idea what this code does. The beep in conjuntion
with FvwmWindowList comes from the same source.

Cheers, Uwe

The code grabs the pointer before executing any complex function.
As it fails, another application must have already grabbed the
pointer.  Is it essential to grab the pointer before starting the
menu as it may otherwise not get the button release event which is
important for menu operation.

Okay. Is there a way to find out which application has
grabbed the pointer?

Nothing special I guess: 

Fvwm is running. A couple of applications have been started.
I do a middle click on the root window which is defined as:

Mouse 2 R A Module  FvwmWinList -transient
Mouse 2 A 4 Module  FvwmWinList -transient

(http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/Ablage/beep.jpg)

When FvwmWinList is opened I wait for 2 seconds while moving
the mouse pointer up and down over FvwmWinList until 2 beeps
occur. 

The problem does not occur if I run fvwm with an empty
config. If I find the time I could try to find out which
parts of my config causes this problem.

Cheers, Uwe

Use

	fprintf(stderr,"*** FVWM Bell: Abort function %s\n", action);

in the place of

	fprintf(stderr,"*** FVWM Bell: %s line %d ***\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);

the you will know which function cause the beep (maybe a scheduled
function?).

Um, it's FvwmWinList of course.  It grabs the pointer when run in
transient mode, forcing you to close it before you can continue
working on the desktop.  The -transient option is meant to be used
this way:

  1. Click to open FvwmWinList.
  2. Drag pointer to item you want to activate.
  3. Select entry by releasing the mouse.
  4: FvwmWinList closes and releases the pointer.

You probably have soething running that sends commands to fvwm
while the pointer is grabbed.  Maybe FvwmWinList should grab the
whole X server.

FvwmWinList opens when I release the mouse pointer. When I
keep the mouse button pressed a little clock apears after a
while but not FvwmWinList.

Could it be that this is caused by FvwmEvent? After
disabling it the the prob seems to be gone.

Here is my setup:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Events

DestroyFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
AddToFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc I Next (CurrentPage State 2) Focus NoWarp
+ I None (CurrentPage Focused) Prev (CurrentPage !Iconified !Sticky) Focus NoWarp

*FvwmEvent: new_page CurrentPageFocusFunc 
*FvwmEvent: new_desk CurrentDeskFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: focus_change MarkWindowAsActiveFunc

Any suspicions?

Cheers, Uwe

I got:

*** FVWM Bell: functions.c line 987 [MarkWindowAsActiveFunc] ***

which comes from FvwmEvent. So I guess it is my fault :-\

I disable it for now.

FvwmScript seems to be broken when inputting text in UTF-8 locale.
Inputting characters within ASCII (first 127) works as expected, but
umlated characters and so on produces strange characters (and sometimes
just a rectangle, the font's "unknown" characters).
The font has the requested characters. I think there is something strange
going on as to how keyboard input is handled, maybe just one byte is read
for each keyboard event?

I do not think that it is your fault :o)

If you use my version of FVWM you never get these beeps (and the
function will be executed). But, for some reasons dominik does not
want that your setup work. The last thread on this subject start here:

ven 07 nov   Olivier Chapuis Re: FVWM: gkrellm and FVWM v2.5.8

on the fvwm workers list (there was an other thread on this subject
during the summer). I attach a patch (small) against the current cvs
which always execute totally immediate function.

I do not understand what you want to do with your FvwmEvent, but you
can apply the patch and see if it causes problem (when you use your
transient FvwmWinList or FrameMaker).

Regards, Olivier

I'm using the following config(see end of mail) for a panel which slides out
my licq main window... until 2.5.7 the window would slide out and slide back
in (32 steps both directions).

>From 2.5.8 onwards it slides out... but when retracting it goes away
instantly(0steps instead of the expected 32)

Same problem exists in 2.5.9(4/5th Jan snapshot.) too.

OK, I think I found where the problem is:

modules/FvwmScript/Widgets/TextField.c (line 522 onwards)

else if (i!=0)        /* Cas d'un caractere normal */
{
	/* Insertion du caractere dans le titre */
	/* a normal character: insertion in the title */
	Size=strlen(xobj->title);
		xobj->title=(char*)realloc(
		xobj->title,(2+Size)*sizeof(char));

	memmove(&xobj->title[NewPos+1],&xobj->title[NewPos],
		Size-NewPos+1);
		xobj->title[NewPos]=car[0];
		NewPos++;
		SendMsg(xobj,SingleClic);
}


No matter how many bytes are returned by XLookupString, only one byte
(the first) is inserted into the widgets textbuffer.
Also delete and moving (left, right) will need to be fixed.
Actually it will also not work with right-to-left text.

I think I will start to make it work for left-to-right text with no
combining characters in it (like the UTF-8-equivalent to ISO-8859-1/2
etc.)

Would this be filed as a "normal bug"?

Would you *please* stop spreading these rumours?  I really don't
understand why you have to provoke this argument again.  And it's
useless too, since if we keep haggling over features that won't be
implemented in 2.6 anyway, we will never get it done, and new
features will never be written.  Instead of focusing on these
discussions - which stop me from doing any fvwm work for one to
two months every time - how about doing some work towards the
release together instead?

Ciao

Yes, it describes the same I meant.

I have been running 2.5.7. at work for a while and want to
stay at this version since other users use this installation
as well - So I don't want to change for compatibility
reasons.

I use FvwmEvent to "remember" the focused window on the
current page. For the focused window FvwmEvent sets
windowstate 2. When I move to another page, move the pointer
and come back to a page I was before the last focused window
gets the focus again.

Since this does not work for all cases. I am not to unhappy
if I have to disable this function.

However, since this seems to be a general problem and you
have a solution to it, it should be considered to apply
this patch to avoid this problems in later versions.

Cheers, Uwe

Sure.  Actually, I don't understand exactly what a "anormal"
bug would be.

This means that FvwmButtons did not expect the panel to be at this
position when you close the panel.  Either the panel window is
moved/resized while its open, or FvwmButtons miscalculates its
position.  I will try it out myself and report back later.

I do not understand your position on the subject!
Note that I am not alone. Simply re-read the last thread
on the subject.

How can I work on FVWM as I *cannot* use the current cvs? Your are the
FVWM maintainer, one of the main developer (really I worked a lot on
the 2.5.x series) strongly think that we should do something about a
given subject. But you do not care and you reject any compromise. For
me there is a problem here.

: There only seems to be two examples on the menu screenshots section of the
: website, so I thought I'd contribute one of mine :)

Yeah, the ones on the web site look pretty ... ordinary.

I offered screenshots of my menus a while back:

but noone seemed interested.

Thanks - Really great menu style. I am going to rework the
menu screenshot page (and the window decoration page) soon.
Then I will add your menu screenshot.

Cheers, Uwe

Sorry, I must have missed this one. I am going to add some
of your shot soon. Could you please provide a configuration
for the menus as well? It would be nice if other users who
like your menu style can see how this can be achieved.

Excellent!

If you are planning on changing the pages, I have making beautiful looking
Icons with fvwm down to a fine art..I have impressed a lot of people (and
made a few fvwm converts) with this little hack :)

Would you be interested in showing this on the website?

Here's a little demo:

From: Mrs Serena Jones
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in
Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year
2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days. Before his death we were both born again
Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the
Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six
hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one
finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland.
Presently, this money is still with the Security
Company.Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not
last for the next three months due to cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to church or better still a christian individual
that will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct here in. I want a church that will use this
fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure thatthe
house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don`t have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives
are not Christians and I don`t want my husband`s hard
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don`t
want a situation where this moneywill be used in an
ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom
of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will
fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don`t need
any telephone communication in this regard because of
my health because of the presence of my husband`s
relatives around me always. I don`t want them to know
about this development. With God all things are
possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give
you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in
Amsterderm Holland. 
I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
prove you as the original-beneficiary of this fund. I
want you and the church to always pray for me because
the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived
a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any
delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for
a chuch or christian individual for this same purpose.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you.
NOTE:YOU CAN CONTACT MY LAWER VIA

Greetings,

I have hacked the current (2.5.8) version of fvwm to include a new
window style flag called "IgnoreMouseBindings", which causes all
button presses in the corresponding window context to be passed
through to the application, even if otherwise bound.  This is useful
for vnc viewer style applications, where there's another wm running
inside the application window.  With reasonable bindings one can still
manipulate the container (vncviewer) window through its border context
bindings or menus.

Would it be useful if I posted a patch (it's pretty trivial) to this
list, or is this too arcane a feature for the main branch?  If a
patch, is making it against 2.5.8 ok, or would you rather I grabbed
the current cvs?

m.

Wow, the icons on the left side look great! Are they
generated automatically - do they change if the window
contents changes? If so could you share your setup? It
would be great to have icons which offer a preview of the
windows contents ;-)

Do you want this screenshot appear on the fvwm screenshot
page?

Cheers, Uwe

They are generated automatically, the icons are little screenshots of
the windows before they were iconified, pretty simple to do with the new
WindowStyle command, but they look really cool :)

sure, I have it online here http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/fvwm2rc.html

(lynx -dump renders it in plain text correctly, if you prefer)

I have added your shot to the fvwm screenshot list. I

Hello,

Try this:

	AddToFunc foo I Echo "OK"

The schduler code did not initialise the function return code
exited with a random number of "break" levels.  Fixed.

Inspecting the code, I noticed that "Schedule" is prone to a race
condifion.  If you use "+", AddTo{Func,Menu,Decor}, this
interferes with commands being typed asynchronously by the user,
e.g.

  Schedule 60000 AddToFunc bar echo bar
  $ FvwmCommand "AddToFunc foo
  (61 seconds pass)
  $ FvwmCommand "+ I echo foo"

"echo foo" eventually gets added to bar :-P

Ciao

Here you go.  diff -ur applied to at the root of the 2.5.8 tree.
Fortuitously, the first hunk covers the only operative change ... the
rest is just the bookkeeping needed to set up the style flag.

Hi all,
I found this issue in the latest 2.5.9 CVS. When I use ClickToFocus and
use the mouse to change the focus, the windowlist is not in last focused
order. Instead the list is rotated, as if the Focus command had been
used. This does not happen when the MouseFocus or SloppyFocus style is
in use. If I issue a
Style * FPSortWindowlistByFocus
everything works as expected.

The manpage seems to suggest (in the description of
FPSortWindowlistByFocus) that the observed behavior is the default for
ClickToFocus. As well as for SloppyFocus, contradicting actual behavior.
The section about FlipFocus implies that selecting windows with the mouse
is equivalent to the FlipFocus command. So, I don't know how much of the
bug is in the documentation. In my opinion the default should be the old
most-recently-focused order anyway.

Best regards

Jochen
