Thanks for the report, the bug will be fixed in the 2.4.3 release.

Fixed.  With just the "WindowList" commands without any options,
the screen was not set correctly.

Fixed.  Originally, rectangles referred always to the global
screen.  Now, the screen part of the geometry also confines the
menu into that screen (defaulting to the primary screen).

You are misinterpreting what your style line does: it creates an
icon box with the given dimensions on whatever screen the pointer
is on at the time the style command is issued.  It *does not*
create one icon box on each screen: this must be done manually.

What fvwm does is this:

 - Create a default icon box that covers the primary screen.
   (screen 0).
 - Create the given icon box on the screen with the pointer.
   (screen 1).

Whenever a window is iconified, fvwm looks for a suitable icon box
in this order:

 - Icon boxes that intersect with the screen of the window.
 - Any icon box other than the default icon box on any screen.
 - The default icon box.

So, what you are seeing is icons being placed in the default icon
box on the primary screen since this is the only box that
intersects the primary screen.  You have to specify a separate
icon box for each screen.

Of course it would be nice to have a way to specify the same icon
box for each screen in a single style command, but I don't see how
this can be done easily (most of the icon box calculations are
still in style.c).

I guess not :-)

Hard to say.  The decor code looked like this right from the
start (the oldest release I can find it in is 2.0.46).  I guess
this double loop was originally meant to delete the various states
of a decor (like "inactive", "active", "pressed" ...), but the
FreeDecorFace() function takes care of this anyway.  Or it's a
cut-and-paste mistake (similar code can be found in
InitFvwmDecor()).  Anyway, I'll just remove the second loop.

I added this debug output some time around then since I thought
calling functions with illegal arguments isn't a good idea.  Can
you try to find out which piece of decoration causes this message
by disabling the title buttons, the title and the border
successively?  Unfortunately I don't have access to mailtool
myself.

Resize generates the message if the sticky title text does not fit in the
resized title bar.

Non-sticky doesnt print the message.

Resize 0 0 was what i originally had that generated the message.

Resize 250p 0  was a little past the end of the text and gave
RelieveRectangle: called with w = -2, h = 1

Resize 260p 0  was further past then end and gave no warning.

	Don't understand these two last paragraphs: if the app saves its
position, how will you distinguish between a "legal" +1030 request, and a
position on screen #1?

	Let's take the following example (a usual CRT screen as #0 and
1600SW as #1):

+-----------+---------------+
|0:         |1:             |
|  1280x1024|  1600x1024    |
|           |               |
+-----------+---------------+

	What "+1300+10" would mean: +20+10@1, or +1300+10@1?

	Other similar pitfalls and ambiguities are definitely possible.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I simply don't fully grok the logic of your patch
(and I want to, since "making old apps behave correctly under Xinerama
setup" is a very interesting and important topic).

	Anyway, cay you please play with GIMP (it does save the main 
window position and uses it on subsequent run)?

BTW, Sidik, are you on the list or should i keep CC:ing to you?

Ok, but there are an other problem: it is possible to call
the WindowList or a menu via a mouse binding function as:

DestroyFunc MouseXX
AddToFunc   MouseXX
+ I Mouse $0 $2 $3 $4 "$5" "$6" "$7" "$8" "$9"
OR
+ I Mouse $1 $2 $3 $4 "$5" "$6" "$7" "$8" "$9"

This type of function allows to switch between mouse 2 and
3 in a config file where mouse bindings are defined by
MouseXX 2 3 R A WindowList
MouseXX 2 3 R S WindowList (CurrentDesk)
..etc.
We use this in fvwm-themes. So then the action which arrive
to get_menu_options (menu.c) is '"" "" "" "" ""' and then the
menu position is not good. Ok this is strange but this work
with Xinerama Off, the get_option_options has a test for this
case (if (!tok))  and strictly speaking an "" menu position
should be equivalent to a null one. I've commited a safe and
obvious fix to get_option_options.

Ok I think I understand. But:

a. The order you mention is not totally exact. For example if I've:
	Style * Iconbox 200x400+0+0@p, IconFill left top
(Primary is screen 0) then if I iconify a window which is
in screen 1 the icon go on the bottom right of screen 0
(no iconbox if found I think).
This is caused by the lines in AutoPlaceIcon (icons.c):
	if (FScreenIsRectangleOnScreen(&fscr, FSCREEN_XYPOS, &ref))
	    loc_ok = True;
	  else
	    loc_ok_wrong_screen = True;
The test is alawys false as there are no iconbox on screen 1
(and this test may be always false if you iconify from an other
page that the page of the window).
Moreover if I have:
	Style * Iconbox 200x400+0+0@0,IconFill left top,\
		Iconbox 200x400+0-0@1, IconFill bottom left
Then if the screen 1 iconbox is full, and I iconify a window
on screen 1, no iconbox will be found.
I think that the order is: go throught all the iconboxes
(as there are entred + the default iconbox) take the iconbox
only if it is on the same screen than the window.

b. IMHO, the @c logic is wrong: a command like 
     Style * Iconbox 200x400+10-10@c,IconFill left top
will move the icons in an "inacceptable" way (especially
if we fix the bug of a) and so is usable only at startup
or if no windows are iconified.
Ok, Ok, ... I should use multiple iconboxes and do not use
@c. But what I am trying to do is to found a good iconbox
for any Xinerama settings (optionally Off). As @c is unusable
I suggest to change the @c logic: here current may means the
center of the window and not the location of the pointer.
I do not think that it is a difficult change. The idea is
simple: replace 

/* get the screen dimensions for the icon box */
FScreenGetScrRect(NULL, icon_boxes_ptr->IconScreen,
		&ref.x, &ref.y, &ref.width, &ref.height);

by

/* get the screen dimensions for the icon box */
if (icon_boxes_ptr->IconScreen == FSCREEN_CURRENT)
{
  FScreenGetScrRect(&fscr,FSCREEN_XYPOS ,
                    &ref.x, &ref.y, &ref.width, &ref.height);
}
else
  FScreenGetScrRect(NULL, icon_boxes_ptr->IconScreen,
                    &ref.x, &ref.y, &ref.width, &ref.height);

in AutoPlaceIcon and fix the test of a). In fact a more elaborated
FScreenGetScrRect(FSCREEN_XYPOS) is needed, one that can get
the screen dimension from a xypos on the desktop (which seems
needed, for example, to fix iconification from an other page
problem of a).

The other alternative is to add an @w screen as suggested
by Dmitry for iconbox geometry.

I will try to fix the problems of a) any advice and 
"authorization" for b) is welcome.

I Hope that I've not misunderstand something this time,
Olivier

Hello,

I've recently noted that COMPLEX_WINDOW_PLACEMENT has been
undefined in FvwmWinList. I do not think that this is good idea:
without this complex window placement a "DeskOnly" WinList is
totally buggy and it does not seem that there are problems
with this code. I recall that this complex code is needed
because WinList unmap itself if no windows have to be
represented in it.

It did find the icon box, but the loops did not break in case
loc_ok_wrong_screen got set and thus always chose the last
position to fit the icon, not the first one.

Fixed.

The logic is consistent with all other uses of the 'c' screen.

You're right, that was very easy to implement.  I didn't change
the 'c' behaviour because it would have been confusing.

The CVS logs indicate that I removed this as part of the Xinerama
patches on 11th of August.  I can't remember consciously doing
that.  Either this was part of the patches I applied or I did this
by accident.

Olivier, if you think that we don't need the old code anymore,
feel free to remove it.

Hello all,

I've been tinkering with the FVWM 2.4.2 source code lately, trying to rectify
one of its few remaining lacks of themability :-) I've developed a patch which
adds a new type of TitleStyle. You can specify up to six pixmaps for the
titlebar in each state: main, under text, left of text, right of text, far
left, and far right (the first two are tiled, the rest aren't). This allows
FVWM to do a quite pleasing rendition of themes like Eazel-Blue and Crux
(though without the fancy borders).

The config syntax looks like this currently:
   TitleStyle Fancy <state> <main pixmap> <far left> <left of text>
                    <under text> <right of text> <far right>

You can specify "no pixmap" at any position by substituting '-' for a pixmap
filename. The main pixmap will be tiled over any resulting empty spaces.

Bearing in mind that the patch is currently buggy (titleunder pixmap
often doesn't update properly), unpolished, and the work of a complete
FVWM/X programming newbie, you can find it attached to this e-mail and
apply it to 2.4.2 via "patch -p0 <patchfile" from the top source dir. You
also have to #define FANCY_TITLEBARS in config.h to activate any of
the new code.

Would there be any interest in integrating this into the main source tree?

Suzanne

	Hello all.

	At last, a guy tried to play with fvwm 2.4.2 on OpenVMS.
	The compilation stage had been very difficult, because the code changed
a lot since my original port. He got it, though, but doesn't feel brave enough to try
the executable today :-))))))))

	My point is : he found a couple of things with the DEC CC compiler that I 'd like to
tell you :



Compiling [.FVWM]VIRTUAL.C...

    val[2] = 1;
........^
%CC-I-SUBSCRBOUNDS, In this statement, an array is being accessed outside the bounds specified for the array type.
at line number 408 in file _ROWDIE$DKA100:[SCRATCH.FVWM.FVWM]VIRTUAL.C;1




Compiling [.MODULES.FVWMICONBOX]ICONS.C...

  item->icon_depth = depth;
.....................^
%CC-W-UNINIT1, The scalar variable "depth" is fetched but not initialized.  And there may be other such fetches of this variable that have not been reported in this compilation.
at line number 360 in file _ROWDIE$DKA100:[SCRATCH.FVWM.MODULES.FVWMICONBOX]ICONS.C;1
Creating image [.MODULES.BIN]FVWMICONBOX.EXE...




	Another one : it seems that FvwmBanner doesn't use the XPM macro
defined by the configure stage, so it complains during compilation when
xpm is not present.


	I attach the description of the modifications he had to make
in the build HOWTO I wrote 2 years ago. You may find some intresting
things in it. Don't hesitate to ask for more information, but note
that I can't access a VMS machine anymore, so I'll have to ask John to 
make the tests you'll need. Perhaps I'll be able to convince him to
join your team as I did 2 years ago.

	Fab.

SUBJECT:	Changes made for VMS build


            Changes made to fvwm V2.4.2 for successful VMS compile
            ------------------------------------------------------

    -   Unpacked kit.

    - 	Copied .mms, .opt and config.h to root. Copied vms.% to [.libs]

    -   Modified MAKE_FVWM.MMS:
	-   Defined BaseDirFix, BaseDir.
        -   Removed XpmInclude, XpmLib and all references thereto.
	-   Added blank line after all comment lines ending in "-". 
	    (MMS seems to take the next line as a contunuation with
	     weird results.)

    -   Edited config.h:
	-   #undef XPM
	-   Added the following, found in acconfig.h

	    /* Define if stroke library is used. */
	    #undef HAVE_STROKE

	    #ifdef HAVE_STROKE
	    #    define STROKE_ARG(x) x,
	    #    define STROKE_CODE(x) x
	    #else
	    #    define STROKE_ARG(x)
	    #    define STROKE_CODE(x)
	    #endif

    -   Edit MAKE_FVWM.MMS:  Re-sync with current state of the source 
	(removing stale modules, adding new ones).

    - 	Wondering if the typedef for fvwm_msg_type includes reserved words.
	Added an 'X' to the front of each.

    - 	Added "#define fd_set_size_t int" to config.h.
	(From successful Unix build; shot in the dark.)

    - 	Added "#define FVWM_CONFDIR "/Sys$Login" to config.h.

    -   Ignoring the pointer mismatch and conversion warnings for now.

    - 	Closed comment on line previous to "#define USEDECOR 1" in config.h 
	that prevented the definition being made.
	(Took some time to find this one.)

    -   Changing "ECHO" to "XECHO", as done previously in the typedef.

    -   Included:
    
	    #include <builtins.h>
	    #define alloca __ALLOCA

	(There is also a version of alloca included in [.libs].  Not sure yet 
	whether to use or not.)

    -   Added "#define SELECT_FD_SET_CAST" to config.h.

    -   Removed local version of strcasecmp; Appears to be part of C RTL.

    -   Removed local version of strerror; Appears to be part of C RTL.

    -   Removed local version of strncasecmp; Appears to be part of C RTL.

    -   Removed local version of usleep; Appears to be part of C RTL.

    -   in [.libs]FVWMLIB.H, changed #include "Parse.h" to "libs/Parse.h".
	Was getting confused with the parse.h in the fvwmbuttons module.

    -	Removed FvwmBanner module; appears too tied into XPM, which I don't
        have.  (Does not use the HAVE_XPM flag.)

    -   Removed "#include <sys/param.h>" in FVWMCPP.C; Could not find.  Needed?

    -	In FvwmCpp: Replaced:
    
	char *cpp_prog = FVWM_CPP;   with char *cpp_prog = "FVWM_CPP";
        
        FVWM_CPP is not defined anywhere.
        
    -   Removed FvwmGTK module.  Includes headers not available.
	Don't understand what this is.

    -   Removed #include <sys/param.h> from FVWMM4.C.

    -   Removed #include <syslog.h> form FVWMWHARF.C

    -   Removed local implementations of strdup and atexit, using library 
	versions.

    -   Removed FvwmConsole:  Uses un.h; can't find on VMS.

    -   Removed local gethostname function in favor of standard implementation.

    -   Added definitions for gravity_translate_to_northwest_geometry_no_bw
	and gravity_translate_to_northwest_geometry to avoid 31 char limit
	in extern names (losing uniqueness). (Went ahead and added 
        abbreviations for all other very long names.)

    -   Renamed "Scroll" function in module fvwmpager to "Pgr_Scroll" to 
	avoid conflict with DECC Scroll function.

    -	Replaced function name "Free" with "Icn_Free" in fvwmiconman module
	to avoid conflict with std free function.

    -   In link of fvwmbacker, need to include /include=picture after
	[Libs]Libs.Olb/Lib to force inclusion of this module.  Otherwise
	linker cannot resolve pvisual et al, possibly because this
	module calls no procedures from thepicture module.

    -   In FvwinWinlist, changed colorset to colorsetArr to avoid
	linker confusion with Colorset, something entirely different.

    -   Changed local declaration of "colorset" to "colorsetI" in 
	fvwmtaskbar.c, goodies.c, fvwmscroll.c and grabwindow.c to 
        avoid linker confusion with Colorset.

    -   Replaced SendMsg with ScrSendMsg, and Wait with ScrWait in
	fvwmscript modules to avoid linker confusion.

I'm trying to fix up FvwmForm's buttons so that they
activate on a button release.

I thought it might be a good idea to change the mouse pointer to
something else while the pointer is grabbed (as long as the button
is pushed in).

Looking around, I see that fvwm/cursor.c seems to expect that on
some X platforms, a lot of the "standard" cursors might not be
available.

That seems to include one that FvwmForm has been using all along,
XC_xterm:

cursor.c line 299:

#ifdef XC_xterm
    {"xterm", XC_xterm},
#endif

Does anyone know the rules for this?

Hm, this looks pretty useless to me.  The definitions in
/usr/X11/include/X11/cursorfont.h come with the standard X
distribution.  I can hardly believe that any of these is not
defined on any system.  Anyway, the header file just consists of
a sequence of

  #define XC_<cursorname>

lines.

Bye

That's already fixed in CVS.

Uh, could you ask him to make a patch from these changes
("diff -u" if possible)?  It's very hard for me to make the right
adjustments with only free form sentences as a description.

Your question has been pending here for a while, its difficult to
give you one answer.

Fvwm is developed by the Fvwm Workers, there is no one person
that will make a final decision, unless one of us commits some changes.

I looked at the 2 themes you identified, and didn't see any titlebar
pixmaps in Eazel-Blue.

Crux just didn't do it for me.

I think if you really want to make any progress with this, you
would first want to show how nifty this would look.

This has been discussed in the past, and the general feeling is that
shaping the borders and doing more titlebar decoration will add too
much bloat.  The idea of doing elaborate decoration in an FVWM
module (where it wouldn't bloat the core)
has been discussed a few times, but it hasn't been done yet.

I'm not big on themed borders, myself--the options already in Fvwm for that
work fine for me. I only tweaked the titlebars. The hack is actually quite
lightweight: it adds, on my system, several K to the final stripped binary
if FANCY_TITLEBARS is defined, and adds nothing if it isn't.

Of course, I recognize that there is such a thing as source-code bloat
(aka #ifdef hell :-), and if you guys don't want to make this standard, I
understand. In that case, I'll just share the patch on the users list for
those who are interested. Once I work out the annoying titleunder-update bug,
anyways.

Funny you should mention that :-) I've recently been grabbing screenshots to
include in an Fvwm-touting page off my website. I haven't done any other
development yet, but I can put up just the screenshots ahead of time.

   http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/

This shows off several window-decorations I particularly like: Eazel, QNX,
Helix Sweetpill, and Infadel (the new IceWM default theme). All of them
depend on extra pixmaps: some have titleunders, others just have special
transitions at either end of the titlebar (i.e. the curved ends of Sweetpill).
The latter is possible with regular Fvwm but it's kludgy: you have to define
"decoy" pixmap buttons and make them Nop. This is the approach that the
folks at fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net take for rendering stuff like NanoGUI.

Infadel, if you look closely, shows off all six pixmaps: main, titleunder,
and the four transitions.

I wanted to work on titlebar inhancements, because a titlebar is not
configurable in FVWM as opposed to other window managers. But I didn't
have a good design to start with it (and I am not an X programmer anyway).
Your solution seems to be complete enough and does a minimal change.

Some notes about a "bloatness". I don't remember we had a consensus not to
extend a titlebar functionality. If I missed it, please post a thread url.
Instead I remember at least 5 user requests to be able to define a colorful
pixmap that still leaves text readable. So users definitely would like your
patch. (And fvwm-themes is the biggest user for that reason.)

Tim suggested to move all fancy decorations to FvwmDecor module, but I am
not sure how serious is this suggestion (i.e. who can implement this).

Dominik and some others agreed that TitleStyle/ButtonStyle/BorderStyle
commands should be dropped in favor of per-window styles using colorsets.
But this does not mean the current configurability of these commands
should be dropped, so, when such transformation happens your extended
titlebar implementation could be reused together with the existing one.

I am interesting to support an inclusion of this or updated patch.

I have some questions, I am not sure what the correct answer should be.

How is UseTitleStyle option of ButtonStyle affected?
Is the main pixmap used in this case?

How the continuation problem is solved? I mean, if some pixmaps are not
defined will the main pixmap started again and again or one continued
pixmap be used?

What happens if a text is wider than a titlebar?..

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I'll certainly be willing to maintain it myself and keep it synced with
official releases, if the developers don't want to add it to the main tree.

> How is UseTitleStyle option of ButtonStyle affected?

This is something I hadn't thought about. I've updated my working copy so
that it uses the main pixmap, as you suggest.

Okay: If titleunder isn't defined, the main pixmap is tiled under the title:
much like the regular TiledPixmap style. If any of the non-tiling, "transition"
pixmaps is not defined, it is simply eliminated from the equation entirely,
i.e., no space is allocated for it on the titlebar. Fvwm also starts dropping
them one by one when a titlebar becomes really small with no room for extra
cruft.

> What happens if a text is wider than a titlebar?..

Same as in other styles--it gets truncated.

When this patch actually reaches the fit-for-public-consumption point, I'll
try to give somewhat more complete documentation on it.

Should not the order for consistency be the following:

  TitleStyle <state> Fancy ...

I can't apply your patch right now. I have more questions:

  * In http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/glenwood.jpg do you use transparent
pixmaps for <* text>? The same question about <far *>.
It is not critical if all pixmaps should be non-transparent, but if only
Main pixmap is fully destructive, it may be replaced by a general colorset
later (TiledPixmap, [Resizable]Pixmap, complex gradient, solid color),
while all other pixmaps would be only partially destructive.

  * Currently a titlebar text noticeably flickers in some configurations.
How is a flickery with your patch?

Just for a curiosity how hard is to update your patch to do the following:

  * Use named parameters for pixmaps with only one mandatory Main?

  * Use optionally Main pixmap as resizable instead of tiled.

  * Add optionally Button (LeftButton/RightButton) pixmaps that would be
used instead of Main in ButtonStyle UseTitleStyle. This is needed if
buttons are configured separately from a titlebar like in fvwm-themes.

I am not sure the following are needed in practice, but to think about:

  * Use optionally LeftMain and RightMain instead of Main. Probably
only useful with Centered text.

  * Optionally undefined <under text> pixmap is skipped (like other
non-main pixmaps) instead of retiled.

Options may be given after "--" like in other TitleStyle styles.
What I said is only thoughts. I am trying to find a reasonable optimum.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Hi!

	How to specify a shadow thickness for raised/sunk titles and
borders?  There's no "shadow thickness" flag in TitleStyle/BorderStyle
commands, and there's no "thickness" attribute in colorsets.  On the other
hand, at least Kendrick Vargas' screenshot shows a sunk title with
thickness of 1 instead of default 2.  So, how?

	TIA,
		Dmitry

Definitely. And I should be recognizing -- flags, "all state" styles, etc. Now
that I've actually got this working as a "proof of concept" thing, I'm going to
go back and rework the code to try to integrate it better with the other
TitleStyles.

I wouldn't recommend applying it yet unless you're brave :-) Especially since
the config format will probably change considerably...

Nope...the patch doesn't use transparency currently.

I haven't noticed any...of course, I don't use opaque move.

Not sure what you mean by this...

Doable.

At that point, why not just use pixmap buttons with the desired background
already built in?

Could be done, but I don't know of many themes that would need it...

Doable.

You can't, it is hardcoded to 2 when raised/sunk.

I didn't see Kendrick's config, but it is clear to me that he uses flat,
not sunk title, everything is pixmap based. I.e. it only works with
TitleStyle Height 19 in his case.

As for borders, the shadow/hilite colors depend on the border width
and some more flags, also hardcoded. And it is not symmetrical at
different sides. Borders are hardly configurable.

Mikhael.

Okay, here's a somewhat cleaned-up patch for nifty titlebars. I still wouldn't
call it ready for general use (not enough testing, not enough review by the
people who know what they're doing ;-), but the titleunder bug seems to be
fixed and the config syntax is much more reasonable. Bonus: the patch is
smaller!

The syntax is now: MultiPixmap [main] [under text] [left of text]
                               [right of text] [far left] [far right]

e.g.: TitleStyle ActiveUp MultiPixmap main.xpm under.xpm lt.xpm rt.xpm - -

The read code has been integrated into ReadDecorFace, so now this can be
combined with pretty much anything else TitleStyle supports (flags, defining
multiple states at once, etc.)

Please try opaque move from time to time, it is one command, you know. :)

I mean instead of 6 ordered pixmaps to have named parameters like:

  Main decor/title-main.xpm, TextUnder decor/title-textunder.xpm, ...

Because this does not work well for frameworks where buttons are
configured separately from titlebar, i.e. the same MAC-like or OS2-like
buttons are used with different titlebar configs, see for example
http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/windowdecors/ .

For all (well most) mixes to work well, titlebar colors (pixmaps in our
case) should dictate window button background. If you want to learn more
about what I said, get fvwm-themes and try different mixes of colors@
and buttons@. You may also see what commands these 2 components use.

Of course, this is an extra functionality, but it would solve us some
problems we have now with fancy decors. For example, take a look at the
url above, currently buttons@ in @brushedmetal, @mech and @nanogui are not
transparent just like you suggest, but then they can't be mixed at all.
If it is possible to specify non-Main pixmap to be used in ButtonStyle
UseTitleStyle, these buttons in all 3 themes would be transparent and all
possible mixes of colors@ and buttons@ would look nicely.

Actually this would be useful when TitleStyle Centered|Right/LeftJustified
is configured separately from titlebar colors (pixmaps). Yes, this is
configured in another component windowlook@ in fvwm-themes. :)

For example, in your glenwood try to change text alignment, you will see
what I mean.

Thank you very much for your work.

	And what about
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/windowdecors/decor-2[14].jpg ?  Or
these two are also flat with pixmap bg which work for specific height
only?

	Aha...  So, these should go to a "wish list" together with
"offsettable" buttons and an ability to specify separate thicknesses for
left/right/up/down borders?

Doh, now that I come to think of it, this was all discusses long
before you joined the workers list.

This was completely serious.

I still hesitate to actually do this.  The planned changes would
mean:

 1) Rewrite TitleStyle, BorderStyle, and ButtonStyle commands as
    styles.
 2) Integrate the remaining window looks related commands into
    styles (e.g. HilightColors/HilightColorset).
 3) Remove all code related to decors.
 4) Don't provide backwards compatibility without being able to
    write a conversion script.

Many of the more complex configs would be broken.  But if we don't
forget about compatibility, rewriting that stuff does not make
sense at all.  The benefits are simpler and cleaner code and a
more user friendly syntax.

Agreed.

If $LANG is set to use a different language, the font-handling does
not work any more. Fvwm does not find any single font in this case.
It reports the following error message:

[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset
<insert-any-fontname-here>, trying 'fixed'

Unsetting $LANG before starting fvwm removes this error message.

Full_Name: Antonio Freixas
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 8
X_Server: X11R6 (Solaris vendor relase 6410)
Submission from: (NULL) (139.47.5.191)


I upgraded from Fvwm 2.2.2 to 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. Now, when I move any window
over a Netscape window, Netscape redraws the exposed areas with a dark grey

background.

For example,

 1. Bring up Netscape 4.76 (Solaris build).
 2. View a page with a white background.
 3. Bring up any other window. An easy choice is to use Alt-F to bring up
    the Find dialog.
 4. Drag the Find window over the Netscape window.
 5. Chunks of the Netscape window background will appear in dark gray.

I tried turning on BackingStore and SaveUnder and saw no change. Other
windows don't seem to have this problem.

I run in 24-bit color mode.

Relevant(?) .fvwm2rc file entries:

Style *			SloppyFocus
Style *			StickyIcon, MinOverlapPercentPlacement
Style *			NoIcon, NoPPosition, DecorateTransient
Style *			BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4
Style *			MWMDecor, MWMFunctions
Style *			ResizeOpaque
Style *			BackingStore
Style *			SaveUnder
Style "Netscape"	MiniIcon netscape.t.pm

I'd like to blame this on Netscape, but the problem didn't appear with
Fvwm 2.2.2. I just tried Fvwm 95 and it also doesn't appear there.

I tested it some last night. It's somewhat jerky; then again, MultiPixmap
doesn't fair much worse than TiledPixmap in that respect. But I think plugging
Fvwm into, say, Imlib2 would go very contrary to the developers' style ;-)

> I mean instead of 6 ordered pixmaps to have named parameters like:
>   Main decor/title-main.xpm, TextUnder decor/title-textunder.xpm, ...

Ah, that's a good idea. Seems more user-friendly and extensible than the
position-dependent syntax.

The leftmain/rightmain/leftbutton/rightbutton extensions should be pretty
easy to add on this way...of course, the user won't need to specify them
unless they care.

Ok, small addition, it is hardcoded to 2 with Style option FVWMBorder
and to 1 with MWMBorder. Components windowlook@cde and windowlook@luthien
that you point to, both contain the line: Style * MWMBorder.

I don't know. We may discuss this if you have a good design.

I just committed changes to make buttons activating on release
the default behavior.  (You can configure it either way.)

You can get these changes from the current CVS or tonights snapshot,
or the next official release.

You should have seen this problem with all versions of 2.4.0.

I like the new activate-on-release default. BTW, this is what is used in
FvwmScript unlike what was said in another thread.

It is a bit unusual that the pointer is changed when mouse pressed,
but it is ok if it is configurable.

> Make all 3 cursors configurable.

Fine, but it would be nice to add pointer fore/back colors too
similarly to CursorStyle command.
I myself do not use black on white pointers when possible.

Mikhael.

Glad they are consistent now.
FvwmScript fooled me again.

I know, I searched around for another GUI that does that,
and couldn't find one.  (I didn't search all that much.)

The pointer is grabbed while the button is down.
It only seems logical (to me) that the pointer should change.
I just wish I could have a better choice than "hand1".

I think it might be better to use the same cursor but just
change the colors.  (Using your idea for colors.)

Yep, XEmacs is fun:

Emacs*pointerBackground: red
Emacs*spacePointer: sailboat
Emacs*modeLinePointer: spider
Emacs*selectionPointer: trek

Some night soon I'll get to it.

	Maybe a bit offtopic, but I have a question: which colors people
on this list prefer to use for pointers?

	When we began using 4 monitors on one PC, a problem of finding
where the cursor is had appeared; the same problem was noted by people who
use big resolutions (like 1600x1200).  I did some research, and it
resulted in fgcolor=red, bgcolor=white (BTW, that's a default in SGI's
Motif).  I even did a patch for XFree86 which allows to change default
black&white colors and optionally doublesize the pointer.

	So, what colors do you prefer?

--yrj/dFKFPuw6o+aM
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

Here's the latest incarnation of the spiffy titlebars patch. It's not yet
guaranteed stable or in its final form, but it's getting there. This one was
generated against 2.4.3. It fixes a silly crashing bug and changes to a new
position-independent format for the MultiPixmap TitleStyle.

There are ten pixmaps, all of which are optional except for Main (or, define
both LeftMain and RightMain):

Main                      - tiled all the way across before anything else
LeftMain, RightMain       - tiled on the left and right sides of the title
                            (if titleless and no Main, LeftMain is tiled all
                            the way across)
UnderText                 - tiled underneath the title text
LeftButtons, RightButtons - tiled underneath left and right buttons in case of
                            ButtonStyle -- UseTitleStyle
                            (if not specified, LeftMain/RightMain is used, if
                             that isn't specified, Main is used)
LeftEnd, RightEnd         - Non-tiled pixmaps for the far ends of the titlebar
                            (just before the buttons)
LeftOfText, RightOfText   - Non-tiled pixmaps for left and right ends of text

This may sound daunting, but there's very little overhead for a decor if
TitleStyle MultiPixmap isn't used (and 0 overhead if #undef FANCY_TITLEBARS,
of course). Just a single unallocated Picture** pointer.

The new config syntax is:
  MultiPixmap <pic name> <filepath>, <pic name> <filepath>, ...

Since the syntax is no longer position-dependent, you don't have to include
any "placeholders" for pixmaps you don't use.

Stretching instead of tiling isn't implemented yet (config syntax?). Mikhael's
request for a way to have nothing tiled under title text is implemented in a
sneaky way: specify LeftMain and RightMain instead of Main. It would be great
if any brave prospective users of this patch could test it a bit, since I no
longer personally use all of the features present :-)

Final note: I notice the parameter left1right0 to DrawButton (in borders.c),
which is supposed to indicate which side the button is on, goes unused:
RedrawButtons always passes 1! Since I need to know which side in order to
handle UseTitleStyle correctly, I fixed this. If that's a problem, lemme know.

I used fg=red, bg=white on my PC for several years, a habit from SGI.
I configured xterm and all other possible apps to use these colors.
Some time later, and until now, I find fg=yellow, bg=black to be more
plesant to me. Anyway, both color combination are better for me than the
default fg=black, bg=white. Also try: FvwmForm FvwmForm-RootCursor .

If we speak about this, I like the WAIT cursor that the latest mozilla
uses, it's not the one X has, but a combination of left_ptr (that is my
favorite) and small watch in the bottom-right, it seems to be better than
watch that we use by default for WAIT. I think we may draw some custom
cursors and enable users to specify them together with the standard ones.
I may do something about this later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Looks good to me.  The only thing I don't get working is the
indentation of the text paragraphs:

  .TP
  .B "Menu "
  .I     menu-name
  .BI    "[ " position " ]"
  bla blub

results in

  Menu menu-name [ position ] bla blub

and

  .TP
  .B "Menu "
  .I     menu-name
  .BI    "[ " position " ]"

  bla blub

gives me

  Menu menu-name [ position ] bla blub

        bla blub

but we want

  Menu menu-name [ position ] bla blub
        bla blub

Full_Name: Thomas Baumann
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.19
X_Server: 2.4
Submission from: (NULL) (130.126.241.21)


With fvwm 2.4.3 and xmgrace 5.1.4 a right mouse click (and hold) in 
any of the set selection dialogs will turn the screen black for the time
the button is pressed.

This behaviour was not observed with fvwm 2.4.0

Additional information on request.

Thanks for a great piece of software.

Thomas

My own conclusion in July was we should write our own macro instead of
.TP, but looking at /usr/lib/groff/tmac/tmac.an where .de TP is defined
gave me headache. This is learnable for sure, but may be someone else
is already familar with this hieroglyphic language?

And I am still sure we don't need spaces (remember, braces are in bold
or even in different color), i.e. I prefer this bold-inverse output:

  Menu menu-name [position] [double-click-action]
        bla blub

Hi guys...

I got a surprise today when running 2.4.3... it core dumped on me!!
THis happens repeatably when running an application here at work.  The
app is not necessarily well behaved, and uses openwindows libs etc.
Still, a coredump shouldn't happen.  It appears to be on teh startup
copyright splash window.

I've enclosed all the relevant info, and I can trace this if someone
tells me what to look for.

Note that I'm not 100% sure that gcc 3.0.1 generates good code yet on
solaris... I've got problems with mozilla and gimp so far.  Compilations
are OK, core dumps on startup.

Apologies for the long mail...

Thanks,
Nils.

Regarding the FvwmIconMan module, it would be useful for those of us that
are addicted to AutoRaise functionality if there was the ability to raise &
warp to a window after the mouse hovers on an entry in the icon manager for
a specified number of milliseconds.

I had something like this in mind - just kind of a general auto-event after
hovering over an entry in the icon manager for a while :

FvwmIconMan*auto   trueFvwmIconMan*autodelay  1000
FvwmIconMan*autowarp  false
FvwmIconMan*autodeiconify  true
FvwmIconMan*autoraise  true

That would raise and deiconify it (if needed) after the delay, but it
wouldn't warp the mouse there.  I don't think that there's anything else
that you'd want to do to a window after hovering on it in the icon manager
- I thought of the ability to pass FvwmIconMan an Fvwm function
handle/pointer, but I don't even know if that's possible.

Hello dear fvwm developpers,

  I've noticed that with version 2.4.3 and latest snapshot (20011010), some
of my
keybindings do not work anymore:

# Alt + Shift + Direction moves the cursor (fast)
Key Left      A  MS   CursorMove -10  +0
Key Right     A  MS   CursorMove +10  +0
Key Up        A  MS   CursorMove  +0 -10
Key Down      A  MS   CursorMove  +0 +10

Behave as:
# Alt + Direction moves through the pages inside a Desk
Key Left      A    M  Scroll -100    0
Key Right     A    M  Scroll +100   +0
Key Up        A    M  Scroll   +0 -100
Key Down      A    M  Scroll   +0 +100

In fact, it's as if the 'shift' key was not taken into account for several
(all?) of my keybindings.
Has anyone noticed the same problem ? I think I've seen something written
about shift recently on the list but couldn't find it in my archives.

I'm running fvwm on a Tru64 5.1 system, compiled with the native C compiler.

Cheers,

	Jeremie Petit

Hi again,

  in fact, it seems it's the second keymappings that override the previous
ones:
If in fvwmtalk I do

Key Left      A  MS   CursorMove -10  +0 (ALT+SHIFT+LEFT moves cursor left)

The key mapping works fine.

If I add the following, then

Key Left      A    M  Scroll -100    0 (ALT+LEFT SCROLLS left)

The first mapping is changed and behaves as the second one, ie
ALT+SHIFT+LEFT SCROLLS left instead of moving the cursor.

Cheers,

	Jeremie.

Can you please include the ability in SnapGrid for it to begin with an offset
number?  I use the WindowShade feature, and layer the windows I'm using on a
project one below the other at 35p increments (the width of the WindowShaded
TitleBar).  To give some clearance to the FvwmTaskBar I start the layering at 
x+0 y+10.  The increments I need for the SnapGrid to work then would be:

x+0 y+10
x+0 y+45
x+0 y+80
x+0 y+115
x+0 y+150
etc.

Thanks for allowing us input.

Glen

Is anyone against applying this/updated patch? It is #ifdef'd and does not
add any memory overhead or instability when the new feature is not used.

Suzanne, it seems logical to have Buttons pixmap, not only LeftButtons and
RightButtons. Or I may add this later myself.

There is one bug with stippled titles, try opaque move of sticky windows.
The stipples disappear when they should be redrawn during the move.
To be honest I don't know what to do with stipples when MultiPixmap used.
Stipples don't look very nice with MultiPixmap or TiledPixmap titlebars.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Please hold off a bit. As mentioned in e-mail, my computer monitor is
dying (ever seen hourglass-shaped windows? and no, I'm not using the
Shape extension!) so I may not have computer access at all much longer
until we replace it (within a week or so). If problems come up I won't be
able to help right away in fixing them.

Also, if any of my code makes it into CVS I should give myself a crash
course on CVS usage :-)

Sure, I can add that in.

I can reproduce this (but not with Control in the place of Shift).
Also,  a workaround is to reverse the order of the bindings:
Key Left      A    M    Scroll -100    0
Key Left      A    MS   CursorMove -10  +0 
work fine here.

Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.148.21)


After upgrading from Fvwm 2.4.0 to 2.4.3, some of my keybindings stopped
working. After a bit of testing I found that I needed to use KP_Left
instead of KP_4 etc. in the below:

Key KP_4	A	M	Scroll -100 +0
Key KP_Left	A	M	Scroll -100 +0
<snip>

I cannot make these work with Shift+Control at all, however if I exchange
Shift for Meta they work:

Key KP_4	A	SC	CursorMove -1 0
Key KP_Left	A	SC	CursorMove -1 0
Key KP_6	A	SC	CursorMove +1 +0
Key KP_Right	A	SC	CursorMove +1 +0
<snip>

I have Control+<numpad key> bound to other actions, which now happens
regardless if I have Shift pressed or not, so it seems Shift is here
ignored, or something like that.

While with Shift+Meta, it worked as before; I did not need to use KP_Left
etc.:

Key KP_4	A	SM	CursorMove -10 +0
Key KP_6	A	SM	CursorMove +10 +0
<snip>

My old keybindings worked fine with Fvwm 2.4.3 on Solaris 2.7.

Full_Name: Brent Ewing
Version: fvwm-snap-20011018
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: Xfree86 4.1.0
Submission from: (NULL) (128.208.109.64)


I have a dual display based on the dual output Matrox 450 video card and I
use the XFree86 4.1.0 mga server.

The resolution on both displays is 1280x1024; the secondary display is to
the right of the primary display.

I set up fvwm with multiple 'virtual desktops', is that the right term? I
switch between the desktops with the pager, anyway.

So the problem is...when I create an xterm window in the secondary
display,
(I place it 'manually'), the outline does not appear on the secondary
display
as I move the mouse around while I hold the left button down. When I
release
the button, a window is created in the 'virtual desktop' to the right of
the visible desktop. On closer examination, the 'placement display', which
pops up while I hold the left mouse button down indicates that the 
x-position is > 2560..that is, it is displaced to the right by one screen
width, which is where the window ends up.

I looked into the code a bit. The problem is a result of applying an
offset
too many. The Xlib functions return position values as if the
two screens were one...so the top left pixel in the secondary screen is
1280x0 and the top right pixel is about 2560x0, according to the server.
So those are the values returned by XQueryPointer(), for example.

There is a call in PlaceWindow() to the function


FScreenGetScrRect(NULL, FSCREEN_CURRENT, &mx, &my, NULL, NULL)

which apparently, is used to get the screen geometry, and which returns
mx=1280 my=0.

The mx and my values are added to the positions returned by the Xlib
functions, and so the position of the grid and window go off the screen.

I do not know what a good solution is for this problem...

Hello,
The Shift-Tab FvwmForm short cut does not work on my
machine. A test like this fails:

if (ks == XK_Tab && (event.xkey.state & ShiftMask))

as Shift-Tab generate the keysym "XK_ISO_Left_Tab"
here.

Maybe a solution is to do something like that to find the
Shift-Tab keysym:

KeyCode tab = XKeysymToKeycode(dpy, XK_Tab);
shift_tab_ks = XKeycodeToKeysym(dpy, tab, ShiftMask);

I use this method in FvwmScript.

Hello,

An alias name for a module should be constituted by
a...z, A...Z, 0...9, - or . characters a should begin
with a letter. This cause problems with FvwmScript as
typically (not in fvwm neither in fvwm-themes) you may
start a FvwmScript as:

FvwmScript scripts/MyScript
or
FvwmScript /full-path/MyScript

So it seems that we should add "/" to the list.
Is this can cause problems?

Regards, Olivier

I would think that in both cases the alias name could be MyScript.
Or yet better, it should be set independently from the file name.

If you decide to use the file name as the alias, then yes, you may add "/"
to the list of valid chars. Hopefully this will not break anything.

Of course the correct solution is to formalize (and standardize) aliases,
so that fvwm and modules would not guess and not use their own heuristics.
Something for the future, not very easy if we think about compatibility.

Mikhael.

The correct syntax is

  IgnoreModifiers <modifiers>

I don't know where the "SetLockModifiers" command is coming from.

Hello,

In earlier versions of fvwm2 (2.2.x), I use the following
instructions to switch between windows :

Key KP_4 A 4 Direction West (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Function Focus-Raise
Key KP_6 A 4 Direction East (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Function Focus-Raise

Unfortunatly theses commands doesn't work anymore with
fvwm2-2.4.{2,3} (it worked with fvwm2-2.4.0). Is it a known bug,
or maybe something wrong with my configuration ?

Note: I use

	IgnoreModifiers L2

in ${FVWM_USERDIR}/.fvwm2rc	

Thanks in advance

I'm running FVWM 2.4.3 under Linux using the Accelerated X server
(www.xig.com).  This is the Debian testing distribution, so I've got
Gnome 1.4 and I'm using Fvwm2 as my window manager.

If I look in ~/.gnome-errors, I find:

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: Help

I think this must be something Accelerated X doesn't support or something.
This happens before my .fvwm2rc file is loaded.

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> XMMS window 0x400001a has broken (max_width) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
hint override = 0
flags = 30
min_width = 0, min_height = 0, max_width = 0, max_height = 0
width_inc = 136136208, height_inc = 0
min_aspect = 0/136136264, max_aspect = 1075312524/135911216
base_width = 1075438280, base_height = 136136264
win_gravity = 136136264

I'm running gkrellm from my init function in my .fvwm2rc file, with
the gkrelmms module. It automatically loads xmms and then minimizes
it.

Anyway, everything seems to work OK, but I was told to report the error :-)

Dear fvwm-workers,

I'm using fvwm 2.5.0 out of CVS:

FVWM version 2.5.0 compiled on Oct 23 2001 at 14:23:23
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM, Xinerama

starting from the following commit:

2001-10-15  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

        * fvwm/bindings.c (activate_binding):
        * libs/Bindings.c (GrabWindowKeyOrButton):
        activate mouse/stroke bindings immediately

        * fvwm/events.c (HandleButtonPress):
        it is possible to bind actions to the 'ClickToFocus' click

I'm having some problems with 'Style * ClickToFocus'.

Two examples:

- Netscape/Mozilla: if the window is not focussed, I have to click twice 
  on links/buttons (one for the focus, the second for the action)

- xterm: if the xterm is not focussed, I have to tip 3 times to select 
  something (as above, one for the focus, the other two for the selection)

It seems to me that maybe the ClickToFocusPassesClick stopped working 
after that commit.

Please let me know if I can help somehow in solving this thing.

Thanks in advance,
Giuseppe.

Hm, I don't see any probelm, ClickToFocusPassesClick still works
fine for me.  Are you sure you have this in your config file and
that it is indeed executed?

The binding for the Help key (if you have one) is built into FVWM.
We recently added this warning for key bindings that don't match
any key.  I think the message is useful for debugging but
is going to cause more problems than its worth.

If there are no objections, I'll disable the warning.

This warning helps find applications that set invalid hints
but sending the report to us always generates the same response from
us, Ie., notify the application owner.

I think its time to change the message to "please notify the
owner of the application".

Any objection to this change?

Actually I find this warning useful.

I did a small patch that prints warnings in ParseBinding only if
silent_functions flag is not set. This built-in Key command would be:

  Silent Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot

Ok?

Maybe something like "Please send a bug report to the application owner,
you may use fvwm-workers@fvwm.org as a reference."?

P.S. I initially sent this message to Dan by a mistake, he replied "ok".

Yes, I'd like the workers list to be CC'ed.  At the beginning, the
message helped to write more robust hint handling code, but I
can't remember anything useful coming from this message for a long
time.

Hi Dominik,

yes, I have Style * ClickToFocus in my .fvwm2rc and it was working before 
that commit ...

I've also tried adding Style * ClickToFocusPassesClick (even if these 
should be the default), but I still see the same effect.

I'll send you my .fvwm2rc: maybe there's something conflicting with it.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Greets!

Behold the latest fancy-titlebar patch. I've cleaned up the code a little,
added in a "Buttons" pixmap option (for tiling under the buttons in
UseTitleStyle if LeftButtons/RightButtons isn't defined), added the
ability to stretch pixmaps instead of tiling, and took a stab at documenting
this mess in fvwm2.1.

You can now put a "stretched" flag after a pixmap name, like this:

   TitleStyle MultiPixmap Main (stretched) foo.xpm, UnderText bar.xpm

Now the Main pixmap will be scaled, but UnderText will be tiled as usual.
Note that this flag will only affect Main, LeftMain, RightMain, and UnderText.

The primary drawback with stretching is that it can't (yet) be extended very
well with UseTitleStyle. This would be somewhat tricky since the buttons are
rendered separately from the rest of the titlebar. Instead, whatever pixmap is
rendered under the buttons will always be tiled (even if it were stretched, it
wouldn't necessarily be seamless because it would start anew with each
button). It may be best not to use UseTitleStyle at all in this case and just
build the background you want into the buttons--this is the way most themes
(IceWM, Sawfish, etc.) are distributed anyways.

It'd be nice if someone could figure out a way to stretch a pixmap *all* the
way across the titlebar, including under buttons, but it's a task to which I am
not up :-)

The patch is now about 19k and, on my system, adds 2368 bytes to the stripped
executable when FANCY_TITLEBARS is #defined :-) It seems to be reasonably
complete and stable, but due to continued absence of our new back-ordered
monitor, I haven't been able to test it extensively yet (it's not that X won't
come up...it just *hurts* to look at!)

 ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive \\
   (-- flat)
 .EE
+If fvwm is compiled with the FANCY_TITLEBARS option enabled, an additional
+TitleStyle is available: MultiPixmap. This allows you to specify different
+pixmaps for different parts of the titlebar. Some of them are tiled or
+stretched to fit a particular space; others are discrete "transition" pixmaps
+which are not resized in any way. The definable pixmaps are:
+.EX
+- Main (tiled/stretched): The main titlebar pixmap
+- LeftMain (tiled/stretched): Left of title text
+- RightMain (tiled/stretched): Right of title text
+- UnderText (tiled/stretched): Underneath title text
+- LeftOfText: Pixmap just to the left of the title text
+- RightOfText: Pixmap just to the right of the title text
+- LeftEnd: Pixmap at the far left end of the titlebar
+  (just before buttons)
+- RightEnd: Pixmap at the far right end of the titlebar
+  (just before buttons)
+- Buttons (tiled): Tiled under buttons in case of
+  UseTitleStyle
+- LeftButtons (tiled): Tiled under left buttons in case of
+  UseTitleStyle
+- RightButtons (tiled): Tiled under right buttons in case of
+  UseTitleStyle
+.EE
+None of these are mandatory except for Main (or, if you don't define Main,
+you must define both LeftMain and RightMain). If no "Buttons" pixmaps are
+defined and UseTitleStyle is specified for one or more buttons, Main,
+LeftMain, or RightMain will be used as appropriate.
 
+The syntax for this style type is:
+.EX
+MultiPixmap <section> (<flag>) <pixmap filename>, ...
+.EE
+continuing for whatever pixmaps you want to define. By default, all
+non-transition pixmaps are tiled. If you want one stretched instead (this is
+allowed for Main, LeftMain, RightMain, and UnderText), add "(stretched)" after
+the section name:
+.EX
+MultiPixmap Main (stretched) foo.xpm, UnderText bar.xpm
+.EE
+Otherwise you can omit (<flag>), as shown with UnderText.

Using Mozilla, when I drag an Email message to anothe folder, and a popup
comes up at the same time (the poor thing can;t reach some Email server)
the WM hangs - the curson has a strange corner-like symbol, it moves
around, but I cannot DO anything at all. Way out - reset X server.

I use 6 managers with FvwmIconMan. Here is the relevent part of my
fvwm2rc:

*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers        6
*FvwmIconMan*Resolution         global
*FvwmIconMan*background         RootColor
*FvwmIconMan*foreground         RootColor
*FvwmIconMan*font               Bold
# Great! M4 reserves the word "format" so we must quote it to prevent
replacement
*FvwmIconMan*`format'           "%i"
*FvwmIconMan*shape              False
*FvwmIconMan*title              ""
*FvwmIconMan*titlebutton        flat RootColor RootColor

*FvwmIconMan*sort               none
*FvwmIconMan*followfocus        true
*FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton        up HighFore HighBack
*FvwmIconMan*focusbutton        up HighFore HighBack
*FvwmIconMan*iconbutton        up ForeColor BackColor
*FvwmIconMan*plainbutton        up ForeColor BackColor
*FvwmIconMan*selectbutton       up HighFore HighBack

All of the color names are replaced with real colors by FvwmM4. I use
*show and *dontshow to make different types of apps go to different
managers
depending on their icon,resource, etc.

The problem is that when no icons are being governed by a particular
manager, the area that it would cover on the screen when *shape is set
to True gets garbled with whatever happens to be the last thing to draw
itself there. If I set *shape to False, then I have to be sure to set
*FvwmIconMan*background to the background color or else the outlines
of the six managers will be visible whether or not they contain any
windows.

2.0.46 and 2.2.4 do not have this behavior. I like setting *shape to True
so
that the icon managers that don't have any windows yet are basically
invisible.

Perhaps it's just my personal preference and other reasonable people will
disagree, but it is really annoying when a web page contains a horizontal
scrollbar like this. Please remove this annoying horizontal scrolllbar so
that we can utilize the vertical space on the page without have to press
return and govern our own line widths.

Phew! I feel so much better!

Full_Name: Jeff Solomon
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: SPARC/Solaris 8
X_Server: X11
Submission from: (NULL) (171.64.72.46)


I have a two head display on a Sun Ultra 60 with two gfx cards. I like
to run two fvwm2 sessions, one on each screen.

I start fvwm2 from my ~/.xinitrc like this:

	fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -DSHORT_HOST=$HOSTNAME $HOME/.fvwm2/fvwm2rc"

where $HOSTNAME is something like foo instead of foo.stanford.edu. I know
that FvwmM4 defines HOSTNAME, but it always turns out to be
foo.stanford.edu
instead of just foo.

Then I have a menu item that Restarts fvwm2. In 2.0.46 and 2.2.4, I would
just say:

	Restart fvwm2

and everything would work.

Now, however, nothing works. I've read all the info on the Restart option
with 2.4.3 and I've tried all kinds of experimentation with --pass-args,
-s and -replace but nothing seems to work. I think it has to do with the
fact that when fvwm2 originally starts, it sucessfully deals with
the fact that I have two screens. But when I try to restart, my most
frequent error message is that FVWM has detected another ICCCCCCM2.0
compliant WM and I should try the -replace flag.

The problem is that I can't just say "Restart" because I need to add the
-replace flag, but I can't just say Restart fvwm2 -replace because then
I'd lose the initial arguments. Notice that I also can't just copy the 
contents of .xinitrc into the Restart command because each time through,
FvwmM4 will perform replacement (making -DSHORT_HOST literally into -Dfoo)

I *think* what I need is for yet another form of the Restart command
that allows me to specify --pass-args but also supply new ones.

Perhaps I'm way out to sea here, but if anyone has any idea what is going
on, it would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

Jeff

I though that I dealt with this situation and I actually got reports that
Restart without parameters works on a dual head setup like yours.

The trick is that when you use Restart on some screen, "-s" is added to the
end of all original arguments of fvwm2. This trick was used in the earlier
fvwm versions too, but it was too buggy regarding different Restart cases.
Currently this switch is added once just after forking for each screen.

I don't know why it does not work for you. Can you create ~/bin/fvwm2
wrapper that looks like:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo "[fvwm2 on $DISPLAY called with args]: $@"
  /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 "$@"

and use "Restart --pass-args ~/bin/fvwm2" command to see what parameters
are passed to fvwm2 on one or another screen, and send the output?

BTW, you may use this slightly modified wrapper and this Restart command
if you want to add additional parameters. But this should not be needed,
since a simple Restart without parameters should work.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm guessing that you've identified the problem in the subject line,
Ie. you are seeing a horizontal scrollbar on the web page that you
use to enter a bug report.

Right now I'm using Mozilla, and I have to make the web page quite
narrow before I see a horizontal scrollbar.

FVWM uses "Jitterbug" for bug reporting.  There is a link to Jitterbug
at the bottom of the page.  Of course your browser might have something
to do with the problem also.

If we don't hear otherwise from you, we will close this problem report.

The behavior also doesn't show up in IE5.5 or Opera 5.0. I've sent a
mail to the jitterbug folks letting them know.

Ok, thanks.

Hi Dominik,

have you discovered something in my .fvwm2rc ?

I'm starting getting used to click first once to raise the window, and 
then to do the stuff I need ... but I've dome some homework ...

While using the latest CVS for all the rest, I went back to events.c 
version 1.308 (instead of the current 1.309), and it works again as I'm 
expecting ... i.e. if for example I click on the 'reload' button in an 
unfocussed Netscape window, the window is raised and the page is reloaded 
(ClickToFocusPassesClick).

I don't have any experience of X11 ... I've just played a little bit with 
events.c trying to narrow down where the problem starts when going from 
1.308 to 1.309:

if the 'UngrabEm(GRAB_PASSIVE)' is put just after the 'XSync' as in 1.309, 
I see the 'broken ClickToFocusPassesClick'.

if the 'UngrabEm(GRAB_PASSIVE)' is put just before the 
'if (!IS_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win))' like in 1.308, everything works fine (for me), 
as far as I can see.

Does this help you somehow ? I hope so, since I really don't know what 
I've done ...

I'll be happy to test any patches/changes to the code if you want, please 
CC if you need fast feedback, since I'm not on this list, even if I read 
it almost daily ;-).

Thanks a lot.

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Um, I hope these "#ifdef FANCY_TITLEBARS" are going away soon.
I've spent much time to reduce the amount of ifdefs over the past
years.  I don't think it's a good idea to start making the same
mistakes again.

Mikhael, now that the title bar patch is applied, can you please
make a branch for the stable versions right before said commit?

Bye

I would prefer to fork starting from today, not at some arbitrary time in
the past. Considering how many new features we already added in 2.4.x, the
title bar patch is not bad (it mostly adds, not changes). The bug that
Olivier fixed was caused by this patch, but this is fixed now.

I may exclude this patch and fork, but maybe there are other opinions?

Another issue. It was planned that EWMH (Enhanced Window Manager Hints) is
done in 2.4.x series, but this is moved to 2.5.x now, right?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am agree to fork starting from "today". The change I made to FvwmScript
are *totally* backward compatible and are safe (I hope). Also I will
be happy to see this changes in 2.4.4

Yes, fvwm-ewmh contains some bad hacks (to fvwm2) and I do not think
that it is a good idea to apply it to the 2.4.x series. Moreover, I
think that the EWMH support should go inside fvwm2 (ifdefed a la GNOME).
I will start to work on such support once we've got a branch for the
stable tree. I needs "only" 3 or 4 months to complete such a work
(thanks to my previous work on fvwm-ewmh), but it can interfer with
(or depends on) the new Style stuff.

Maybe, we can have now a discussion on reallistic plan for the
near future (next six months)?

Regards, Olivier

I see no problem with the FvwmScript changes, but I don't think
it's a good idea to include new features like the title bar patch
in the stable branch.  We already have a lot of bug reports and we
want the 2.4 branch to become stable, not unstable, right?

Full_Name: Richard Lee
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: FreeBSD 4.4 Release
X_Server: XFree86 4.1.99 (CVS)
Submission from: (NULL) (204.123.2.83)


in fvwm/add_window.c, Bool setup_window_placement(..),

If XGetCommand() returns client_argc of 0 and client_argv of NULL ptr,
trying to do client_argv[0] in following function calls, such as
MergeCmdLineResources, GetResourceString, etc., will cause core dump.

I am not even close to being an experienced X programmer so I don't know if
it's a normal behavior for XGetCommand to return null ptr, but it makes
sense to me.  I worked around it for my own use by enclosing a whole set of
stuff in:

  if (client_argc) {...}
I doubt that's the correct way to fix it.  I looked at 2.4.0 code (because
it didn't coredump like 2.4.3) and I see it's completely changed.

I was running dinotrace when fvwm2 crashed.  It is 100% reproducible.
I'm sorry to have bothered you if this is already known (I browsed through
bug tracking list and didn't find anything similar) or if I'm way off
somewhere such as it being an XF86 bug and not fvwm bug.

I'd  just like to point out  that as long as the  ifdefs remain in the
code, the code remains stable.

Well, not exactly, it was pointless to include the feature and disable it.
These latest #ifdef's are equivalent to #ifdef 1 by default and there was
one small change (supposedly fix) that was not ifdef'ed.

Anyway, I accept what Dominik is trying to say and I will do this.

Mikhael.

Subject: pager w/ more visible separators
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I got tired of not being able to see the separators between pages that had no visible root, so i hacked FvwmPager to keep windows away from separators.

Basically i widen the separator. shift all windows to the right, and cut
back on the size of windows hitting the right edge of page.

The changes might not be 100%, but you might want to integrate this in some
form.


  if (size < MinSize) size = MinSize;
  if (1) {
    /* this mini-window has to be grown to be visible
     * which way it grows depends on some magic:
     * normally it will grow right but if the window is on the right hand
     * edge of a page it should be grown left so that the pager looks better */

    /* work out the page that the right hand edge is on */
    page = virt / Scr.MyDisplayWidth;

    /* if the left edge is on the same page then possibly move it left */
    if (page == ((virt - t->width + 1) / Scr.MyDisplayWidth)) {
      /* calculate how far the mini-window right edge overlaps the page line */
      /* beware that the "over" is actually one greater than on screen, but
         this discrepancy is catered for in the next two lines */
      over = edge + size - ((page + 1) * win_w * Scr.MyDisplayWidth) /
	Scr.VWidth;

      /* if the mini-window right edge is beyond the mini-window pager grid */
      over+=2;  /* leave room for separator */
      if (over > 0) {
        /* move it left by the amount of pager grid overlap (!== the growth) */
        /*edge -= over; */
        size -= over;  /* keep win away from separator */
      }
    }
  else size -= 2;  /* maximized win */
  }
  /* fill in return values */
  *x_ret = edge + 1;  /* keep win away from separator */


     gcv.line_width = 3;
