I have restored the change in merge_styles. It works well in many tests,
but it is hard to see what is freed when in complex cases, (especially
with multiple icon boxes, some orphaned), probably there is a better fix.

Hi, Not really a bug but I found nowhere to report it. :-) I dowloaded  
the icon file (360KB) several times and the file is always corrupted. Not
for sure that this is because the site or my browser. Perhap not my browser

Submission from: (NULL) (131.111.70.6)


Using Tcl/Tk (8.0 or 8.2.3) on Linux RedHat 6.2, which uses fvwm2 2.2.4,
most of the time if I do a Tk 'raise' command it takes a couple of seconds

of elapsed (but not CPU) time to complete.  This can be done as simply
as:

   /usr/bin/wish
   % raise .

This happens to me if my X server is running under xdm, but not if I
start it from the console with xinit or startx.  I've tried to find out
what the relevant differences between the X setups are, but I'm afraid
not being an Xhero, I've failed to come up with anything.

I posted a message about the problem on comp.lang.tcl, and got the 
following response from Eric Melski (The Other Tcl Guy):

   To: Mark Taylor <mbt@ast.cam.ac.uk>
   Newsgroups: comp.lang.tcl
   Subject: Re: slow 'raise' using fvwm2

   The problem is that the window manager, in addition to changing the
   stacking order of the windows, is supposed to send out a
ConfigureNotify
   event, to let the restacked window know that it has been restacked. 
When
   the window manager neglects to send this message, Tk times out waiting
for
   it.  The length of that timeout is (you guessed it) 2 seconds.  It
sounds
   like FVWM2 is another WM that doesn't follow the X spec in that it is
not
   sending the ConfigureNotify message appropriately.  That is, this is a
   window manager bug, not a Tk bug.
  
   Versions of Enlightenment <= 0.15.5 had the same problem.  It's since
been
   fixed in that WM.  I contacted the author of that WM when I was working
on
   this bug originally; I suggest you drop a line to the FVWM2
maintainers.

This looks like it could be related to bug #653.

You neglected to say where you got this distribution.

There is no "fvwm-2.2.2" anywhere in the fvwm-2.3.21.tar.gz tarball I
just downloaded from the ftp.fvwm.org site, and there isn't any such
directory in the CVS archive either...

I can't tell for sure, but it looks like you may be trying to install
directly into the source directory.

The target of the install must always be outside the source directory.

I think if you untar the distribution file, you will see that there
was an fvwm directory there when you started.

It turns out that window (or whatever it is) is named "Untitled" and so I 
placed the following in my .fvwmrc file

Style "*Untitled*"      RandomPlacement

now I don't have to do anything to bypass the placement, but the question 
still stands (doesn't really relate to fvwm, but) what is this window and 
why is it being spawned.

Is there anything else I can do to debug the origins of this window ?

Thanks Dominik for your help.

Running the tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc
produces a core file while processing

Style "foo*" IconBox 1 5 100 500, IconGrid -10 10, IconFill

It tries to produce the error message:

  IconFill must be followed by T|B|R|L, found %s.

but PeekToken has returned a NULL pointer and that doesn't work well
with the %s.

I can fix it at the fvwm_msg call by checking for zero and passing
a null string instead, or by changing PeekToken.

I'm guessing that PeekToken was returning a NULL string in the past.
If not, this would have been detected last time we ran this.

Probably changing PeekToken is too likely to break things other places.

Probably changing anything this late is not such a good idea.

Nite,

I don't think this is easily possible with argument lists (0 may be an
integer, not just string) and not really needed. The check should be done
before calling fvwm_msg. I did this.

> I'm guessing that PeekToken was returning a NULL string in the past.
> If not, this would have been detected last time we ran this.

PeekToken should return NULL if there is no more tokens, and an empty
string if there is an empty token, i.e. "". In the case above (no token)
it returns NULL as expected.

In fact PeekToken returns NULL instead of an empty string if the token is
empty, which I see as a potential problem if we have a command accepting
an empty string. This is not related to the mentioned core dump though.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Mikhael thanks for fixing the PeekToken problem, the tests now
run to completion.

I thought it might be good to share some of the results.
I've got lots of leaves to rake today so I don't know when I'll get
back to this.

I haven't actually run this under Purify yet, first I want to clean this
up some more.

I'm running this from home using Exceed.

The gradient tests take a really long time,  I guess thats because of
all the color allocation that takes place.

I ran this tests using "tail -f" on the log file so  I could tell what
step the test  was on.  The whole test   took a few hours.   I noticed
that  the log file showed the  tests ending about  an  hour before the
windows stopped getting updated.   I guess that was  a load of  stuff
being put on a queue for the X server.  I think it might be helpful if
the test could periodically case an XSync,  but I don't  see how to do
that.  Perhaps there should be an fvwm command for that.

When the test were done, all the xterm windows that it created were
transparent.  I have no idea why.  It doesn't happen when I run xterms
from the command line.  I'm not sure if the "sleep 1000" ran out or not.
Thats only 16 minutes,  I think the windows should have disappeared.

The purify.fvwm2rc file has some "SetMenuDelay" commands.  I haven't
looked that up yet, but I suspect I have another command to deal
with in fvwm24_convert.

Our man page and the test script have a "Style" option of "NoOverride".
That option is rejected as invalid.  I haven't looked it up yet.

There's a test for the command "WarpToWindow" which doesn't exist.

In the WindowList test, theres an argument "Unsorted" which comes up
invalid.

SetMenuDelay was deleted in 2.1.6, so it may be ignored.
Anyway, now it is MenuStyle * PopupImmediately/PopupDelayed, PopupDelay.

There is a search&replace typo with NoOverride.

This is a valid (and working) command. There is a syntax error again.

Yes.

I will fix purify.fvwm2rc, but it seems out dated.
fvwm-themes may be used instead to test much more things.

Mikhael.

This article was posted on the perl-Tk mailing list this week.
I think it's related to bug #653.

---------- snipp! ----------
FYI, "Slow Dialogs" have raised questions numerous times in the past,
which appeared to be window manager specific.  Here's the detail from
c.l.tcl:

Most of the syntax error are in the script on purpose to provoke

Of course it is outdated :-)  Feel free to add any stuff from
fvwm-themes.  Actually I planned to ask you to do that anyway.
But please be careful when "fixing" syntax errors.  Most are
there on purpose.

A comment in the appropriate places saying "this error is on purpose,
please don't remove" or similar would probably save a lot of headaches
going forward...  My $0.02 :)

Teehee, it's all in the README:

  NOTE: you can safely ignore all error messages, beeps, ...

Of course I didn't think about what happens when the syntax
changes back when I wrote this :-)  I will rewrite the test
for 2.4 eventually, but that can take a while.

Most of the errors are pretty much apparent.  This WarpToWindow thing
really was an error:

##### WARP TO WINDOW

 + "I" CursorMove -100 -100
 + "I" CursorMove 0 100
 + WarpToWindow
 + "I" CursorMove -100 -100
 + "I" CursorMove 0 100
 + WarpToWindow    10     10
 + "I" CursorMove -100 -100
 + "I" CursorMove 0 100
 + WarpToWindow		50p		75
 + "I" CursorMove -100 -100
 + "I" CursorMove 0 100
 + WarpToWindow 50 50

(The "I" was missing.)

What I was thinking of doing was checking in the test output after the
file got cleaned up somewhat.

Logging before intentional errors wouldn't hurt either.

It is possible to make a cut of some theme combination and dump it to rc
file using `fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc` (about 3000 fvwm commands),
but this can only give a static test. I suggest to use the fvwm-themes
package itself, not a single config from it. This enables to test most of
the static and dynamic fvwm features by opening dynamical menus, reloading
the current theme or loading other theme components (all without Restart).

Here are some statistics about a testing ability of fvwm-themes:

  http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1357/0/4615914/

This does not mean we don't need other tests, including random error test.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is it possible to automatically generate a testing script from the
themes package that can be read from the purify test script?

We don't have *that* much time to the next release :-)  The purify
test simply tries to cover as many (mis)uses of fvwm commands as
possible.  I wonder if it is possible to write a script that
automatically generates example commands from an abstract
description of each command's syntax.

> This does not mean we don't need other tests, including random error test.

I already wrote a semi random test. It's in tests/random. From the README:

  The script needs to find fvwm2 in the search path.  It then generates a list of
  strings from the executable using "strings".  With this list of strings it
  generates semi random config lines that are written to stdout.  It also throws
  in random whitespace, punctuation and quoting characters between the words.

  This test is meant to find coredumps and to run in conjunction with a malloc
  debugger.

BTW, I already tried a completely random byte stream as a config

If the requirement is that fvwm-themes is not installed, it is very time
consuming to prepare a good testing sample (like reinventing fvwm-themes).
If you have fvwm-themes installed, it is trivial, call from purify rc:

  Read themes-rc

Or the equivalent:

  PipeRead `fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc`

It is a good idea to call StartFunction after this initial read.

To modify themes after that:

  FuncFvwmThemesConfigAndUpdate '--load @redmond98 --load colors@luthien'

It is possible to repeat procedures above as many times as needed.
This is good if you want to automate the process; if you don't neglect
to click several times on menus, it is probably better to simply run
fvwm-themes-start instead of 'fvwm2 -f purify.fvwm2rc', like Dan did.

Mikhael.

There were no replies to this message about FvwmForm aliases. Since we now
have the non conflicting module configuration syntax, it's good to use it.
It will take me an hour to do, but I would like to get a feedback first.

This consistent scheme will syncronize fvwm and fvwm-themes module
aliases, such as FvwmPager-Single, FvwmButtons-DaLo, FvwmGtk-Menus,
FvwmForm-ThemeSettings, FvwmScript-IconBrowser, it is also more readable.

Now:

  module alias, which is also file name, is FormFvwmQuitVerify.

  DestroyModuleConfig FormFvwmQuitVerify.*
  *FormFvwmQuitVerify.WarpPointer
  *FormFvwmQuitVerify.Command Quit

To be:

  module alias, which is also file name, is FvwmForm-QuitVerify

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmForm-QuitVerify: *
  *FvwmForm-QuitVerify: WarpPointer
  *FvwmForm-QuitVerify: Command Quit

(note if in addition there is FvwmForm-Quit alias, there is no conflict).

The patch is tiny, I think it is good to support old 2.3 configurations.

I am not sure whether it is intentional or not, but not being able to
expand variables $V or $[VAR] in module config lines (unlike other lines)
limits fvwm functionality. There are many usages of this, say:

  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 7 VGradient $[bg.cs5] $[bg.cs6], fg $[fg.cs5]
  *FvwmBanner: Pixmap $[MY_LOGO]
  AddToFunc test I *FvwmPager: Geometry $0x$0+$1+$1

I see nothing special in module commands from user point of view. I would
like to have this functionality that all other commands have, before 2.4.

On a similar subject, I think that FvwmButtons has an unfortunate choice
of '$' prefix for its internal Action variables. This clashes with the
fvwm command expansion. I think a more appropriate prefix is '%', i.e.
%left, %width, %%.

Mikhael.

To what would the naming convention apply?  Are you proposing this

fvwm-supplied forms for config and by the themes and other "official"

Or by all aliases, even those created by the user?

I don't want to have to support this ad infinitum; I think it would be a
good idea to have this patch generate a warning when it makes such a
conversion so we can remove it again with the next fvwm release.

To aliases that fvwm and fvwm-themes install into $datadir/fvwm/.
Also to aliases used in the precreated themes coming with fvwm-themes.
fvwm currently installs FvwmForm and FvwmScript aliases.

> Or by all aliases, even those created by the user?

If the user wants he can use this naming scheme too. Nothing is required.

Yes, a warning is good. And this patch may be removed in 2.5 series.

The current Fvwm naming scheme applies to module aliases and config files.
Using mixed case, it already separates the components.
I'm not crazy about a naming scheme that includes arithmetic operators.

Shouldn't things  that  are  not part of   the  Fvwm distribution  not
include the word "Fvwm" in the name?

I would prefer:

ConfigThemePagerSingle
ConfigThemeButtonsDaLo
ScriptThemeIconBrowser

It is a matter of habit. If you look closer to software you can find that
hyphen is used in all lisp function names, in ssh-agent, gtk-config,
gnome-help-browser and other 137 executables in my /usr/bin; it is also
used to define subpackages like fvwm-web or to separate a package name from
a version and so on. It may be as well used to separate a module name.

This is not a problem for me here, fvwm-themes extends fvwm in all areas.
But here Fvwm is part of module anyway, it does not mean anything else.

Module aliases are not independent from their modules unlike menus or
functions, so they can't be covered by the same naming scheme FuncFvwmId.
Also, unlike function and menu names it is not needed to have separate
naming spaces for fvwm and user module aliases, I can show later why.

The naming that we use in fvwm-themes is similar to what Dominik once
suggested. To have a subdirectory for all modules, like:

  FvwmPager/Single
  FvwmButtons/DaLo
  FvwmGtk/Menus

But since I didn't convinced you to have this non-flat structure, the
currently suggested scheme uses the flat structure with a hyppen instead:

  FvwmPager-Single
  FvwmButtons-DaLo
  FvwmGtk-Menus

This naming scheme has these problems:

* it is inconsistent; why FvwmPager is different from FvwmScript?
* it is not easily understandable
* it is not easily parseable, can't get a module name of this alias
* can't be applied to non-standard module names, like GoodStuff
* does not cover the case where there are modules FvwmIcon and FvwmIconMan

All these problems are solved in the proposed scheme.

Anyway, I asked this only because we decided to get rid of trailing dots.
If you still prefer FormFvwmQuitVerify name more than FvwmForm-QuitVerify,
I will do this. I only don't think that this is a good long-term scheme.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,
It seems that bindings (mouse and key) are broken in
FvwmIconBox (e.g., try the default config). 
I almost never use IconBox so I do not know when this 
first happen.

I hate these things, as you say its what you get used to.

You left out COBOL.

Config is used when the file contains Fvwm commands,
the stuff FvwmScript reads directly is not Fvwm commands.

My theme download gave me "FvwmApplet-DayClock" is that missnamed?

ConfigFvwmGoodStuff

Do you mean:

ConfigFvwmIconBox
ConfigFvwmIconMan

Since you fixed the dot problem, getting rid of the trailing dots
before 2.4 sounds like a good idea.

Forgetting the dot, the naming scheme in place is:

First node: "Config"!"Form"!"Script"
Second node: "Fvwm" (owner)
Third node: identifier using CapsAsDelimiters

Theres a slight inconsistency in that the Form files are also Config files,
but they are a special type of config file.

I won't be upset if the scheme changes, if anyone can change this without
breaking a lot of stuff, you can.

Maybe we should have gone with "." extensions. :)

So the question is why FvwmPager is different from FvwmForm or FvwmGtk.

No, I planned to do a shell wrapper to FvwmApplet one day. FvwmApplet is a
class of FvwmScript designed for swallowing unlike all other FvwmScript and
it worths to assign it an individual class name as if it is another module.

Does it belong to a module Good or GoodStuff or FvwmGood or FvwmGoodStuff?

Yes, does these aliases belong to the hypotetical FvwmIcon module?

FvwmGtk is also a toolkit much like FvwmForm or FvwmScript.

> Second node: "Fvwm" (owner)

I see no reason, we can try to explain on fvwm-themes-devel@, it's long.
Also it is not clear what is an owner and who contains a list of owners,
to assign a unique owner name to a new module alias requester. :)

> Third node: identifier using CapsAsDelimiters

I think I showed not once why caps only are not good delimiters.
BTW, I only spoke about the current FormFvwm* and ScriptFvwm* aliases.
I didn't want to rename Config* files, they are not module aliases.

> Maybe we should have gone with "." extensions. :)

Hyppen is a perfect non-alpha delimiter, I am puzzled why you hate it.

No, that would be

ConfigFvwmIcon

and if that came in 2 flavors, that would be:

ConfigFvwmIconBig
ConfigFvwmIconSmall

Your point is that you can't tell where the module name leaves off
and the flavor starts.

I guess I don't see the importance of making that distinction.
You don't have to convince me, see below.

I guess if FvwmGtk reads a special language, it would be

GtkFvwmQuitVerify

otherwise it would be

ConfigFvwmGtkQuitVerify

The owner is there so that if a user creates a file

FormMyQuitVerify

he will never have to worry that fvwm will clash with the name.

I'm not being clear.  I don't hate it.
All the stuff I've written is a mild preference.

Go ahead and change it if no one else objects.

If anyone on the list thinks I did the wrong thing
by answering this request for information, let me know.
Either on the list or off.

I did invite the person involved to communicate with the workers
list but he seemed to prefer personal communication.

The only wrong thing you did, IMHO, is not mentioning that FVWM is all
about cats. :-)  I have two now, by the way.

Subject: PRIVATE: 2.3.21 FvwmIconMan  "Cannot Parse Color"

first off.  I verified that version 2.2.2 installed with redhat 6.2 does
_NOT_ generate the problem.

The problem is that FvwmIconMan puts out messages

	Cannot Parse Color

when moving the mouse over/around the icon manager.  I believe there
is no syntax error in my color lines according to my understand
of the man-page _and_ the fact that 2.2.2 does think there is an error.
Here are the "color lines" that I think cause the message:

	*FvwmIconMan*plainbutton                flat    white   red
	*FvwmIconMan*selectbutton               flat    white   black
	*FvwmIconMan*focusbutton                flat    white   blue
	*FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton       flat    white   blue

Here's the entire configuration/use of FvwmIconMan from my startup file:

fvwm 2.3.31 hangs upon startup from my .xinitrc file if output is not
redirected.  I know it sounds weird.  In my normal login & xstartup,
xinit & xinitrc are usually disassociated from any output device or
tty/pty
and I _THINK_ this is the crux of the problem.  Something is waiting to
do output.  Though I'm not sure.

Check this out:

If I start it this way, it will come up and run fine...

        exec >/tmp/__XOUT__$$ 2>&1
        set -x
        sh -x $HOME/bin/xrsh -fg $clienthost $window_manager -display
${displaybase}.0
#        xrsh -fg $clienthost $window_manager -display ${displaybase}.0

but when I do

#        exec >/tmp/__XOUT__$$ 2>&1
#        set -x
#        sh -x $HOME/bin/xrsh -fg $clienthost $window_manager -display
${displaybase}.0
        xrsh -fg $clienthost $window_manager -display ${displaybase}.0

fvwm begins to run that just doesn't complete (ie FvwmIconMan doesn't
start, FvwmPager does not start).  I can move the mouse around but
menus do not appear nor do windows move/raise-lower when mouse buttons
clicked.

I initially thought this may be related to FvwmIconMan putting out
the error message "Cannot Parse Color" but I have tried starting with
the "Module FvwmIconMan" commented out.

Here's the output of one of the temp files:
+ sh -x /home/deeno/bin/xrsh -fg deadreckon fvwm2 -s -f
/home/deeno/etc/X/wmgrs/fvwm2/rc -display :9

Cannot parse color

As you can see nothing to exotic is happenning my xrsh script.  The
exec fvwm2 line looks reasonable.

Following is my complete start up file.  Its a bit of a mess right now
since I'm just moving to fvwm2 from twm/tvtwm.

These lines are ok. The rest of your FvwmIconMan is good as well.
I don't think that this error message comes from FvwmIconMan.

It seems that in some command which requires a color, you specified
no color or a value with only spaces, like in: Style * ForeColor " "
How many spaces are there after "Cannot Parse Color "?

You should try to find which line in your configuration is problematic.
If you are sure this only happens after you move your pointer over
FvwmIconMan, I suggest to take a look at your functions IconifyAndFocus,
DeIconifyAndWarpToWindow. If nothing helps send your entire config.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks Mikhael,

And sorry for the useless bug report.

It was an option to FvwmPager causing the problem.  A missing parameter.
Though, I'm not 100% sure why moving the mouse around the FvwmIconMan
icon box/window caused the error message to be printed even when the
FvwmPager window was iconified.  Actually, I'm not sure why it would
even put out the message when it was open.

If you are curious, the offending option (in the correct from) was:

        *FvwmPagerDeskColor             *       black

I forgot the '*'.

But thanks alot.  You got me looking in the right direction.  I kept
obsessing on FvwmIconMan options.  I just check option that had a color
one by one.  Luckily, the above wasn't too far in the config file.

I really like fvwm2.  I should have probably moved to it along time ago.
But its hard to change from working stuff that I used for a long time
(ie twm & tvtwm).  But I really needed, well wanted, the virtual desk
capability.

Best Regards,
dcj

In the FvwmWinList man page, it uses this as an example keybinding for
transient mode:

       Mouse 3   R   A   Module "FvwmWinList" FvwmWinList Transient

This is invalid syntax, isn't it?  Isn't the ``"FvwmWinList"'' value
after "Module" above invalid in Fvwm 2.2 and above?

This test was run using fvwm from about 4 days ago.

It ended with a  core dump.  I don't know  why this started happening.
This  run is slightly  different.  The X server is  Solaris 8 with 256
colors vs.  Exceed with 16  bit color.   I  also moved the  ModulePath
tests to the end of the file.

Still, it ran up to FlipFocus in the test_func.

I ran this by starting a Purified fvwm with my regular config, then
bringing up FvwmTalk and typing "read ......purify.fvwm2rc".

Heres the output:

There was a typo (scanf instead of sscanf) hanging fvwm on Mouse commands,
this was done recently (grep 2000-10-05 modules/ChangeLog).

Key commands work ok except of internal FvwmIconBox commands (Next, Left)
are not recognized. FvwmIconBox used its own version of SendFvwmPipe, but
it was removed (grep 1999-11-18 modules/ChangeLog) using a library one,
this broke internal commands. Strange that noone complained this year.

I have restored SendFvwmPipe (renamed to MySendFvwmPipe) in FvwmIconBox.c,
probably it may be optimized, someone can take a look.

So FvwmIconBox seem to be working now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, but Transient option does not seem to work, i.e. FvwmWinList exists
immediately...

For my $0.02c worth....

Since the implementation of the common data directory in typically
/usr/local/share/fvwm, I'm mystified why each and every file name has
Fvwm in it.
Surely each file already has fvwm prepended in its filepath and cannot
be confused with another WM's configs. Is it necessary for fvwm itself
to be able to find a file, and fvwm needs to find an "Fvwm" for a file
name to be identified as official?
Even more mystifying is that every single command, function, menu name
and option, of fvwm-themes has an Fvwm somewhere in it.

Are we all not clear on which window manager we're talking about? ;-)

</tongue>
</cheek>

On a more serious note, wouldn't the crunching of file names, function
names, menus etc..., improve the performance of complex structures like
fvwm-themes?
Especially on slower machines like my old 486?

At the very least, some rational crunching could reduce overall total
file sizes by up to several thousand bytes. Could this reduction improve
performance? And if so, would any perceived performance adjustment
justify the effort involved?

The "Fvwm" is there to avoid name clashes with user created files
not other window managers.

If the user has a form called "MyRlogin", he won't appreciate Fvwm
creating a form with the same name.

This is sometimes called "namespaces".

Theres no doubt that shorter names would take less memory and might be
faster but I don't think you would perceive a difference.
You would have to be doing thousands to accesses to the long names
before it became an issue.

I tried installing 2.3.22 on Solaris 5.5.1 but hung up on the Makefile line

sed -e 's,FVWM_IMAGEPATH,$(FVWM_IMAGEPATH),' $< > $@ chmod a+rx $@

The "$<" file was blank, so sed hung up.
Commenting out the fvwm24_convert in bin_SCRIPTS = ...
allowed me to finish compile.

My last compile was snapshot 917 and i'd never had this problem then or
earlier.

Thanx

That should be 2 lines:

 sed -e 's,FVWM_IMAGEPATH,$(FVWM_IMAGEPATH),' $< > $@
 chmod a+rx $@

> The "$<" file was blank, so sed hung up.

I don't see how $< could be blank, its shorthand for the name of the
first dependency, in this case fvwm24_convert.in.  I usually use gnumake
but I see it in Sun's man page.

Please send a copy of the error, and the content of the generated Makefile.

My mistake, I should have read further.
Its no good in explicit rules.
I think Paul pointed this out once before, but I'll never learn,
I'm addicted to it.
I'll fix it.

An old bug has reappeared in 2.3.22 (on solaris 5.5.1
Quotes around a command

Below is a made up example.

This fails
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'Maximize 10 10'

Mouse 3		FST	N	"Maximize 10 10"


This passes...

Mouse 3		FST	N	Maximize 10 10



My actual code is...

and it complains about Popup Applications

This is a bug, you are right. The first token in the command currently
is expanded differently than all others (it always stays one word).

Dominik, I think we should first expand the command when needed, and then
start to PeekToken's, not vice versa. But I should yet learn all nuances.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Subject: focus problems w/FvwmIconMan after os upgrade

Full_Name: Peter Croce
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: AIX 4.3
X_Server: ??
Submission from: (NULL) (198.133.22.68)


Looked through the FAQ and searched the mail archive for a solution,
but had no success....

OS was upgraded to AIX 4.3   Prior to this FVWM was working great.  I
am setup with a 3x3 desktop.  On each page I have an FvwmIconMan.  Prior
to the os upgrade, when I clicked on an entry in the IconMan, the effect 
would be immediate; i.e., the window would minimize or maximize depending
on the windows current state.  After the upgrade, when I click on an entry

in the IconMan, the desired effect does not take place until the cursor is
moved off the IconMan.  Looked at the man pages and tried followfocus, but
this had no effect.  Any ideas??   Thanks,

Peter

As you may have noticed, I hadn't much time to spend on fvwm
recently due to a lot of changes in my private (non-fvwm) life.
Although I tried to answer as many mails as I could, only few
of my answers ever made it to the lists (grrrrrrrr) and there
was little time to correct the mailing problems.  The good news
is: I quit my current job a few days ago, accepted a new job in
a non-Windows company :-)) and made severe changes to the way I
spend my leisure time - Thus you will see me on the lists much
more often again, as soon as I get used to all the work again :)

Unfortunately I lost orientation about how things are going, so
I request that everybody takes a look at the to-do list in CVS
and updates it so we have a basis to work on.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Well, this is almost guaranteed to be a side effect of the parsing
problem I fixed a while ago.  Perhaps it is not possible to prevent
both problems from occuring at the same time :-P  If you have an idea
what to do about it, give it a try.  I am clueless right now.

I wonder if we can remove the README file in the FvwmForm
directory.  This information should be part of the man page,
right?  A 'find' shows up a lot of other README files in other
module directories:

  FvwmBacker/FvwmBacker.README
  FvwmConsole/README
  FvwmTaskBar/fvwm2.README
  FvwmTaskBar/README
  FvwmForm/README
  FvwmCommand/README
  FvwmScript/README
  FvwmScript/Scripts/README
  FvwmWharf/ASSound/README
  FvwmWinList/README
  
I'd like to get rid of all of these README files as the
change log files in the module directories:

  FvwmConsole/Changes
  FvwmForm/Changes
  FvwmCommand/Changes

Bye

I have no problem with removing it.  I only left it (and updated it)
since the previous author put it there.

Having you back on the case again will be great.
I've been trying to figure out what goes on with the FvwmWindow pointer
with little progress.

If you look at the purify log I posted a while ago, I fixed the first
problem and all the remaining problems have to do with an FvwmWindow
pointer that points to a deleted window.

As the subject line says:

fvwm menu keybindings don't work over input false windows.

I'm still using 2.3.22.  I'm reporting this because I'm pretty sure
there haven't been any changes in this area.

When I bring up a menu with the keyboard over a window with the hint
"input false", shortcut keys in the menu don't work.

I see the hint "input false" with FvwmIdentify.

The windows I've seen this on include "workman", "dclock" and "xsysstats".

I have no idea when this started, I just stumbled on to this.

Sorry if this is a repost... sent this as a bug report instead of a
question...
(please forgive this newbie..)

Looked through the FAQ and searched the mail archive for a solution,
but had no success....

OS was upgraded to AIX 4.3   Prior to this FVWM was working great.  I
am setup with a 3x3 desktop.  On each page I have an FvwmIconMan.  Prior

to the os upgrade, when I clicked on an entry in the IconMan, the effect

would be immediate; i.e., the window would minimize or maximize
depending
on the windows current state.  After the upgrade, when I click on an
entry

in the IconMan, the desired effect does not take place until the cursor
is
moved off the IconMan.  Looked at the man pages and tried followfocus,
but
this had no effect.  Any ideas??   Thanks,

Peter

hi !
Sorry for my english !!

Fvwm2.2.4 starts very well (any errors in .FVWM-ERRORS). I use only
FvwmPager.
Few minutes later, any keyboard shortcuts works and the only active window

is the last I've opened, I can't use the others windows. I don't understand

why, I do nothing particular before this bug appears.

Thanks.

I'm trying to track down a bug and would like some help as to go about it as 
it can't be reliably reproduced.

We have a program that opens debug displays to display waveforms and 
instrument settings.  The crash occurs when a window is opened in the 
following way:

- the system is set to manual window placement
- the user does not seethe rubber bands for placing the windows
- at that point it looks visually like fvwm restarts 

There's a core... if anyone wants executable and core (just under 1M) please 
let me know.  Here's what I get from looking at the core file:

This has been happening at least between versions .18-.21 (haven't installed 
.22 yet, will do so tomorrow) and probably quite a bit longer.  It used to 
be with the early versions (2.2 or even earlier I think) that the crash 
happened immediately every time one certain display was opened.


I just compiled with the following:
~ > uname -a
SunOS topaze 5.7 Generic_106541-02 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
~ > gcc --version
2.95.2
/sup/build/fvwm-2.3.22 > ./configure --prefix=/sup --enable-debug-msgs

I'll try to get more info, but any suggestions on how to track this down are 
welcome.

Thanks,
Nils.

Dear Workers!

Any Eterm 0.9 will safely ignore my iconbox settings in .fvwmrc and iconify

to the upper left corner (+0+0 in X geometry terms). If you iconify 2
Eterms, 
they will also ignore each other icon's presence and lay on each other.  
The correct icon is used (with IconOverride), at least.

There's no icon position switch for Eterm to my knowledge.

All other applications - even real exotic ones - behave as they should 
and iconify at the right position. This includes older versions of Eterm
(0.8). 
I'm using fvwm for many years now and don't think I'm doing anything 
wrong in my settings, but of course you never know.

This is on:
RedHat 7.0 (fully updated - glibc 2.1.94 etc.)
XFree86 4.0.1
fvwm 2.3.22, latest snapshot where this was observed: 8. nov. 2000

Thanks a lot 
Amir

I could not find a single script in modules/FvwmCommand/scripts
that still works.  Furthermore these scripts are not installed
with "make install" and thus come only with the source distribution.
So I wonder what we should do with them.

Well, there *have* been changes. I cleaned up the keyboard
grabbing code, so this may be the cause.

I tried workman and xclock and both work for me.  First I simply
moved the pointer over the window and used my key binding for the
root menu:

  Key space A   M   Menu workmenu root c c

And it works. The I tried to bind something specifically to
the client window:

  key f3 w a menu workmenu

and it works too.

Can you give step-by-step instructions on this?

Most likely you have pressed the CAPS-LOCk or NUM-LOCK keys.
Keyboard and mouse bindings do not work if one of these keys
is active. This is what our FAQ (taken from 2.3.x) says:
(the IgnoreModifiers command is new to 2.3.x, it will not
work in 2.2.4).

--
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in you configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine or very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. E.g. do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.
   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.

Well, there *have* been changes. I cleaned up the keyboard
grabbing code, so this may be the cause.

I tried workman and xclock and both work for me.  First I simply
moved the pointer over the window and used my key binding for the
root menu:

  Key space A   M   Menu workmenu root c c

And it works. The I tried to bind something specifically to
the client window:

  key f3 w a menu workmenu

and it works too.

Can you give step-by-step instructions on this?

Most likely you have pressed the CAPS-LOCk or NUM-LOCK keys.
Keyboard and mouse bindings do not work if one of these keys
is active. This is what our FAQ (taken from 2.3.x) says:
(the IgnoreModifiers command is new to 2.3.x, it will not
work in 2.2.4).

--
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in you configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine or very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. E.g. do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.
   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.

I could not find a single script in modules/FvwmCommand/scripts
that still works.  Furthermore these scripts are not installed
with "make install" and thus come only with the source distribution.
So I wonder what we should do with them.

Ok, I just updated and it still fails.

Here are the lines I think are important:

Style "*" MouseFocus
Style "*" Lenience
Key KP_Multiply A N Popup Utilities
MenuStyle "*" WIN, PopupDelayed, PopupDelay 150
MenuStyle "*" Animation
MenuStyle "*" PopupOffset 1 100


I move the mouse over a no input window, hit Kp_multiply,
and the menu pops up and the item under the pointer highlights.

None of the keyboard accelerators work, return won't select anything,
escape doesn't work, the arrow keys don't work.  The menu can still be
operated with the mouse and moving the pointer in and out of the menu

I think I've fixed last nights snap building problem, but I attempted
to verify that everything was OK and I ran into a problem.

I ran make distcheck and it failed with this:

cd .. && CONFIG_FILES=utils/fvwm-menu-headlines CONFIG_HEADERS= /bin/sh ./config.status

Sure enough, there is no file named fvwm-2.3.23/=build/fvwm24_convert.in

I had EXTRA_DIST set to the file fvwm24_convert, and Mikhael changed it
to fvwm24_convert.in.  Any clues?

This is because this generation was not designed to pass distcheck. Fixed.
I would change this, so the generation is done by configure not by hand,
but this is not really important.

EXTRA_DIST variable lists files we want to include into the distribution,
which are not included otherwise. We want to include fvwm24_convert.in
not fvwm24_convert, which is generated on 'make' time.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Okay, I can reproduce this with your description. In the mean time
I discovered several problems that are probably related:

 1) Sometimes I have to click twice to paste into a window. The
    first click is simply ignored.
 2) Sometimes clicking into a window does not raise the window
    to the top (sloppyfocus and mousefocusclickraises). I have to
    leave and reenter the window before this works.

All problems are related to grabbing keys/buttons. I will try to
fix them but will be gratefull for any hints.

Fixed. The menu code now grabs the keyboard when the first menu
is openend.

I'd like to be able to link fvwm (and the modules) with the efence
library.  All it takes is to add "-lefence" to the LDADD variables
in the Makefile.am files.  What do I have to do to make this choice
a configure option?

With more and more goons making their application windows
override redirect I wonder if we should make a style option
to help the poor souls that are stuck with these windows.
Something like

  Style <appname> IgnoreOverrideRedirect

comes to my mind.  Of course fvwm can't notice when such
windows are created, but we already look for override
redirect windows in the stacking code.  With this style, fvwm
would remove the override redirect from such a window when
detected and take over management of the window.  If we could
only come up with a method to detect these windows reliably.

Given the time we took between 2.2 and 2.4 I would even be
willing to introduce this style before 2.4 is released.  Any
comments are welcome.

Bye

Sorry, I have no idea how you could find out the application that
created this window.

I did not do this because it wasn't done before.  I feared this
would introduce new incompatabilities with old config files.

I have no idea :-)  I'm completely ignorant about autoconf and
automake.  However, I managed to patch configure.in by cutting
and pasting the dmalloc stuff :)  I don't care the least bit
how this is done as long as I don't have to patch the Makefiles
when I want to use efence.

LD_OPTIONS has nothing to do with autoconf or automake, its a way
of passing options to the linker.  Do "man ld" to verify that
it works with your linker.  I think its pretty universal.

(This is in response to mail to Dominik and myself.)

I don't think any of us ignored your post, its still in my inbox.

I haven't responded because
sporadic dumps don't help much, a reliable way to reproduce the problem
is needed.  I just reran the purify regression test, this time without
purify and it ran to completion.

Your dump looks a little similar to the purify problem, you have a possibly
valid value for the window pointer, but the prev and next pointers are
bad.  It might be useful to try to confirm the purify output.
Perhaps you could print and mail the whole structure:

print *t

That's the problem, I can't reproduce it reliably.  I know what I have isn't 
worth much... I have two core dumps that someone can look at under solaris 
2.7 if that helps... other than that I can't do much.

Let me know what else I can do...

I have access to Solaris 2.7 machines, but
I've never seen a Solaris core file that was useful anywhere but on the
machine on which the core file was generated.  (Same on HP.)

If this is the same problem reported by Purify, (and it seems like it
could be), poking around in the core file won't help much anyway.  The
problem occurs before the core is generated.

Perhaps you want to try once or twice again.
There was something missing from the test script which I just fixed.

I just ran and produced this core:

I have just checked in some debugging code for the stack ring.
You might detect a corrupt stacking chain before fvwm cores out.
It may be a start for debugging.  This code verifies the stack
ring whenever a window is raised or lowered and prints a dump
of the relevant data to the console.

If you can get a copy of the efence library you can configure with
--enable-efence and then set these environment variables before
running fvwm:

  export EF_PROTECT_FREE=1
  export EF_FILL=123
  export EF_ALIGNMENT=1

The EF_ALIGNMENT variable may not work on your system, though.
If efence detects a problem it will immediately leave a core
dump. This might help tracking the problem.

Bye

Recently I have problems with my PS/2 mouse. Sometimes, when I
press any mouse button, I get not just a single ButtonPress
event but one press, one release and another press or even more
release/press events - as if I had pressed the button several
times in fast succession. This is independent of the OS. It
happens with Linux, and Windows. I also exchanged the mouse
with another one, so it's not the mouse hardware. Also, there
is no IRQ conflict on my system:

  PCI video card:          IRQ 3
  /dev/ttys0:              IRQ 4
  ISA soundcard:           IRQ 5
  /dev/lpt0:               IRQ 7
  PCI SCSI adapter:        IRQ 9
  PCI soundcard:           IRQ 10
  AGP video card:          IRQ 11
  PS/2 (keyboard + mouse): IRQ 12
  IDE controller:          IRQ 14
  ISA ISDN card:           IRQ 15

This setup worked perfectly well for years.  The only additions
I made recently was adding the ISDN card - but the mouse still
worked with it.  Then I added an ethernet adapter and things
still worked well for a few days.  Then the problems started
and since then I replaced the network card with the PCI graphics
card, but the problem still persists.

I also tried to attach the mouse to the serial port instead -
to no avail.  One observation I made is that the chance that
the additional clicks show up seems to be somehow related to
the speed of the mouse pointer: the faster the mouse moves the
higher the chance. It still happens if I don't move the pointer
at all, but much less frequently.

Help!

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hello,

I've got a license for one day for using insure++ ("instrumental
memory debugger" as Purify).
Here the first two outputs from it, the first one (22650) done with
tests/purify.fvwm2rc, the second one done using fvwm-themes.
I hope that this may help.
There is a good documentation at:
http://www.parasoft.com/products/insure/index.htm
see in particular:
http://www.parasoft.com/products/insure/manuals/v5_2/unix/ref/err_intr.htm
(the terminology is not the same as Purify).
The good point is that insure++ run under linux, the bad point is that
there are no official "personal" license and a professional one 
cost some thing like 20 000 euros (there is also a light version with 
some RedHat with time limited licenses).
I can still use it for 22 hours, so if one want I do particular
test say me.

Olivier

I've never had this problem, my advice is to never use the mouse.
Have you been drinking a lot of coffee lately?

Seriously, Usenet  may  be the way  to  go, theres lots  of traffic on
"comp.os.linux.hardware" and "comp.sys.ibm.pc-hardware.misc".

Can somebody shed a light on how the taskbar can coredump un its
DeadPipe() function? This is the stack trace of the dump:

#0  0x4000a314 in fixup (l=0x402f4dd4, reloc_offset=1075985464)
    at dl-runtime.c:81

(gdb) where

#8  0x804a741 in main (argc=6, argv=0xbffff5f4) at FvwmTaskBar.c:348

And this is the DeadPipe() function:

  void DeadPipe(int nonsense)
  {
    exit(1);
  }

Hm, the last time I asked (2 years ago) the fee was about 1500
Euro.

Just run as many test as possible as long as the license lasts.
insure++ provides information about where memory leaks occur and
is *much* better than purify. Once the parasoft people offered
to give me a license for a week every time I asked them, but then
the people involved left parasoft and founded a new company :-(
Perhaps I should just ask the new folks if they would donate a
license to our cause.

That call to "exit" is not as final as it looks, FvwmTaskbar has
an "atexit" routine.

Still, I don't see the problem, it looks like its trying to load
a shared library during termination processing.  Whats "libnss_compat"?

If there is an atexit function doing X calls, and the DeadPipe
function calls exit, doesn't this make the signal handler do
X calls, which I thought wasn't alllowed.

NSS is the Name Service Switch library; it's thing that reads
/etc/nsswitch.conf and decides where to go to look up passwords, hosts,
protocols, etc. etc. (local files, DNS, NIS, NIS+, etc.)

This seems a little suspicious.  Either we're trashing memory retrieved
or used by NSS (gethostbyname, getpwuid, and that type of thing), or
there's a bug in these system libraries somewhere.

God belss parasoft :-)  I managed to fix a dozen leaks and core dumps
in about an hour.  BTW, "dangling read" and "dangling free" mean that
a pointer was read/freed that has already been freed.

In the two logs there are about 20 occurences of dangling read or
free that all look alike and that I all do not understand.  For
example:

------------------------------ snip --------------------------
[bindings.c:173] **READ_DANGLING**
>>     n2 = sscanf(token,"%19s",context);

  Reading from a dangling pointer: token

  Pointer : 0x082b41c8
  In block: 0x082b41c8 thru 0x082b41c9 (2 bytes)
                  block allocated at:
                          malloc()
                        __strdup()
                  DoGetNextToken()  Parse.c, 328
                    GetNextToken()  Parse.c, 335
                    ParseBinding()  bindings.c, 104
                     binding_cmd()  bindings.c, 347
                   mouse_binding()  bindings.c, 366
                 ExecuteFunction()  functions.c, 1037
                   SetRCDefaults()  fvwm.c, 980

                  stack trace where memory was freed:
                            free()
                    ParseBinding()  bindings.c, 155
                     binding_cmd()  bindings.c, 347
                   mouse_binding()  bindings.c, 366
                 ExecuteFunction()  functions.c, 1037
                   SetRCDefaults()  fvwm.c, 980
                            main()  fvwm.c, 632

  Stack trace where the error occurred:
                    ParseBinding()  bindings.c, 173
                     binding_cmd()  bindings.c, 347
                   mouse_binding()  bindings.c, 366
                 ExecuteFunction()  functions.c, 1037
                   SetRCDefaults()  fvwm.c, 980
                            main()  fvwm.c, 632
------------------------------ snip --------------------------

All these occurences look similar to this:

  action = GetNextToken(action, &token);
           ^__ place where the memory block is allocated
  if (!token)
    return
  free(token);
     ^__ and where it is freed
  ...
  action = GetNextToken(action, &token);
  if (!token)
    return
  (read or free token again)
     ^__ where it is claimed to have been accessed

The dangling read/free occurs in the marked line.  Since
GetNextToken() is supposed to always return either a fresh block
of malloced memory or NULL in token, the second call of
GNT() should have overwritten the old pointer. So either insure++
is confused or GetNextToken() returns without modifying token
somehow.  But after looking up and down the code I can't find
an explanation for this.

Yup.

I simply used tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc but added a "read"
command that reads in some modules:

--------------------- patch ------------------------
Module    FvwmBanner
Module		FvwmBanner

+read /tmp/modules

################# GLOBAL COMMANDS ###################

--------------------- patch ------------------------

The contents of the file /tmp/modules:

When the test script ends, there is a FvwmTaskBar core file.  BTW,
many modules leave a core in this setup. If you find a different
core, comment out the corresponding module line until you find get
the corrent one.

Of course. Fixed in a moment. Boy, I don't understand why people
think they have to free every resource the program allocated
before quitting. The only modules I can think of that could do
something useful are FvwmButtons and FvwmWharf (they could
unswallow windows).

BTW, what will happen with the colour sets if FvwmTheme is
terminated?

This is still pre-alpha, but I thought the fvwm-workers
might appreciate a preview.

Looks very interesting, though I'm not exactly sure I understand... It
allows you to nest windows inside a "super-window"? I wonder if
FvwmButtons might like to have the extra functionality of dynamically
adjustable boundaries (FvwmPartition is providing that, right?).

Ok I run again with fvwm2: starting fvwm2 with fvwm-themes, then
read purify.fvwm2rc. This time the test go to the end (the first
time I stop fvwm2 because I thought that the test was finished:
I've a message as:
### mar nov 21 09:18:48 CET 2000: Tests done, F12 or any mouse button will 
make fvwm quit ###
but now I see that the test was not finish.
I think that I do not need to send the "Leaks detected at exit",
but if you want it I can sent it.

This one was done with fvwm-themes:
go around all themes (in the menus order).
All the lines before [add_window.c:1992] **LEAK_FREE** (line 168)
came from the startup. The [add_window.c:1992] **LEAK_FREE** came
when I switch to awol, The [PC: 0x4027211a] **USER_ERROR** came
when I switch to blackbox, The [Picture.c:316] **LEAK_FREE**
came when I switch to cde. After no more errors. Moreover,
I try a number of operations

Wait a minute; the DeadPipe() function has been "retired" from signal
handling. It therefore doesn't matter what functions it calls. If
there is a core dump here then something must be corrupt.

If you examine the stack-trace then DeadPipe was called quite legally
from ReadFvwmPipe.

Hm.  At least, removing the X cleanup code from the atexit function
stops the core dump.  I think the core dump has nothing to do with
signal handling but with thrying to do X stuff when the X server is
shutting down.

* It seems that WinList is ok (the same errors that we found in
all modules)

* You will find output for FvwmThemes and FvwmIconBox: no core

All fixed except the sigaction user error (see separate mail) and
the core dump.  The dump was caused by an unhandled X error you
schould look for the error output on the console.

Oh, and btw, can you please test my theme (the luthien theme) with
isure++? It does a lot with colour sets and gradients (fvwm,
FvwmPager, FvwmButtons, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan plus any other
modules you care about).

I'm guessing that FvwmButtons went through this logic:

#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT
    sigact.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;
# else
    sigact.sa_flags = 0;
#endif

with SA_INTERRUPT defined, and its defined to be 0x20000000.

Take a look at your /usr/include/sys/signal.h.

If it really is defined there, then I think you just have a disagreement
between insure++ and your system about the validity of the flag.

* One FvwmScript output with FvwmApplet-Mixer (from fvwm-themes;
gives the "better" result). Maybe we need a bison expert.

* One GUI FvwmGtk output (ThemesSettings from fvwm-themes , the only
example I know)

* One output with a Gtk menu, here I've got a core dump (with gnome 
libs enabled or not).

* Two output for Form one without a core (1: Form Default) one with
a core (2: fvwm-themes ThemesSettings). I do not think that the core
is Form specific, it is caused IMHO by colorsets changes.

*Two* core dump follow:

It seems that FvwmAnimate, FvwmAuto, FvwmBanner, FvwmBacker, FvwmBanner
FvwmEvent, FvwmRearange, FvwmConsole, FvwmCommand, FvwmIdent are ok.

However there is a problem in FvwmM4 (and so probably with its
brother FvwmCpp).

I do not know if I have to test Warf, Save, SaveDesk, DragWell and Debug.
I would say no, but perhaps for Wharf (but we have Buttons!)

I cannot reproduce again this but I've found in my X err log:

FvwmIconMan: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 3 (BadWindow)
   Major opcode of failed request:  40 (TranslateCoords)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
   Resource id of failed request:  0xefbeadde 
 Leaving a core dump now

from /usr/include/bits/sigaction.h:

  # define SA_INTERRUPT 0x20000000 /* Historical no-op.  */

Although that is not the system insure++ ran on.  But I guess Linux
systems don't differ this much.  Seems taht we can do nothing about
this warning.

...

I think the core was caused by the UMR in the previous line of
code.  Now that the UMR is fixed the core should not happen.

Insure run with fvwm2, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTask (and other
modules Buttons, Auto, Event, ...) with fvwm-themes and
purify.fvwm2rc. Note that I've got *no* core dump at all.

I've got two log from fvwm2 ?
May be I forget to send you such log before if purify.fvwm2rc
can 2 fvwm2 logs ...

I am sorry to do not go faster with log productions, but I try: 
runing everythings under insure and fvwm-themes + p.f, but my poor 
laptop crash!

Ooops, now Form core dump at once, I do not see why,
the only insure info is:

[unknown:unknown] **Insure trapped signal: 11**

  Stack trace where the error occurred:

The code in FvwmButtons says:

#ifdef SA_INTERRUPT
    sigact.sa_flags = SA_INTERRUPT;
# else
    sigact.sa_flags = 0;
#endif

which as far as I can see is fine. The package is somehow considering
the value of SA_INTERRUPT on this platform (whatever it is) to be
illegal. The question then becomes "What is its definition of legal?"

In my opinion, its a really bad idea to try to fix the memory leaks in
FvwmForm.   When I worked  on this module,  I noticed it leaked memory
all over the place,  but due  to the nature   of this module, its  not
persistent so it shouldn't matter much.

In this case, its now trying to free up the old color name before it allo=
cates
space for the new one, however, the initial values are set
in FvwmForm.h like this:

EXTERN char *color_names[4] =3D {
  "Light Gray", "Black", "Gray50", "Wheat"
};

I think the new algorithm does quite a nice job to make sure the
window are covered as little as possible.  But there is a
situation under which it has a probably unwanted effect:

||          ||          ||
||          ||          ||
|+----------++----------+|
|                        |
|                        |
|                        |
+------------------------+

Now, if I open a tall new window it is placed like this:

+------------------------+ <-- viewport
|+----------++----------+|
||      +--------+      ||
||      |        |      ||
|| w1   |        |  w2  ||
||      |  new   |      ||
||      | window |      ||
|+------|        |------+|
|       |        |       |
|       |        |       |
|       +--------+       |
+------------------------+

So now I get both old window covered about 50%.  With the old
algorithm, the new window would have covered either window 1
or window 2 exclusively.  So at least I did not have to move
the new window to work with one of the two others. 

...?

There are still some problems with FvwmButtons (no problems at all
with luthien, olicha) awol buttons core dump. Maybe a container
problems? The log and the core dump:

  Reading from a dangling pointer: user_dir

  Pointer : 0xbffffb5c (stack)

  Stack trace where the error occurred:
                            main()  FvwmM4.c, 228
------------------------------- snip ---------------------------

I don't think it's a problem.  Insude++ always reports a 'dangling read'
when a variable (like user_dir) is filled a la getenv("FOOBAR").

I also did what I could in FvwmScript and FvwmGtk.  But the memory
leaks in Script seem way too touchy to risk fixing them.  I fixed
a few leaks in FvwmGtk, but I may have misunderstood something, so
please check for coredumps in the file expand.c.  The other errors
seem to be Gtk bugs, including the bad function pointer that caused
the core dump :-P

If there is still time, rerun insure over the core modules and
fvwm2.  THe time is better spent there.

I think I might be able to talk Parasoft into donating an insure++
license to our cause.  However, I think they will ask for
something in return - perhaps a banner or link on our home page or
something.  Of course I want to discuss this before doing
anything.  What do you think?  What else could we offer?

They should be happy with being mentioned on the workers list.
Perhaps Jason can supply you with the current number of subscribers.

I don't see  putting a banner  on the main  page  as a viable  option.
We moved the authors and Jason off the main page.
Perhaps we  could add a  link to a sponsor's  page and put a banner or
link there.

I think Jason would have to OK anything commercial.

After the recent changes to the menus, my menus paint a line at a time
at an extremely slow pace.

One line paints slower than an entire 30 line menu using 2.2.4.

(You would only notice this running fvwm remotely.)

I added a bunch of module starts to the tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc
file.  This config file quits after the tests are done.

In order to take advantage of existing functionality like snapping,
every bar is its own window.  An instance of the module
maintains a hierarchy of bars.  This would be the "super-window".
There is no "background", so empty panes just expose the root window
on the screen behind them.

You can either drag a bar to resize adjacent windows or
resize a window manually which moves adjacent bars and
potentially resizes other windows.

You can also attach multiple windows to each pane.
For example, you could have several vim windows open in one pane
and switch between your source files quickly.  I suppose its
a little like having an IconMan for each pane with one window
deiconized at a time.  Currently, I'm just using a Raise instead
of icon operations.

So, what are the protocols for adding a new module to the trunk?
This is too early, but what stage of maturity would be appropriate?
beta, pre-alpha, ...

I guess 'legal' does not include 'Historical no-op':

  # define SA_INTERRUPT 0x20000000 /* Historical no-op.  */

So it's fvwm which is shutting down, not the X-server?

If you use the window manager to "hold" the X session, shutting down
the window manager leads to the X server shutting down too.
So if your .xinitrc ends with executing fvwm without an ampersand
at the end of the line, and you quit fvwm, its possible fvwm will end,
and X will end before the module sees the broken pipe and does all its
cleanup.

If you use xlogout, or some other means of holding the X session, you
wouldn't see this.

I re-updated this morning and the problem seems to be fixed already.

Hello,

Here my story with ParaSoft.
First I ask a test license as they explain in the insure++
doc. After a few days I get an email from : 
        Sabine Navailles <s.navailles@parasoft-fr.com>
She wanted my phone number and after a long conversation and
a few emails she was ok for a one day license.

The subject of the conversation:

* Is it for a personal used? 
Of course I say yes. Note that it seems that there are no personal
license policy for insure++

* For which soft?
I explain what is the GPL, FVWM and give the FVWM url (so maybe
parasoft look at us).

* The professional price is not reasonable, what you can give in
echange to get a usable license (more than one days) at a reasonable
cost (no price was mentioned, but the professional one which is
20 000 euros)?
She wants a link in the FVWM www site and that we/I do some publicity
for the Linux World. I answer that I've to ask the other developers.
Also, I explain that the fvwm-workers list will be a source of good
publicity for insure++ even with only a one day licenses (I think it
is the reason I get this license ...).

So now I do not know exactly what to do. I start this story without
thinking a lot: I just wanted to test insure++. I think that it will
be better that Dominik get a license (and not me, even if I am ok to 
run insure++ a lot).

If we want insure++ for free I think that we have to do a good 
proposition. I think that a sponsor www pages is a good idea (we can 
add some  comments, "Yes, insure++ is great ... it save our time ...") 
and we can suggest some way to take advantage of the help they give to
us ("Parasoft help the free software community ..."), but this may be
dangerous.

So now, either Dominik try to get a license or I can contact Sabine
(a cool women, ready to understand some things, but she wants to win
something and maybe more), to explain the situation and either trying
to get something or says "it is better that you "work" with Dominik ..."

Hello,
This mail never arrive to the fvwm-workers mailing list
yesterday because it was to big I think.
In fact it seems that I can still produce insure++ logs, but
I cannot recompile, so I can produce logs with the yesterday
FVWM version only.
I send this message with all the logs to Dominik, the version
for the mailing list is without logs. If some one want these
logs just ask me.

Olivier

I wrote Yesterday:

So maybe my last insure logs.
I am a bit tied so I did what I can at the end.

As you ask Dominik a FvwmGtk Log. The interesting part seems to
be without interest so I send all the file. I use
a menu and it seems that the dump core are repeated by: popup a
submenu menu and go to it and then come back to the father menu.
The core dump is below.

There is also a FvwmScript Log. After that I run again fvwm2 with
fvwm-themes and do a few switches with some modules under insure:
FvwmButtons-errs.6827, FvwmPager-errs.6928. Then I switch to
redmond98 with the TaskBar and the ButtonsBar under insure. The
Buttons core dump is as in "Re: CVS domivogt: * Fixed errors from 
insure++ log in module". After that I read purify.fvwm2rc and I 
hope that fvwm2 go to the end of it (the TaskBar do not core dump).

Ah, here a recent FvwmIconMan Log (and I've lost an IconBox one!).

Sorry for the size of the message but it ends a crazy day for me.

Olivier

I'm not a big fan of banners on the web site, personally... at least not
the front page.

I would be happy to include an acknowledgement/thanks in one of the base
files in the distro; AUTHORS or the FAQ (if it was in the FAQ it'd be on
the web site, too) or even README.

Or, if there were some version of the AUTHORS file or similar on the web
site, as a link off the homepage, it would be appropriate there.

Anyway, that's my $0.02.

Currently we have a non-obvious authors page at the top of

http://www.fvwm.org/developers.html

Now that you bring it up, I agree we should get the AUTHORS file
out onto this page or a new page in a manner similar to the FAQ,NEWS.

  For Debian we have a 'Partners Page' (www.debian.org/partners) for 
providers of systems, bandwidth, etc.... basically: any ongoing contribution 
we give organizations the option of having a link there.  For one time 
gifts, we send mail to our debian-announce list.  This arrangement satisfies 
the people who work with us.
  I would suggest something similar: an 'Acknowlegements' page where you 
list who's contributing and what.  I'd suggest avoiding statements like 
'insure++ saves us a lot of debug time' since that's subjective.  Rather 
something like 'the FVWM developers would like to thank ParaSoft <link> for 
donating a license for their insoft++ <license> to help debug .... etc.'  
It's short, objective, and links to the provider so people who want more 
info.  Not doing this on the main page makes it non-offensive.

Just my few centimes...

Nils.'

when FvwmTheme quits any colours that it allocated remain in the

So maybe my last insure logs.
I am a bit tied so I did what I can at the end.

As you ask Dominik a FvwmGtk Log. The interesting part seems to
be without interest so I send all the file. I use
a menu and it seems that the dump core are reapted by: popup a
submenu menu and go to it and then come back to the father menu.
The core dump is below.

There is also a FvwmScript Log. After that I run again fvwm2 with
fvwm-themes and do a few switchs with some modules under insure:
FvwmButtons-errs.6827, FvwmPager-errs.6928. Then I switch to
redmond98 with the TaskBar and the ButtonsBar under insure. The
Buttons core dump is as in "Re: CVS domivogt: * Fixed errors from 
isure++ log in module". After that I read purify.fvwm2rc and I 
hope that fvwm2 go to the end of it (the TaskBar do not core dump).

Ah, here a recent FvwmIconMan Log (and I've lost an IconBox one!).

Sorry for the size of the message but it ends a crazy day for me.

Hello,
This mail never arrive to the fvwm-workers mailing list
yesterday because it is to big I think.
In fact it seems that I can still produce insure++ logs, but
I cannot recompile, so I can produce logs with the yesterday
FVWM version.
I send this message with all the logs to Dominik, the version
for the mailing list is without logs. If some one want these
logs just ask me.

Olivier

I wrote Yesterday:

So maybe my last insure logs.
I am a bit tied so I did what I can at the end.

As you ask Dominik a FvwmGtk Log. The interesting part seems to
be without interest so I send all the file. I use
a menu and it seems that the dump core are repeated by: popup a
submenu menu and go to it and then come back to the father menu.
The core dump is below.

There is also a FvwmScript Log. After that I run again fvwm2 with
fvwm-themes and do a few switches with some modules under insure:
FvwmButtons-errs.6827, FvwmPager-errs.6928. Then I switch to
redmond98 with the TaskBar and the ButtonsBar under insure. The
Buttons core dump is as in "Re: CVS domivogt: * Fixed errors from 
insure++ log in module". After that I read purify.fvwm2rc and I 
hope that fvwm2 go to the end of it (the TaskBar do not core dump).

Ah, here a recent FvwmIconMan Log (and I've lost an IconBox one!).

Sorry for the size of the message but it ends a crazy day for me.

Olivier

Hello,
This mail never arrive to the fvwm-workers mailing list
yesterday because it is to big I think.
In fact it seems that I can still produce insure++ logs, but
I cannot recompile, so I can produce logs with the yesterday
FVWM version.
I send this message with all the logs to Dominik, the version
for the mailing list is without logs. If some one want these
logs just ask me.

Olivier

I wrote Yesterday:

So maybe my last insure logs.
I am a bit tied so I did what I can at the end.

As you ask Dominik a FvwmGtk Log. The interesting part seems to
be without interest so I send all the file. I use
a menu and it seems that the dump core are repeated by: popup a
submenu menu and go to it and then come back to the father menu.
The core dump is below.

There is also a FvwmScript Log. After that I run again fvwm2 with
fvwm-themes and do a few switches with some modules under insure:
FvwmButtons-errs.6827, FvwmPager-errs.6928. Then I switch to
redmond98 with the TaskBar and the ButtonsBar under insure. The
Buttons core dump is as in "Re: CVS domivogt: * Fixed errors from 
insure++ log in module". After that I read purify.fvwm2rc and I 
hope that fvwm2 go to the end of it (the TaskBar do not core dump).

Ah, here a recent FvwmIconMan Log (and I've lost an IconBox one!).

Sorry for the size of the message but it ends a crazy day for me.

Of course you can, what you see proves it.
Whether its pretty or not is another matter.

I fixed it this morning, or are you going to re-fix it?

Hi Chris, did you mean to reply directly to me?

My understanding is that if you don't do your X cleanup, X will do it
for you when the module exits.

Most people exit the window manager and X at the same time.  Cleanup
is not an issue for them anyway.

I think what you propose might work, but I don't think it would add
much value.  I don't believe fvwm restarts actually cause any kind of
leak in the X server, if it did, any X client could cause a leak, and
you would have to be restarting the X server pretty frequently.

One of the logfiles was an old one that seems to have been
edited manually.  The FvwmTaskBar logfile does not show
anything relevant, only the sigactio() 'user errors' and
the emory leak in XOpendisplay() which is the fault of
your X server.  I fixed the outstanding leaks in FvwmIconMan
and - hopefully - fvwm.

So, here is a summary of the thread this far:

They should be happy with being mentioned on the workers list.
Perhaps Jason can supply you with the current number of subscribers.

I don't see  putting a banner  on the main  page  as a viable  option.
We moved the authors and Jason off the main page.
Perhaps we  could add a  link to a sponsor's  page and put a banner or
link there.

I think Jason would have to OK anything commercial.

We may offer:

 - to mention parasoft in the AUTHORS/FAQ/README file.
 - being thanked for the assistance on the mailing list
   (most prominently the aunnouncement list).
 - a link from our web site (e.g. acknowledgements page).
 - allow them to mention their support on their own web site
   (hey, perhaps they could some advertising for us :-) ).

We can not or do not want to offer:

 - advertising
 - banners on the front page

Correct me if I'm wrong.

So, I would offer this:

 - Add an acknowledgements page to our web site and add a link to
   Parasoft.  There we can also thank them for their donation.  A
   banner with a reasonable size might be acceptable if it can't
   be interpreted as an advertisement.
 - Supply an ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file in the distribution (or whatever
   the proper name for such a file would be).
 - Their name will regularly appear on the mailing lists.

Bye

Gee, I know, that's hard to resist :-)  I often do this because
I can't read the code otherwise - and then don't care to remove
the changes afterwards.  *guilty*

I have a bug where an xview window moves/resizes itself to a wrong position
off the screen....but only after a fvwm page switch. My guess is fvwm is
feeding it bad position info somewhere (Y position is off by title bar
amount). I'm not expecting a fvwm fix....but i'm wondering if theres a way
to detect that a window move went off the screen so it can make a move
adjustment (in this case move window down by title bar Y).

Thanx

I have a script that reinstalls fvwm from a running fvwm session
and then restarts fvwm.  In the past this worked fine, but
recently all my "fprintf(stderr, ...);" debug output does not make
it to the console after the restart.  Everything still works fine
if I restart fvwm normally.  The script looks like this:

--------------------------- snip ---------------------------
#!/bin/zsh

unsetopt shwordsplit

~/bin/fvwminstall
# passing $* does not work properly with /bin/sh
exec fvwm2 $*
--------------------------- snip ---------------------------

and I call it with this line:

  Restart --dont-preserve-state --pass-args $HOME/bin/restartfvwm

I can see the output of fvwm_msg() calls, though. I'm puzzled.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Well, *technically* I knew you could, but I had hoped nobody would
ever do thisi.  But I guess there is no such thing as a bad
programming practice that nobody uses :)

No.  It's just that I could not call back my mail after it read
yours and it was already sent.  I'm not on line when writing mail
or patches, and as soon as I dial in, the mails get sent.

It wouldn't have been that bad if you had not sent it four times :-)

FvwmPager:
  Nothing relevant except an UMR in M_RESTACK packets.  This was
  fvwm's fault.  These last window in these packets was
  uninitialised.  This led me to some fixes in the
  BroadcastRestack() function.  Also noticed that some
  M_FOCUS_CHANGE packets were one ulong too large.

FvwmButtons:
  The crash is already fixed.  Nothing else worth mentioning.

FvwmIconMan:
  No interesting errors.  Only the XOpenDisplay() leak that has
  to be fixed in the X sources.  I still wonder why this leak does
  not appear for some modules - but then, 2 bytes leaked per
  module is not such a big problem :)

FvwmScript:
  Let it leak.  It's much too risky to fix.  Added comments
  to the places with the known leaks.

FvwmGtk:
  My, Gtk does not seem to need any calling program to produce
  core dumps and memory leaks.  Perhaps you should rather send
  that output to the Gtk crew.

fvwm:
  I got all of these berfore.

Bye

Since this commit something strange happen when I switch
between themes with fvwm-themes: the size of the windows become
very very big: geometry like 1232132x45454565 and even more :o)

If you can give me instructions to reproduce this I will look into
it.

Hm, I didn't do a lot of changes in fvwm. Can you give me

Try this: start FVWM without config file and open a Console.
Then type in the Console:

Style * MwmDecor, OLDecor, HintOverride, MwmFunctions, GNOMEUseHints

In my machine, the Console become infinitly big (I crash one time
the X server ...).

Is there a chance of getting 2.2.23 out sometime in the near future with all of the insure++ fixes?  We have crashes fairly regularly here (one every 2-3 days on each workstation) that came from the stack ring problem that was fixed, among others.  I'm attempting to convince people here in the office that FVWM is better than OLWM (yes, OLWM...:) and with those crashes not happening it would be much easier.

Thanks,
Nils.

Could it be static? My home PC once went berserk (after I'd vacuumed in
the same room) such that simple mouse movements actually triggered all
manner of on-screen actions; this remained until I powered off. Now, the
mere sound of the hoover sends me reaching for the switch!

If this still happens, please send me your config file.  I guess
it is a misconfiguration and has nothing to do with the monochrome
screen.

I have added a lot of sanity checks to the stacking order code.
Please try the latest snapshot and see if you get any output (it
will beep every time it writes something to the console) prior to
the core dump.  It would also be a tremendous help if you found a
reliable recipe to reproduce this.

IE5 provides an icon that is neither of depth 1 nor is it the same
depth as your rott window.  Fvwm does not allow this and it's not
part of any standard.  So Microsoft will call it a feature :-) I'd
call it a bug in IE.

We have crashes fairly regularly here (one every 2-3 days on each workstation) that came from the stack ring problem that was fixed, among others.  I'm attempting to convince people here in the office that FVWM is better than OLWM (yes, OLWM...:) and with those crashes not happening it would be much easier.

Sure, I'll build it in a few minutes.  But I do not think the bug
you experienced is fixed.  It is probably only hidden by some
other change an may as well show up again.  If it does, please
report back.

Consider it done.  But the 2.2.23 release will we a short lived

This has finally been fixed - now that I have a dual head setup :-)

If fvwm had crashed, you would not be able to open a menu.  It
must be something else.  Let 'top' run in a window while you work
and look at it when this problem appears.  There you should see
if any application or even the X server is causing this.  The
guilty application will probably appear on top of the list.

XFree 4 seems to be rather unstable.  I'm experiencing random
crashes and loackups when running dual head, but I can not imagine
how this could be fvwm's fault.  Let's wait for the next few XFree
releases and see if things settle down.

I feel with you.  I can well remember the pains it cause me to
initially create the test file.  And this is not even a
functional test :-/

You can do it like this (with 2.3.x):

------------------ .fvwm2rc -----------------
# common stuff
...

Read .fvwm2rc.$[screen]

# more common stuff
...
---------------------------------------------

----------------- .fvwm2rc.0 ----------------
# commands specific to screen 0
...
---------------------------------------------

----------------- .fvwm2rc.1 ----------------
# commands specific to screen 1
...
---------------------------------------------

This was fixed in some 2.3.x beta release.  Either you are still                
using an older version of the pager (perhaps the old modules are                
still in the search path?).  Or you set an explicit geometry in                 
your pager configuration.  DesktoScale does not work if you also                
specify a geometry like this:                                                   
                                                                                
  *FvwmPagerGeometry 100x75

Log message:
Reap children asynchronously and automatically. Effectively, just
installed ReapChildren as the SIGCHLD handler since this function was
already reentrant. Also some extra twiddly bits to ensure that the
SIGCHLD handler isn't interrupted.

Also one spelling fix in gnome.c: BTW lines 757 and 760 can NEVER be
true because val[0] and val[1] are unsigned.

I've recently discovered a bug in I believe iconify
code.
If style * IconFont is not set to some valid font or
set at all in a .fvwm2rc fvwm2 will seg fault on an
iconify function.

This is the latest cvs code and it showed up about 3
days ago

Dear FVWM experts,

since today's CVS, I observe a problem on OSF that I think can be related
to the changes in the SIGCHLD handling.

I'm using gzipped .xpm files for title-bars and mini-icons, and xpm-3.4k.

Since today update, I get:

[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> couldn't load pixmap Active.xpm
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> couldn't load pixmap Inactive.xpm
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> couldn't load pixmap Inactive.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-ball.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-ball.xpm

and so on. The number of warnings changes from restart to restart (using
kill -USR1 from another machine), so I suspect that maybe fvwm2 is not
waiting for the gunzip pipe to finish ... well ... I'm just guessing ...
I've seen the 'gunzip' processes from the Xpm library starting.

If I uncompress all the pixmaps, the errors and warnings disappear, but
then I start seeing several defunct processes, and their number costantly
increase restart after restart ...

If I compress again all the pixmaps, the errors and warnings appear again,
but the defunct processes disappear !!

Any idea ?

Thanks *really* a lot !

cheers,
Giuseppe.

I set FvwmWharf geometry in my ~/.fvwm2rc:

 *FvwmWharfGeometry -0+0

But Wharf appears strange place "+180+0".

When I use stable version of FVWM(2.2.4), Wharf was placed correctly.

Display modes: "1280x1024"

That's really odd, because the OS doesn't send SIGCHLD until the child
process has died. Is fvwm the parent process for all of the defunct
processes? Does OSF support sigaction?

Hi,
I've experimented with my Linux-i586 platform and I think your Zombie
problem must be specific to OSF. Can you examine your config.h file
and tell me whether HAVE_SIGACTION and HAVE_SIGINTERRUPT are defined,
please? I'd like to see what kind of signal handling is available for
OSF.

On the off-chance that OSF has sigaction, can you try adding this line
to fvwm/fvwm.c:

Hello,

I am not sure that this is bad?
With the new code window 1 and window 2 are equal, as with the
old code one window is more equal than the other ...
The idea is that if we want 3 windows in the same page we want
to see all 3 windows, if this is not possible the algo try to do
so that a new window cover the old one's in a minimal way (using
percentage, because small windows may be important as well as big
one). With the old code in the previous situation you may win if 
the new window cover window 1 and you want to work with window 2, 
but you lost if you want to work with window 1. Again I think that 
"all normal windows are equal (even small one vs big one)" is a 
good principal.

Anyway, "clever placement" is a difficult task and when I change the
code I try to forbid some really bad situation, as complete covering 
of an old window by a new one. Moreover, I try to do minimal changes
since we was in "feature freeze". I suggest to try a fine study
of "clever placement" after 2.4, but I am ready to test some codes.

Hello,

It seems that something is not "updated" now when we change of
desks:
start an xterm in desk 0 go to desk 1, come back to desk 0. Then, the
interior of the xterm is no more here ....

I have a similar problem now (i.e. for a day maximum).  Sometimes,
(about 50%) when I restart fvwm by clicking on a button in my
FvwmButtons, the new window manager does not come up properly.  At
first I only see the default window decoration and it takes some
seconds before windows get decorated with the colour sets I use.
I guess FvwmTheme is slow to start up.  Other modules like
FvwmButtons do not start at all.  In the console output this line
appears when fvwm is restarted:

  [FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<ERROR>> Some command line modules have
  not quit, Starting up after timeout.

This all looks awfully like a nasty side effect of the SIGCHLD
patch.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Ah!  You gave me the right idea, although it's dynamic, not
static ;-)  The cable of the mouse came too close to the screen.
Works much better now, although not perfect.

Neither am I.  But in effect I have to move windows that were in
the place where I wanted them before.

In this case, my preference would have been to get the new window
at the left edge.  This might be different if the windows were
browser windows.  But I think a window being placed in the center
of the screen will bother you much more often than one placed in
an edge - even at the cost of covering up more of a particular
window.

You're right, it's not easy at all.  Whatever you do, you can find
a situation where it works worse than before.  For example: the
new algorithm does not 'like' covering free space on the screen if
it has to touch an icon:


  +-------------+ <- viewport
  |+-----------+| 
  ||           || +-----+
  ||  window   || | new | <- new window to place
  ||           || |     |
  ||           || +-----+
  |+-----------+|
  |       ()    | () = icon
  +-------------+

The window could be placed in the bottm left corner with minimal
interference with other windows/icons.  But if it overlaps a
single column of pixels of the icon, it will be placed like this:

  +-------------+
  |+-----------+| 
  ||           ||
  |+-----+ old ||
  || new |     ||
  ||     |     ||
  |+-----+-----+|
  |       ()    |
  +-------------+

Not very nice.

I am all for rewriting the CleverPlacement code and introducing
a host of user configurable tuning parameters (e.g. the exact
values of all these penalties).  This way the user can adapt the
algorithm to his/her liking.

But if we are sure we will put a lot of work in this code after
2.4, we may be better off reverting to the old code for now so
that people do not complain about the changed algorithm with 2.4
and then again for the next release.  What do you think?

Both are defined:

done, but I see no changes. Still a lot of defunct processes (their parent
process is fvwm2) if the pixmaps are not compressed, and "Couldn't find
pixmap" messages if they are.

I'll send you the man page of sigaction on OSF. Please let me know if I
can help you somehow.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Dear FVWM experts,

I'm using Style "*" ClickToFocus , and I'm having these problems on
Linux RH7.0, XFree3.3.6.

If, just after a Restart, I move the pointer inside an xterm and click on
it, the window is raised and it receives the focus. Good. But then if I
move the pointer outside the window, it loses the focus.
This happens just once after every restart.

If, instead of clicking inside the window, I click on the title bar, the
window receive focus when the mouse is pressed, but it loses it
immediately when I stop pressing. Also this happens only once per restart.

Another strange thing is this one: I think I remember that when moving
from one desktop to another all windows where unfocussed, and I had to
click on the one I wanted. Now, one of them has focus, always the same
on each desktop between switchings if I don't 'touch' them. It looks like
it's never the xterm on the top, but one of the most 'hidden' ones ... so
that if I click the one on the top, go to another desktop and back, I'm
sure the focussed one is not this one !

Please let me know if my descriptions are too obscure and/or if you need
more informations.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi,
Do you have any way of confirming what all of these zombie processes
were? Were they *all* gzip processes spawned by Xpm? Do any FVWM
modules become xombies? What about shell commands executed by FVWM? I
am trying to find a "difference" here that will give me a clue what's
going on, since I don't have an OSF platform. Does Xpm do anything
crazy with signals and handler which is interfering with FVWM?

The trouble here is that the SIGCHLD changes don't affect anything
until the child process has completely finished. Do you know what the
default SIGCHLD handler does under OSF, because that looks like the
only unknown in this problem. However, every handler is installed with
the SA_RESTART flag and so it's not as if we should be suffering from
interrupted system calls. Does OSF provide an equivalent of the /proc
filesystem so that you can examine the state of FVWM while it is
running?

Cheers,
Chris

I've dug out the source code for Xpm and it looks like it uses popen()
and pclose() to run gunzip on compressed pixmaps. Do the OSF man-pages
for popen and pclose mention any dependencies on SIGCHLD handling?
The glibc pages just mention that pclose() sets errno to ECHILD if the
pipe-process has already been waited for, which is fine except that
your pipe-processes aren't being waited for at all! Frankly, I find
this bizarre because the waitpid(-1, ...) call is a big vacuum
cleaner for zombies, which means that under OSF, FVWM can be neither
performing a pclose() nor receiving a SIGCHLD signal!

Can you perform an strace on fvwm2 to see what the pclose is doing
under the covers?

Cheers,
Chris

Hi,

The zombies are not the gzip processes: when there're pixmaps to gunzip
(sometimes failing with the [FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find
pixmap ... messages) there are no defunct processes: they appear if I
gunzip the pixmaps before restarting fvwm2, and they come from the modules
and an xload process that I'm swallowing in FvwmButtons. This is 'ps x'
after a restart with pixmaps to gunzip:

If I use 'kill -USR1', more and more defunct processes appear. The
(for me) strange thing is that if I gzip again the pixmaps, and 'kill
-USR1', all the defunct processes disappear (but I get only some of the
pixmaps) !

Doesn't seems so ... the code is this:

            sprintf(buf, "gunzip -qc \"%s\"", filename);
            if (!(mdata->stream.file = popen(buf, "r")))
                return (XpmOpenFailed);

and is not failing for all the compressed pixmaps, but only for some of
them.

I'm not an expert ... sorry ... so I've done the stupid test of commenting
out the line 'sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sigact, NULL);' in fvwm/fvwm.c.

The effect is that I don't have the error messages on missing pixmaps, and
I have the defunct processes. Their number this time increases
independently from the use of compressed pixmaps or plain one.

But you probably would have already guessed this ...

Yes, there's a /proc/XXX with XXX the PID of the processes, but it's
binary and I don't know how to read it.

Before having this problem with the pixmaps, I was always using them
gzipped, so I can't say if the defunct processes were there before or not.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

BTW:
I've started having the following message, too (on OSF only, not on
Linux):

[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<ERROR>> Failed to wait on descriptor: Interrupted
system call

(this started after your commit on My_XNextEvent: I've not seen it
before, but I can't be sure because the setup is not the same: before I
was using my fvwm2 session on OSF at work from home, but after many
restarts it crashed, so now I'm running it inside VNC, which is
much slower).

nothing ...

       If  the  pclose()  function fails, errno may be set to the
       following value:

       [ECHILD]  The status of the child  process  could  not  be
                 obtained.

There's no 'strace' on OSF .... AFAIK ...

My own tests:

I've done the following: I've build a fake 'gunzip' as:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/gunzip "$@"
sleep 1

and ... it works !! No more 'Couldn't find pixmap' messages, only
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<ERROR>> Failed to wait on descriptor: Interrupted
system call

Still, if the pixmaps are not compressed, I get the defunct processes.

My naive idea at this point is that there's nothing wrong with Xpm: if the
loading of the pixmaps is fast (not requiring gunzip) I have defunct
processes, if it's slow (spawning sh -c gunzip and so on) then somehow the
SIGCHLD code intercepts them and they don't exit correctly, but this
'delay' allows the code to work fine for the Fvwm modules.

I've no idea if this is correct, of course ...

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

I put this message in as a response to an issue that Dominik raised. I
have just made another commit that should fix this message by
restarting the interrupted system call ("select", in this case).

Yes, when I rewrite the code I change some penalies, but after some
complaint I put these penalities back.

I am not against that you rewrite now the clever placement code. In
my opinion the old code is not good: small window that are often
important was systematically cover by new one's if a "problem" occur
during the placement. For me the old code was not usable.
I am ready to test your new code. Maybe a simple solution is to
add one argument to cleverplacement which allows to have either
the old code or the new one. Anyway if you have time to do better,
I vote yes.

Hi !

I have the following problem: on my system there's an old version of the
Xpm library (3.4a), installed in /usr/local/lib (libXpm.a *AND*
libXpm.so) and in /usr/local/include/X11/xpm.h.

I've downloded and installed in a private directory the latest version of
Xpm, and run 'configure' as:

./configure --prefix=${HOME} \
            --with-xpm-library=/usr/users/dellaric/lib \
            --with-xpm-includes=/usr/users/dellaric/include

This gives a mismatch between the Xpm include file and the library if in
/usr/users/dellaric/lib I just put libXpm.a. To solve this problem, I'm
forced to put in /usr/users/dellaric/lib the shared library libXpm.so, and
add /usr/users/dellaric/lib to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The relevant lines of config.log are:

configure:2353: checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm
configure:2372: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c -lXpm
-L/usr/users/dellaric/lib -lXpm   -lSM -lICE -lX11  -ldnet_stub  1>&5
configure:2416: checking for X11/xpm.h
configure:2426: gcc -E  -I/usr/users/dellaric/include  conftest.c
>/dev/null 2>conftest.out
configure:2474: checking for Xpm 3.4g or better
configure:2491: gcc -o conftest -g -O2  -I/usr/users/dellaric/include
conftest.c   -L/usr/users/dellaric/lib -lXpm  -lSM -lICE -lX11  -ldnet_stub 1>&5

This is because, as the ld man page says:

       When linking a shared  object,  ld  searches  all  library
       directories for the shared object library (libx.so). If it
       cannot find the shared object library, it  again  searches
       all  library directories for the archive library (libx.a).

Changing line 2476 of configure from

CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $xpm_CFLAGS $X_CFLAGS"

to

CPPFLAGS="-static $CPPFLAGS $xpm_CFLAGS $X_CFLAGS"

solves the problem for me. I don't know if there's a better solution for
this: it should be portable, at least.

Can something working like this be implemented in the official configure ?

Thanks a lot !

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Um... you are treading on uncharted territory here!!!

No.  It is not portable.  Even if it was portable, you'd be forcing
everybody to build fvwm2 and its modules as statically linked
executables.

Since I noticed in your previous messages that you are using "OSF1"
(aka Tru64 Unix), there is an additional problem:

The -static option on Tru64 Unix doesn't even do what you think it is
doing!

Read your cc(1) and ld(1) man pages.  On Tru64 Unix, there is no
-static option documented.

If you wish to build a statically linked executable on Tru64 Unix, you
should pass the "-non_shared" option to the linker.

If you use -static, you will be sorry.  That UNDOCUMENTTED option is
only supposed to be used for kernel compiles.  Using it changes the
address map of the generated image and enough "minor" changes that
will give you subtle problems further on down the road.

Since there are very few "standard" linker options that are portable
among the various flavors of operating systems upon which fvwm2 will
be running, you should instead use the functionality within the
configure script to pass desired options to the C compiler (CFLAGS) or
the linker (LDFLAGS).

For your situation, the following might work:

	LDFLAGS="-non_shared" ./configure

Another thing you may want to consider is to upgrade the libXpm.a or
libXpm.so image on your system.

Hi !

I should have said that I'm using gcc, where '-static' should be ok:

`-static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking
     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
     effect.

(maybe gcc converts it to -non_shared internally ?)

On the other hand, I don't want link statically *all* the libraries, but
just a way to tell ld to use my archive library instead of the default
shared one in this particular case ...

Meanwhile, I've realized that this is just a (wrong) way to fool the
'configure' step, since later on during the 'gmake' the official (old) Xpm
from /usr/local/lib is still used ... uff ...

(This is not related with my other problems with pixmaps, since both
version rely on the same method to open compressed files).

Unfortunately, we cannot update the official Xpm library for various
reasons.

*BUT* you gave me a good idea:

env LIBS="-L/usr/users/dellaric/lib -Wl,-no_so -lXpm -Wl,-so_archive" \
./configure --prefix=${HOME} \
            --with-xpm-library=/usr/users/dellaric/lib \
            --with-xpm-includes=/usr/users/dellaric/include

that *works*, is not portable, but doesn't require to edit 'configure'
each time it is changed !!

Thanks a lot !!!

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi,

your latest commit, ie:

        * fvwm/fvwm.c (InstallSignals)
        Invoke the SIGCHLD handler manually after installing all the signal
        handlers. This should mean that any Zombies created while the default
        SIGCHLD handler was in place (for instance, after a restart) will be
        reaped.

solved my problem on OSF1-True64 Unix when using *plain* pixmaps: there're
no more defunct processes around after a restart.

Thanks !!

I still have problems when the pixmaps are compressed: I've found that
creating a 'gunzip' wrapper as:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/gunzip "$@"
sleep 1

(somewhere in my $PATH before /usr/bin) works, but I don't understand why.

I've also tried changing bash to sh ... still works ... but it breaks if I
remove the sleep.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

There are some commands (for example maximize, the autoplacement of
window)
which currently use all available screenspace and would benefit of beeing
restricted so that they'll not place the window over the icon box or a
set of buttons.

I'd suggest a new style (or a new global configuration, but a new style
would be more usefull) which would allow to give a rectangle
	- the initial placement would be restricted inside this rectangle
 	- maximize will toggle between this rectangle and the current size

Obviously, interactive moving and resizing should not be restricted by it.

As far as I know, currently this is possible only for maximize and in a
restricted manner (one corner of the rectangle is always 0,0).

I've experience crashes when iconizing.  Adding a IconFont style solved
the problem, but I do not think that a configuration mistake should crash
fvwm (especially that the configuration worked with 2.2.x)

Argh! Not *another* new placement option

Well, that's exactly the problem.  I have recently quit my current
job and taking off the rest of my overtime till the end of the
year.  And I am determined to get 2.4 out the door until then.
There will not be any time left for this kind of things.  After
this, the placement style options are a good candidate for a
rewrite of the syntax along with the algorithms.

But the question is: what shall we do *now*?

 - Disable the new algorithm for now?
 - Somehow ambed it in the CleverPlacement syntax?  This will
   entail a change in the style structure.
 - Make it a compile time option?
 - ...

At least, the old algorithm should be the default so that we won't
get lots of complaints about the new one (not because it's bad but
because it's different).

  I can't reproduce it reliably... I've tried just opening tons of windows 
etc. but nothing really reproduces it.  It just happens at some point (once 
every 3-4 days or so) when you open a window.  I think to me its happened 
once at another time (with .22, which seems more stable than .21), but I'm 
not sure.  Best I can do is run the snapshot and hope the debug code catches 
it, or look though the two core files from .21 that I have here.  If that 
helps, let me know what to look for...
 Which snapshot do you mean?  I'll install .23 tonight... or do you want 
something newer than that even?
  BTW, is there a way to install a new version 'transparently' i.e. without 
asking all users to log out when replacing the binary?  If they don't log 
out or restart immediately the WM crashes because the binary has changed...

Thanks,
Nils.

Hello,
    I was tweeking my fvwm2rc and noticed something. When I use this:
'AddTitleStyle ActiveUp Pixmap left.xpm'.  Transparency works great,
however if I try to tile it: 'AddTitleStyle ActiveUp TiledPixmap left.xpm'
I get a black color where it should be transparent.

Is this a bug or a feature? :-)

Sincerely,
Shawn Anderson (using 2.3.24 cvs)

Phew! What a relief! :-)

Well, the gunzip process here is a child of bash, and bash is the
child of FVWM... The problem with compressed pixmaps is that FVWM
doesn't load them or find them, correct? I'll need to think about this
on the way to work.

And Dominik answer

Ok, what I think I can propose to ParaSoft:

1. We add a Acknowledgements page to our site (Jason is agree
with this if I well understand) where we can found a banner
for ParaSoft/insure++ with a small text like "We thanks ParaSoft
for its donation of an insure++ licence for ... months. This help
the fvwm-workers to finalize version 2.4"
I need someone for writing this small text ... Also the 
Acknowledgements page may contains the head of the developers.html
and a link to the AUTHORS file.

2. We send a mail to the 3 FVWM mailing lists, with subject
ParaSoft/insure++ and with the small text above.

3. Version 2.4.x will have a file ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS with the small
text.

4. The ChangeLog file will mention insure++ when it is used to fix
a bug. So the insure++ will appear often in the fvwm-workers mailing
list.

5. ParaSoft can mention its donation to the FVWM developers.

Maybe all these is too much? Against this we can ask a 6 months
licences for Dominik. And be agree for 3 months (or maybe we can
ask a 12 months license and be ok with a 6 months one).

The nature of the license we ask is a personal license for
Dominik Vogt <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>. It will use insure++
for a personal use and only for debugging FVWM.

Olivier

Yes, I think this is great.  I'd only have a problem with including their
advertising materials on our site.  We can thank them and link to them all
we want.

Looking thru some old mails, I find I first ran into this problem
last June:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0006/msg00303.html

I think there is some possibility that the Purify problems I reported
and this "stack ring" problem are one and the same.

The Purify output showed fvwm trying to free FvwmWindow structures already
freed, then writing into them.  Depending on where it starts writing,
I think its possible that it could lead to this symptom.  If I understand
it, both problems involve FvwmWindow structures.

>  Which snapshot do you mean?  I'll install .23 tonight... or do you want

Snapshots are prepared every night.  You find them by going to the download
page and picking "latest snapshot".  (The latest snapshot is

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-20001126.tar.gz

which contains the next release number 2.3.24.

We use the Xpm library to load them, but we do a little work trying to
find them on the "ImagePath".

In Picture.c when we look for an Xpm, we do:

    return searchPath( pathlist, icon, ".gz", type );

This tells "searchPath" to first look for the named file (icon)
and if that doesn't work, look for the file with .gz at the end.

We have to do the search this way because the xpm library doesn't
have the concept of an imagepath.

The rest of this is handled by the Xpm library.

Dan, can you please make another Purify session when 2.3.24 is
released and provide a log file with this problem again?

This was because the tiled pixmap was simply set as the window
background.  Of course this can't be done with this decor stacking
code anyway.  I have fixed this.

Since we rarely write anything on the announcement list, try to
avoid this one if possible.

Ah, but not for *every single* bug, right?  Of course I can add
something in each debug session.  But for *every* bug would be
impractical.  If possible, please avoid this completely.

I wouldn't object to a license with a longer duration either,
if this is possible (permanently? *just dreaming*).  Insure++
would be even more helpful if we could use it during the
development phase.  We could have saved a lot of time if we had it
when the buggy code was originally written.

Of course.

Oh, and many thanks for your engagement.  I really hate to
negotiate myself.

I think we must send an annoucement to the annouce list. It is
our more strong argument, since the link to ParaSoft is not in the
page. The ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS file in the distribution is not really
needed.

I am pessimistic for a permanent license. However, I will not do

Hi Dominik,

your latest commits solved both my problems with ClickToFocus windows,
both after a Restart and after switching between desktops.

Thanks !

What I've noticed now is that if I click on the title bar of an
xterm and immediately move the poiter to start moving the window, it takes
some time (about 1 sec) before the xor-frame is drawn.

I have 'ClickTime 150'.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

I suggest to use the old algo + adding a PLACEMENT_AVOID_COVER
coeficient in addition of the others:
iconic which is set to 10 
sticky which set to 1
ontop which is set to 5
Moreover the algorithm will try other positions in adition of 
the border of the windows: a grid of 20x20.

This seems to lead to an algo which solves your "problems", which
is close to the old one and which is usable with small windows
in the screen.

So I try to do an algo which is not far from the old one,
but which is better.
The code is not pretty, but after a decision it will be.

I can partially configrm this using opaque move and a tiled pixmap
in the title. Otherwise it does not happen for me. I did not yet
have time to look into this, though. Can you please provide the
relevant configuration bits?

Hi,
Would I be correct in assuming that every <<WARNING>> message is
preceded by an <<ERROR>> message? I.e. FVWM can't find the pixmap
because it hasn't loaded it? It seems natural, but I thought I'd
better check. And is it always the same pixmaps that cause problems,
or do they change from restart to restart?

Cheers,
Chris

I didn't have any success.  First I got a core dump in XTextWidth called
from line 125 in icons.c.  tmp_win->icon_font.font was zero, so I changed
line  122:

  if ((!HAS_NO_ICON_TITLE(tmp_win)) && (tmp_win->icon_font.font != 0))

Then fvwm hung during starup trying to place a rubberband frame.
The mouse pointer changed to the 4 way arrow, but I can't drop
the frame and continue.  The stack looks like this:

Submission from: (NULL) (158.140.3.201)


When I desiconify an icon by clicking on it, the newly mapped window
has the focus and is hilighted, when I desiconify it using a keypress,
the newly mapped window has also the focus but is not hilighted.  Moving
the pointer inside it does not hilight the window;  I've to move the
pointer so that the focus is given to another window and the back to the
first one to give it an hilighted frame.

Something which may be relevant, I use the SloppyFocus mode.

What I meant was, if you see an "<<ERROR>> couldn't load pixmap
Foo.xpm" message, do you later see a "<<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap
foo.xpm" message? Similarly, is every <<WARNING>> message preceded by
an <<ERROR>> message for the same pixmap?

Was this before or after the batch of grabbing patches I made?

How do you try to drop the window, with the keyboard or with
the mouse?

Does the window follow the pointer?

Please add this line to move_resize.c around line 1261:

     * operation */
    if (Event.type == KeyPress)
      Keyboard_shortcuts(&Event, tmp_win, ButtonRelease);
+   if (Event.type != MotionNotify) fprintf(stderr,"got event type 0x%x\n", (int)Event.type);
    switch(Event.type)
    {
    case KeyPress:

Does it print out any event during placement?

Bye

After.

Both.  Fvwm was completely frozen, I had to log in from a remote and
kill it.

> Does the window follow the pointer?

Nothing would move except the mouse pointer.

I should  have  mentioned  that  fvwm  was  trying to  do  interactive
placement for  some overlapping, off screen  windows.  It shouldn't be
doing interactive  placement at  all  during startup, the windows  are
already placed.

> Please add this line to move_resize.c around line 1261:

That will have to wait until I get to work in a few hours.

Hi Dominik,

sorry for the late answer: I'm not in the mailing list, and I follow the
Web archive.

For me the 'problem' is still there: I can't say if it is reduced or not
(it's difficult to 'time' this sort of things). The xterms I'm moving
in this test are above the 'OpaqueMoveSize' (ie they're drawn as frames).

Hi !

I'm using FvwmForm to restart fvwm2 (very often, these days ...) from a
menu. My FvwmForm config is appended below.

The problem is that, from time to time, the FvwmForm-Restart windown is
not drawn at all: the pointer is 'warped' at the center of the screen but
the window is not there ... I've checked with 'ps x' that a FvwmForm
process *is* indeed there. Sometimes, I can see from the Pager that a
FvwmForm-Restart window has appeared on a different desktop, but even if I
move there, I can't find it. Selecting again the restart from a menu
usually works.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi,

My research into the OSF signal problem has unearthed a rather
worrying thought. This text is from the OSF man-page which Giuseppe
sent me:

SA_RESTART
Setting this bit enables a function that has been interrupted by the
execution of this signal's handler to be restarted transparently by
the system. The affected functions include wait(), and the read() and
write() functions on a slow device (such as a terminal, but not a
regular file).

Does this mean that even if we set SA_RESTART for all the signals on
OSF, then any signal can interrupt read()s and write() from XPM files,
or from popen() calls to gunzip compressed XPM files? This could be a
nasty race condition, what with gunzip processes dying and sending
SIGCHLD signals!

Further study of the man-page indicates a SIG_NOCLDWAIT flag that
dispels all Zombies without the need to wait for them, although this
isn't universally supported by other OSs. Linux, e.g. defines the flag
but documents it as not working. Paul (PDS), is there an autoconf way
of checking whether this is available? It looks as if it might solve
the OSF problem.

Cheers,
Chris

Hi Chris,

I've just recompiled using the latest CVS (where you disabled SIGCHLD
around Xpm).

And ... it *WORKS* !!! Great !!

Thanks a lot !

Actually, scrub that. I think that SIG_NOCLDWAIT would break pclose(),
and hence break Xpm!

So ASSUMING that SA_RESTART does not restart read() calls from pipes
on OSF, is there a preprocessor macro for spotting OSF? Actually, I
find the thought of OSF behaving like this to be very worrying! So
worrying, in fact, that I'm thinking that I must be misinterpreting the
man page.

Oh dear, not great! This seems to imply that some system calls on OSF
(I'm guessing at least "read" when applied to a pipe descriptor) are
not being restarted on receipt of a signal - SIGCHLD in this case.

Yuk.

If you wish to use a non-autoconf method, you can use the fact that
the following macros are predefined on Tru64 Unix (aka OSF1) when the
C preprocessor is invoked as "cc -E":

_SYSTYPE_BSD
__DATE__
__FILE__
__LINE__
__TIME__
__alpha
__osf__
__unix__


I would say that "__osf__" is probably a safe thing to use for an
#ifdef around the code.  Unless somebody can think of something
better.

Ok, this morning it doesn't hang anymore.

It is now moving icons that it has never moved before.
I have a few icons I position outside the iconbox using X resources.
Now when I quit and start fvwm it moves all my icons into the iconbox.

I'll see if I can get a Purify run...

I spoke too soon.

I attempted to run the test script without Purify, after it exited, and
I tried to restart, it hung up like before.

Looks like "__osf__" is safe for gcc, too:

gcc -dumpspecs gives:

....

*predefines:
-Dunix -D__osf__ -D_LONGLONG -DSYSTYPE_BSD -D_SYSTYPE_BSD -Asystem(unix)
-Asystem(xpg4)

Hi!
I joined sources of 2 modules, hacked em a little and
made another useless module! here is shoer description:

DESCRIPTION
       The  FvwmChannel  module displays the number of the active
       desktop or page in the upper right corner  of  the  screen
       whenever it changes.

If anyone interested in it, I can mail source(s) or upload tarball.

PS: sorry, I'm not reading this list, so insert my e-mail in CC
if interested.

Dear Friend;

In conjunction with the United States Marine Corp and the Toys for Tots
Foundation I am asking for your support in helping a child this
Christmas.  The Toys for Tots Foundation raises funds to purchase toys
for needy children. 

We have selected a few people like yourself to help us spread the word
about the Toys for Tots fundraising program. We would like to give you a
free membership for GaZoom.com.  In return, all we ask is that you make
a "best effort" to refer your friends or family to the Toys for Tots
campaign web site at http://www.helptoysfortots.com 

A GaZoom.com membership normally costs twenty dollars with half the
proceeds going to charity.  Your free membership entitles you to a years
worth of Incredible Deals and the knowledge that you are helping out a
child this Christmas.  To receive your free GaZoom.com membership please
click on url http://www.gazoom.com/toysfortots

Best wishes for a happy holiday season


John F. Marshall

solaris 2.5.1

fvwm.2.22 runs fine

fvwm.2.23 doesnt run my .fvwm2rc. It hangs at the initial screen w/o even a
menu.

An .empty .fvwmrc gives same result as no .fvwmrc.

How can i tell other than massive trial and error of my rc file what 23
doesnt like that 22 does?

Thanx

Looks familiar. However, since the concept of "yesterday" is a bit
vague (what with global time differences etc), can you tell me which
changes you backed out? There was someone else who had been reporting
this problem for several days, but "yesterday" I put a change in that
fixed it for him. In his case, it looked like the gunzip child
processes spawned by XPM to uncompress pixmaps (I'm assuming that all
your pixmaps are compressed too) were interrupting the read() system
call with the SIGCHLD signal when they died, despite having installed
the SIGCHLD handler as SA_RESTART. This lead to a lot of partial
pixmaps being read in, and libXpm was rejecting them.

The important change was adding "sigprocmask" calls around the
XpmReadFileToXpmImage() function in LoadPicture() (libs/Picture.c)

problem persists.

turns out that

WindowShade False
       or
WindowShade "False"

in .fvwm2rc will hang it up.
