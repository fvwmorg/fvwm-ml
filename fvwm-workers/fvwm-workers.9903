Do we really want themes to be able to change behavior?  I thought one
of the fundamental ideas behind themes was to separate look from feel,
and only be able to change the look (via changing themes).  

The number of titlebar buttons and their bindings are definitely
"feel".  

Without the rollover ballon-type help that Enlightenment provides for
titlebar widgets, changing their behavior could be a sudden unwelcome
surprise for the user (for instance, my "close" button is on the left of
the titlebar instead of "iconify"...)

The pixmaps used to display them are "look" and therefore would be
themable.   We might want to make standard decors for "CloseButton",
"IconifyButton", "MaximizeButton", etc.  These can be changed via
themes, and the corresponding buttons (with those decors) change
automatically.

yes, here is a function that I used in my config file to clear out all the
buttons in the title bars. Not a super clean way of doing it, but it
works.

##########################################################################
# Function:     Disable ALL buttons 
#               (This needs to be called when resetting between different
#               Decors to keep from getting buttons all mixed up)
#========================================================================#

DestroyFunc     "RemoveAllButtons"
AddToFunc       "RemoveAllButtons"
+ "I"   Style "*"       NoButton 0, NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 3, \
                        NoButton 4, NoButton 5, NoButton 6, NoButton 7, \
                        NoButton 8, NoButton 9


Use this with a function like:
DestroyFunc	Decor_Mwm
AddToFunc	Decor_Mwm
+ "I"  RemoveAllButtons
+ "I"  Style "*"	UseDecor Mwm, ForeColor Black
+ "I"  Style "*"	Button 1, Button 2, Button 4
+ "I"  MenuStyle	Black grey75 grey40 -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-120-* mwm
+ "I"  Mouse 0 1 N	Menu Window-Ops Close
+ "I"  Mouse 0 2 N	Maximize
+ "I"  Mouse 0 4 N	Iconify
+ "I"  Mouse 3 4 N	Replace
+ "I"  Recapture

This is stuff that builds up a basic system of doing themes that I started
this summer.  But with the class load I have this year, I just haven't had
time to work on it. (that and I don't have a machine that runs fvwm anymore
either....) hmm, I suppose that if you want, I can send you what I've done.
Its nothing real impressive, just a small foundation. (but it mostly worked
:)

Ouch!  Good catch, Steve.

We should add info about the right way to do this (override on the make
command line) to INSTALL.fvwm.  Is this a big enough problem to consider
a configure command-line option, or is overriding on the make
command-line sufficient?

Since everybody tries to convince me, I'll change the default values 
to 4 and 6 (you can still override this with DefaultLayers).

I'm not so sure about adding StaysOnBottom as a shortcut Style option.
If we do so, we will have to think about extending the WindowList
options and command conditions in analogous ways (for completeness 
and symmetry). I thought that that was exactly the reason for the
existance of the preprocessor modules: you can easily do
define(`StaysOnBottom',`Layer 2') and feed your rc through FvwmM4
without putting everybodies favourite shortcuts into fvwm proper.

There seem to be three different filename extensions for bitmaps in
the icons/ directory: .bitmap, .icon and .xbm.  Anyone know why or
what the difference is?

fvwm (not fvwm2) remains installed in our  environment, as there are a
group of users that are  just not going   to move.  Changing the  name
from fvwm2 to fvwm is just going to cause problems.

I'll fix the man page once the dust settles, unless I'm out voted.

	This is an interesting question.  Most WM's that support themes
don't allow changing of buttons (look at WindowMaker or even the new Mac
themes)... the existing themes at fvwm.themes.org do allow modification of
the buttons... but probably because they were not built with 'instant
switching' in mind.  I think we should keep the ability to do it, but make
it a *FvwmTheme config option (that defaults to not allowing it).

	Absolutely true... Ask me how many times I've switched to another
theme and nuked the window I was working in when trying to iconify it..
heh. =)

	I like this idea.  This is getting away from keeping the
Fvwm-style configuration options... but I think I can find a way to work
it in while still keeping the config style.  I think this is the route I
will pursue...  

	However, I still think there should be a way to remove a button
from the titlebar once it is no-longer bound.  I realize (now) that you
can do the "style * nobutton 1" thing, but then you have to re-specify
each button you are going to use to get them back.  To make this work
properly the FvwmTheme module requires quite a bit more logic (and access
to some things it currently can't get, like which buttons are active when
it starts).

	How difficult would it be to have the display-button-or-not logic
triggered during a recapture... or is that even the right place for it?

Thanks,

Jay

Okey doke, now we know it should be possible I'll have a go at something
simple to start with, I thought I'd start with drawGC, the context for
rubberband lines, and hack FvwmAnimate to default to using the same as
fvwm.  It should be possible to get XOR pixmaps into FvwmAnimate without
it having to read xpm files.

If that goes well I'll have a go at the GC's used by DefaultColors.

Cheers,
Tim.

You can't login to the bug database unless you're a maintainer.
Jitterbug is a minimalist system, to be sure :).  You're not allowed to
create your own accounts or anything.

Anyway, this is one way to go (create a new bug) but another would be to
just send the new information to the fvwm-workers list, referencing the
original bug number, and someone here'll add the note to the bug.

Thanks for continuing to look into this!

IMO, everything should be "fvwm" except when referring to the actual
executable name (and the ~/.fvwm2rc file of course).

The name of the package is "FVWM".  To allow simple installation for
those places which want to keep both fvwm 1.xx and fvwm 2.xx, the
installed binary is named fvwm2 and it reads the config file .fvwm2rc.

That looks right to me.

  jg> - Is the program called fvwm or fvwm2?

As above, the actual program is called "fvwm2" (for now?)

  jg> - What are the filenames and directory paths used?  Do they have fvwm2
  jg>   or fvwm components?

All directory components should use fvwm.  All filenames except for the
window manager program itself and its rc file should use "fvwm"; the
former two use "fvwm2".

  jg> - The documentation for Restart appears to say that fvwm will restart

I'd have to look at this, but note you can put any program after the
Restart command.  Typically you'd want this program to be a window
manager :), but it doesn't have to be fvwm.

You can put "mwm", then it'll restart mwm.  You can put "twm", ditto.
And you can put "fvwm" or "fvwm2", and it should start those,
respectively.

I'd like a StaysOnBottom command to make it simpler for the user, not
harder...  I want to give them access to "full functionality" with the
most basic of .rc files.  

Not everyone has time to be a "windowmanager rocket scientist".

I think something to this affect should be included in the DEVELOPERS file
in the /docs directory (to serve/guide new hackers/coders)

 FVWM Objectives
 ---------------

 1. Designed to minimize memory consumption (SMALL footprint)
 2. Designed to provide the ability to use accessory programs (modules)
 3. Designed to provide a 3-D look to window frames
 4. Designed to provide a simple virtual desktop
 5. Designed to be extremely customizable
 6. BLAH BLAH BLAH

With all the recent additions (layers/gnome-support/etc) my concern is for
FVWM not to grow and become blotted (controlled growth is OK, as long as
the objectives above are adhered to as much as possible)

Don't get me wrong, I dig the new additions (and I agree with most that they
are sorely needed if FVWM is to keep up with other wm).  I just wanted to
remind people to keep the general objectives in mind and to make sure that the
new hackers know about 'em as well - thus my suggestion of the inclusion,
noted above, to the DEVELOPERS file.

Keep up the GREAT work

No, don't get rid of FvwmWharf.  I prefer this to FvwmButtons.  When I get some
time I would like to update this module with the latest changes from AfterStep's
version.  Once this is done and if it is stable, I would be willing to maintain
it.

Please don't get rid of it though!!

It allows you to "shade" a maximized window (or to maximize
a shaded one) and to resize a shaded one (while keeping it shaded).

What does FvwmWharf do that cannot be done with FvwmButtons?  Does it
use a less complicated syntax?  Can it do something that cannot be
easily done with FvwmButtons?  I'm simply asking this out of ignorance.

If one is a superset of the other, why not have a "SuperButtons" module
that can be made to work like FvwmWharf or FvwmButtons?  I don't think
that allowing the two to diverge even further is good for either of
them.

Of course, that's just my opinion.  I could be wrong...

The DEVELOPERS file already has a hint in that direction:

 5) New features should be discussed on the list to ensure everyone
    thinks they're "appropriate" (one of the goals of fvwm is to be
    relatively efficient, remember, which means we don't necessarily
    want the kitchen sink).

But it may be worth to add something like

 6) Before adding a new feature think twice if it could perhaps
    be implemented as a module (perhaps after some esxtension 
    of the fvwm<->module communication protocol). Moving features
    in modules helps to keep fvwm itself clean and efficient.

I have thought about ways to implement the session management stuff 
in a module. It would perhaps be possible, but only after considerable
extension to the Style command and the fvwm<->module protocol (you must
be able to specify all relevant per-window state in a Style command
and to match windows by client-id and role and fvwm must communicate
its global state to modules). 

The layers stuff doesn't really bloat fvwm in my eyes...it actually
cleans up some ugly places in the code (I only mention KeepOnTop()
and the RAISED flag).

Looking at the files, they are all bitmaps and probably should have had
the .xbm extension.

I think we are long past knowing why any of this stuff is as it is.

Hi,

I can't compile without XPM anymore.  Anyone have a clue?  The message is:

No, it should be FVWM 2.xx (1x) as it is in section 1x of the manual.

The .TH line should read something like:

.TH "FVWM 2.xx" 1x "22 Feb 1999"

Having a date of "late 20th century" doesn't really help people to
know which version the manpages relate to ;-)

OK!  I will not get rid of FvwmWharf.  It would be great if someone would
actively care for it!

Here is a patch for the utils/fvwmrc_convert script.  Several things
are done here; in order:

(1) Whitespace only lines are treated as empty.
(2) Remove trailing "&" sign from Exec commands.
(3) Slightly more verbose ButtonStyle error message.
(4) I thought that the paths were going to use fvwm, not fvwm2.  So
    the paths should not have gsub("/fvwm", "/fvwm2"); in them.
(5) Handling of the case Key ...... Exec "name" ...
(6) Awful typo: searching for /^[ \t]**.../ takes huge amounts of time
    and/or memory.  This MUST be fixed (and it's trivial).
(7) Slightly more verbose warning message.
(8) More consistent error message.
(9) If the internal Pager command is used, the output file now gives
    hints in the output file as to how the FvwmPager module can be
    configured to look similar to the original internal pager.

Hope these help,

   Julian

Hm.  I never thought about this.  I wasn't aware that the PixmapPath was
being searched for button & menu backgrounds.

I retained "IconPath" as the sole path, because I thought the pictures
there were being used only for icons.

I suppose we could retain "PixmapPath" instead.  That has the advantage of
being usage-neutral, but the disadvantage that it sounds like it is ONLY
for pixmaps. 

Alternatively, we could call it "PicturePath", since they are known as
pictures internally.  This is both usage- and format-neutral, but seems
like a bit of a gratuitous change. 


We've had one opinion expressed that PixmapPath should be the command
retained.  I sort of lean to PicturePath from an aesthetic point of view,
but I'm willing to be persuaded that PixmapPath is better from a
backwards-compatibility stance.  Other opinions?

Oh well, I thought I knew what I was doing.  (And it seemed to work so
well.)  Thanks Steve.

Nice work with FvwmForm!

Just a few tiddlers:

FvwmAnimate is still specifying black text on the form and FvwmForm
doesn't handle variable width fonts for labels, It's fine on buttons and
I don't think there's a need for it in the input fields.

Cheers,
Tim.

Can fvwm read graphics formats other than pixmaps? (bitmaps are pixmaps,
technically)

Oops!  I just committed the fix for that.

Proportional fonts are working for me, or are you refering to the fact
that the form width doesn't come out exactly right?

Right now, I'm trying to get the form to react to resizes and extend
the error message area when the form is made larger.  Once that works
I think we can blow away FvwmTalk.

OK, now I'm with you.  I wonder if this relates to the logic in
FvwmForm.c, line 785:

line->size_x += (line->n + 1) * ITEM_HSPC;

which has me totally mystified.

line->n is the width in characters.  ITEM_HSPC is 10.

What I can't figure out is why it seems to work.

This just happens to be the logic I was  trying to understand for form
resizes.

Anyway, I think proportional fonts for text will be working soon...

Not sure what's causing this, hope it's not me removing ->bw, but I get hangs when
some windows get closed, moved.  With -debug the last thing in the log file is:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 8, EventType: 2

Any clues as to what this is?

Better yet "ImagePath". In hope fvwm will soon manage other image formats

I experience a really long delay during startup.
All my windows are bordered, and I can open and close windows.
None of my keybindings or root menus work.
I get "beeps" trying to activate menus with the keyboard or
the mouse.
FvwmAnimate works during this interval.

About 2 minutes later, FvwmBanner does its thing, and keybindings and
root menus start to work.  There is a "Recapture" in my startup
procedure.  I don't see any significant CPU use during this interval.

The same config works fine with 2.2.

If it was a delay of 42 seconds and the windows weren't bordered I'd
guess at the new start up algorithm, but I don't think this is the case
since your windows are captured.  I've been having hangs, maybe they are
the same thing.

In seconds:

00 Hit return
06 Borders appear
49 FvwmBanner does its thing.

Is 43 seconds close enough?

Hello,

When I move a window, the window does not move inside the FvwmPager until I
release
the mouse button bound to the Move action. It would be nice if there were
an option
to FvwmPager that allowed for a configuration where windows would move
within the
pager at the same time as they were moved from the desktop.

When gnuplot plots something it automatically raises the plotting-window if

it is not on top. This raising doesn't get caught by the pager. 
It still shows the plottingwindow below the others.

Just a little one ;)

	Eh? Obviously I've missed something, um, interesting in the last couple

Not yet, but consider Mikhael Goikhman's response.

I like the suggestion of calling it ImagePath.

I think we should be commenting ModulePath out altogether.  It's 100%
certain that this will break, isn't it?  You won't be pointing to the
new modules and I believe the old 1.xx module interface is not
compatible, so any "extra" 1.xx modules you might have (were there any?)
won't work anyway.

If you like, you can print a warning about this for the user.

Just FYI, there are some modules that are not part of fvwm2. 
tkgoodstuff comes to mind.  I don't foresee tkgoodstuff moving itself
into the libexec/fvwm/2.2 directory...

[Runs screaming]

...but in retrospect, it would a nice option if only because the library
will already be loaded on a significant number of target machines.
Unfortunately, initing imlib costs 500K per instance (not per machine) for
the cache if you want it since it doesn't support any kind of unified
cache.

Sure, understood.  But this is an fvwm 1.xx to 2.xx converter script, so
we can assume the input is an fvwm 1.xx script.

AFAIK, there are _no_ extra modules, including tkgoodstuff, that work
with the fvwm 1.xx module interface (are there?).  So, no ModulePath in
fvwm 1.xx should need translation... just removal.

Or am I confused?

I cannot speak for past versions of tkgoodstuff, but version 8.1 (to be
released shortly) requires tcl/tk 8.x and fvwm2.x (and I'll continue to
track the module interface raising the requirements as new features are
added).

I do know that there was a tkFvwm.c that was written prior to
tkgoodstuff that allowed tcl/tk programs to access Fvwm's module
interface.  I'm not sure, but I believe that this was written around
the time before there was an fvwm 2.x.

While working on shading/maximizing, it  occurred to me
that I should try to compile with --disable-windowshade
to check that I ifdef'ed all occurrances of WSHADE and
it turned out that there were some unprotected ones. For
now I have just inserted the necessary ifdef's, but I'd
like to question the utility of #ifdef WINDOWSHADE
sprinkled all over the source - what is the rationale for
this ?  disabling it will not save much memory, but the
ifdefs really make the source harder to read. 

And if someone doesn't like shaded windows, he can simply
ignore WindowShade.

I'd vote for removing all #ifdef WINDOWSHADE and the 
--disable-windowshade configure option.

I think not.  The module protocol did change between version 1 and 2.

We have lots  of those besides WINDOWSHADE.  Probably  as a result  of
using the   the '-D' option to patch,   rather than at the  request of
anyone.

I would guess the only possible advantage to all those ifdefs, is
for someone that decides to turn them ALL off to try to create
a really small fvwm2.  Just turning off WINDOWSHADE probably
wouldn't buy much.

The ifdefs do make a mess.  If the window shade code
isn't too large, I guess I'd vote the same way.

If the question is should we remove all the ifdefs that are along
these lines, (mini-icons, usedecor, etc.),  I'm not sure...

Agree.  I think we need to take these on a case-by-case basis, and
examine critically how much we could save by disabling them, both in
terms of process size and memory or other resources.  We've already had
someone report they don't have a shape-enabled X server (seems
incredible in 1999, but there you go...).

For example, I'd lean towards keeping the ability to disable xpm
support.  But maybe it doesn't make sense to keep pixmap-buttons but
disable mini-icons, for example: maybe mini-icons don't really make much
of a difference.  Or, maybe they do: maybe they add to the size of the
data structures for each menu item and window.  I dunno.

Anyway, whatever.  Re-read my first paragraph :)

Submission from: (NULL) (134.153.1.13)


Hello,

It would be nice to add a style option such as "PopUpOnBottom" or
"FireUpOnBottom".
This option would be similar to the proposed "staysOnBottom" or
"StayOnBottom"
feature except for it would apply only to launching applications for the
first time.
This would be useful for applications such as netscape wich can take
several
seconds to pop up and often end up taking up the whole screen. Often these
applications (eg. netscape) pop up in front of an xterm while you are
typing into
it, disrupting what you are doing. This is frustrating and in my opinion is
a good
call for a style option such as "FireUpOnBottom".

Regards,

Neil Zanella

Log message:
Many fixes to remove warnings when using SGI's compiler.  Mostly the
changes involved using the correct types (unsigned in in X calls), and
using 'extern' to avoid multiple definitions of variables.

I didn't manage to remove all multiple definitions.  Would someone who
understands X11 please check whether the various definitions of
_XA_WM_PROTOCOLS should be shared (hence one instance extern'd) or
private (hence both instances static'd).  Thanks.

Don't have time to check into this right now but it seems that
FvwmPager crashes if the user is moving a mini-window (with
button 2) and the window is destroyed.

Something in all the changes to the move code that went in over the
weekend has once again broken moving a window out of the Pager onto the
desktop. Anyone have any idea what went wrong?

Grep the fvwm2 man page on "TriangleRelief" and 
"TrianglesRelief".  You'll see both there, but
obviously only one is right (TrianglesRelief,
as it happens).

Hi,
I have made some changes and additions to my pager patches.
I have introduced a well defined priority between different options when
the desk background is drawn. The priority for choosing the background of 
a desk is the following (high -> low):

1 - Desk specific pixmap
2 - Desk specific colour
3 - Global pixmap
4 - Global colour

I made sure that desk hilighting is disabled if neither the Hilight
nor the HilightPixmap options have been used. I also added an option
to disable desk hilighting. 

All these features are now also visible when the pager is iconified.

I thought a little about the pixmap scaling feature requested by
Robert Ford, but to do that the way I would like to do it might give the
pager a huge footprint, so I decided to skip it.

	/ Johan

+ 	choosing the background of a desk. They are chosen in the order
+ 	they are mentioned above. In order to do this, the Dcolor and

+	desk has been assigned a specific colour or pixmap.
+	
+	Introduced an option to disable hilighting of the current desk.
+		
+	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.1
+	Added sections for the new configuration options.
+
+	* FvwmPager/FvwmPager.c:
+	(main): The Dcolor and bgPixmap fields of the desks are now
+	initialised to NULL. 
+	Hilighting is turned off if no hilight colour or pixmap is specified. 
+	Setting the colour and font variables to default values are now
+	only done if they have not been set by the configuration file.
+	(list_new_desk): Introduced the new ordering of backgrounds, and
+ 	made a small update to how the label colours are treated.
+	(ParseOptions): Added new options and updated the Back and Pixmap
+	options to only update the global background not the desk specific
+	backgrounds.
+
+	* FvwmPager/x_pager.c:
+	(initialize_pager): Introduced the new ordering of backgrounds.
+	(DrawIconGrid): Introduced some machinery to make the feature of

I just checked everything out of cvs and built it and fvwm never starts up it seems to hange on an XQueryPinter call in WaitForButtonsUp in misc.c I don't see anything here that changed recentlly but this probablly has something to do with the fixes that went in for the slow startup.

I made some progress on the FvwmTalk  replacement last night.  Its not
quite  done, but this  surfaced again, and I  thought I'd solicit some
opinions.  Here are the 2 forms files involved:


# FormFvwmTalk - Basic replacement for FvwmTalk

*FormFvwmTalkHelpLine    center
*FormFvwmTalkHelpButton  quit    "Return - Dismiss"         ^M
*FormFvwmTalkHelpCommand   Nop


The problem here is that the instance FvwmForm "FormFvwmTalk" complains
about the configuration commands for "FormFvwmTalkHelp" since they
match up to the word "Help".  It looks at "HelpLine", etc. and
treats them all as invalid commands.

I can change "FormFvwmTalkHelp" to "FormFvwmHelpTalk", or make
FvwmForm not complain about commands it doesn't understand.
Changing the name around just makes it progressively harder to come
up with names.  Killing the command syntax check makes it harder
to debug configuration problems.

I wish there was a mandatory space after the module alias:

*FormFvwmTalkHelp Line    center

but I think its a little  late for that.  Maybe  a command line switch
to the module indicating the mandatory space  is needed would help, or
maybe I'm just not thinking straight.

Since you're invoking FvwmForm with a command line alias why not put a
delimiter after the base name e.g.
FvwmForm FormFvwmTalk:
and then have config lines like
*FormFvwmTalk:Line left
...
I don't think using a space is possible, even if it didn't get stripped
off by fvwm the module might tokenize the config lines. Using : might
not be the best, it might get confusing with Xdefaults, a / might be
good since it's impossible to clash with a real module.

Cheers,
Tim.

I've noticed this maybe a total of three times.  There is a usleep in menus.c, it looks like it is for the popup stuff, it is supposed to sleep for 10 ms but I ocasionally get a sigint during the usleep and then I fvwm hangs showing me the arrow cursor for menu selection, anyone else see this or am I just going crazy.

What if there were a libfvwm function to parse the config file, and fvwm
and all modules used it?  Could we not enforce some sane & consistent
syntax?

I haven't noticed any sigints, but I have noticed that there is no
prototype for the function.  Since its argument is a long,
if you are on a 64bit machine...

I think the ":" suggestion  is pretty good.   I wish I had thought  of
it.  Thanks.

Some of the parsing is in a library routine.  FvwmEvent, FvwmAnimate,
and FvwmForm are using it.  You may be referring to parsing the line
itself.  I've been thinking how bad the FvwmForm syntax is.  I think I'd
prefer:

*FvwmForm:Line center, Text "Command: ", Input Command, Length 80, Value ""

I haven't yet looked to see if we have generic code to parse that.

I feel that at least one of the original names remain.

I am concerned about compatibility across a thousand machines of various OS
flavors, and version, all running fvwm as the default wm. I do not see this
nameing as a valid reason to break compatibility.

My preference would be which ever one that is currently the most
incompassing. If that is "PixmapPath" then it should be used despite its
"name". For my setup it does not appear to make a difference if I use only
"IconPath" or only "PixmapPath" (I use xpm's in the titlebar, menus, etc).

Another option would to have a "PicturePath" that would take some order of;

if (${IconPath} != NULL) then
${PicturePath} == ${IconPath}:${PicturePath}
if (${PixmapPath} != NULL) then 
${PicturePath} == ${PixmapPath}:${PicturePath}

Then we could be publishe that IconPath and PixmapPath were being
depreciated in favor of PicturePath.

Then again, what about ImagePath?

Just had another occurence...  this time, FvwmTaskBar went into a loop
for a few minutes, then crashed before I could look into it...

(gdb) where

Not being familiar with gdb and what might be useful, I'm all ears for a
quick gdb sequence to use when this occurs...

Right now, I am running without a taskbar; if I try to start one, it
immediately becomes a cpu hog...  so, I'll have to wait for a convenient
break to restart the X server...

Cheers,
Pierre

He He He  :)  It's not THAT bad.  The no-global-cache issue IS a turn

Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  -- But more precisely, that's a
significant number of _LINUX_ machines.  The rest of the world won't
have Imlib by default.

Since we're going the Gnome route, maybe if they compile in "Full Gnome
Compatibility" then they get to use Imlib.  If they don't, then they get
to use pixmaps.

You discount the fact that Gnome is portable; I will certainly have it
running on my Suns and Digital machines.

Not all Linux machines will have Gnome; not all machines running Gnome
will be Linux machines.  Of course, a large number of machines of all Unix
flavors ill have neither Gnome nor Imlib, so the point is probably moot.

Yes I am on a 64 bit machine but I do have a prototype for usleep an it takes an unsigned int.

I see you haven't actually tried to be fully gnome under solaris, I tried and gave up about 6 libraries in I got tired of compiling.

I'm guessing we are talking about 2 different things.

Since usleep didn't seem to be 100% portable, there is a fvwm version
of usleep in libs/usleep.c.  It's first and only parameter is a long.

If you're OS calls usleep with an int, and its a 64 bit OS, this
tells me you are going to have a problem with usleep.

We just had some header file reorganization, so I'm not sure yet where
the right place to fix this is, but
you could try adding:

int usleep(unsigned long);

to the front of menus.c.

I have a pretty much full compile on Solaris 2.6, and have been keeping
it like that for quite a while now.. Very few problems (related to

Actually, FvwmEvent was not using it until 2 days ago, when I removed
Parse.c from its Makefile. Maybe we should remove the files Parse[ch]
from the modules/FvwmEvent directory, since they are no longer used.

I caught that, which is what led me to include FvwmEvent in the list.

If the file is no longer being used, there is no maybe about it.
Go ahead and remove it.

You are right I did miss the usleep in libs but mine doesn't get built into the library.  I tried running gcc on menus.c with the -E switch and I get 
typedef unsigned int    uint_t;
.
.
.
typedef uint_t      useconds_t;
.
.
.
extern int usleep(useconds_t);

now my solaris man page for usleep says that setitimer is the prefered
function over usleep, do you think it would be better to just replace
the calls to usleep with this or should I try forcing the arg as a long
first, although I'm not sure how that helps

You could try it and see if it helps, but we can't just replace it since
it's not a very portable function; we'd need some configure support for
it first.

Now I have.. and the 4-state thingie screwed it up for me a bit.. but I
got almost everything fixed.. just one issue right now which I haven't
been able to nail.. maybe someone knows how to fix...

How to reproduce:
Shade window
Maximixe in any direction (to fullscreen shows best)
Unshade window

While animating, the contents of the window is the same size as it was
when shading it...

It gets fixed if I call SetupFrame() before the actual animation, but
then it flashes to the correct size, back to title-only and animates
out... Looks butt ugly...

When trying to figure out what SetupFrame does that fixes this, my brain
gets lost.. could anyone with better knowledge look through it?

Just a sidenote, FvwmIconMan already does something to isolate config
lines intended for different instantiations of itself. It uses '*' as
a separator, as in:

*FvwmIconMan*transient*Foo Bar

Just in case you wanted to be consistent with that. Or alternatively,
maybe someone could decide what the right thing is and then have
IconMan conform to that?

Hmm.  I really am confused.

Now I look at my build area, I see that I don't build usleep either.
Apparently config figures out that I already have a usleep and
doesn't build it if it doesn't need it.

Based on your other mail, your compiler is seeing the vendor prototype
for usleep, so it should be converting the argument to usleep to
whatever the vendor usleep needs.

Wait, thats not  right either.  When I compile  menus.c with "-Wall" I
get this:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../version-2_3_0/fvwm -I.. -I../../version-2_3_0/libs -I/opt/public/include -I/usr/openwin/include    -Wall -c ../../version-2_3_0/fvwm/menus.c
../../version-2_3_0/fvwm/menus.c: In function `MenuInteraction':
../../version-2_3_0/fvwm/menus.c:641: warning: implicit declaration of function `usleep'

So its not seeing a prototype, at least in Solaris 2.5.1.

This is from glancing at the code of SetupFrame (l.1500ff)

#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
  if (!shaded) {
#endif
      XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->w, tmp_win->attr.width,
		    tmp_win->attr.height);
      XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent, cx,cy,
                        tmp_win->attr.width, tmp_win->attr.height);
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
  }
#endif

Thus, if you maximize a shaded window, Maximize calls SetupFrame, 
but the client window is not actually resized (since "shaded" is true).
This is not a problem for non-animated WindowShade, since the call
to SetupFrame in WindowShade after resetting the "shaded" flag will
get it right). 

I'm not 100% sure what the proper fix is. Will it work to
simply remove the "if (!shaded)" in the cited place ? If not,
you could try to just use the two XMove calls instead of a full
SetupFrame...

I just tried XORpixmap for the first time, was impressed, 
 ...and couldn't find a way to get rid of those rainbows
again! Perhaps XORpixmap should recognize "off" or "none". 

Another thing I just noticed is that Maximizing to 
something other than the full screen (eg height only)
is currently broken when it comes to unmaximizing:
the window isn't restored to its original position.
I fear that I might have introduced this behavior
with my latest patches...

Sorry to break your heart, but when the window is shaded, the geometry
is way off... mutt segfaults and "resize" reports 999 lines (prolly some
higher value, but it rounds down to some sane value).

I've been experimenting with calling SetupFrame before the actual
animation, but _not_ doing the XConfigureWindow around border.c:1520
before the animation. I have been unable to break that setup so far, but
it's a horrible kludge...

I'll get back to you..

Tada.

Could anyone try this (attached) horrible kludge? I haven't been able to
break it yet.. (The 'fix' checked in last by clasen made the bug go from
visual to actually doing harm)

I was continuing to work on patching fvwmrc_convert, when I came
across a bug in the FindPopup() function.  This shows itself when a
menu name has spaces in it, such as "Window Ops", and is due the
double parsing of the name.  The patch below fixes this.  Also, there
is a new fvwmrc_convert patch.  For ease, this patch is against the
distributed 2.2 version, so the patches I posted earlier are repeated
here.  Again, I will list a rationale for the patches.  New patches
are indicated with a * in the following list.  The numbers (1), (2)
etc. refer to the sections of the diff file delimited by @@.  Also, I
haven't checked which ones, but some of these diffs, although not
marked as new, supercede the ones I posted earlier in the week, so
should be used instead.

Patches to fix the FindPopup() bug
----------------------------------

Essentially, the FindPopup() function does not distinguish between
cases when the argument should be fed to GetNextToken() prior to use,
and when not.  I have solved this by renaming the original FindPopup()
function as FindPopupGetTok(), and creating a new function FindPopup()
in place of the original which does exactly the same except that it
does not call GetNextToken() on the string given.  Then those
occurrences of FindPopup() which require the strings to be parsed are
replaced by FindPopupGetTok().

The patches to fvwmrc_convert partially assume that this patch has
been applied; otherwise, some created .fvwm2rc files may not work.

Patches to fvwmrc_convert
-------------------------

 (1)* Change in accreditations; our awk is in a different place ;-)
 (2)  Whitespace only lines are treated as empty.
 (3)  Remove trailing "&" sign from Exec commands.
 (4)  Slightly more verbose ButtonStyle error message.
 (5)* Oops -- a typo in the order of +'s and -'s led to button shapes
      which looked like diabolos instead of rectangles.
 (6)* Comment out any ModulePath command.
      I thought that the paths were going to use fvwm, not fvwm2.  So
      the paths should not have gsub("/fvwm", "/fvwm2"); in them.
 (7)* Handling of the case Key ...... (Exec|Module|Restart) "name" ...
      Similar for the case Mouse .... (Exec|Module|Restart) "name" ...
      Changed the Mouse code to just pass it through otherwise; why is
      there any need to make mouse bindings sticky, anyway?
 (8)  Awful typo: searching for /^[ \t]**.../ takes huge amounts of time
      and/or memory.  This MUST be fixed (and it's trivial).
      Slightly more verbose warning message.
 (9)* Preserve the names of Menus in cases where they are quoted.
      More consistent error message.
(10)  If the internal Pager command is used, the output file now gives
      hints in the output file as to how the FvwmPager module can be
      configured to look similar to the original internal pager.

I prefer ImagePath to any of: PicturePath, IconPath, or PixmapPath.

What I envisaged was this:

ImagePath is implemented, and documented as the proper way to set the
path.  Both PixmapPath and IconPath remain; they will print out a warning,
and then call ImagePath.  At some point, PixmapPath and IconPath would
disappear, but they would remain through at least one full release.

How would this affect a user?  There are several possibilities, depending
on what is in their fvwmrc:

1. neither PixmapPath nor IconPath appear
- no change

2. exactly one of PixmapPath or IconPath appears
- warning emitted; images work as usual

3. both appear, set to different paths
- two warnings emitted; the last path set wins

4. both appear, set to the same value
- two warnings emitted; images work as usual


The breakage happens only in case #3 when the last path set is the
smaller. I suppose this could be coded around, but is this the most likely
case?

In any event, there will be a clear warning about what happened and how to
fix it, along the lines of: "IconPath is deprecated since 2.3.0; use
ImagePath in its place."

Good enough?

I guess you're only suggesting this for testing purposes. 

That's fine, but please don't check in things like that! 

We should not be prototyping _any_ syscalls that live in the system
libraries.  There's just no way you're going to get them right for all
machines.

On the other hand, we *should* be prototyping the distributed usleep() for
systems that build it.  I have a feeling we're not doing this.

Too late, it got removed last night!

The reason I removed them was *not* just that they became superfluous.  It
was more subtle than that:

1) You missed an #include "Parse.h" in FvwmEvent, so
2) FvwmEvent.c depended on Parse.h (in the FvwmEvent directory), but
3) Parse.h was not in the Makefile.am, meaning
4) the distribution ("make dist") had a broken dependency in the makefile:
   Parse.h was neither distributed nor could it be built.


How did I discover all that?  Simple: "make distcheck".  

Remember: "make distcheck is your friend"

We've had a lot of good commits lately, but we've also seen some degree of
breakage, too.

Does anyone have any big changes outstanding that they want to get in?

Did Jay's Gnome hint patches get in yet?  I don't recall seeing them.

I suggest that in a few days a bit of effort is spent on testing and
stabilization with an eye towards making a 2.3.1 testing release if things
work out well enough.  Why so soon?  Well, Gnome 1.0 came out today, for
one.  So we will soon have both a new crop of folks who can test the stuff
_and_ a crop of FVWM users going "why don't I get cool Gnome interaction?"
Plus the but count has ballooned with all of the new features, so it would
be good to get some stability back after the first wave of pent-up patches
has broken.

Oh, and also to help prevent Dom from having a coronary when he comes back
from vacation.

	Seems to work ok so far. I just blindly applied it to a fresh CVS
update and tried it out, so I can't comment on the aesthetics of your
solution. (Of course, windows behaving properly do have their own
aesthetic appeal!) I'll try to pound on it some more tomorrow.

	It's good to have windowshade animation back again!

No one's attempted it yet :)

Nope.  He posted a few days ago in response to your query, saying he was
going to make a new patch against 2.2 but he had a few nits to work out
first.

Yes.  That's why it's best to have it in a separate file, in lib.
That's how we generally handle potentially "missing" functions in
autoconf'd packages: there's special support macros for adding xxx.c
files to the build if you're missing function xxx.

Bleah, looks like Solaris 2.5.1 is missing a prototype for usleep(),
even though the man page says you should #include <unistd.h>

I did a grep through /usr/include/*.h and /usr/include/sys/*.h on my
Solaris 2.5.1 system and couldn't find any prototype for usleep
anywhere... :(

	I think it wouldn't hurt to stabilize what we've got and put out a
2.3.1 beta before we start on the GSFR, though.

XORValue 0 gets you back to the default, should be in the manpage I
guess.

Well, somehow I thought it would be ok to leave fvwm_msg(DBG,...)
in the code, and they wouldn't show up unless I configure --enable-debug,
but that is obviously not true. 

Do I have to protect them by #ifdef ENABLE_DEBUG_MSGS ?

I still have my window group stuff, but I'm happy to leave that for 2.4,
since I think it still needs some work (user-definable groups, user-settable
group resources (eg the group icon), etc).

I wonder what "cool Gnome interaction" they will actually get from the
Gnome hints stuff ? The only thing I could think of is the Gnome pager,
and, frankly, I think it is crap compared to the fvwm alternatives:
FvwmPager + WindowList. I'm personally quite happy with swallowing the
FvwmPager in the panel. (Please don't read this as an argument against
including the Gnome hints stuff.)

Subject: Issues with layers/M_RAISE/M_LOWER
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


A small inconsistency in the fvwm<->module protocol: There is 
M_WINDOWSHADE/M_DEWINDOWSHADE, but no corresponding 
M_MAXIMIZE/M_DEMAXIMIZE pair. It turns out that no modules uses 
the WINDOWSHADE packets (apart from FvwmCommand listing it) so 
they could be removed without harm. I vote for doing so.

The introduction of layers has changed the semantics of Raise/Lower 
and accordingly of the M_RAISE/M_LOWER packets. I guess the pager 
is currently doing the wrong thing wrt to stacking order, since it 
will raise a window for which it receives a M_RAISE to the absolute
top while fvwm has raised it only to the top of its layer.

Two solutions come to mind: 

 1) Make modules knowledgeable about layers, ie add a M_LAYER 
    packet sent on layer changes and add the layer information 
    to the M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW/M_ADD_WINDOW packets. Then modules 
    can maintain a layered stacking order.
 
 2) Keep the illusion of an unlayered stacking order for modules.
    This needs a new packet M_RESTACK which would be used to
    tell modules about a window that has been raised to a new
    position different from the top of stack.
    Ie send more or less the parameters used for the XConfigureWindow
    done by fvwm (stack_mode and sibling, mainly). Then FvwmPager
    can do the corresponding XConfigureWindow.
    Perhaps we need to allow this to also transfer the information
    needed to do a XRestackWindows (since RaiseWindow basically
    does XConfigureWindow followed by XRestackWindows)

    So I think the contents of the M_RESTACK packet would have to 
    be stack_mode, sibling, list of windows (we would probably
    allow more than one window only in the case of stack_mode==Below,
    to get XRestackWindows functionality) 

    fvwm would then be changed to send M_RESTACK packets instead
    of M_RAISE/M_LOWER packets. Since the only module using M_RAISE/M_LOWER
    packets is the pager, this shouldn't break too much.

    Btw such a packet would also have to be sent from 
    HandleConfigureRequest if a client changes the stacking order
    of its window.
    
Comments ?

I think I'll try to implement 2).

There's a bug report that  [fvwm -cmd "read system.rc" -cmd "read
user.rc"] would ignore the decorations specified in user.rc until a
Recapture.  The reason for this behaviour was that the initial capture
and styling of windows happened after the first Read finished.  It was
possible to hang fvwm at start-up with [fvwm -cmd "Echo hello"] as well
as there was no Read.  The only reason that Fvwm{M4,CPP} ever worked was
that they created a file and sent a Read command to fvwm.

What I did was to take the call to StartupStuff() out of the Read
command and put it in the main event loop.  It now gets called as soon
as all commands started by the command line have finished. To get a
general solution I implemented a monitor of all modules started by the
command line that counts all the start-up modules as they are started
and as they finish.  Once there are no modules running StartupStuff() is
called and counting ceases.  What you can now do is to have FvwmCpp send
lots of reads and even start other modules and fvwm will sit there
reading in the config commands until all the modules it has started have
quit and then it will do the initial capture (and get the decorations
right) and run InitFunction.

The problem with this is that it's more likely that something will
wedge.  You must not cause a module to start that requires a top level
window (e.g. FvwmBanner) since fvwm will not reparent the window until
after StartpStuff().  Any module trying to create a top level window
will hang until fvwm reparents it, which it won't until all the start-up
modules are finished.

To prevent the above deadlock I put a time-out on the select() in the
main event loop.  When StartupStuff() is called the time-out is
disabled. If the select() times out StartupStuff() is called.  I set the
time-out to be large so that it would annoy the user into fixing the
problem (with their command line args).

I don't think this is the cause of Dans slow start-up as he reports the
windows are captured before the delay. It's strange that the delay is
roughly the same as the time-out so it may be that there's a bug.  If a
time-out happens there will be an error message in the log file.

Hope this helps,
Tim.

Maybe, The 42s timeout is on the select() call in the main event loop
and won't go off if you click the mouse.  Dou you get the foloowing erro
message in your log file?

"Some command line modules have not quit, Starting up after timeout."

it seems they added the protypye to unistd.h in 2.6 because I don't have a protytype either, strangely enough I build fvwm on 2.6 and have users running on 2.6 and 2.5.1 and I've only had users get this problem on 2.6 ??

As I said before the problem is rather intermitent but I'll try to add thje protypete at see if it turns up again.

this is fine by me.  unfortunately, however, our archiving software is
liable to bark at you each time you upload with multiple licenses.  if you
don't mind, we don't either.

Yes, now that you say it. When I click on a window border it is
interpreted as a 'move', not a 'click'.

Allright, we had that bug before. Something in the fvwm startup logic
screwed up. A while ago I made a patch that set Scr.ClickTime to a
negative value during startup to speed it up. As it is now fvwm
ends up with this negative value in the main loop. I don't know what
has been changed there. Who made the recent startup changes? Tim?

Looks like Scr.ClickTime = -Scr.ClickTime is missing from StartupStuff()

I'll add it in a mo,
Tim.

Hi Julian,

could you please recreate your patch in a way that it
doesn't contain the name of your fvwm directory?
Usually you should create patches from within the
fvwm directory and use

  # diff -u some_file.orig some_file

This way you don't have the version number in the patch either.

I'm on Solaris 2..5.1 and have to build with --disable-session.  There
are no  session headers on this system.   With the current  CVS, I get
this:

  tp> The problem with this is that it's more likely that something will
  tp> wedge.  You must not cause a module to start that requires a top
  tp> level window (e.g. FvwmBanner) since fvwm will not reparent the
  tp> window until after StartpStuff().  Any module trying to create a
  tp> top level window will hang until fvwm reparents it, which it won't
  tp> until all the start-up modules are finished.

  tp> To prevent the above deadlock I put a time-out on the select() in
  tp> the main event loop.  When StartupStuff() is called the time-out
  tp> is disabled. If the select() times out StartupStuff() is called.
  tp> I set the time-out to be large so that it would annoy the user
  tp> into fixing the problem (with their command line args).

Wow.  Tim, can you add a FAQ about this?  I think it warrants it;
something like:

 Q. My fvwm startup now takes a lot longer!  What's up?

 A. ...???...

Also a note in the NEWS file (if there isn't already) is probably a good
idea.

Note you can still apply it using the -p option to patch.  It is simpler
if you don't have to do this, I agree.

Didn't this already go in?  I could have sworn I saw something by
Matthias or someone updating the pager background stuff already.

Now that we have a wacky new start-up algorithm both FvwmM4 and
FvwmCPP can be rewritten to not need a temp file. i.e.they can
exec m4/cpp.  The -debug option will still be handy but it can
be simplified to not refuse if the file exists already, instead
it can exec m4 | tee <outfile>

Yep, I see one of them.

I don't fully  understand the 42 second deal,  but if  there's a timer
waiting around for me to click the mouse, it could wait for days.

Urk.  Configure should determine this for you, you shouldn't have to
specify --disable-session.

Can someone provide some header files or X functions or other tests
which could be used to determine if the system supports session
management or not?

What you typically want to do is run GDB and attach to the running app.
You can do this with:

  $ gdb /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.2/FvwmTaskBar <PID>

Once you attach, you can try next-ing or step-ping through, and see if
you can tell where it's looping; if you can describe the loop maybe we
can look more closely.

Another thing that can be useful is, esp. if you know it's going to
immediately go south, you can use truss or strace or whatever your
system supports and log the output; it might be possible to see the loop
from that, too.

I have one, possible silly, question.

Does fvwm2 export an "ImagePath" the way it does for "ModulePath"?

When you run configure now you can specify the path from the command line
(--with-iconpath).  If fvwm2 could then export this path, there would be no need
to have an "ImagePath" defined in the rc file, except if a user had private
images. Then all they would need to do is ImagePath=$ImagePath:/home/me/images.

It doesn't now, although it could be made to easily enough.

The following patches are still lying around on my disk:

1) FvwmStyle module (in perl)
2) A large FvwmScript example
3) 'Replace' function to re-place a window on the screen
4) FvwmWinList ButtonFrameWidth patch
5) Some FvwmBorder patch by Tim (I think Tim has already taken
   care of this).
6) Dropping windows into the pager. The patch is for 2.0.46.
   Perhaps we could convince the author (Toshi Isogai) to
   update it for 2.3.x.
7) A patch by Matthias to split SmartPlacement and CleverPlacement
   into separate functions (Personally I think one Smart/Clever/...
   placement style is enough).

Bye

Dominik

I've recently cleaned up my mailbox and found a number of                       
patches Matthias Claasen made. I'm unsure what has been or
should be committed. Could you look through this list, please?                            
                                                                                
1) ICCCM focus handling in FvwmPager
2) Window groups. We had some discussion here and some more
   ideas. We should think about that before committing.
3) Menus in FvwmPager.
4) A patch to fix the size of maximized and shaded windows.
5) GTK menu module.
6) Shading as an ICCCM state.
7) FvwmEval module.

Agreed. I'd like to start with the GSFR as soon as the major
patches (like GNOME support) have bee applied.

As mentioned in another thread I'd like to begin with the
GSFR as soon as the larger outstanding patches have been
applied. Let me summarize what we (more or less) agreed
in our last discussion:

1) Flags are implemented as bit fields inside a struct.
2) Style and state flags are kept in different objects.

     struct 
     {
       struct
       {
         unsigned start_iconic : 1;
         unsigned lenience : 1;
         ...
       } style,
       struct
       {
         unsigned IconifiedByParent : 1;
         unsigned NameChanged : 1;
         ...
       } state
     } flags;

3) Flags are accessed through macros:

   e.g.:

     if (IS_STICKY(window))
       ...

We had some discussion about (3) and if we should use
unions with an array of integers (as described in the TODO
file) but I think we can agree on the above.

I'd volunteer to do a good chunk of the work. However I've
got no idea which of the present flags are style flags and
which are state flags.

Paul (PDS) perhaps we could get that through together, what
do you think?

Bye

Dominik

Well, I've haven't seen any commit for this and the patch
applied without any conflicts. So unless the patch was
reversed and I removed it again ... ;-)

..--==-  Thu, 4 Mar 1999 21:28:15 +0100,
..--==-  Dominik Vogt (DV) discussed:

 DV)  As mentioned in another thread I'd like to begin with the
 DV)  GSFR as soon as the larger outstanding patches have been
 DV)  applied. Let me summarize what we (more or less) agreed
 DV)  in our last discussion:

 DV)  1) Flags are implemented as bit fields inside a struct.
 DV)  2) Style and state flags are kept in different objects.

Good idea

 DV)  3) Flags are accessed through macros:

 DV)  e.g.:

 DV)  if (IS_STICKY(window))
 DV)  ...

 DV)  We had some discussion about (3) and if we should use
 DV)  unions with an array of integers (as described in the TODO
 DV)  file) but I think we can agree on the above.

Just thought I'd mention some past experience I had when playing
around with stuff like this (I did a GSFR last April, which patches
against 2.0.46, and had it functionally running just like 2.0.46).

Basically what I used there were things like:

set_flag(on_flags, sticky_icon)
flag_isset(t->flags, on_top))

etc.  That was a while ago, and what you might consider now are things
like. Or something like:

SET (flags, group, flag)
CLEAR (flags, group, flag)
IS_SET (flags, group, flag)

I also implemented macros operations such as OR, AND, ADD, REMOVE and
EQ (which made the on_flags off_flags thing easy).  Then define other
macros which access particular subgroups of the bitfield:

#define WIN_SET(win, group, flag) \
	SET((win)->flags, group, flag)
#define WIN_CLEAR(win, group, flag) \
	CLEAR((win)->flags, group, flag)
#define WIN_ISSET(win, group, flag) \
	IS_SET((win)->flags, group, flag)

The advantage of this more generic way was that it made it easier to
create bit operations like or/and and stuff. This much simplified
converting some stuff in style.c wrt on_flags and off_flags (which I
had completely converted), to retain the current behavior.

  538     if (t1 != &Scr.FvwmRoot)
  539       {
  540         /*
  541             If the window is not moving into the viewport...
  542         */
  543         txl = t1->frame_x;
  544         tyt = t1->frame_y;
  545         txr = t1->frame_x + t1->frame_width;
  546         tyb = t1->frame_y + t1->frame_height;

And above that I find this comment:

  /*
      RBW - 11/13/1998  - new:  chase the chain bidirectionally, all at once!
      The idea is to move the windows that are moving out of the viewport from
      the bottom of the stacking order up, to minimize the expose-redraw overhead.
      Windows that will be moving into view will be moved top down, for the same
      reason. Use the new  stacking-order chain, rather than the old
      last-focussed chain.
  */

These are all useful if we're using arrays where we then set and test
bits, but if we're using C's bitfields I don't really see the
advantage.

You can't use bitwise and/or to set or test multiple bitfields at once:
you have to do them individually anyway.  It seems more straightforward
to just deal with the data structure directly, rather than through
macros which don't add any value... e.g.

  #define HAS_STICKY_ICON(_w)    ((_w)->has_sticky_icon)

    if (HAS_STICKY_ICON(window))

doesn't seem any more clear or usefully abstracted, to me, than simply
writing:

    if (window->has_sticky_icon)

Whatever, this sounds suspiciously like a discussion we've had before.
Maybe we should all go back and read through the archives before going
further :)

Yikes, let's at least have a common naming convention here :)

We should probably have someone come up with a data structure and then
post it, and we can fight about the names.  I'm partial to the
lower_case method if identifiers, but I don't care enough to worry about
it if you-all like the UpperCase method.

Just so long as we're consistent :)

  dv>    e.g.:

  dv>      if (IS_STICKY(window))

For the record, I'll repeat that I think these macros are superfluous,
but I don't care that much either :).

  dv> and if we should use unions with an array of integers (as
  dv> described in the TODO file) but I think we can agree on the above.

I was never sure what the purpose of the union was.  When would it make
sense to access the data via the array?  You can copy the entire data
structure with a struct assignment, or memcpy(), or whatever, and you
can't rely on being able to set bits in the bitfields via the array or
even access some bits in a structure that way, since the compiler can
organize them however it likes.

If we really think we need to be setting and/or testing multiple bits at
the same time all at once and don't want to use syntax like:

  if (!window->is_sticky && window->is_iconic)

then we can't use C bitfields and should just go back to an array of int
or whatever, with macros to hide the bit operations.

I don't think I have much more of a feel than you for this distinction,
but we can take a first whack at it and let the list decide.

What exactly _is_ the distinction we're trying to make?  That is, where
in the code will we want to treat these things, as a block, differently?

	I'm gonna have to stop leaving my initials in the code!  :-)

	Nice to see you back, Dominik!

	What are you doing when this happens? From the trace, I presume you're
creating a non-SkipMapping, StartsOnPage window on a page other than the
current one, and it's not during Startup or Restart, but what else has
been going on? This looks like an FvwmWindow struct has been improperly
deleted from the Great Chain of Being.

	Well, yes, now that you mention it. Last night while testing Tomas'
patch I found I couldn't get my Maximize-100%-in-both-directions
function to work. This action is bound to a double click on titlebar
button 2. Wondering what I might have screwed up, I tried playing with
some other functions I have bound to double clicks, and couldn't get any
of them to work.

	I then bumped my ClickTime setting from 100 (which is what it's been
for years) to 200, and double clicks began to be detected.

	I didn't look into it any further at the time, since my main concern
was testing WindowShade/Maximize/Move interaction.

	I'd kind of like to see this one make it into 2.3.1, if Toshi's
willing.

	Of course, I'd also like to see dragging windows *out* of the pager
fixed. (It got broken sometime in the last week. I haven't had time to
research it - lots of changes have happened that affect the move code.)

Hey Dominik or whoever uploads to the-site-formerly-known-as-sunsite, note
that their guidelines state:

	So please, whenever possible, try to fill the Copying-Policy field
	with one of the values in the table below. If your software has
	parts covred by different licenses, list the most restrictive
	license. 

	[ ... ]
	restricted
	      Less free than any of the above


We could just stick "restricted" in the field to shut up the archiver.

Tim make sure you wrap it in an if the problem is that towards the end
of main it gets maid positive but SetClick in builtins switches it back
to negative because finsStartup isn't false yet.

Something like,
if( Src.ClickTime < 0)
	Scr.ClickTime -= Scr.ClickTime

No, the patch that already went in was for the balloon label formats,
the background stuff hadn't gone in yet.

	I uploaded it. Since the sequence of messages showed that it ended up
in the right directory (the one where the lsm claims that it's located),
I didn't worry about it.

	I don't mind the occasional squawk from keeper, but I suppose we don't
need to spam the whole mailing list (and the archives) with it.

	Anyone else have an opinion? I've got a couple of other nitpicking
changes pending for the lsm to satisfy the LSM itself, so I'll hold off
committing them till we decide on the "restricted" suggestion.

Log message:
These are the changes to deprecate IconPath and PixmapPath in favour
of ImagePath.

Coders beware: the picture functions' API has changed.  See
libs/Picture.h.

Also, note the searchPath function in System.c.  This is what used to
be findIconFile(), but got overloaded to find executables too!

No, it went in before 2.2, but was taken out since it changed
the behavior of M2 wrt desktop changing

I want to leave that for 2.4, since it needs a bit more thought

No, I think this should be done in a cleaner way, by making
the actions bound to mouse buttons in the pager completely 
configurable

This is not exactly what my patch does, but it is in.

This is currently available via ftp from

ftp://peano.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/pub/fvwm

I keep thinking about extending it to a complete replacement
for all widget-like functionality in fvwm and modules, ie
adding dialogs and WindowList functionality. 

> 6) Shading as an ICCCM state.

No, this has been rejected after some discussion pre-2.2. 
But something related to this went in, a patch to make
shading and maximization truly independent 
("cube of wm-private states").

> 7) FvwmEval module.

No, but I would like to drop this in modules/FvwmEval
if nobody objects.

Don't panic. What I actually put in was
  if (Scr.ClickTime < 0)
    Scr.ClickTime = -Scr.ClickTime;

Oops, I didn't think about that. 

But the urgency hint is not session management, its ICCCM 2. That
may have been added in R6. So we either have to ifdef out the icccm2
stuff for older systems or simply provide a definition for the urgency
hint bit if the X headers don't define it. I'll take a look.

This means that either
1) you have something on your fvwm command line that ends up trying to
create a top level window.

or
2) There's a bug in the starting up algorithm.

What does you command line do? does it start any modules? Do the files
read during start up run programs that create top level windows?

There isn't a timer, it's a timeout. What should be happening is that
every time a module is started while fFwvmInStartup is true a bit is set
in fd_init.  Every time a module quits the bit is reset.  Every time the
main event loop is entered while fFvwmInStartup is true, fd_init is
examined and if zero StartupStuff() is called.  StartupStuff() sets
fFvwmInStartup to false and captures all the windows.  Here's the code
in events.c that checks the init modules

  /* check for termination of all startup modules */
  if (fFvwmInStartup) {
    for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
      if (FD_ISSET(i, &init_fdset))
        break;
    if (i == npipes) {
      DBUG("My_XNextEvent", "Starting up after command lines
modules\n");
      StartupStuff();
      timeoutP = NULL; /* set an infinite timeout to stop ticking */
    }
  }  

Is this OK?  I'm relying on i=npipes if a break doesn't happen

Here's the select() bit

  if (select((SELECT_TYPE_ARG1)fd_width,
             SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &in_fdset,
             SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &out_fdset,
             SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 0,
             SELECT_TYPE_ARG5   timeoutP) > 0) {

    /* Check for module input. */
    for (i=0; i<npipes; i++) {
      if ((readPipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)) {
        if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
          HandleModuleInput(targetWindow,i);
        } else {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
          KillModule(i,10);
        }
      }
      if ((writePipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(writePipes[i], &out_fdset)) {
        DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling FlushQueue");
        FlushQueue(i);
      }
    }

#ifdef SESSION
    if ((sm_fd >= 0) && (FD_ISSET(sm_fd, &in_fdset))) ProcessICEMsgs();
#endif

  } else {
    /* select has timed out, things must have calmed down so let's
decorate */
    if (fFvwmInStartup) {
      fvwm_msg(ERR, "My_XNextEvent",
               "Some command line modules have not quit, Starting up
after timeout.\n"
      StartupStuff();
      timeoutP = NULL; /* set an infinite timeout to stop ticking */
    }
  }

The funy thing about this is that X events from the select are ignored
until the loop is entered again, Maybe an XSync in front of the select()
would help.

Cheers,
Tim.

Oh, I forgot about that, thanks.  The man page for XConfigureWindow only
mentions BadMatch in two cases. One is setting the borderwidth of an
input only window, the other is specifying stack position against
another window that is not a sibling.

I managed to get gdb to grab fvwm2 when it hung.  It's not hanging, it's
looping around the stack list (line 899 of misc.c). It seems to happen
when I hit a key that runs a functions that does:
Close
Prev Focus
Prev Raise

and the window that is closed is a transient of the window that gets
raised.

It looks like the stack order list is getting corrupted.. I hate to
point the finger of suspicion but this only started after the layer
patch went in.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS it would be nice if SIG_QUIT signal caused a core dump. In this case
it doesn't break the loop, only SIG_KILL works and that doesn't leave a
core.

Good spotting. In fact, last night I realized that my implementation
of layer-smart RaiseWindow was not so smart after all (manipulating
the stacking order list while looping over that list is, um, dangerous.)

I'll provide a (hopefully) better RaiseWindow tonight.

The symptoms that the current CVS might show are either X errors from
ConfigureWindow (as you've seen) or getting stuck in a tight loop 
(the stacking order can get corrupted to have cyclic pointers). All
this should only happen when raising windows with transients. A
way to make fvwm work more reliable until I correct my mistakes
should be to compile with DONT_RAISE_TRANSIENTS, I guess.

Hi,
there is a small "off by two bug" in searchPath in libs/System.c
When the path variable is allocated there are two things that are not
taken into account: The separator between the found directory and the
filename plus the string termination character. This bug is only
triggered when the path you want to search only contain one component.

I have attached a small patch that takes care of this problem.

	/ Johan

Right. XConfigureWindow generates an X error which is handled
by FvwmErrorHandler in x_pager.c:

  XErrorHandler FvwmErrorHandler(Display *dpy, XErrorEvent *event)
  {
  #if 0
    Window root;
    unsigned border_width, depth;
    int x,y;
  
    if(XGetGeometry(dpy,Scr.Pager_w,&root,&x,&y,
                    (unsigned *)&window_w,(unsigned *)&window_h,
                    &border_width,&depth)==0)
      {
        exit(0);
      }
  
    return 0;
  #else
    /* really should just exit here... */
    fprintf(stderr,"%s: XError!  Bagging out!\n",MyName);
    exit(0);
  #endif /* 0 */
  }

Looks like another one of these error handling patches
that break more than they fix. In my eyes the right
thing would be to ignore all errors (and hope this doesn't
cause the pager to crash somewhere). If the pager window
was destroyed and fvwm has died or broken the connection,
wouldn't the broken pipe be caught in a signal handler?
So why should we need to exit here?

The example above is from the current code. Personally I use
underscores and I don't mind in the least which we use. But
since most flags are uppercase it's less work to change those
with underscores.

Um, I always thought that you wanted the macros and I thought them
to be dangerous. I can do without them perfectly well.

I think this is the reason. As far as I remember early versions of

Why should we want to test several bits at once? I've seen nothing
like this in the code. The only case i could imagine is when there
are more than two alternatives of a single option and then you can
use 'foo : 2' instead.

Probably nowhere, the advantage is that it may make the code
easier to understand (well, of course not if we hide the struct
with macros). It will even make things more complicated since we
need a second level of structs. If we can't figure out which flag
belongs where we could simply use one struct with a style and a
state section:

  struct
  {
    /* style flags */
    unsigned start_iconic : 1,
    unsigned lenience : 1,
    ...

    /* state flags */
    unsigned IconifiedByParent : 1,
    unsigned NameChanged : 1,
    ...
  } flags

I don't know how to reproduce this. I was working with fvwm, i.e.
popping netscape, mutt and several rxvt's up and down. The coredump
happened when I switched from page (1,0) to page (0,0) via a
key binding. I had a netscape open on page (1,0). It *may* have
created a new window at the same moment, but I'm not sure. It may
also have something to do with transients (find window) of netscape,
but again I can't remember.

     Well, it's clearly the result of the window chains' getting somehow
corrupted or out of sync. I suspect it'll go away after Matthias commits
his new version of layer-aware raising.

     After the layer code has had a few days of stabilizing, we should
revisit this and really try to confuse FVWM with a flurry of
raising/lowering/page-switching/window-creation-and-destruction activity.

Oops, most flags use underscores.

I've hacked it into fvwm.h this way (with some modifications).
Could you take a look?  I'd like to change all the names to
'is_...' or 'has_...' too.

Comments?

I'm not sure we are on the same page, but when looking at style flags,
it makes sense that you first understand what is going on with
"ALL_COMMON_FLAGS".

When we discussed this  last time, we  came to the conclusion that the
"common"  bits should be  in a structure by  themselves since they are
moved  all at once from   the style structure  into  each new  windows
structure.

I'd much prefer to see this functionality implemented as support for pasting

There is nothing on my command line.

During startup, I invoke  FvwmBanner  thru the InitFunction and  start
FvwmAnimate with "Module FvwmAnimate".

FvwmBanner wasn't showing until after the timeout, FvwmAnimate isn't going
to quit during startup.

I haven't been able to compile 2.3.0, let alone test it for a few days
now.  If some of  the recent patches help, I  wouldn't know  it.  (The
last problem was the XUrgency stuff.)

ARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!

This is going to break a few things:

1.  tkgoodstuff uses these documented commands (WindowList, Switcher,
    among other things).

2.  People using FvwmCommand or FvwmPipe to do special things will have
    to modify their scripts to use the new names if they use those
    functions.

Remember, the module interface was DOCUMENTED in order to allow people
and programs to take advantage of it.  Serendipitously changing
function names during a minor release will break things needlessly.

I beg you to reconsider this change.

I don't mind the occasional squawk either.  It's not like we're uploading
all the betas there!

I thought at first, it would be useful to be in one of their recognized
categories.  But on second thought, it might not be good for us to be in
the same category as commercial demos or something quite non open source.
It would be too easy for automated tools to just skip over FVWM.

So perhaps being exceptional is not a bad idea.  It would force a human to
make a decision about the package.  ;-)

I'm happy with it either way, restricted or not.

  Hi.  This patch allows functions and scripts to gain full knowledge of
where the user is working at the time they are called. I've been using it
patch for two days with no trouble.  The FAQ isn't clear on which Changelog
I should edit; it says how to have Emacs find out automatically, but I
don't use Emacs.  It also refers me to a "Q16" which isn't there.


1999-03-05  Will French <wfrench@interport.net>

  Added special variables $x and $y for complex functions.  These expand
to the x and y coordinates of the viewport.

Oh, yeah.  I think you're right!  How embarrassing.

One advantage of the macros, I will say, is that you don't have to worry
about how (or if) you split the flags into multiple structures; that's
hidden by the macro.

This is true, traditional K&R couldn't do that.  However, we've long
since abandoned any pretense at supporting pre-ANSI C compilers, what
with requiring prototypes and stdard.h, etc.

However, a memcpy() will do just as well on a struct as it will on an
array of ints if we don't want to rely on struct copies (although I
recommend it, since it's undoubtedly faster the majority of the time).

Looking through the mail archive to remind myself of exactly what my
positions are on these issues ;), I see we already laid this one to rest
in the last discussion: we don't need these arrays.

> Added a hint to ImagePath command in manpage (IconPath, PixmapPath)

I use a man page to, say, find out how to configure fvwm.  So I like to
have the useful information up front.  

Is it useful to know about obsolete commands?  Yes, if you have an old
fvwm2rc file that you are trying to understand.  But not if you are trying
to write yours, or understand the supplied examples.  None of the examples
have IconPath or PixmapPath in them.

I guess we should decide on what the primary purpose of a man page is: be
a short reference, or be a comprehensive document.

IMO, the man page is already too long, so one ought to think carefully
about what to put in it.  In this case, fvwm itself already warns you that
IconPath being is replaced by ImagePath.  The NEWS file also documents the
change.  Thus, I removed the IconPath and PixmapPath entries deliberately. 
If the question comes up a lot in future, I'll write a FAQ entry.

If it is deemed absolutely necessary to have obsolete commands mentioned
in the manpage, I suggest a small note AT THE END of the ImagePath entry. 
Man pagers allow searching by string, an this will suffice for that
purpose. 

P.S.  Dominik, you re-inserted IconPath twice.  ;-)

P.P.S.  For a similar reason, I re-wrote the Iconify section about the
optional argument to put the CURRENT syntax FIRST, and the old numeric
stuff *last*.  I only re-wrote this because I happened to notice it.  If
there are other similar sections, I'd advocate doing the same.

I agree with Larry.

If  this was attempt to  fix the collating  sequence problems with "_"
vs.    caseless compares, I still    favor changing the command  table
itself to  all one case, and changing  the argument  to the same case,
and doing the command matching with strcmp instead of strcasecmp.

It seems nuts to use binary searches, on the command table, and at the
same time do case conversion twice before every compare.

I  know we  are doing  this in modules  too,  but in  the main command
loop...

I think we can list under GPL.  I just checked and all the licenses seem

Tis is latest CVS I get this when I compile in libs
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I..  -I/usr/openwin/include    -g -O2 -c Picture.c
Picture.c:74: `FVWM_IMAGEPATH' undeclared here (not in a function)
Picture.c: In function `SetImagePath':
Picture.c:78: `FVWM_IMAGEPATH' undeclared (first use this function)
Picture.c:78: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
Picture.c:78: for each function it appears in.)


doing a grep at the top level I get
grep FVWM_IMAGEPATH *
acconfig.h:#undef FVWM_IMAGEPATH
configure.in:AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(FVWM_IMAGEPATH, "$val")


Is this my problem or did something not get checked in.

The algorithm Emacs uses is to start with the current directory, then go
back up to each parent directory.  The first ChangeLog found is the one
used.  (If none is found, one is created in the current directory.)

  wf> It also refers me to a "Q16" which isn't there.

Oops :-/.

Anyway, what you've done here is fine:

  wf>   Added special variables $x and $y for complex functions.  These expand
  wf> to the x and y coordinates of the viewport.

Preferred, actually: submitting the changelog entry as part of the diff
is problematical because it almost _never_ applies: the changelog file
changes too often.

The "best" way to submit a patch is as you've done it: provide the patch
and provide a vanilla text changelog entry before it, that can be cut
and pasted into the ChangeLog by the person applying the patch.

One nit: the format isn't quite correct.  It should have the filename
and function name you changed.  See the current changelog entries.
S'thing like:

1999-03-05  Will French  <wfrench@interport.net>

        * fvwm/complex.c (expand): Added special variables $x and $y for
        complex functions.  These expand to the x and y coordinates of
        the viewport.

I'll take a whack at the FAQ entry for this, thanks.

Looks like autoconf didn't regenerate your configure script, and you
didn't re-run configure (since that's not found in "configure" or in
"config.h.in" by your grep).

Odd, since the makefile you have should notice that configure.in is
newer than configure, and "do the right thing".  Or, isn't it?

Anyway, I'd try "autoreconf" then make again from the top.

(1)  cd fvwm-2.2/fvwm
     patch -p2 < patchfile

    will ignore everything in the filenames up to and including the
    second slash.  Standard practice: diff -Nru dir.orig dir  gives a
    full patchfile from an original source tree to a modified one, and
    it is applied using patch -p1.

(2) Having the version numbers in the top directory names makes it
    extremely clear to anyone looking at the file which version it is
    patched against.  Who knows whether it would work or be correct in
    a different version?

Just my 2c on this one ;-)

Hi Paul,

Well... this time I was so busy editing and running jobs that I didn't
even notice the taskbar crashing...  so I didn't get to gdb the
process...

Before the problem, I tried to recreate the steps I originally thought
might be contributing to the crash with no luck.  Then I thought the
problem might be related to incoming mail which causes part of the mail
icon to appear white until netscape gets it (my mail POP is local with
NS set to check every 1 minute), so I started an strace... Starting long
before the segv; it's about 2MB...  here are the last lines in the trace

Well, I liked the ":" (colon), but I changed  my config file's name to
"FormFvwmTalk:" and  was unable  to  get the  filename to  pass   thru
gnumake.

Using asterisk doesn't appeal to me since I need to be able to use
"DestroyModuleConfig" which uses the asterisk as a wildcard.

Right now I'm   using period, which looks  OK,  and is common in  file
names, (although not always as a trailing character).

I'd hate to go to using filename extensions, but they would work too.
Right now, period seems acceptable.  So far, this is just a naming
convention, there is no code in FvwmForm that requires periods.

Hmm, good point. The use of the asterisk always looked a bit suspect
to me...

Periods look like a good approach.

Agreed. Maybe we should patch IconMan to follow the same convention? Or
place something in libfvwm and patch IconMan to parse using library
routines?

I never used or looked at this module before, but felt I should.  This
module really does require asterisk delimiters.  (I had  to see it for
myself).  All Brady had to say for himself was in the README:

"I realize that the syntax for  setting options is different from that
used by other modules."


I'm not sure if  we could change FvwmIconMan  and keep current  config
files working.  I  guess it could allow  either  '*' or '.'?   Since I
don't use the module, I'm not too concerned.

First of all, there are still some commands used in modules which are
renamed (SET_MASK in FvwmAnimate/FvwmForm/FvwmAuto/FvwmArrange).

Then there are some funky things with button pixmaps.. They won't show
until I've given the window focus once...

Also, the windowshade/maximize stuff seems to have been taken out (works
like that anyhow).. You can't shade a max'd window / max a shaded
window...

Ideas? (Everything above worked with snapshot as of 48h ago)

Hmm...Reading documentation on a PalmPilot.  Whats that like?

If you send a URL, someone here might be willing to link the Fvwm

	Now I'm thoroughly befused and confuddled. (It's frustrating not being
able to track CVS directly during the day; I can't get to it till I get
home in the evening.)

	Is the code in the same state as it was night before last (EST), just
before you sent us your "horrible kludge" patch to try, or is it even
further behind? After I applied your patch, it all seemed to work fine.
However, I haven't seen a commit for it come through. I've assumed you
were trying to work out a more elegant solution.

	The latest that I've seen was from last night, which behaves as you
describe. But how does that compare with what your patch goes against?

As of some recent changes, the ".TH" line in fvwm/fvwm2.1 reads:

.TH FVWM2 2.xx "late 20th century"

It looks to me like it still needs fixing.

On my system, the man page installs into section 1, not 1x.

The phrase "late 20th century" clearly indicates that everyone
forgets to change the date after they change the page content.

I see some variation in how we do heading lines:

blue> find . -name '*.1' -exec grep '[.]TH' {} \;
.TH FvwmCommand 1x "May 11 1998"
.TH focus-link.pl 1

.TH FvwmWinList 0.4h "May 27th, 1995"
.TH XPMROOT 1.01 "13 August 1993"

I guess it should really be:

.TH fvwm2 1 "03 March 1999"

On the other hand,  this "man page" stuff is  boring.  We already have
the "html",  why not move  it into the  source tree and remove the man
pages?

I think its pretty common for larger programs to not rely on man pages.

Lots of things fvwm2 does really need pictures.

This little bugger slipped in from Dom ... without it, windowshading and
maximize are friends again. Will zap it..

I am .. but the problem is that there is a little code snippet in
SetupFrame that always should execute, except once before unshading a
shaded window... Pretty specific...

I see 3 solutions...
1) Use a global variable (my patch I sent.. kludge.. ugly)
2) Make another arg to SetupFrame (it's called from 27 places right now,
   will be a tad specific)
3) Copy the code to another func, specialized for the shading ..
   (adds code and can bring stuff out of sync if you change one but not
    the other..)

Neither of those solutions are optimal... Or should I stuff some
variable into the window bitfields?
if (tmp_win->flags & CURRENTLY_UNSHADING)  ....

I just committed a new version. Hopefully it's better. It
should also make the ideas of fvwm and the pager about the stacking
order more similar...please have a look at that, too, when you
go confusing your wm. I also hope to have fixed the bug report
about the pager ignoring stacking order changes when clients
raise their own windows.

One more thing to test (I think Dan reported these):
* I have added a definition for XUrgencyHint to events.c in
  case it isn't defined by the X headers.
* I tried to add a check for SM to configure.in; the
  --disable-session is gone.

OK, I didn't add FvwmEval. This functionality doesn't need a module
anyway. I turned it into a small utility xselection which prints
the content of the X selection to stdout. Use it with PipeRead.

I would strongly object to the removal of the man pages.  I always have a
terminal up, but I don't always have Netscape running, and I like less much
more than lynx as a pager.

If the primary documentation ends up being the html docs, fine; I can live
with that.  But I'll try to keep the man pages up to date with them, and
keep them in the distribution.

> I think its pretty common for larger programs to not rely on man pages.

Can you give examples?  Emacs and Vim are the only two programs I use which
rely more on online help than on man pages (and even so, there are minimal
ones).  In both cases, however, there are either hundreds or thousands of
configuration options and  packages, and both support a configuration
language.

Even perl and zsh, which have the largest sets of documentation I know of,
still have manpages.  With their volume, they're split into pieces, but
they're still quite manageable.  And neither program comes with any *other*
documentation (unless you consider the camel book).

Fvwm's manpage is half the size of all the zsh documentation, and I find it
to be extremely readable.

> Lots of things fvwm2 does really need pictures.

Probably so, but if I want to spend ten seconds checking the syntax of an
fvwm command, the man pages are much more suitable.

Well, Emacs doesn't (generally) have them, and it has more documentation
than Perl and Zsh combined.

One interesting about all three, though, is that nobody actually writes
manpages or HTML or Info pages for any of them.  They all instead use some
markup language.  Perl uses POD, Zsh uses YODL and Emacs uses TeXinfo.  It
seems to me that if we have some basic wish to have documentation in
multiple formats then some form of markup is preferable to keeping multiple
versions synchronized.

DD> And neither program comes with any *other* documentation (unless you

Well, Perl doesn't come with any manpages at all; it creates them at
install time and can also create HTML, PostScript and PDF versions.  Zsh is
a different story because most folks don't have YODL to convert things.
But there are HTML and Info pages for Zsh; you can build them yourself if
you have the tools.

I'm not sure if the FVWM documentation is now so unmanageable that some
solution is called for, but it might be nice to have a documentation
champion.

Seems to work just fine now, except for one thing...

DefaultLayers 4 4
Style "*" Layer 4
Style "SomeStyle" Handles

This makes SomeStyle end up in Layer 0, not in Layer 4 as one might
think...

Guess the first  thing  that comes to  mind is  emacs.  Next would  be
"cc", at  least in the sense that  "man cc" does not  tell you  how to
write C programs.

I've seen POD and TeXinfo.  Anyone  know a meta-language for man pages
and html  that allows the  html  to include images, and  possibly some
animations?

I agree its not unmanageable, I still think its boring.  I don't think
I know  what you have  in mind for the  "documentation champion".  I'm
not sure I want to know.

With the latest CVS, configure detects my lack of Session Management,

POD has =for, =begin and =end sections where you can include raw output for
that target.  See 'man perlpod'.

Writing docs is always boring.  I have someone helping me with docs for
Majordomo2; so far, several hundred pages of it.  Just reading it through
all the way is killing me.  He works as a translator; I write
programmer-speak and he pokes at the software and figures out what on Earth
I'm saying.  (The problem is that he knows programmer-speak too well
himself, so the end result still isn't always suitable for end users.)

DE> I don't think I know what you have in mind for the "documentation

Someone who wants to read it all and make sure it's "good stuff".  You know
that kind of person.  The kind that reads the manual first.  The kind we
call "anal".  The kind that the end users will laud as a hero, because
without that person they'll have to read the source.

This is not for eternity. Simply removing a command without
any comment in the manpage is bad practice. As long as the
commands work there should be something in the manpage. So, 
If you for example look through your .fvwm2rc and want to know
what exactly IconPath/PixmapPath do you won't even find it in
the manpage.

What else can it be than 'a comprehensive document'? We have no
other documentation so we shouldn't make it less detailed.

Right. But instead of making the manpage smaller I'd suggest to split
it into several parts (like the zsh manpage).

Yes, I've seen that, but I don't assume everybody looks at the
output.

That will do you no good if you specifically look for 'IconPath'. You
won't find it.

But you assume that everybody knows how to do a string search in a manpage.
I know lots of people who never thought that this was possible at all.

Maximize, WindowShade and Stick. I hate writing manpage :)

I disagree. Removing the conflict markers from the ChangeLog is no
work at all. If I had to cut-and-paste the text into the ChangeLog
it will be considerably more work.

A patch for the manpage would be nice too.

Where did you check this? Fvwm can never have GPL unless we rewrite
it completely (and most of the modules). We have licenses that allow
more than GPL (most files), less than GPL (some of the modules that only
had a copyright statement), exactly GPL (like FvwmAnimate) and so on :(
Don't look at the COPYING file. It only lists the most basic permissions
that all files and modules have in common.

OK, reading the old thread again I see that I misinterpreted your
suggestion, Dan. I'm quite aware that this will force people to update
the modules that are not distributed with fvwm itself. Well, if it's
this bad for some people I will remove the change although I still
think we should do it. Now something for the CVS experts: how can I
remove just the changes I committed when the files have already been
modified by someone else?

	In a word:  convenient.  Especially when you are trying to learn
it. It makes it easy to read the FVWM docs while you are just waiting,
say, at the bank or whatever during the day...  Awfully convenient when
you just want to look something up.  don't have to search around, or even
have net access... just turn on your palm pilot.  I've got html
references, php3 references, fvwm module guide, and a few others on my
palm-pilot.  I find it immensely useful.

	I've put up a web-area for my fvwm-related stuff:

	Feel free to link to it there.

I added a link on our links page.  I've committed it to our CVS source
tree, it may take some time to show up on our pages.

The slow startup problems seem to be gone.

Now fvwm2 can't find my icons.

I had xpms in my PixmapPath, and xbms in my IconPath.  My guess is that
the new command just sets the path instead of adding to it.
The actual effect of the 2 old commands is a little different than
just setting the path.

I think the right command may be  "AddToImagePath". (Always add to the
front, and remove duplicates from the back.)

I know some time ago we were talking about logos.  

I was playing with one for the fvwm site I was going to put up... and
wanted to offer it up for the fvwm project, if you guys like it. If not,
I'll just use it for my page.

http://www.oneway.com/fvwm/  

It's the logo at the top of the page.

Submission from: (NULL) (203.85.226.249)


Hi, I just downloaded fvwm-2.2 on a Redhat 5.2 box running linux2.0.36
I did a configure --prefix=/usr/local/site/fvwm2
make
make install

When I check in /usr/local/site/fvwm2
I see only 3 dirs
bin,libexec,man

I can't see a etc directory.

I went into sample.fvwmrc directory in the src and did a make install
there
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.2/sample.fvwmrc'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'.
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.2/sample.fvwmrc'

Am using gmake 3.77

I am trying to get FVWM2 to look like WindowMaker. I can duplication the
color schemes, but have thus far been unable to duplicate the "Look" of
the Title Bar. I am also trying to figure out how to use Control-Tab to
rotate (autocirculate) through the  windows on the screen and have the
window on top automatically receive focus without having to click in/on
it with the mouse. Can someone help here ?

What will happen to the original file then? A patch created with

  # diff -u some_file.orig some_file

will create some_file.orig when applied which is *very* useful for
me. I don't create a copy of my source tree before applying every
single patch.

OK, then we don't adhere to the standard practice. Anyway, for me
as a developer it's quite cumbersome to fiddle with version numbers.
This way I have to look at the parts of the patch to find out where
and with which options I have to apply it.

Well, this is correct if you want to publish them as 'unofficial
patches', but if you want them in CVS this would prevent them from
ever being committed. The CVS tree is always changing so the chance
that your patch is against the current CVS source is close to zero.

Will never be done most certainly. You could create an enhancement
request in Jitterbug to document this issue.

Maybe one day, but there are no plans to do it right now.

Yes.  Combine the two paths into one ImagePath command.

Submission from: (NULL) (134.153.1.13)


Hello,

I am having trouble with FvwmForm. When I enter the site
http://www.fvwm.org/
in the input field from the following snippet, six netscape
windows pop up instead of one. All show the following as the
"Location:". Most of the "Location:"s are inexistent. These
locations are, in order:

file:/root/18
file:/root/4
file:/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc
file:/root/0
file:/root/8
http://www.fvwm.org/

The same happens with any URL I enter at the input field.
Plus, hitting RETURN at the input field doesn't seem to work.

Is this a bug or is there something wrong with my code?

Module FvwmForm BrowserForm
*BrowserFormPosition 61 332
*BrowserFormLine expand
*BrowserFormText "Website to browse: "
*BrowserFormLine expand
*BrowserFormInput website 31
*BrowserFormButton quit "GO" RETURN
*BrowserFormCommand /usr/bin/netscape $(website)

That's fine.  You can always re-release using a less-restrictive
license.  It's perfectly OK to write GPL'd code that depends on X, for
example, because X's license is a strict subset (or superset, depending
on your point of view, I guess :) of the terms of the GPL.

  dv> less than GPL (some of the modules that only had a copyright

Eh?  If that's true, we have no permissions to redistribute them at all;
without a license we have only basic copyright, which doesn't allow any
duplication or distribution.

If the authors can't be reached for clarification, then either we must
remove these immediately, or we have to assume that in the absence of
any statement to the contrary they are distributed under the same terms
as basic fvwm itself.

  dv> exactly GPL (like FvwmAnimate) and so on :( Don't look at the

Hm.  I'm not sure how you mean that.  If you mean that the permissions
listed in COPYING are truly basic across all the modules, and that none
of the modules deny any of the permissions listed in COPYING, then
that's fine; as I've said all of those look as liberal as the GPL or
more so to me (and I've spent a lot of years in and around
gnu.misc.dicuss, "discussing" these kinds of licensing issues :).

If you mean that some of the modules place _more_ restrictions on
redistribution than is listed in COPYING, then I think that's a bad
thing and we should rectify that.  The entire distribution can only be
distributed in a manner consistent with its most restrictive license,
and we should make clear in COPYING what that is.

If some of the modules have a more restrictive licenses we should
seriously consider removing them from the fvwm dist and perhaps
releasing them separately.

??? I think you're confusing patches with CVS merges.  Certainly CVS
merges, which provide the conflict markers, aren't too much trouble--and
if you forget it someone can go back and fix it up.

But if a patch can't be applied you don't get conflict markers, you get
a foo.rej file and you have to hand-apply the patch, removing the patch
tokens, etc.  This is a pain in the rear.

A simple swipe with mouse-1, then a single click with mouse-2 in the
ChangeLog is all that's necessary to cut-and-paste; I'm not sure how
that could be considerably more work than anything, much less merging
.rej files :)--I've very often accidentally put them in the wrong place,
or left in some of the "+" or "-" tokens, or even forgotten to merge
some rejected parts.

  dv> A patch for the manpage would be nice too.

Definitely, for any change that requires user documentation.

patch, when run with the option -b will create the .orig files.
Without this option, it will probably only create the .orig if the
patch failed.  A multiple-patch file like the one which I created will
then create .orig files for each patched file.

Maybe I'll just give the required command at the top of the email next
time to make people's lives easier.  No problem!

Absolutely, but the fact that they say that they are patches against
2.2 will stop people wondering why they don't work properly with the
latest CVS version ;-)

Also, I just checked up and one could pipe my original email into the
command:

  patch -b -d <root of FVWM source tree> -p1
or
  patch --backup --directory <root of FVWM source tree> --strip=1

which would have patched everything.  Cool, eh?  We love Larry Wall!!

   Julian

P.S.  One last thought: is there any intention to release patched
versions of 2.2 as bugs are found and ironed out?

Maybe I'll just give the required command at the top of the email next
time to make people's lives easier.  No problem!

Absolutely, but the fact that they say that they are patches against
2.2 will stop people wondering why they don't work properly with the
latest CVS version ;-)

Also, I just checked up and one could pipe my original email into the
command:

  patch -b -d <root of FVWM source tree> -p1
or
  patch --backup --directory <root of FVWM source tree> --strip=1

which would have patched everything.  Cool, eh?  We love Larry Wall!!

P.S.  One last thought: is there any intention to release patched
versions of 2.2 as bugs are found and ironed out?

People have been making very selected bugfixes to the current 2.2.1
branch; I assume at some point we'll release that version.

OK. I assume this comes under the other Changelog entry and doesn't need
its own (I should have done it then, but I feared I'd need to learn a
bunch of obsolete troff commands.)

I think we really need a way to tell interactive commands
to simply fail if the window they were issued for has
disappeared. Two solutions come to mind here:

1) Always fail if the window id does not exist (i.e.
   DeferExecution never calls back). Only ask the user
   for a window if no specific window was requested.

2) Write a 'Silent' command that can be used as a prefix
   in a command line:

     Silent Move 0 0

   Would move a window to 0 0 but fail without asking for
   another window if the window has been killed.

Bye

You should have a look at the X error output. The syntax you use
is not quite correct. But this has nothing to do with your bindings.

After a bit of debugging I found out that FvwmButtons
hangs in FvwmButtons.c (My_XNextEvent) in this line:

  if (select(fd_width,SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &in_fdset, 0, 0, NULL) > 0)

What is select waiting for here? Some input from fvwm itself?
I noticed that the binding itself works if you click on the
topmost row of pixels (it's a bit hard to aim). This looks as
if fvwm had put an input only window over the application that
eats up all button presses. The parent window isn't supposed to
do this, right? Or does FvwmButtons not know about the parent
window?

Any ideas?

Bye

Dominik

You're right, of course.

I still find it easier if I have it in the proper format already. Saves
me the effort of reformatting everything.

OK, I always use '#' since the '>' prompt I use is a bit irritating

Hmm, I never assume patches are against the current CVS source. Usually
I try to apply them and if it fails I check if it's easy to fix. If not
I just ask the submitter to update the patch (very rarely).

Yes that's a really nice feature of patch. So you can archive the patch
and its description in one file :)

No, we can't since we're not the copyright holders and the
licenses sometimed do explicitly state that we can't do it.

I worked hard to get permission to distribute the stuff for all our
files. Unfortunately this doesn't include the permission to modify
the files (except for us).

Then we'll probably have to remove fvwmperl, fvwmpython, FvwmRearrange
and FvwmPipe. I've talked to the authors and most of them do
not like the idea of relicensing their software.

No, really, look at the modules mentioned above. They are much more
strict than GPL.

No.

Why not? Good idea.

Submission from: (NULL) (195.165.9.128)


I don't know if this is a bug or a feature..

I use gnome and fvwm 2.2.. anyhow the problem is that gnome has that panel
which pops up
everytime you move your mouse over it, which is fine and works well but
when I have
Style "*" ClickToFocus
in my .fvwm2rc file, it doesn't move anything over that panel when I click
on any window.
(It does otherwise work fine allthought, between normal windows)

However, clicking on WinList works perfectly, raising everything over the
panel, 
as I have
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1,Focus,Raise
in .fvwm2rc ..

* fvwm/resize.c, fvwm/move.c, fvwm/virtual.c: Removed some extra ;'s
which belongs in a prototype, not the actual function declaration.
* fvwm/virtual.c (changeWindowsDesk): s/t/tmp_win/ .. since that's
what the function gets as argument.

Any autoconf gurus around?

Problem:
The readline check looks for -lreadline and readline/readline.h
  Fine with me, I get those from gdb (4.16).
extras/FvwmConsole/getline.c uses readline/history.h as well
  Not fine, don't have it.

Thus fvwm thinks I have a full setup of readline, but then the compile
fails because I don't have history.h

Solution:
Check for both readline/readline.h and readline/history.h

Another problem:
I don't know how do fix it 8)

Hello,

It would be nice if it were possible to use
parametrized functions in the .fvwm2rc file.

I think the fact that lines in Fvwm2 can be continued with
backslashes at the end of the lineis an undocumented feature
of Fvwm2 worth mentioning in the fvwm2 man page.

When installing using 'make install ...' at the
.../src/fvwm-2.2 level, the icons do not get installed.

And when chdir to .../src/fvwm-2.2/icons I get:

[529][06:55:22][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/src/fvwm-2.2/icons
$ make install prefix=/gppr/local/stow/fvwm-2.2
make[1]: Entering directory
`/gqs/work8/dontdelete/EKXRAN/src/fvwm-2.2/icons'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'.
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/gqs/work8/dontdelete/EKXRAN/src/fvwm-2.2/icons'

So basically it does nothing and I have to install the icons
manually;

Any ideas are greatly appreciated

TIA,

Rob -

Right--that's what I'm saying.  The ChangeLog will never apply cleanly
and always results in a .rej file in diff format--which isn't the proper
format.  That's why it's usual to provide the ChangeLog in "cleartext"
rather than as part of the diff--then it's in the proper format and
ready for inserting directly into the ChangeLog.

Whatever.

Hm.  Well, I personally am all for the right tool for the job--and
regardless of the power and flexibility of your shell, there are some
things that can be done more easily in other ways :).

This means that fvwm, as a whole, isn'g even OpenSource and cannot be
distributed with, say, Debian Linux distributions.

This is very bad.  These modules (IMO) _MUST_ be removed from the dist
if their licenses cannot be made Open Source-compatible.

You're right.  The licenses for these modules as written clearly violate
at least Clause 3 of the Open Source guidelines.

I vote we check with these authors again, and if we can't get some
license which is OpenSource-compatible then we immediately release a
2.2.1 with these modules removed.

We can make them a separate dist, if we like.

I note that Barry Warsaw owns the copyright to fvwmpython; I find it
very hard to believe he, at least, wouldn't agree to some kind of OS
license.

Well, the modules concerned are not this important. I have no objections
against splitting them off.

Well, that would be correct if my wrist wouldn't hurt whenever I touch

No problem. To activate new style setting you have to do a

You can call functions with up to ten parameters. Within the

In the midst of rebuilding FVWMBorders I've started to have thoughts
about the GSFR.

There seems to be a bit of confusion between the appearance style flags
and decors.  What's the group feeling about making Decors mandatory and
moving the appearance style stuff to decors?

What I mean to move is:

BorderWidth, HandleWidth, NoTitle/Title, Nohandles/Handles, Color,
ForeColor, BackColor, MWMButtons/FvwmButtons, MWMBorder/FvwmBorder,
MWMDecor/NoDecorHint, NoButton/Button, 

and to leave:

NoIcon/Icon, MiniIcon, IconBox, IconGrid, IconFill,
WindowListSkip/WindowListHit, CirculateSkip/CirculateHit, Layer,
StaysOnTop/StaysPut, Sticky/Slippery, StartIconic/StartNormal,
StartsOnDesk/StartsOnPage/StartsAnyWhere, IconTitle/NoIconTitle,
MWMFunctions/NoFuncHint, OLDecor/NoOLDecor, HintOverride/NoOverride,
StickyIcon/SlipperyIcon, SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement,
RandomPlacement/ActivePlacement, DecorateTransient/NakedTransient,
SkipMapping/ShowMapping, UseDecor, UseStyle, NoPPosition/UsePPosition,
Lenience/NoLenience,
ClickToFocus/SloppyFocus/MouseFocus|FocusFollowsMouse.

My motivation for this is that Decors can change a lot of the visual
appearance of windows without a Recapture, but not quite everything.
Doing this move would make the look be controlled by decors and the
behaviour controlled by the Style command.  It might also make things
more consistent if the ButtonStyle, TitleStyle, BorderStyle,
HilightColor and WindowFont only worked as part of AddToDecor rather
than as standalone commands (as well as part of AddToDecor).

I realize this would break existing fvwmrc scripts, but it would make
understanding how to configure the look easier.

A smaller change would be to make the BorderWidth, HandleWidth,
NoTitle/Title, Nohandles/Handles, Color, ForeColor, BackColor,
MWMButtons/FvwmButtons, MWMBorder/FvwmBorder, MWMDecor/NoDecorHint,
NoButton/Button parts of style into standalone commands like
Button/Title/Borderstyle.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Tim.

I know you can use pixmaps in FvwmButtons, but IMHO it would be nicer
(and more consistent with the other parts) if it would also be
possible to {V,H,B,D}Gradient buttons in FvwmButtons.

Anyone who has some time and knowledge to do this?

If the config file breakage can't be easily repaired with greps/seds,
(invisible to the users I support), I'm against it.

Can't these things exist as both styles and decors?

I didn't look to closelly at your patch but this will get the xselection

This should follow the form definition.  I assume it did.

Preceed the form definition with:

DestroyModuleConfig BrowserForm*

I'm guessing that this my be why you had multiple copies of Netscape
appear, but I'm guessing.

> *BrowserFormPosition 61 332
> *BrowserFormLine expand
> *BrowserFormText "Website to browse: "
> *BrowserFormLine expand
> *BrowserFormInput website 31

Despite what the man page says, replace "RETURN" with "^M"
(2 characters).

With the "DestroyModuleConfig" and "RETURN" changed, the
form worked OK for me.

I'll leave the problem report opened at least until the "RETURN"
problem is dealt with.

Unfortunately, this is not a good approach to grabbing the selection. Use
of CUT_BUFFER0 is deprecated (at least that is what somebody else
told me), and is currently supported for "backwards compatability"
in some applications like xterm (the most common place).  The above
"xprop" trick does not work for Motif apps like Netscape, Z-Mail, zwgc,
etc. I've hacked together a small C program (`xgetprisel') that gets the
primary X selection (used in Motif apps, xterm, etc.), and if that isn't
set, falls back to CUT_BUFFER0. Maybe this is what FvwmEval does as well;
I haven't looked too closely myself. :-)

One interesting difference between the "Primary Selection" (preferred)
and CUT_BUFFER0 is that once a selection in an app that uses the
"Primary Selection" method is de-selected, it is no longer available
for pasting (try in with Netscape. Hilight something, paste it into an
xterm. Now de-select it and try pasting it into an xterm -- you should
get the last thing you selected in an xterm; I do anyway.) This is in
contrast to the CUT_BUFFER0 approach, where even after you have de-selected
the text, you can still paste it.

As I said, xterm uses both the Primary Selection and CUT_BUFFER0, so it is
not really a good "general" test case, even though it is very prevalent.

I don't know if my home system and work system are producing different
results, but with this mornings CVS,
FvwmBanner appears long after I start fvwm2.  (Everything else seems
happy.)

This is on my error log:

[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<ERROR>> Some command line modules have not quit,
 Starting up after timeout.

Almost. It turns out that xprop converts newlines in string properties
in "\n". I just couldn't come up with a sed command that would replace
"\n" with a newline. sed -e 'y/\\n/\
/' complains about "strings for y command are different lengths",
and sed -e 'y/\\n/  \
/' replaces all occurrances of "n" by two spaces and a newline!
sed -e 's/\(.*\)\\n\(.*\)/\1\
\2/g' replaces only one occurrance of "\n" by a newline.

An ugly solution is:

PipeRead "echo -e `xprop -root CUT_BUFFER0 | sed \'s/^.*=..\\(.*\\).$/\\1/\'`"

ie feeding the output of the sed command through echo -e to convert
"\n" to newlines.

I tried to achieve something like that; but to be honest, I just copied
the code for getting the contents of the selection/cut buffer from
FvwmTalk, so I cannot really say if it gets it right with the primary 
selection.

Perhaps you could look a bit closer and tell me how to correct it if
it is broken (or just donate `xgetprisel').

   ^ eeeek! 8)

No, it's fixed... the only bug I know of right now (except for my
shading stuff I haven't checked in yet 8( ) is that the pixmaps in
titlebar buttons aren't drawn until the window gets activated...

Also.. it goes away if you move a window above it...

Taking a quick look at FvwmTalk.c, I see this:

/* No primary selection so use the cut buffer. */

So it looks like FvwmTalk is trying to "do the right thing". I'll attach
the source to my `xgetprisel' program that prints the output of the
current selection to stdout in case it is of use to somebody. I have
a context-sensitive selection parser written in Perl (called "Magic"
:-) that uses this tool to get the current selection, analyze it, and
then "do the right thing" (and is bound to the giant "Help" key on
my Sun keyboard). For example, if the current selection starts with
"http://" or if the selection has at least two dots's in it, or if
it has one dot followed by two or three characters, it is probably a URL.
A lot of the other "Magic" stuff is specific to my job, but it is a major
time-saver to say the least... it is great to be able to select a 
URL (or double-click on something like "www.fvwm.org") smack the "Help"
key and jump to that web page!

A long time ago I suggested including a special variable in FVWM2 called
"$selection" that could be used in the rc file. Currently, my .fvwm2rc has
lines like this:

Key Help        A       N       Exec Magic 
Key Help        A       S       Exec Magic -shift 
Key Help        A       C       Exec Magic -ctrl 
Key Help        A       M       Exec Magic -meta 

it would be *great* to not require the `xgetprisel' binary, and just be
able to do something like:

Key Help        A       N       Exec Magic $selection
Key Help        A       S       Exec Magic -shift $selection
etc.

where "$selection" would contain the same thing `xgetprisel' returns...

Excerpt from my `Magic' script for anyone interested:

# For convenience, strip leading and trailing spaces

if ($#ARGV < 0) {
    for ($sel) {
    # Selection looks like a URL -- send to Netscape
        /^(https?:\/\/|ftp:\/\/).+/                             and do
            { exec "navigator -display :0.0 -remote 'openURL($sel,newWindow)' &"; };

    # Selection contains: at least two dots OR one dot followed by two or three
    # characters (a top-level domain name) and then a non-word character or the
    # end of then selection -- form URL and send to Netscape
        /^[\w-]+\.[\w-]+\.[\w-]+|^[\w-]+\.\w\w\w?(\W|$)/        and do
            { exec "navigator -display :0.0 -remote 'openURL(http://$sel,newWindow)' &"; };

FvwmButtons core dumps. I think the problem (or at least one of them)
is in MakeContainer since it appears that there is the
possibility that not all fields of the new structure are 
initialised. In particular, I am not sure that the foreground
and background colors are initialised in all cases.
I think free is being called with garbage in parsecontainer.

I am still investigating this problem.

I am using the SUN compilers.

I hope I am not doing something stupid
which is causing the problem.

Regards,
pdg

Hello,

Restart does not preserve hierarchy of windows in the sense
that after restarting, a window that was on top may well be
on the bottom or somewhere else with respect to the other
windows on the desktop.

Stacking order got a major overhaul in 2.2.  If you still have
a problem with 2.2, let us know.

I'm trying to get caught up on all the changes latelly. And here is what I'm seeing, I've built without session managment since I'm on solaris 2.5.1.

When I come up I usually get widnows with a sort of gold border when they are active but now I'm getting grey ones.  in addition when I haven't yet given a window on a page focus I don't get any title buttons and if I give it focus to get the buttons then switch pages and come back the buttons are gone again.  I'm haven't yet put any of the new commands since 2.2 into my rc save using ImagePath for my icons/pixmaps.

I do use M4 so I tried a recapture, in case the new startup logic was a problem but no luck there is this a problem or do I need to do something else in my rc file.

Sorry must have missed that thread I thought the look was being
reworkerd I didn't think we had broken the title buttons and color
scheme as well.  But no problem I'll wait on that.

The FvwmSave manpage talks about NoClutter, not FvwmSave!!  And in
fact, there seem to be several references to FvwmClean (which was
perhaps the new name for FvwmNoClutter?) in the sample system.fvwm2rc
files, even though there does not appear to exist a module by the name
of FvwmClean.  What's going on?

Anybody out there willing to take a look at these?

Is this patch needed? The 'Replace' function should be renamed
if it is committed.

I've no opinion on this one. Tim, I think you did look at this
patch. Should it be committed (with the change that the border
width is not limited)?

Rejected. Didn't apply to 2.3.x, 2.2.x and 2.1.4, so I gave up.
Doesn't seem so useful anyway.

I have this line in my .fvwm2rc (truncated):

 + "I" PipeRead '... | sed -e "s/\.bg\..*$//" ...'
                                         ^^^^

I'm usin FvwmCpp to preprocess my config file. This
used to work fine (I think 2.2 was still ok), but with
the current CVS source FvwmCpp treats the '//' as a
comment. What has happened here? This is not good at
all since it breaks existing config files and may give
users a very hard time. When and why was this changed?
If this important to have it has to be documented!!

Bye

Dominik

Works on my system. If you have a coredump, could you please fetch us a
stack trace like this:

  # gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

Sorry, my fault. Sometimes I wonder why those file don't get compiled

Tim, I haven't seen anybody mention it: the shades
I had around my title bar buttons and the title itself
were 1 pixel thick before your changes but are now 2
pixels thick (which I find rather ugly). Is this going
to revert back to the old look?

Well, I asked him and he didn't like the idea of using GPL. He told
me he was working on some kind of new license and that he'd contact me
when it was ready. Seems he has forgotten me.

I've fixed a coredump in FvwmButtons today that may be the thing you saw.
Could you check again with the current source?

There are lots of files in the extras/ tree which refer to .fvwmrc.  I
think that we would do well to have a good clean-up of the
documentation.  I am willing to help do this if this is wanted.

Well, it certainly doesn't have to be GPL: we don't need to require that.
Any Open Source license is fine w/ me.  Best would be something that is
GPL-compatible (modified BSD/X license, or the basic FVWM license) or
even a dual-license such as Perl is released under.

Do you want to re-contact these folks?

  That wasn't supposed to go to the list (yet).  AARGH...

  It remembers positions on your virtual desktops so you can hotkey back to
them, etc.  It's not ready for prime time, and that message didn't contain
a bunch of stuff that you'd need to compile and run it.  I should have
something ready to announce in a few weeks; if anyone is too impatient, let
me know.

Yes, I'm trying to make it exactly like it was before.

Hey Dominik, did you break $0 in functions?

I've got a function:

DestroyFunc my_start
AddToFunc my_start I Echo my_start,$0
+ I Restart $0

What I get in the log file is 
[FVWM][Echo]:  my_start,my_start
[FVWM][Echo]:  ExitFunction
[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'my_start' failed!!!! (restarting
'fvwm2' instead)

Cheers,
Tim.

That is indeed ugly as not all versions of echo support -e.
Here is a solution for sed, wrapped up in an example.

#!/bin/sh
s='abc\\ndef\\nghi'

echo $s | od -c

echo $s | sed 's/\\n/\
/g' | od -c

This results in

0000000    a   b   c   \   n   d   e   f   \   n   g   h   i  \n
0000016
0000000    a   b   c  \n   d   e   f  \n   g   h   i  \n
0000014

Unfortonately not all versions of sed support quoting a newline like
this either. Sometimes (e.g. on my HP-UX) you have to say

  sed 's/\\n/\n/g'

If you know him better I would prefer if you would contact Barry and

Oh dear.  That syntax is no good for my versions of sed.  The
following might be more portable, as well as uglier.  Yes that is a
literal BEL (hex 07) in the sed argument.

#!/bin/sh
s='abc\\ndef\\nghi'

echo $s | od -c

echo $s | sed 's/\\n//g' | tr '\007' '\012' | od -c

0000000    a   b   c   \   n   d   e   f   \   n   g   h   i  \n
0000016
0000000    a   b   c  \n   d   e   f  \n   g   h   i  \n
0000014

The sed argument in hex is 73 2f 5c 5c 6e 2f 07 2f 67.
The tr arguments in hex are 5c 30 30 37 and 5c 30 31 32.


I rather suspect that the bottom line is that a portable shell script
would be too complex.

A little question: if someone commits to the 2.2 branch of the CVS
tree, would the CVS log message to the workers list show this?  The
reason that I ask is that some of the commits seem to be correcting
stuff in 2.2, and if they're only being applied to the 2.3 track,
well, there's never going to be any chance of releasing a 2.2.1
version, is there?  8-)

There are no plans to put non-critical fixes into the 2.2.x branch.
To be honest I was a bit surprised that the branch was created in 
the first place since I do not think there are any fixes in there
(correct?).

I have committed some changes to the 2.2 branch, and the "FVWM CVS"
message on the list was like this:


CVSROOT:	/home/cvs/fvwm
Module name:	fvwm
Changes by:	clasen	99/02/28 12:49:21

Modified files:
	modules/FvwmEvent: Tag: branch-2_2 Makefile.am ChangeLog 
	libs           : Tag: branch-2_2 ModParse.c 
	fvwm           : Tag: branch-2_2 move.c builtins.c 
	.              : Tag: branch-2_2 ChangeLog 

Log message:
Fixes for bugs in GetArgument, InteractiveMove and WindowShade functions.
Make FvwmEvent use the functions from libs/ModParse.c rather than its
own.


Thus, the "Tag: branch-2_2" indicates that the commit went to the branch
instead of the main trunk.

Actually, there have been a few serious, minor bugs (core dumps 'n
stuff) checked into the 2.2.1 branch.  We probably haven't been
super-vigilant in thinking about what changes to 2.3.x belong also in
2.2.x.

Besides that, the NEWS file doesn't reflect any 2.2 activity.

Since we plan to have a much shorter release cycle now this isn't
very important. In my eyes only fixes for bugs that completely
break fvwm should go in the branch.

That might be appropriate: if no new features are added on the 2.2
branch there shouldn't be any NEWS entries.

It might be useful to note that we have not been distributing fvwmperl nor
fvwmpython since back in October or November.  [Nobody has missed them so
far, it appears.]  They are still in the CVS tree only because of sloth &
inertia.

Moreover, FvwmPerl's functionality is contained in FvwmCommand.  In my
recent proposal to promote "extras" to "modules", there was no
disagreement to the idea of dropping it.

I intend to soon move the extras over to modules, and these three would be
dropped in the process.  That leaves only FvwmRearrange to deal with.

I think you are correct, however, we do have to know whats in 2.2.x.
What else would cause us to release it?

Yes, yes, it is wanted!

But you needn't bother with all the extras.  A few will be dropped during
the move to modules:

* Drop FvwmConfig because the author's documentation says it is
  "braindead" and he "discourages its use".

* Drop FvwmGoodStuff: obsoleted by FvwmButtons.

* Drop FvwmPipe: similar functionality is obtained using FvwmCommand.

Well, typically that's what's used.  NEWS files for releases with no new
features say something like "Bug fixes." and leave it at that; the
ChangeLog contains the details.

I'm not adverse to having some other way of describing bugs fixed... I
just don't want to see everyone have to write 2 pages of information in
7 different files for each 3-line bug fix :).

Another option would be to leave it as-is, and have the person who
writes the 2.2.1 ANNOUNCE go through the ChangeLog and generate some
bugfix bullet items to go in the announcement.

Someone said they sent off an announce to c.o.l.a and
comp.windows.x.announce, but you're right I never saw anything show up
either.

As people start using GNOME 1.0, I'm seeing and hearing lots of
grumbling about the current state of GNOME-aware WM's.  There is
far-reaching dislike for Enlightenment.

Do we have any news on the GNOME patches for fvwm?  It's looking more
and more like we (fvwm) could really be a hit if we provided a
reasonable alternative to the other GNOME window managers in a timely
manner...

I see the fvwm-2.2 GNOME aware version on Jay's web site:

  http://www.serv.net/~jpaint/download/fvwm-gnome-2.2.tar.gz

What's the status of this?  Should we be looking at it for merging with
2.3.x, or is more work needed on it first?

Of course, some people are looking for graphical configuration of WM
features, too, which we don't have (much) yet.  But, first things first
:)

And if it is, then I can try to answer any questions about it. To refresh
the memory of anyone who is interested, the large FvwmScript sample I sent
is an "xterm customization tool". It opens a "dialog box" (for lack of a
better term) with a bunch of predefined colors the user can click on to
select foreground/background colors (along with R/G/B sliders to select a
color not listed). It has buttons to select from 5 or 6 "good" xterm fonts,
and text boxes to put in a window title, etc. It will also optionally save
the selected xterm configuration to a file as a menu in .fvwm2rc-sourceable
format. The nice thing about windows opened this way is that "FvwmSaveDesk"
correctly saves all of the xterm settings for each window since they are
specified on the command line.

Anyway, if anybody has any questions about it, just let me know. A lot of
people at my company find it useful, so I thought I would offer it as an
"advanced" example of "FvwmScript" that could be included (possibly) in the
sample .fvwm2rc.

This confuses me.  Isn't Rearrange a relatively new module?  (cvsweb says
it went in four months ago.)  How on earth did it we let it into the tree
with a copyright like the one it has?  We don't even have permission to
modify it.

Andrew Veliath is a list member; perhaps he'll comment.

I did anounce it to both and I saw it show up in x.announce but I'm not subscribed to c.o.l.a but if it showed up in one and it didn't get spit back I assumed it showed up in both.

I'm glad I'm not the only one that wants to argue this point.  Perhaps
fortunately for us, GNOME was released on somewhat of an unfinished state,
so we have a bit more time.  But I think that if we don't make the RedHat 6
cutoff date (whenever that is) then we essentially concede to icewm or qvwm
or one of the other small WMs, even though they aren't finished.  (Which
never made much sense to me, but that's the way it seems to be.)

I wonder if someone couldn't take FvwmForm, convert it to GTK and turn it
into a control panel applet somehow.  Then it just comes down to writing
all of the forms.

FvwmRearrange is the combination of two other modules (FvwmCascade and
something else); I assume that when Dominik merged them into one new
module he had to keep the original license.

Hello,

Congratulations for fixing the problem from fvwm 2.0.46 concerning
preservation of
stacking order of xterms upon restart.

The problem now persists with the FvwmButtons module, which when on the
bottom, ends
up on top upon restart rather than in its original position.

I have not checked this behavior with other modules yet eg. FvwmPager
(which is
itself swallowed by a button on my desktop), FvwmForm, FvwmCommand, and
others.

Overall, fvwm2 seems to be speedier. It installed on my Red Hat 5.2
cleanly.
Good job!!!

My apoligies it seems my problem with cvs is not with the border stuff but with the new start up logic I use M4 to create my decors for me and it is taking to long I suppose.  All my windows are missing out on the decors,  a recapture doesn't seem to help I need to actually go through and in FvwmConsole and read the decor reisue the style lines then do a recapture for it to work.  Is this really right or didi I miss something in that slow startup thread?

Right, but the original license does not permit changing even one character
in the file.  If Dominik did the merging, then he violated the license to
do it.

Using cvsweb I can see the original copyright for FvwmCascade:

/*************************************************************************
 * FvwmCascade.c -- fvwm module to cascade windows
 *
 * See man page for usage.
 *
 * Written by Andrew Veliath
 * Copyright 1996
 * 
 * $Id: FvwmCascade.c,v 1.3 1998/11/06 02:22:59 steve Exp $
 ************************************************************************/

So we don't even have permission to distribute it.

FvwmTile has the same copyright.  It looks like not only were re not
allowed to distribute either of these modules, but we weren't allowed to
modify them in any way and the combination into FvwmRearrange was pure
copyright violation unless Andrew did it himself.

We have three choices:

Remove FvwmRearrange from the distribution entirely.
Reimplement FvwmRearrange from scratch with a new license (this is shaky)
Get Andrew Veliath to relicense the code.

The latter is of course preferable.  I'm sure this is all a
misunderstanding and that not putting this code under an open license was
just an oversight, but it needs to be cleared up ASAP.

This happens because the modules do not survive a restart but are killed
and restarted which puts them at the top.

I think he said he contacted the author and got the current license
applied.  Of course, the _current_ license doesn't allow anyone
(including us) to change it, either, it only allows redistribution (the
old one didn't even allow that!)  Dominik said he got permissions for
the fvwm-workers to modify it, but that's definitely not reflected in
the license (and what does that mean, anyway, that anyone subscribed to
the list can modify it?  Anyone with write permissions to the CVS tree?
Weird. :)

I agree we need to do something about it ASAP.

This is to be expected, as a restart of fvwm2 will also cause the
"RestartFunction" to be executed, where you will probably find that
FvwmButtons is being (re)launched.  It is the "newest" window at this
point, which puts it on the top of the stacking order.

I don't foresee this being "fixed" since it isn't really a bug.

Perhaps something like

Style FvwmButtons StaysOnBottom

would work. At what stage is the implementation of the StaysOnBottom style
option in fvwm2? It does not show up in the man page and trying to use it
seems to cause an error in my .xsession-errors file.

[FVWM][ProcessNewStyle]: <<ERROR>> bad style command: StaysOnBottom

Thanks.

This is wrong (works for simple cases only).
It doesn't work when a selection has one of these chars: backslash, quote,
newline or equal.
Here is more correct version:

xprop -root CUT_BUFFER0 | sed 's/^CUT_BUFFER0(STRING) = "\(.*\)"$/\1/' \
 | sed 's/\\n/^G/g' | sed 's/\\\(["\\]\)/\1/g' | tr '\007' '\012'

where ^G is BEL (hex 07) (type ^V ^G in the shell).
This must work with any version of sed and with any shell.

Migo.

Hello,

Fvwm2 just feels so much better when it comes to menus... extra large menus
that
don't fit on the screen have the "More..." menu and when they are opened by
the edge
of the screen my pointer is not moved, the menu opens on the correct side,
etc...
Thank you all. What a great job!

I discovered a new potential bug in the menus which I will illustrate with
the following example:


AddToMenu Utilities "Utilities"         Title
...
+                   "Applications"      Popup Applications
...

AddToMenu Applications "Applications" Title
...
+                      "Utilities"    PopUp Utilities
...


This configuration can be useful when menus are just full of menus and
submenus
and one wants to have some repetition to make finding things a little
easier.

With this configuration, if I PopUP Utilities, then Applications, and then
try to
PopUp Utilities again from within the Applications submenu then nothing
pops up.

Hello,

Here is something I have noticed about the menus:

When I PopUp a submenu from within a menu and the menus are not cascading
menus
(ie.the menus overlap upon popup),and the popped up menu does not fit on
the bottom
of the screen, the pointer is literally moved to the top of the submenu.
Wouldn't using menus be more comfortable if instead of this happening, the
pointer
was positioned on top of the closest entry of the popped up submenu upon
popup?

And in any case it's still not an adequate license.  For inclusion into,
say, RedHat or Debian, you must allow the distribution of modified
versions.  I think there's an exception relating to distributing patches
used to generate modified versions, but that's academic.  The point is that
it really should be GPL or something freer (X, BSD with no advertising
clause, etc.)

PDS> I agree we need to do something about it ASAP.

I think that if we can't get anything worked out in a couple of days, we
must cut 2.2.1 without this module.

 JLT)  used to generate modified versions, but that's academic.  The point is that
 JLT)  it really should be GPL or something freer (X, BSD with no advertising

 PDS)  I agree we need to do something about it ASAP.

 JLT)  I think that if we can't get anything worked out in a couple of days, we
 JLT)  must cut 2.2.1 without this module.

I would change the license to whatever is needed, however I can
neither maintain nor improve my old modules code in fvwm2 without CVS
write access.  However, consider the license for FvwmRearrange to be
fully modifiable, which I would change immediately if you guys can get
me CVS access this week.  I can send you a crypted login and password
if necessary.

Actually, I find that if  you click on  the  submenu in question,  the
original menus drop down,  and then the  new menu pops  up as a  fresh
menu.

I didn't try it with another menu in between...

I like the word "feature" better than "Potential bug".

If this is documented behavior, I'm all for it.

CVS is yours for the asking, unless someone else objects.  (Andrew's done
plenty of code so I see no reason why he shouldn't have access.)  Send me a
login name and crypted password at your convenience.  Use this to crypt a
password, if you wish.

 JLT)  FvwmTile has the same copyright.  It looks like not only were re not
 JLT)  allowed to distribute either of these modules, but we weren't allowed to
 JLT)  modify them in any way and the combination into FvwmRearrange was pure
 JLT)  copyright violation unless Andrew did it himself.

Dominik had my permission to modify the license--clearly it was not
enough modification (and I'd like to correct some misspellings).  The
original license was more out of ignorance than anything--it is
already a few years later and quite a number of things have changed
since when I was involved when Chuck was around (I've also come to
realize the importance of proper license wording ;-).

by hitting it with a rock," he said, "though I am not unkind."

Check for readline/history.h, rather than readline/readline.h.  Some
packages install the latter, but not the former, but both are required
if FVWM is to use readline.

Also tell user why we are checking for readline twice (once with

This was created by merging FvwmTile and FvwmCascade recently (since
they shared lots of code). Andrew wrote these and I merged them. He
didn't object, so I think it's ok.

my GtkMenus module was a start in that direction. I'm on dialogs right now.

Well, you see I'm just a bit bemused by the whole thing.  FVWM 1.xx
had an FvwmClean module -- anyone know what happened to it?  Is there
any reason it can't be included in 2.xx?  It's not to say that it's
demanded, it's just a bit bizarre that it seems to have just
"vanished".  Anyway, if I can figure what's going on, I'll send you
some patches (personally).

No, not documented but an intentional limitation. It would require
a huge effort to change this since a single menu has only a single
window, MenuRoot structure etc. We'd need to duplicate the complete
menu and create a new window on the fly.

Subject: FVWM2 interaction with PCXware

Full_Name: Mark Paterson
Version: 2.1.7, 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Digital Unix 4.0D
X_Server: PCXWare
Submission from: (NULL) (141.205.2.73)


We are running fvwm on top of PCXWare on Windows NT. Sigh.
With fvwm 2.1.5 and earlier, fvwm windows could be raised above the native
NT
windows. With 2.1.7 and 2.2 (we think 2.1.7 and on, but this is all we have
tested),
this functionality does not work.

  c> fvwm/modules/FvwmScript/Scripts/some_nice_icons

I really think the FvwmScript directory needs some cleaning out; now
seems the perfect time to do it.

For example, I don't see why it should have its own icons directory.  If
there really are nice icons there, they should be moved into the
standard fvwm icons directory.  If they aren't nice, they should be
chucked in the bit-bucket.

Also, it appears there's both an FvwmScript/scripts _and_
FvwmScript/Scripts directory?  This is very bad; even though UNIX is
obviously case-sensitive many kinds of filesystems aren't, and I see no
reason to gratuitously break on those systems.

The FvwmScript module is far and away one of the largest in the dist,
and I'd really like to see it trimmed down if possible.

Log message:
Added note about moving extras to modules.

The repository should be stable again.  If not, flames to me.

After doing a "cvs update", you will find that a "make" fails.  This
is because the makefiles still have extras in them.  To fix this, just
do a normal "make", let it fail, then run "config.status" from the top
of the build directory.  This rebuilds the Makefiles, and "make" will
now run.

Oops, sorry, one's in FvwmComand.  Never mind about this part.

Oops, sorry, of course you had to fetch the stack trace for
FvwmButtons, not fvwm. Could you do it again, please?

This was changed to sort out the stacking order problems with restarting
and the problems with autoraise windows being raised above their menus. 
I don't think it will be possible to change this behaviour without
breaking something else.

I have a similar set-up so I can sympathize,  I gave up trying to manage
X and NT windows at the same time and switched the XServer to be full
screen.  It might be easier to work in mixed mode if there was a way to
lower NT windows, but I expect you would need a shareware app and a
reboot to get it working.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hm, my last reply didn't get through. So here it is again:
When the pointer lands on a menu item when the menu pops up
it warps the pointer out of the way to prevent that you select
something by accident. This can be turned off with

  MenuStyle * TitleWarpOff

I've implemented the new options 'PopupAsRootmenu' and
'PopupAsSubmenu' for MenuStyle. This determines if clicking
on a popup menu item just posts the menu (PopupAsSubmenu) or
closes the parent menus too (PopupAsRootmenu).

Why use three sed processes?  Either of the following should work.

xprop -root CUT_BUFFER0 | sed -e 's/^CUT_BUFFER0(STRING) = "\(.*\)"$/\1/' \
 -e 's/\\n//g' -e 's/\\\(["\\]\)/\1/g' | tr '\007' '\012'

xprop -root CUT_BUFFER0 |
  sed 's/^CUT_BUFFER0(STRING) = "\(.*\)"$/\1/;s/\\n//g;s/\\\(["\\]\)/\1/g' |
  tr '\007' '\012'

On the second, append trailing backslashes if using csh.

Hi all,
	I think I found the problem I was having with functions with args. 
I've commited a fix that works for me but I'd like you to look at it to
see if it's going to have side effects. In fvwm/functions.c
ComplexFunction2:

What this does is an extra GetNextToken before stashing the args.

Couple more tiny bits and pieces for fvwmrc_convert: this sends all
error and info messages to stderr instead of stdout, and attempts to
preserve file permissions as much as is possible.  It also avoids
replacing "Restart fvwm2" by "Restart fvmw22"!  (The stderr instead of
stdout is so that if $dest="-" then the messages don't get
intermingled with the output.)

BTW, my previous patch (to fvwmrc_convert and the FindPopup bug) could
certainly be also applied to the 2.2 branch as a bugfix (I can mail it
again to someone if necessary); this one is much more cosmetic but
could also be seen as a bugfix and similarly applied to 2.2 as well as
the 2.3 track.

This is bad, if you don't have any command line args it shouldn't be
expecting any modules to finish before doing the initial capture.  If
you turn on debug messages do you get any of the following?

[executeModule] starting commandline module
[killModule] endig command line module

Here's the code that checks for no more modules to wait for.  Its just
before select().  I'm assuming that the for loop leaves with  i ==
npipes if the break hasn't happened. Is this OK?

  /* check for termination of all startup modules */
  if (fFvwmInStartup) {
    for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
      if (FD_ISSET(i, &init_fdset))
        break;
    if (i == npipes) {
      DBUG("My_XNextEvent", "Starting up after command lines
modules\n");
      StartupStuff();
      timeoutP = NULL; /* set an infinite timeout to stop ticking */
    }
  }

Our web pages indicate that all you have to do is "autoreconf" after
a fresh download.  I get this:

If I then go on to try to configure, it fails.

I believe the "automake  --add-missing" step is still required.

With this mornings CVS, I not only get the 42 second delay,
but early on the pointer changes to a circle and seems to hang
the startup process until I move the mouse.

I assume when you asked for debug, you wanted me to start fvwm2
with -debug.  If you want all 5000 lines, I can send them.  I trimmed
out everything bug "reads" and a few other lines.  I don't see
much interesting in here:

Sorry, I still don't understand the part about waiting for modules
to terminate.  If FvwmAnimate was being started by way of the command
line, why would you expect it to terminate?

I happen to start FvwmAnimate with the command "Module FvwmAnimate" in
the  file /opt/public/src/fvwm-config/.fvwmrc.modules.  I don't add it
to the InitFunction.  I don't know if that matters.

Hmm, doesn't help much. Unless I can reproduce this somehow (which I can't)
I can do nothing. However I checked in a fix for a FvwmButtons coredump
recently into the source tree. Could you check again with the current
CVS source? I'll send you the current FvwmButtons sources in a private
email.

	It seems so.

	What I do (embedded in a small script that does the build as well) is:

automake --add-missing
autoreconf
./configure
make

	I still get the same error messages you're seeing, but things work.

The problem I'm trying to fix is that the initial capture shouldn't
happen until all the configuration commands have been read.  If the
initial capture happens too early the window decorations and styles may
be wrong and require before they look and act right. This has been a
long running problem with the RedHat distribution.

It's difficult to know when the config commands have finished because
they are just commands and FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 complicate matters as they
aren't just files to be read but modules and fvwm doesn't wait for them
to quit before enetering the main event loop.

It's just the assumption I made to get starting up to work. Any module
started on the command line (or caused to start from a command line Read
of a file) is assumed to be a start-up module and the initial capture is
delayed until it finishes to give it the chance to send back config
commands. If you can think of a better way to know when config commands
have stopped coming in let me know and I'll put it in.

Try moving it to the InitFunction and RestartFunction, it should fix
your problem.  You could move the "Read .fvwmrc.modules" to the
InitFunction if it's more convenient.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi Dan,

Yo're correct abot "atomake --add-missing".  [Sorry, my u key is broken
today]

This is correctly documented in the CVS repository.  I guess the public
pages need an update.

If the fix you're thinking of is:

1999-03-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

        * fvwm/misc.h:
        * fvwm/menus.c (FindPopup):
        * fvwm/functions.c (ComplexFunction2):
        (FindFunction):
        Removed harmful GetNextToken from FindPopup and FindFunction.
This is
        done before these functions are called now. (Bug found by Julian
        Gilbey).

I think this is what broke $0.  My fix effectively puts back a
GetNextToken before the command line tokens are put into $0,$1...

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi,
I noticed that the session managment creates a new file (with a new
name) each time you save your session, cluttering your SM_SAVE_DIR
with .fvwmXXXXaaa files. I don't know if that generally is considered
to be a feature or a bug, but I don't really like that behaviour.
Personally I don't see any reasons not to reuse the old filename,
since it is the same session, but at different points in times.

I attached a small patch that does exactly that.

	/ Johan

The Restart command does not seem to work well when invoking another

fvwm1:

Yeah, that's probably the better soltion.

For now, I changed configre to check for only readline/history.h on the
assmption that it won't get installed withot readline/readline.h also
being there.

Tim,

I understand the problem you are trying to correct, although I can't say
I have ever seen it, but now with your new logic for startup I do see
the problem.

I start fvwm like this
fvwm2 -cmd FvwmM4 -debug -m4-squote \{ -m4-equote \} -m4opt -DNOINIT -m4opt -DMYVERSION=fvwm23 -m4opt -DFCOMMAND=.FCM-jojo:0.0 .fvwm2rc

Now under 2.2 this works fine, my rc file doesn't have any other reads
the only thing I do is run my rc fle through FvwmM4.  But with the new
logic I don't get either of my decors defined. To get things working I
need to pull FvwmConsole up and do an AddToDecor on to create my decor
reisue the Style lines that have UseDecor and then do a recapture.

I can't imagine that this right and seeing as this worked under 2.2, I'm assuming this startup change is my problem, although I don't see any of the error messages about waiting for modules to finish.

Brad

checking with termcap... checking for readline in -lreadline... yes
checking for readline/history.h... no
checking with ncurses... checking for readline in -lreadline... no

  Have ReadLine support?    no

Looks a bit strange, but it works.

    Neil, FVWM doesn't support restarting a WM with command line
args. It doesn't parse the string you pass into individual args
to pass to the new program. So what happens is that the entire
string - "/usr/X11R6/bin/twm -f /etc/X11/twm/system.twmrc", for
example, is passed as the name of the program to exec. This, of
course, fails, so fvwm falls back to restarting itself. All you
can specify on the Restart command is the name of the program to
execute, I'm afraid.

    Although most WM's (unless they're descended from FVWM)
don't offer even this much flexibility, I think we could do
better. I think it would be a nice enhancement to allow the
passing of arguments to the new WM.

Agreed.  First, in an ideal world it would check for readline/history.h
first, since that's a fast and simple check, then only if that succeeds
would it try the libraries.

Second, I guess the only way to get the kind of thing you'd like to see:

  checking for readline in -lreadline with termcap... yes

would require an extra argument to the current macro checking for libs.

    Sometime late in the 2.1.x beta phase I put a patch on
my "Unofficial Patches" page that provides an option to
revert to the old handling of the stacking order.

    Unfortunately, I still need to upgrade it for 2.2 -
a last-minute bug fix for the release broke compatibility
with the patch. I'll put up a corrected version this
evening and notify you.

    I wonder if this option is worth adding to the next
release, with a big warning note that its use is *highly*
deprecated, and reintroduces bugs that are long since
fixed...?

I haven't looked at the 2.3 sources yet (I'm still sorting out the
Debian side of 2.2), but I want to remind you of the problem that I
found, and why I had to remove the harmful GetNextToken: if the popup
menu name was something like "Window Ops", then the first GetNextToken
would return the name, viz: Window Ops.  If GetNextToken is called on
the result, then the returned value would (incorrectly) be Window.
This can cause all sorts of things to break later.  So whatever you
are suggesting, please check that it won't break on cases like these.
And again, I haven't yet started looking at 2.3, so I can't comment on
any specifics.

Too bad, signal 11. It seems to be hardware problem and there is not much
to be done. Take a look at http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/ hope it helps.

Hello,

I use two different colors for window frames of windows with and without
the focus.
But I have a few windows which I would like not to change color ever, not
even when
they have the focus.

The only way I could achieve this effect is if Highlight color was a per
window
style option or if we introduced a new Style option called something like
"Highlights/DoesNotHighlight".

I used "exec xv -root -quit $HOME/.fvwm2.xpm" or "exec xpm

to set the background of my root window. I can see the background after I
start fvwm, but after a very short time, it disappear.

Hello,

I would like to suggest that the following behavior be implemented in the
FvwmPager:

One clicks with mouse 3 in the root window and the pager pops up right
under the

pointer. While the mouse button is still depressed, the mouse button acts
as normal

(ie. as the third mouse button usually acts in the pager). Then the user is
able to

view the entire desktop with very minimalistic movements of the mouse, and,
the user

can place the viewport where wanted, effortlessly!

Upon release of the third mouse button, the pager disappears completely
from the

desktop.

It would be a very nice enhancement: in fact, when I use

Restart /usr/X11R6/bin/twm

and twm restarts, it cannot find its default config file (bummer) and
I am stuck with frameless windows. Right now, the only way to solve this 
problem is to have a ~/.twmrc file. And since I am not seriously considering
running Twm at all (I'm just browsing), having to have an extra ~/.twmrc 
file on a permanent basis seems a bit unnecessary.

It would be a nice enhancement to have Restart deal with flags the right way.

Well, you could write a little shell script that invoked twm with the
right -f option, then invoke that from Restart.

Hacky, but...

Agreed.  The only issue is, once we decide to allow cmd-line args,
people will want shell quoting, etc. etc.  Then we'll have to invoke a
shell to run the new WM, with an exec option, etc...

:)

At least, does fvwm print some kind of error when the original exec
fails?  Hopefully that error is somewhat meaningful?

Yes. If this is what you mean then here it is:

$ cat .xsession-errors

Uh.. you get a segmentation fault if you fiddle with someone elses
memory as well, it's not a "hardware problem" signal...

Ugh.  No, I don't consider this sufficient since it gives no info about
_why_ it failed.  At the very least it should print the errno string, so
you'd see something like "no such file or directory" at the end of the
above message.

That would be confusing here but at least you'd have a _chance_ of
figuring out the problem.

Of course, TFM is also an option, I guess :)

Again, I'm only looking at FVWM 2.2 at present, but all it would take
to provide this enhancement is to use a standard GetNextToken loop in
the Done() function to process the arguments to Restart instead of
copying the arguments we were given (which may be meaningless to the
new WM, although we should check for -d and -s options); of course,
the syntax of Restart would then be  Restart <WM> [<arg>] ...

You are right.  The delays are gone.

Now I'm down the the "circle" problem.

I get a  mouse pointer thats  a circle during  startup, I have to move
the mouse to get startup to finish.
The man page says it uses this for:

 SELECT (XC_dot)
    used for various builtin commands such as iconify

I can also get the  circle by just trying  to change the decor, so its
my guess  that the  circle during  startup  is also  due to  the decor
change.  (I call for a decor change at the end of my .fvwm2rc.)

Here is my decor file:

At the end of my .fvwm2rc I have "DecorCustom".
When I do the same thing by menu I get the same circle.
In addition, these are in my error log:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***

and, worst, the weird10 tiled pixmap window borders are just
plain gray!

I'll try to get hold of a stack trace at the hang, and look up
the messages.

	Erk! I really don't fancy getting into another of those fruitless "to
exec, or to exec exec" debates. I'll have to think on this one a bit.

Well, whether to exec automatically on an Exec command is debatable
(although I'd have preferred it since it's _usually_ what you want, and
provided a different command to not exec).

But there should be no debate here: without the exec you'll change from
a window manager process to a shell process running a window manager
process, then if you restart again you'll have a shell running a shell
running a window manager, etc. etc. etc.

exec is the Right Thing in this case, without a doubt.

Then it is set somewhere else too. You should look through your
.fvwm2rc and .xinitrc and see if there are commands which set
the background too, e.g.

  xv
  xsetroot
  FvwmBacker

I think it is. If these Windows X servers have some problems

propose we have only one option now and in the future for
Windows bug fixes.

lines into a form.  If the form contains buttons activated by
the Return Key the paste can activate the button.

* FvwmForm/.FormFvwmTalk.: Changed the built-in form to reset the
command field on Return key, necessary for pasting many lines to
look right.  Not the best for typing a line at a time, there is
no feedback.  Pasting lots of config lines at once works well.

hotkeys are not case insensitive. Else the numerous definitions I have
a` la:
AddToMenu Foo "&XTerm" Exec exec xterm
would require me to hit "X" to hotkey instead of "x". The
menuShortcut() function does a tolower() before testing the match. One
assumes that AddToMenu similarly does tolower() on the character
following "&" before placing it in the MenuItem struct as the hotkey.

While we're at it (though I see from Dominik's activity we're no
longer "at it", technically ;-), is there some reason that FVWM
doesn't restart itself using the commandline args it started with? An
unqualified "Restart" ought (IMHO) to bring back exactly the same
thing.

I poked around in the code for Restart and it seems that FVWM hangs
onto all the args it ran with right up to the bitter end, but for some
reason decides to just chuck them. Is this in the same boat as the
observation about quoting and exec'ing a Restart with multiple args?
Anyway, my personal feeling is that if Restart won't restore fvwm2
with the same commandline args it started with, commandline args are a
bit useless... My fvwm2 starts as 'fvwm2 -f $HOME/.fvwm/main' but I
*still* had to symlink $HOME/.fvwm2rc to .fvwm/main in order to
Restart with the right rcfile. Sigh.

I know it's thoroughly unrelated to existing logo ideas, but just
thought I'd float a mini icon I've been using happily for a week or
three... The whole idea of course is that F* is what should've been
in the manpage for a long time now. Anyway, if you like the idea, feel
free to play with it, since I readily admit, I'm not really

And doesn't one call this behaviour case insensitive? I.e. it doesn't
matter if you use lower case or upper case letters.

I was fiddling with the Restart function anyway to suppress an
error message that had bothered me a long time. I think the cmd
lime args are use now if you use Restart without parameters. Could
you check that is correct?

Tim, since you are busy with the window borders I have a request.
The last time I cared to take a look the hilighting code for the
focused window was embedded into the border drawing code.

It would be nice if you could hilight any window, not just the
focused one. Could you filter the hilighting code from borders.c
into a new function (and perhaps even file) in a way that allows
to hilight any window independently? The code for drawing borders
should just provide the window to be hilighted and call a function.

Bye

Dominik

Hi,

Am I the only one disturbed by FVWM installing "hidden" files?  For
exaple, the nifty forms of FvwmForm are in files like .FormFvwmTalk.  

Is there no way for these to be given regular filenames?  If so, I think
we should make it the default.  People using prefix=/usr/local (or just
/usr!) are going to be terribly surprised to see all kinds of .FormFvwm*
files in /usr/local/etc!

So far you are the only one.

I think I see your point.  Would it be any better if the files were in
/usr/local/etc/fvwm?  What is the right way to do that?

The leading dot is hard coded.  The command:

FvwmForm FormFvwmTalk. causes FvwmForm to issue the command:

read .FormFvwmTalk.
     ^

I felt the leading dot made sense for config files stored in the users
home directory.  The  way  "read"  works led  me  to  extend this   to
/usr/local/etc.

I know we  have to do  something regarding the potential proliferation
of fvwm2 config files scattered around the users home directory.  That
is,  store them in a  ".fvwm"  or $HOME/$FVWM_CONFIG subdirectory.  So
far, I'm  just trying to get together  enough config files to make the
effort worthwhile.  That could be a reason to drop the leading dot.

I'm open to changing any part of this.

On a  similar subject...I've never  installed AfterStep,  but it looks
like it has  a fairly elaborate   built in config system.  Perhaps  we
would be   smart to steal some  other  window manager's config system,
rather than  building one from  the ground  up.  At least  we would be
creating something familiar to some group of users.

I'd be interested in any opinions about  which config system is around
that is worth starting with and bending to our needs.

I think we could enhance the read command to be a bit smarter if it
fails to read a file name begining with dot.

How about read trying the following files

for /ANYTHING
  try /ANYTHING only

for ANYTHING (with no leading dot)
  try ./ANYTHING, $HOME/ANYTHING, $SYSCONF/ANYTHING

for .ANYTHING
  try ./.ANYTHING, $HOME/.ANYTHING, $HOME/.fvwm/ANYTHING,
$SYSCONF/ANYTHING

That way the install would create /usr/local/etc/FormFvwmForm and the
user could over ride it by having a .FormFvwmForm or a
.fvwm/FormFvwmForm.  The /usr/local/etc files wouldn't be hidden and the
user could have a .fvwm directory to keep all these files in.  I guess
the files saving stuff would also have to be changed (sorry Dan) to try
to create $HOME/.fvwm/$FILE first and if that failed (probably because
the user doesn't have a .fvwm directory) it could try creating
$HOME/.$FILE

Cheers,
Tim.

Perhaps  someone more familiar  with  functions.c can figure this  out
faster than I can.  I have a stack trace from the hang I get where the
mouse pointer turns to a dot while executing some decor logic.

I now   believe I  am executing  "DecorCustom",  which  is calling the
function  "4_buttons".   The  "4_buttons"  command  wanders  into  the
function "IsClick"  waiting for the  pointer to  move.  (I don't  know
why.)

One of the things that seems suspicious is the value of Scr.ClickTime
(-150).

(These functions work fine with 2.2.)

I think I had some insight into this part of the startup process.

What I think we should do when we can't read .fvwm2rc is:

Look for .fvwmrc, if found, popup 'FvwmForm XXXXX' and ask if the
user wants to run the conversion script we have.

Otherwise, copy system.fvwmrc to $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

Does this happen during startup? If not the ClickTime has to be positive.
Probably something I broke. I'll ckeck it in the evening.

It happens during startup and while running.

Maybe Scr.ClickTime  is not the key  to this.  When it happens outside
of startup, Scr.ClickTime is 150.

What is it doing in IsClick?

This would be nice but don't forget that this is probably happening
during startup and that means you can't pop up forms without getting
stuck in the dreaded 42 second timeout deadlock.  I think we can pop up
menus during startup but I haven't tried it.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS the reason for the above patch is in case a user starts fvwm and gets
it configured without any Reads.  There was a danger that a failing Read
would end up doing a Read of system.fvwmrc.

I believe this is a bug nobody noticed before I made a change to
IsClick recently. Whenever ytou call a complex function the code
tries to figure out if it has to execute the Click, Doubleclick
or Motion action, even if the function isn't invoked via a mouse
click (just guessing). I modified IsClick so that it waits forever
if no ButtonPress, Motion or ButtonRelease events arrive. This might
be related with your problem.

No, I don't think we can. Menus are not created before the .fvwm2rc
has bee completely parsed.

I agree; installing .xxx files in system directories is really almost
unheard of.

What have we decided (if anything) about installing a system.fvwmrc?
Where does that go?  I guess I thought it would go in the same directory
as the modules, not $SYSCONF, since there's a good chance it'll change
between versions.  Maybe we need to enhance the read-in of this, too, to
allow for site-specific versions to override the basic versions (kind of
like the Emacs site-lisp vs. lisp directories)?

For example, maybe we look for $SYSCONF/ANYTHING, then
$LIBEXEC/fvwm/$VERSION/ANYTHING, and we automatically install into the
latter?

I guess to be _really_ correct, system.fvwmrc, etc. belongs in $DATADIR,
not $LIBEXEC.  Sigh.  Well, as long as they're small it's probably no
big deal :)

  tp> for .ANYTHING
  tp>   try ./.ANYTHING, $HOME/.ANYTHING, $HOME/.fvwm/ANYTHING,
  tp> $SYSCONF/ANYTHING

This sounds like a good solution to me.  It does make things potentially
more complex to figure out for the user, though.  Maybe we should have
some kind of logging that prints out what files are being read, with
complete pathnames--maybe even prints out what files are looked for but
not found, so users can see the algorithm "in action".

Whatever it is, we need to document it very clearly in the man page :-/.

Maybe we can create some kind of global flag that says "didn't find a
config!" or similar.

Then, after fvwm gets completely started, if that flag is set we can
kick off some kind of FvwmForm to help the user decide what to do next,
maybe based on whether they have a .fvwmrc, as specified above.

On the other hand, probably the number of people still using fvwm 1.x
and upgrading to 2.x is very rapidly dwindling with every new release.
If a release with this feature isn't made within a few months it's
probably not worth bothering with :).

I think I saw something like the following in you rc file

AddToFunc Something
+ I xxxxxx

I think I remember there being a problem with not having an "I" after
"Something" making the function wait fo a clickTime.  Try rewriting it
as

AddToFunc Something I xxxxx

If that fixes your problem I think we should make "AddToFunc Something"
behave as though "AddToFunc Something I NOP" were typed.

Cheers,
Tim.

What seems to cause the problem is the onfigureNotify reporting that the
window is 65524 pixels high.  Is this a bug in my XServer? It's Exceed
6.1 running on NT and it's not the best Xserver I've come across.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS if you want to replicate this don't click on the xev window, you get
millions of events.  I type the following in to FvwmConsole

Exec xev > ev.log

Great minds think alike.  I too remember the bug.
Before I sent the mail this AM I tested exactly that.

Subject: FvwmTaskBar configuration bug

Full_Name: Jacek Kopecky
Version: fvwm-2.2.tar.gz
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux RH5.2
X_Server: XFree86-3.3.2.3
Submission from: (NULL) (195.178.64.178)


 in fvwm-2.2/extras/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.c on line 63 the length is
increased by 11 instead of by 7 so the module doesn't get the
*FvwmTaskBarMailbox 
setting. This probably stayed there after changing MailboxPath into Mailbox
only.
Also on the next line the number 11 should be changed to 8 (not sure about
this)
so that the None option gets recognized.
 Then after UpdateString(&mailpath... a few lines lower the last character
of the
mailpath should be set to 0, so that the newline character doesn't stay
there. 
 You might also consider changing the constant of 10 on the line number 180
to 
a variable number set in configuration if somebody doesn't like updating
after
as long as 10 seconds. 8-) The mailbox bitmap might be configurable as
well. 8-)

Err. Sensitive. Not case sensitive. I was trying to correct Paul's
statement that shortcuts are case-sensitive... Ah, nothing like a
mailing list to make a fool of oneself.

But... wait... the bug report says they _are_ case-sensitive:

So, is the bug report (and subsequent patch) wrong?  Or are we talking
about something completely different?

The shortcut itself is insensitive and the keypress is (was) sensitive.
In the code it's clearly visible that both were intended to be insensitive.
The patch is correct (and already applied) and the right thing to do.

Hi Paul,

Just now, I noticed the taskbar looping again, and I managed to get the
following gdb info...  I'm not very familiar with gdb, so I just grabbed
what looked reasonable from "info gdb"...

HTH,
Pierre

Oh dear!  Yes, that loop will _definitely_ take a while to finish :-/.

Search_len is set to the strlen of the button title:

  pf> (gdb) print button->title
  pf> $3 = 0x80578c8 "Netscape: Python 1.5 and Beyond"

so it started out with a reasonable value.  This loop is trying to find
how much of the title string it can fit onto the button, along with the
"..." extension, if it won't all fit.

Can you reproduce this every time you visit, say, a Netscape site with a
very long title, so that it won't fit on the button?  You also need to
have lots of apps open, so your buttons on the task bar are much
smaller.  Or does it only happen for certain long titles?  If you visit
that same site again in Netscape, does it happen again?

What font are you using for FvwmTaskBar, in particular the button
titles?

I wonder if you're not getting into a situation where the button is so
small that not even the "..." will fit?  Or that's all that will fit?

Anyway, try replacing the loop with this:

  if (XTextWidth(font, button->title, search_len) > w-newx-3) {

    while (search_len > 0
           && ((x3p = XTextWidth(font, button->title, search_len) + newx)
               > w-w3p-3))
      search_len--;
    XDrawString(dpy, win, graph, x + x3p, y+ButtonFont->ascent+4, t3p, 3);

    button->truncate = True;
  } else {
    button->truncate = False;
  }

  if (search_len)
    XDrawString(dpy, win, graph,
                x+newx, y+font->ascent+4,
                button->title, search_len);

I suppose if you had _SO_ many buttons that even the "..." wouldn't fit,
this still prints them all so you might see some text walking off the
edge of the button or something.  Oh well.

I think all this code needs to be reworked a bit, but the above should
help with the infinite looping.

Any time I've let it finish (usually by not noticing it until it's too
late), it crashes...

Not usually, only after I have lots of buttons on the bar...  Funny, my
very first suspicion was that the bubble was too long; but from what I
could see, I thought it was related to the number of buttons that got
overlaid by the bubble.  Now I see that it more likely what you suspect
here...

The problem occurs when there are *lots* of buttons on the task bar.  In
this case, when I spotted the problem, the buttons were small as I'd
expect, but they only went about half way across...  

I may have to restart X since the bar would always get back into a loop
unless I restarted it...  Hmmm...  now, I'm puzzled...  I thought the
buttons were displayed for EITHER the dt0 or dt1, not both...  On
previous loops, I noticed that both dt0 and dt1 buttons were on the
bar...  this time, only half the buttons (and just wide enough) to cover
half the bar...  I'm thinking there may be another related bug here...

Whatever the default is; I've never changed it...  not sure where to
check...  :)

Absolutely...  sometimes I wonder if even the red hat will fit...

Will do.

no biggy if that's the worst effect...

I'll try it and get back to you...

I use 'SnapGrid 8' and 'EdgeResistance 250 10'. When I drag a
window over the left or top border of the screen it shakes.
Every now and then it jumps back a few pixels, then as
I move on it jumps ahead again. It's quite disturbing viasually.

Bye

Dominik

Hi Paul,

Right now, I have 26 buttons; definitely no room for '...'  Moving the
mouse over the vdt causes bubbles to overlap some buttons which then get
redrawn.  The last button even overlaps the day, then gets cropped
depending on which way the mouse moves... :>

At least it's hanging in right now..

Yup...  sure does... much appreciated!

Thanks,

That's my doing (from the VMS porting).  If you don't see
EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION in config.h.in, then running autoheader ought to
clear this up.  If it *is* in config.h.in, then you need to re-run
config.status. 

A simple "make" should take care of this.  Must be some timestamps screwed
up somewhere.

Probably that's just because FvwmTaskBar hung up about halfway through
redrawing the buttons, so you don't see them all.

Well, I'll commit a fix similar to this one--I don't know what the
maintenance status of FvwmTaskBar is going forward but at least we'll
keep it from hanging, even if it might look messy for lots 'n lots of
buttons.

Thanks for your help in tracking it down!

Ick!!  The configuration language won't change _that_ drastically between
releases, one hopes!  

Since it is a configuration file, I think sysconf is a good place for it.
If we go to a scheme with multiple config files, then maybe $sysconf/fvwm
is the place for them.  But I don't think we really need this (yet).

These forms of FvwmForm don't seem like configuration files to me.  They
seem more akin to scripts, are they not?  (I haven't actually played
around with them.  Are these designed to be used as-is, or are they
examples?) 

In any case, they appear to be sharable across architectures, so wouldn't
one want them in /usr/local/share/fvwm?  (i.e. $datadir/fvwm)

Well, the system config file may differ across different architectures at
one installation -- like at our lab :-( -- so I'd not like it in $datadir.
But the forms appear to be shareable.

Yeah, and such complexity bothers me.  For instance, why is "anything" 
treated differently than ".anything"?  Also, I wonder if it is useful to
look in the current directory at all.  Who is starting their window
manager anywhere OTHER than $HOME?

If I wanted to put my config files into $HOME/.fvwm/XXX, couldn't I just
use "Read .fvwm/XXX" in the initial .fvwmrc file?  In other words: why
hardcode this path if I can get the same effect by specifying it
explicitly?

I was really impressed with FvwmScript, actually.  I haven't sat down yet
to figure out the scripting language, but it appears to be more powerful
than just simple forms.  There are conditionals, at least.

There are some configuration-type scripts included in the Scripts
directory, and another more intricate example was posted here by Eddy J. 
Gurney last November. 

I have been musing to myself about building a GUI configure tool for FVWM
from this.  Eddy: any thoughts about this?

It would be great if you made a library function, there are lots of
buttons in fvwm and the modules that don't do truncation very well.
Something like

int TrimRight(Display, Font, char* string, int width);

that returns the number of chars to print before the "..."

Cheers,

Hi,
I found a small typographic bug in the pager man-page. 
One of the sections of italic is not terminated properly, resulting in 
that a big part of the page is displayed in italic.

	Hello all.

	Steve sent me yesterday a 2.3.0 tarball to test the VMS port 
integration. I have the following problems:
	1 - I haven't the shape extension but a line in x_pager.c is not
protected with the #ifdef SHAPE: output from the Dec C compiler: 

|  if(((Scr.CurrentDesk - desk1)  == i) && !ShapeLabels)
|...........................................^
|%CC-E-UNDECLARED, In this statement, "ShapeLabels" is not declared.
|at line number 1048 in file 
|DISK$THOR:[THOR_USR.VILLARD_F.ARCHIVES.VMS.FVWM-2300.MODULES.FVWMPAGER]X_PAGER.C;1
	I added the #ifdef required.


	2 - In menus.c:

|      (int)keychar = tolower((int)keychar) ;
|......^
|%CC-E-NEEDLVALUE, In this statement, "(int)keychar" is not an lvalue, but occurs 
|in a context that requires one. at line number 436 in file 
|DISK$THOR:[THOR_USR.VILLARD_F.ARCHIVES.VMS.FVWM-2300.FVWM]MENUS.C;1
	I removed the "(int)" cast from the lvalue.


	3 - In graphics.c:

|  XSegment seg[line_width];
|...............^
|%CC-E-NEEDCONSTEXPR, In the declaration of "seg", "line_width" is not constant, 
|but occurs in a context that requires a constant expression.
|at line number 19 in file DARC:[VMS.FVWM-2300.LIBS]GRAPHICS.C;4
	I replaced the line with:
  XSegment *seg;
(...)
  seg = (XSegment *)safemalloc(sizeof(XSegment) * line_width);


	Fab.

Last evening I had an idea for a new feature that seems quite
useful to me: window shortcuts. What I am thinking about is this:
Most people have several windows they use all the time (a couple
of shells, perhaps netscape or xemacs). With the new feature you
can assign the window id to some kind of register that can be called
from functions etc. The default should be to switch to the desk/page
with the bound window, raise and focus it and put the pointer into
it. This should speed up switching the focus tremendously.

Proposed syntax:

  To bind a register to a window:
 
    WindowShortcut Assign <register>

  To apply a function to a window with a shortcut:

    WindowShortcut Apply <register> <function>

  Use the window id from a shortcut in a function:

    $r1, ..., $r<n>

  In Next/Prev,...

    Next (register) <function>

  or

    Next (register <n>) <function>


Example:

    AddToFunction Choose-Window
     + "I" Iconify off
     + "I" WindowShade off
     + "I" Raise
     + "I" WarpToWindow 50 +5p
     + "I" Focus

    # bind assignment keys
    Key F1 A S  WindowShortcut Assign 1
    Key F2 A S  WindowShortcut Assign 2
    Key F3 A S  WindowShortcut Assign 3
    Key F4 A S  WindowShortcut Assign 4

    # go to user defined windows
    Key F1 A N  WindowShortcut Apply 1 Choose-Window
    Key F2 A N  WindowShortcut Apply 2 Choose-Window
    Key F3 A N  WindowShortcut Apply 3 Choose-Window
    Key F4 A N  WindowShortcut Apply 4 Choose-Window

    # Assign standard windows on startup
    Next (rxvt) WindowShortcut Assign 1
    Next (rxvt) WindowShortcut Assign 2
    Next (XMessages) WindowShortcut Assign 3


Now you can press shift-F1-F4 to assign a window to a function
key and when you press the key without shift the window will be
brought up in a way that you can immediately type into it. I'm
not sure how assigning shortcuts during startup would work since
fvwm doesn't wait for the windows of exec'd functions. I'm sure
there is a lot more one could do with this.

Ideas for improvements? Comments?

Bye

Dominik

I don't think you need a new set of commands for this.  I think you can
do it by creating functions for the storage.  It might not be as nice
but does the following work

DestroyFunc Assign1 # one of these for each register
AddToFunc Assign1
+ I DestroyFunc Apply1
+ I AddToFunc Apply1 I WindowID $0 \$0 \$1 \$2 \$3 ...

# Apply1 looks like: WindowID 1234567 $0 $1 ...

Key F1 A C Assign1 $w
Key F1 A M Apply1 <function> <args>

I don't know if \$0 is possible, it needs some method of defering the
expansion of $0 until Apply1 is called.  If it doesn't work it might be
easier to get it working than creating new commands and state, it would
be less to test as well.

Cheers,
Tim.

Is it possible to apply a function to a window with a designated
window-id? If not the 'Pick' function could be enhanced to allow
this (e.g. Pick -id <window-id> <command>).

Hmm, I'll try it at home. But this approach convinces me even more
that we need it. I've talked to one of our students about it and
he likes the whole idea very much. We cannot expect the average
user (or the expert user for that matter) to be able to implement
such a functionality with a syntax like this. I believe that this
'feature' would be a tremendous leap ahead in usability. I've
watched some of my colleagues (not that they are using fvwm, but
anyway), and what I always see is that they switch between two
full sized windows again and again. It could be so easy, if there
was only a simple way to do it.

I'd even go a step further to simplify configuration like this:

  WindowShortcut Key F1, Action Choose-Window

This would automatically do the key bindings from the example above.
One could still use the Apply/Assign syntax for better configurability.
And I'd create a WindowShortcutFunction that is preloaded with
the Choose-Window function from the example but can be changed like
the InitFunction. With this, the example from above reduces to this:

  WindowShortcut Key F1
  WindowShortcut Key F2
  WindowShortcut Key F3
  WindowShortcut Key F4

  Next (rxvt) WindowShortcut Assign F1
  Next (rxvt) WindowShortcut Assign F2
  Next (XMessages) WindowShortcut Assign F3

This simply assumes that shortcuts are assigned with the shift
key pressed and called without any modifier pressed.

Bye

Dominik

Strangely enough, right at the very end of the compile,
the make ran the autoheader command.

Ok, forget it. WindowID does the job. The name of this command
is a bit unfortunate though.

I don't think Exceed is the culprit.

I  fooled around with   an rxvt making it   maximized  and sticky  and
windowshaded.  At one point I had it unshaded and I maximized it.  The
rxvt froze in  a half maximized state,  the frame was  maximized, rxvt
wasn't yet, (I think it was trying).

I had to kill rxvt when its memory use reached 823Meg and Xsun reached
62meg.  I beat my  previous record of  300Meg or  so with  Netscape by
quite a margin!

Be assured that it will hog all your memory :) I had the same once
(don't know what I did), and I waited too long. When I tried to kill
it I couldn't open a root shell or even reboot. So I had to
wait until it coredumped when the swap space was exhausted. Sometimes
I wonder if I should limit per-process memory usage ;-)

Hi all,

please, may I request that all of you clean up Jitterbug
when you apply patches, fix bugs etc.? At the moment I'm
running Jitterbug more or less single handedly. I can't
possibly follow every fix from every mail thread and take
the appropriate actions in Jitterbug.

BTW, it would be nice if you could look through the
incoming/comfired/enhacement lists in Jitterbug to
see what has already been done/cannot be done/will not
be done.

Bye

Dominik

I try to keep abreast of Jitterbug.  I wouldn't mind
if you let me know when I slip up.

	This is exactly what I do.  My config is split up, but I have Read
.fvwm/blah in there.  Never even had to think twice about it.

Do all cvs writers have write access on Jitterbug?  I didn't know that! 
Is it the same user&pass as for the repository?  

(Maybe I was away when the Jitterbug instructions came out.)

Yes, should be the same. Jason, do you set people up for
Jitterbug access when you give them write access to CVS?

Hmm...enough  opinions  have  flown   back and  forth,   that  I  have
completely lost track.

I'm not following this last  part of the thread,  I understand that  a
user can put config files anywhere, but I think the subject at hand is
where fvwm2 puts its config files.

There has been some disagreement about datadir vs. sysconfdir.

There  is a schemes  proposed for writing  files $HOME/.fvwm without a
dot or if .fvwm is missing, writing the files with  a dot.  This makes
some sense, although it doesn't seem proactive  enough.  The user gets
fed up with  all our config files  in the $HOME directory, he  reports
the problem, and  we tell him to  do a mkdir, and move  his files?  Or
was   the  proposal for      fvwm2  to create  the    .fvwm  directory
automatically?

I'm not so sure about this dot flipping, I think it can get needlessly
complicated.  I thought if we install  dot files into etc/fvwm instead
of etc directly no one would care if  the files had  the dot.  Besides
that,  I don't think  we want to spread  our config files all over etc
anyway.   However installing into etc/fvwm  doesn't seem to be default
behavior and I'm not sure how I would make it that way.

Didn't we have some guidelines for developers? We should mention

Maybe a DEVELOPERS file in the top level directory (not necessarily

Hi Steve; I note in your change to libs/Graphics.c you added:

  XSegment* seg = (XSegment*)safemalloc(sizeof(XSegment) * line_width);

but you never free this; ouch :)

On this topic, I wonder if we've ever considered using alloca()?  It can
really help reduce heap rot and increase the flexibility of the apps
(because programmers don't have to worry about memory leaks they're more
likely to use alloca() instead of just declaring a fixed-size buffer to
avoid malloc()).

Typically what happens is you ship an alloca.c along with the app which
provides a "dummy alloca" function, which still works on _almost_ all
systems (it works on all systems with a stack that increases
consistently in one direction (either direction) as you get deeper in
the function call hierarchy) for those compilers which don't support
alloca().  Actually, alloca() is surprisingly wide-spread now; AIX's
compiler, Sun's compiler, etc. provide it, in addition to GCC of course.
I do this with GNU make, which runs on UNIX, VMS, DOS, Windows, and
Amiga and I've only ever received one complaint from someone with a
_really_ strange system.

On the other hand, I'm not really widely familiar with the code so I
can't say how often we actually tend to allocate this temporary buffers
which only have function scope (that is, they disappear when the
function exits).

I like alloca() a lot, myself, but YMMV.

Thoughts?

This seems very odd. FvwmM4 runs m4 to create a file and then tells fvwm
to read it before it exists.  This means that the file is read before
the initial capture happens and this is exactly what used to happen with
2.2.

Have you looked at the file that -debug spits out?  This is the file
that fvwm reads.  I think the order of AddToDecor and "Style UseDecor"
matters so it might be an ordering thing.

Cheers,
Tim.

The logic for hilighting is all at the start of the SetBorder function.
I won't have time before next week to do anything.  There is logic in
there that unhilights Scr.hilite by calling SetBorder again so you'll
have to pull that out if you want independence. Apart from that it is
pretty well what you want already.

No reason why not, it make for a bit of redundancy but after the GSFR we
won't need a whole int for the border widths so it's probably no big
deal.

Would the decors override the style?

Doubtless there is some point I am missing.

If you set something with a style and then do a "style usedecor"
the last thing processed should override.

amazing that is exactly what I just did and the good news is I sort of
found the problem my rc has a section like this
AddToDecor $1
+ WindowFont     -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-120-*-75-p-*-iso8859-1
+ IconFont       fixed
+ HilightColor   Black #909078
...

and with -debug I see
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: 'AddToDecor default-decor
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: '+ WindowFont     -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-120-*-75-p-*-iso8859-1 
...

along with the rest of the file as I would expect it when the last lines
from my rc gets printed the capture begins, but I don't get any decor
stuff.

So on a whim I changed things to 
AddToDecor $1
AddToDecor $1 WindowFont     -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-120-*-75-p-*-iso8859-1
AddToDecor $1 IconFont       fixed
AddToDecor $1 HilightColor   Black #909078

now I see
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: 'AddToDecor default-decor
'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: 'AddToDecor default-decor WindowFont     -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-120-*-75-p-*-iso8859-1
'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: 'AddToDecor default-decor IconFont       fixed
'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: '#fore and back for text of window with focus
'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> about to exec: 'AddToDecor default-decor HilightColor   Black #909078
'

and when I get the capture it works.  So the good news is I found the
problem.  The bad news is something isn't parsing my rc file correcttly
anymore.  Because using '+' worked in 2.2 and earlier.  Any thoughts on
whether your change broke this or if it was a problem with the parsing
stuff?

Yep.  Note that you have to go to the Jitterbug page, but then tack a

You'll probably want to bookmark that page.

I'm in no particular hurry since if I'd have to do it it won't be before
May.

I tried it once before 2.2, but it was too disruptive then. The main
problem was that the code referred to the hilighted window. I'd really
appreciate if you could do that (I'm aiming at the configurable hilight
colour).

After removing ALL the plus signs from my decor  file, the dot problem
and the lack of window decorations is gone.

There was a change to main between revision 1.27 and 1.28 here is the
pertinent part of the diff against FvwmButtons.c the real problem is
in not setting parent to NULL. in MakeContainer it is assumed that if
parent != NULL then we can access all of the parents fields, which
it can't because they haven't been allocated the specific dump is in
MakeContainer where it tries to access b->parent->c which is NULL.

'$$' is the right syntax.

It does work, but as I said before, only very few people would think
of something like this. I will make a stab at implementing my version.

  I'm working on a module aimed at this.  However, it uses a database of
actual desktop positions, rather than window IDs.

  If you do that I can't activate it from my module.  Right now I bind a
SendToModule to the key, then the module tells fvwm to switch desktops and
scroll.  I'd like to be able to do it in one step to reduce flashing.

Alex,
	since there has been some discussion about themes lately and about
the need to ease configuration/setup, I'd suggest for you to setup an html
page with pictures describing the procedure (and how easy it all is ;-)
I think you'll get a much greater response once people see what it is that is
doable as an incentive to really downloading the package and trying it out.

I haven't downloaded your package _yet_, but how does it differ from
John Lapeyre's FvwmConf

    http://newton.physics.arizona.edu/~lapeyre/fvwmconf/index.html


Pumpkineers,

	With all the talk about GUI configuration, what is FvwmConf
missing (the only thing that I can see is the "requires perl and perl/tk"),
anything else ? Its author might be willing to lend a hand and it might be a
decent start; after all it is touted as a "Real-time interactive
configuration of fvwm2"

I think we need to jazz-up a bit our web page.  I think www.gtk.org, 
www.gnome.org, www.windowmaker.org have done a GREAT job on their web 
pages and are very content driven, very appealing.  Those pages (along 
with others I'd assume) ought to serve as examples for our beloved
FVWM's page.

I'm not suggesting glitz and glitter for the sake of a fancy look, what I'm
talking about is to make it a bit more appealing for newbies who just got
directed our direction.  I think we should (or even *must*) have a section
that SHOWs (yes screenshots and example) what FVWM is capable of.

Here are a couple of sites that do a pretty good job of what I'm describing
relating to screenshots and examples.

  - Example of configuration commands (but for fvwm-1.24r) the author
    does state that he _will_ be updating the page once 2.0 is released
    (I guess someone needs to give him a nudge ;-)
    The pages content and approach are exceptional.
    http://www.cobaltgroup.com/~roland/fvwm/fvwm.html

  - Sample configuration files (for 2.0.45+ and 1.24) _with_ screenshots.
    A bit list'ish, but gets the point across.
    http://www.fastlane.net/homepages/sdboyd/samples/sample_list.html

  - Very Simple configuration examples
    http://web7.mit.edu/ASC/Documentation/Unix/Fvwm/main.html#local

I would assume there are other sites as well, but what needs to be done
is not to list these URLs - what needs to be done is to create our own
section on fvwm.org showing all the features.

Keep up the great work.

Did anyone post to contest.gimp.org (Patrick ?) about a logo for Fvwm ?

Any follow-ups relating to the matter ?

Hi,

I have a reasonably complete version of a FvwmGtk
module. It implements menus, dialogs and window-list
using gtk. I'd like to add it to CVS, but there is 
a little gotcha: Since the configure.in will then
contain AM_PATH_GTK, building from CVS on gtk-less
machines will need a call to aclocal -I modules/FvwmGtk
(I'll include gtk.m4 in the module dir). Is that
acceptible or is there a better way to handle this.
Rebuilding without touching configure should be
no problem.

Matthias

Subject: Problem with non-atomic SendText
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


While working on that gtk module, I had the problem
that sometimes the module got killed while sending
some text back to fvwm. I traced the problem to the
following szenario:

module: enters SendText, writes the window id
fvwm: sees input, reads the window id, enters HandleModuleInput
       tries to read the packet size, doesn't get it and kills the module
module: now im gonna send the size...oops im dead!

I got around the problem by replacing SendText by the following
in my module:

void AtomicSendText(int *fd,char *message,unsigned long window)
{
  char *p, buf[1024]; /* should be ok; fvwm limits packet length to 1000 */
  int w;

  if(message != NULL)
  {
    p = buf;
    *((unsigned long*)p) = window;
    p += sizeof (unsigned long);
    w = strlen (message);
    *((int*)p) = w;
    p += sizeof (int);
    strncpy (p, message, 1000);
    p += w;
    *((int*)p) = 1;
    p += sizeof (int);

    write(fd[0], buf, p - buf);
  }
}

Would it be ok to replace SendText in libs/Module.c
by this atomic version ?

Um...as of my latest update from CVS (ca. 22:00 EST), ClickToFocus has
become severely dysfunctional. It won't transfer the focus to the
clicked window at all. If I click on the titlebar of a window on another
page from the one where the currently focused window resides, it *will*
take the focus away from that window, but it still won't give it to the
other one.  :-(

How embarrassing!  Ouch indeed --- and thanks to the Hippo for quickly

Yep, someone has!  I discovered an alloca() call last night --- in
FvwmPager/x_pager.c --- because it doesn't compile with SGI's cc.

[Having everyone developing with gcc (which, among other things, supplies
alloca) can be a drawback for portability, it seems ;-)]

It sounds good to me, though I'm not familiar enough with the code,
either, to know if it is widely useful.  I do know that if we *don't*
provide it, we need to make one more malloc() call for a function-scoped
variable!

	I agree.  We have a great program here... I think we should show
it off... If you didn't know what you were looking for, or already use
fvwm, our site doesn't really say "Hey, download this, it's cool"  In my 
opinion, we need a more (uggh) 'contemporary' look.  

If it's a matter of 'who has time to do it', there are people who want to
work on this, but no-one is going to want to do anything until we get
some buy in from the core team.

I've seen related threads just die because no-one replied.  Please don't
let this one go that way...  I know there are opinions on this... what are
they?

Jay

Will configure remember that I used the -I flag once upon a time, or will
I have to now run aclocal by hand (instead of relying on the makefile)
each time configure.in, or acheader (or whatever) gets modified?

If the latter, I know that *I*'ll keep forgetting the -I flag.

Is there no other way?  For example, is gtk.m4 too huge to be stuck into
acinclude.m4?

Hi,

I know this is going to trip up some people, so let me remind you all that
you will have to run "automake" from the top of the SOURCE tree after
cvsupping.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here's why you need to do this: adding a new Makefile.am always requires
re-running automake to create the Makefile.in.

You may find yourself re-running config.status by hand, too.

Reusing the old filename is definitively not an option, since
session managers like xsm might implement named sessions and the
user might be able to change the name of a running session. The
sm client simply doesn't know if it is asked to save its state
as a new checkpoint for the old session or as the initial
checkpoint of a renamed session. In the former case, reusing the
old filename would be ok, in the latter case, it would be wrong.

The XSM protocol has the DiscardCommand property in order to
enable the session manager to deal with this. I think fvwm
handles this properly. At least this is what I see with xsm
(other session managers may not be up to the task):

0) SM_SAVE_DIR contains just one fvwm file for a session named foo
1) start a session named foo
2) do a checkpoint for session foo:
   the old fvwm file disappears (this is xsm executing DiscardCommand)
   and a new one appears
3) repeating this many times will leave exactly one fvwm file in SM_SAVE_DIR.
4) do a checkpoint for another session name, say bar:
   the old fvwm file (for foo) stays and a new one (for bar) appears


So if you see more fvwm save files in your SM_SAVE_DIR than you
have named sessions, there must be some problem with your session 
manager not handling DiscardCommand properly, I guess...

   8117 modules/FvwmGtk/gtk.m4

so including gtk.m4 in acinclude.m4 would more than double
its size, but it still wouldn't be too huge. I you think 
doing it this way is better, I'll do it.

I think the GNOME/Gtk folks have it right here.  The instructions are
always to run 'autogen.sh'; this does whatever is necessary.

If you're waiting for prior approval before starting, you'll be waiting a
long time; there's no entity that gives out approval for projects.  If
you've got a good idea: implement it and show the world!  Put up the
world's best FVWM web site, and then see what happens.

I like the idea of making things easier and appealing to newbies.  Jazzing
up the web pages with screenshots is a good idea.  Having nice coherent
config samples is a good idea.  Maybe each screenshot could be linked to
the config that generated it.  (Or is this what "themes" is doing?  I'm
really behind the times with that stuff.)  

Coming up with a good GUI configuration tool is *very* high on my list of
good ideas.  It needn't be comprehensive.  I'd be happy enough if I could
just rearrange my menus without editing the damn config file!

OK, let's focus on system config files, then.

Uh...  If we're talking about _installing_ system config files, then I
definitely *don't* want the FVWM install writing them into
$HOME/anything!!

If you're talking about something else, then I'm completely lost.

Actually I do care.  I think config files should *never* begin with a dot. 
Ever.  No matter where they get installed. 

Dotfiles in system directories are too easy to forget about, and get
surprised by later on.  (It happens to me, at any rate.)

Part of the problem is the unresolved issue of whether the files in
question are CONFIG files or SCRIPT files.

Certainly "system.fvwm2rc" is a config file.  Admins will want to
customize it.  Often (?) people will customize it on a per-machine basis. 
I do this, at any rate: I use winterms on SGIs instead of xterms (IRIX
xterms use huge fonts by default, which I haven't yet learned how to
cure). 

Thus system.fvwm2rc belongs in the $sysconfdir.  Whether it goes directly
into $sysconf, or into $sysconf/fvwm is a matter of how many config files
we install.  If system.fvwm2rc is the only one, it belongs directly in
$sysconfdir.

The other files in question are the forms for FvwmForms.  Are these config
files?  Will site admins want to customize them?  On a per-machine basis? 
I dunno for sure, but the samples currently in the repository look pretty
generic to me. 

They _look_ more akin to a script, to me.  My feeling is that we ought to
treat them as scripts; i.e., as data shareable across architectures.  If
you buy this argument, they don't belong in $sysconfdir at all, but rather
in $datadir.  In $datadir/fvwm, in fact, since we're installing many
files.  BUT NO LEADING DOTS, PLEASE!  :)

I'm starting to agree.  Creating an autogen script could also take care of
Matthais' problem of remembering the '-I' option to aclocal.

As Steve so correctly points out, you can't  rely on getting feedback.
If you believe  what you are creating has  merit, keep at it  and keep
telling us  about it.  We  have some logo  submitters on the list that
must feel the same way.

We need lots of work on configuration, themes are one part of it.

When posting things, make  it clear what  you want.  If you want links
to your site,  say so.  If you  want to change parts  of the fvwm  web
pages, try submitting patches.  If you feel  like you've been ignored,
be persistent.

Why are  you asking?  Is  there  some drawback I    don't see?  I  was
thinking of making the  same change  myself  (I thought it  might help
performance.)  If it breaks some modules, now is the time to do it.

Hiya Guys!

It might be nice if we were able to consolidate the WindowList
function and FvwmWinList module into one module/function, wouldn't it?

Just a thought....

This one uses the new form of the MenuStyle command, and makes the
relevant part of the code much nicer.  Just pipe this mail into patch
whilst in the utils directory ;-)  It's a patch against the latest
version of fvwmrc_convert (at least, the 2.2 version with my previous
patches applied 8-)  It's now 41 lines shorter; how many patches can
say that?!

No, it wouldn't.

:)

Actually, back when FvwmWinList was introduced, I think the builtin
winlist was removed or deactivated.  There was _great_ wailing and
gnashing of teeth.

The module is cool and has many nice features, but it's (IMO) _too_slow_
for a popup menu.  Builtin all the way, baby!

I thought about this a bit and came up with some more ideas.
Why should you only bind shortcuts on the fly to windows?
There is no reason why you shouldn't be able to bind often
used menus, functions or applications:


To bind windows or menus:

  # current menu or window
  Shortcut Key F1, Action ...

  # current window
  Shortcut CurrentWindow, Key F1, Action ...

  # preload a window that matches options (like in 'Next')
  Shortcut Window (options), Key F1, Action ...

  # current menu
  Shortcut CurrentMenu, Key F1, Action ...

  # preload a named menu
  Shortcut Menu <name>, Key F1, Action ...


To bind the last application that was started with 'Exec'
(i.e. store/recall the last 'exec' command).

  Shortcut LastApplication, Key F1


To bind the last executed function:

  Shortcut LastFunction, Key F1


And not quite the same, but related:
Repeat the last (top level) function

  RepeatFunction
  

I really think this idea has great potential. Any ideas how
to improve this even more?

Bye

My fault. I just learned that in 'a & b == c' the '==' is evaluated
first.

I've been discussing that in private with Patrick in the last weeks
(he wanted it so). It hasn't been forgotten. The contest should start
soon now.

Finally I figured out what is happening. It's very simple. Binding
buttons to swallowed windows simply hasn't been implemented. The
problem is that you'd have to grab the buttons in a rectangle
within the buttons window. I guess if we're going to change that
we need to reparent the application a second time so that
FvwmButtons can grab different buttons for each swallowed window.

I see two possibilities:

1) Change the manpage/FAQ to reflect the current state (easy, fast
   but not very nice).

2) Someone else tries to implement it (sorry, I still couldn't fetch
   a copy of those X books, so I could only guess what to do).

I'd prefer (2). Is anybody willing to do this?

Bye

The "map/unmap" logic in FvwmForm demonstrates how fast a module
like this can go.  Its not as fast as a menu, but I don't have a builtin
FvwmForm to compare it to.

I know you can use pixmaps in FvwmButtons, but IMHO it would be nicer
(and more consistent with the other parts) if it would also be
possible to {V,H,B,D}Gradient buttons in FvwmButtons.

Anyone who has some time and knowledge to do this?

Cheers,
-Ives

Nothing like a little "sudden motivation" :) .  Actually, my linux box
DIED!   So i took the opportunity to go out and buy a new machine.  All
I'll say is that it's blue, not an iMac, and doesn't run linux yet... 
But I'll deal :)

However, I'm now settled in and getting ready to upload v. 1.1 of the
logo page to someplace semi-public for your approval.  Once I get a yea
or nea, I'll upload the pages to 

    http://www.asclock.org, 

which will be officially sponsoring the contest (if/when it happens)
(thanks Beat).


Contest.gimp.org is a little strict on it's "requirements" e.g. you can
only use Gimp, and no Adobe products, etc...

It's ok to evangelize the Gimp, but that doesn't help me or us here.

I've brought this up before and agree completely.  We need to make the
pages look friendly yet professional.   They also need to be easy to maintain.

Dear Dominik,  thanks for responding.  I don't know exactly what I was
doing wrong.  But I agree somehow I got the fvwm95 crap on my machine. 
I've just installed slackware set up my fvwm2.  But your hints helped me
to configure in 5 minutes the fvwm2rc file to get my display up close to
what I want.  Of course now I'll tinker for hours.  I'll then replace
the .fvwmrc pointed to on

Oh,  the only thing that took  a while was figuring where the
system.fvwm2rc file was located.  On slackware it was down the /var/X...
path and not under /usr/X...    Again thanks.

I was just having a look at the Enlightenment web page and noticed
they have a way to download a current development snapshot. Wouldn't
this be a good idea for fvwm too? Often we tell people to fetch
the current CVS source, but many would have to install CVS first
and learn using it. Why not build a snapshot of CVS once or
twice every day and put a link to it on the web page?

I'm not sure when but some time between release of 2.2 and current CVS
the focus on startup stuff got broken.  I really don't remember where
this happens in the code so maybe someone else could take a look

I just didn't feel too comfortable with replacing one of the central
routines for fvwm<->module communication without asking first. I'll commit
the atomic version tonight from home.

my soon-to-be-in-CVS Gtk module does menus and dialogs this way too.
Its fast enough, I think.

This idea has merit, though twice a day seems overkill to me.

    user: "I just downloaded today's snapshot, but I'm having problem ..."
    developer: "Was that the morning or afternoon snapshot?"

;-)

If someone wants to do this, it is pretty easy.  You need to have a
directory for snapshot sources that is separate from your development
directory.  Then:

	cd <snapshot-sources>
	cvs update
	make && \
	  make dist VERSION=snapshot && \
	  cp fvwm-snapshot.tar.gz <wherever> && \
	  cp ChangeLog NEWS <wherever>

This method has the important advantage that the snapshot tarball does not
need all the GNU tools to use!

Of course, you can play around with date to generate a better version
string, if you fancy that.  

One possible wrinkle is that snapshot will not be generated if the sources
fail to build.  You need to do "make" before "make dist" otherwise the
dependency info could be messed up, which could be a real pain to sort out
via email.

My vote goes for once a week or something similar, that way you (The
developers) get time to fix bugs people report and people get time to
thoroughly test stuff. Still you don't have to be rigidly tied to that
schedule. You can for instance say you will release at least one
snapshot a week, but if a major bug occurs you can release one mid-week.

Just my 2p

And the date should be reflected in the filename.

I thought of it not as a way to distribute the code but for easy
access to the current development sources. It should be clearly
marked as **instable** and for developers only (and of course to
verify that bugs have gone away).

Jay,

we need that GNOME patch in the CVS tree real soon. I tried to
apply this, but lots of stuff has changed in CVS already and I
have no hope of merging that myself. Could you please make an
updated patch soon? Please put your changes in '#ifdef GNOME'.
The session and layer support from the version on your web
page is already in, so these shouldn't be ifdef'd.

Bye

Dominik

OK, I use XEmacs to look at so many things, that the hidden file issue

The forms are different from system.fvwm2rc in  that we are installing
them.  I  think they are usable  as is, and it would   be folly for an
administrator  to modify them and not  change the name, as our install
will "correct" any modifications the administrator makes.

I do envision individual users making  copies in their home directory,
under the same name.  This is what led me to include the dot.  I think
this ability is necessary.  As  we get more  and more configuration in
place,  there  will be  the need  to  override parts of  it.  Maybe we
should just  ignore this issue and  change read  to search $HOME/.fvwm
first.

I think they are in datadir,  but not in  $datadir/fvwm.  I'm not sure
why our configure script isn't creating  a fvwm directory to drop them
into.

I'm not sure how to accomodate having the same file in $HOME with dots
and $datadir  without dots.  If I change  the read function, I will be
changing existing  behavior.  That  change  won't affect  me...maybe I
don't  care.  Again,  a non-issue if  $HOME/.fvwm is  made the default
location.

If I get around to it, I'll be adding another form soon, probably with
a leading dot.  (I'll clean up the mess soon.)

I don't think its a question of prominence, its more a question of whether
fvwm.org will keep/update/generate its own _blessed_ examples and screenshots
(BTW: when I say fvwm.org I mean the users and the list)

I have seen a few .fvwm2rc sniplets in the mailing list that I wouldn't be
able to find anywhere on the 'net.  I usually end-up downloading those
sniplets to just _see_ what the effect looks like (screenshots would
come in handy), but the point is there is alot more expertise on the
list than there is on a third-party web-sites.

To be more specific on "why links aren't good enough", consider this.
Whenever I (and I'd assume others) download a package I try to _never_
surf the links in search of information especially if I am at the mother-ship
site ;-)  In other words, when I go to fvwm.org and download fvwm-2.4.0 ;-)
I will not follow a link to some third party to see how to use that package
and to get examples (and screenshots) of this new release.  I would expect
that the examples and screenshots relating to this new release would be
explained in the "what's new in 2.4.0 release" section of the
"Screenshots & Examples" portion of the mother-ship's web-page.

Having most everything that is relevant in one _blessed_ (fvwm.org) place
gives it more importance and shows that its been looked over by "experts" in
the field.  That doesn't say that we shouldn't have links, but they are
usually secondary in case one is looking for _even_ more info.

Hosting the website is no problem if we keep the gifs distributed.
This means, like the themes-submit page on www.asclock.org, people will
have to host their own logo's on their own websites.

I can also hack together some code for instant voting + on-site thumbnails
of logo-entries.

Please tell me if that is acceptable.

I think I'm a little too dangerous with awk to attempt a fix.
I'm on Solaris 2.5.1, and /bin/awk is the first awk in my PATH.

Jay, the "cat" logo is pretty neat.  It does look strangely
familiar, is this original work, or a rip off of something someone
owns?

	It is original work of a friend of mine.  It grew out of a
conversation about the Feline Virtual Window Manager.  It is also free for
the Fvwm Development team to use as we please.

I'll get the #ifdefs in tonight for the GNOME patch and intigrate it into
the current HEAD of the CVS tree.

Yeah, that's automatic if you set VERSION.

Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'!

Since I broke it, I guess I'll fix it.

The work-around for now is: just re-run make.  Even though 'awk' failed,
the file is still created, due to the output re-direction.

[Putting another awk -- like GNU awk -- near the front your path also
works.]

Ah, but that will change!  I'm about to write an install rule to install a
suitably-generic system.fvwmrc *if and only if* the system does not
already have one.  This should make first time installers happy, and not
bother the rest of us.

So we agree, then, that they ought to be put into $datadir.  Great!

Ugh.  I know that people will be really unhappy with a hardcoded .fvwm.

Because we didn't write it that way?  :-)

I think this begs the question: why are the forms written in fvwm
configurease?  

Why not have the config file say things like:

AddToMenu Module-Popup  "FvwmModules"   Title

...
+                       "Form - Rlogin"      Module FvwmForm Rlogin.form

And stick the form definition into "Rlogin.form"?  The module can search
for this file however it likes -- independent of fvwm's ReadFile()
function.

This is simple for the user to override with "FvwmForm .Rlogin.form" or
"FvwmForm .fvwm/Rlogin.form", as they see fit.

Perhaps the module would also have a "*FvwmFormPath" option to set a
search path.

How difficult would it be to trigger an event (such as EnterNotify) on the
title-bar buttons?

I took a look at the title-bar related stuff in events.c and everything
seems to be set up to pass all events to the frame.  Why is this, and is
it then possible to catch EnterNotify events on the buttons?

The reason I am asking is related to a message someone sent, mentioning
pop-up-type balloon help.  I got to thinking about this and thought that a
Balloon-popup type thing would be great to have.  Obviously it is the
perfect candidate for a module (it doesn't really belong in fvwm-core), a
FvwmBaloon module.  Unfortunately FVWM's structure now doesn't lend itself
to non-key, non-click events.  

I would like to see the event-capability and module-capability expanded.
I think that if we could add EnterNotify/LeaveNotify Events (at least on
TitleButtons) we would open up the door for some really cool
extension-type modules.  

Thoughts?

Jay

I've been having a strange problem for about a week and a half - since
about the time the new ImagePath command went in.

	If I specify

ImagePath   /usr/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps

(merging the previous PixmapPath and IconPath statements), FVWM almost
always dies in startup - or more properly, the first time it tries to
start a module (I start up the Pager from my Init and Restart
functions). It usually fails with an error in safemalloc, which just
exits. Putting a deliberate segfault in safemalloc's failure path, I get
the following stack trace:

(gdb) bt
#0  0x80736f1 in safemalloc ()
#1  0x806710e in make_named_packet ()
#2  0x806717a in SendName ()
#3  0x8066338 in SendDataToModule ()
#4  0x805ae56 in ExecuteFunction ()
#5  0x8066c88 in HandleModuleInput ()
#6  0x805a6c2 in My_XNextEvent ()
#7  0x8058936 in HandleEvents ()
#8  0x805c6b0 in main ()
#9  0x804b3ee in ___crt_dummy__ ()
(gdb)

A little backtracking shows FVWM handling a Send_ConfigInfo request from
the module when this happens, and sending the ImagePath string to the
module.

	A couple of times I've gotten a segfault instead of this error, but I
haven't found a way to reproduce it reliably, so I have no debug
information on that.

	If I remove the module startup from InitFunc, the problem is simply
postponed till the first time (usually) that I start a module.

	If I don't specify ImagePath, the problem goes away (but, of course, my
window decorations get a bit plainer). It seems to be related to the
length of the ImagePath, not the fact that it has 2 directories. I tried
using one very long name symlinked to /usr/include/X11/pixmaps, and I
got the failure; with two very short names symlinked to these
directories -
no problem.

	Hoping to see a change in the pattern that might give me a clue, I
tried using a minimal .fvwm2rc. I removed all decors and menu styles and
almost all menus and functions (I have a lot). The result was the same.

	Since I've not seen anyone else mention a similar problem, I began to
suspect my system configuration (Linux, libc5.4.44), but it's been
rock-solid for quite a long time. It could still be the source of the
problem, but I doubt it.

	Does anyone have any idea what might have gone wrong? The last version
that I have saved that was relatively stable was from around March 4 -
shortly before the change to ImagePath went in, I believe.

Hey gang,

So just after the 2.2 release, there was a short thread on future goals.
This is the last list I saw:

	* remove auto*-built files from CVS

Done.

	* remove modules/extras distinction

Done.

	* remove icons to a separate distribution

Is there anyone besides me that thinks this is a good idea?

	* move code duplicated in many modules into a library

Presumably this happens gradually.  People working on module code are
keeping this in mind, right? 

	* experiment with shared library for libfvwm

I experimented with this on the weekend.  It was not an unqualified
success, though.  We can discuss this in a separate thread.

	* Turn on the GSFR code and fix whatever it breaks.

I saw some discussion about this, but I don't think anything has been
committed, right?

	* Evaluate the backlog of new style ideas.

?

	* Add animated windowshade.

This is in, according to the NEWS.

	* Reuse FvwmWindow struct on Recapture.

?

	* The GNOME hint stuff.

?

 	* include OpenVMS port

Done.

	* Get 2.4 out within a few months.

The NEWS file has a load of entries in it.  Is there a reason not to make
a beta 2.3.1 release this week?  Someone will have to fix the "awk
problem"  first, of course. 

Were there other goals that I missed?

Indeed, it appears that at some point from 2.0.46 to 2.2.0 this got
changed... Hurrah.

While I was hacking at the order drawing code I had similar thoughts.  I
think the path of least bloat for fvwm is to extend it to pass on the
window IDs of the frame decorations, title bar and buttons in the
configure_window module message. A module could then ask for enter
notify events on those windows and pop up a suitable balloon message a
short time after the mouse stops moving in the button. What to put in
the message is tricky, just the function name isn't going to be much
help (I bind my_titlefunc to my title bars). It's probably best to just
have the balloon text in the module config.

I had thought about a ModuleDecorate style option that would tell fvwm
to not draw anything in the borders and let a module do all the drawing
but it will have to wait until after the GSFR.

I think this is achievable just by informing the module of the window
id's of the buttons and letting it select for enter/expose/click events.
The module would do all the visual stuff and fvwm would just do the
function calling.

NB I changed the resize handle windows to be InputOnly recently, I was
going to do the same to the title bar and buttons but chickened out
because it would probably end up breaking backward compatibility with
UseTitleStyle for the buttons and it would be very difficult to avoid
flickering the title bar and buttons if they didn't share the same
background as the border.

Being InputOnly means you have to draw in the frame and it may have been
a mistake but it made it easier to do the border drawing and it means
the DGradient borders are simpler to implement (left as an exercise for
the reader 8-)
> 
> Thoughts?
> 
I'd really like to have a bit more flexibility in the border layout and
a module may be the way to do it without bloating fvwm.  There's no
reason a module shouldn't be responsible for doing the graphics in the
window frame, with a few more fields in the FvwmWindow struct and a
couple of commands to set border widths, a module could set the border
size and move the title bar and buttons around in the frame. You could
have the buttons down the left hand side and the title bar on the bottom
if you want (with a stock ticker running along the top of the focussed
window, and your current CD track title down the right!)

Cheers,
Tim.

Ah! Fantastic! We will want some configure option too. That's
a task for our automake/autoconf experts. The GNOME support
seems to require that session support is compiled in too. How
can we do this with configure?

After the 4-state stuff, one minor patch is still needed.. I have a
working version in my copy, but it's a little bit ugly (one global var
existing in 2 files). The other ways I can do it in results in either an
api-break (called from ~30 places) or code duplication (~300 lines),
which can bring them out-of-sync if stuff is changed.
Will commit any day now.

Jay was cleaning this up and was committing any day, according to his
mail to fvwm-workers.

A list of outstanding problems:

* Bad  window size,  or  something else that  put  rxvt into a  memory
consumption binge with windowshade.

* "+" commands are acting up causing the "dot problem".

* Something awry with the ImagePath.

* FvwmForm data  files not installed in "fvwm" subdirectory.

* FvwmForm data files have a leading dot.

Could we decide on a better name for the Replace function that was
posted in a patch and then put that in?  How about Place or PlaceAgain?

Cheers,

I meant beta.  

I thought that the CVS sources are the "alpha releases", and feature
freezes came in when a "real release" (i.e. 2.4.0) was near.

Hmm, our practice with 2.1.x/2.2 was differently. We called only
those labels 'beta' that were announced and intended for the masses.
Several releases were clearly marked as 'alpha' (e.g. 2.1.5, 2.1.6).
Not that I really care how we call them, but someone
might think 2.3.1 is similarly stable as 2.1.13 if they are both
called 'beta'. The open source community has become used to think
of 'beta' as equivalent to 'stable enough'. We don't want that right
now, do we?

Can you send me the minimal config that exhibits the problem?  I have been
running CVS versions of fvwm without apparent problems.  I also have linux
libc 5.4.44, and start FvwmPager from init and restart, with a long
ImagePath.

Another global variable?  Hmm...

Using a global variable rather than changing 30 function calls is likely a
false economy, is it not?  Using globals means one cannot understand or
modify the function in isolation.  It becomes hell to maintain.  

You note that the global only "exists" in two files, currently.  Global
references have a tendency to spread and infect other files.  Moreover,
there is no way to enforce that only two files reference the global.  So
even if you document this fact, someone could (will?) break the rules
later on.  When I go to modify the function using the global, I can't
trust your documentation, and have to search through the sources anyway!

If we want the code to be maintainable, I think one ought to be
re-designing the internals to eliminate globals, rather than increase
their number.  As far as I am concerned, any "internal api" is fair game
to be changed.  It is only documented in the source, anyway.  Changing the
module interface is more problematical, but it should not be a sacred cow,
neither.

Is GNOME detectable, or is GNOME support strictly a build-time option?

Finally we have a volunteer ;-) Yes, I agree 150%. The globals have
to be removed. I'm constantly striving to reduce usage of globals or
at least make them static in their modules, but it's a hard job. Did
you ever look at FvwmButtons or FvwmTaskBar? That's kind of
discouraging. I'll happily support anyone writing documentation on
this or doing some cleanup.

	Nope. The stacking order handling was changed in 2.2 to honor
sociopathic (override_redirect) windows by not raising FVWM-managed
windows above them. 

	This is a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't situation. The
change eliminates an often-reported problem with Motif menus getting
hidden because autoraise raised their main windows above them, and a few
other things as well. Unfortunately, it leaves you more exposed to the
unpleasantries of the, um, anal-retentive school of gui programming.

	We'll be including an option in the next release to allow you to revert
to the old stacking order handling, if that works better for you.
There's a patch on my Unofficial Patches page to do this, but it needs
updating for the 2.2 base (been trying to get around to this for a
couple of weeks!) - the mods to misc.c don't quite fit anymore.

	I'll try to get this updated soon. If you feel comfortable hacking the
sources and fitting patches in by hand, the patch can be found at

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/NoAvoidUnmanaged.patch

I'll post a note when I've updated it.

Well, with the number of libraries GNOME requires surely there are some
that can be detected.

Then the question becomes, is it worthwhile to allow the user to disable
this support even if the requisite libraries are found?  Will it cause
any issues if run in a non-GNOME environment?

We can always grab a copy of snprintf from the GNU dists, if it's deemed
important.  Or maybe the code can be rewritten relatively easily to
avoid the need for snprintf(), I haven't looked.

it appears there is a problem with the new atomic SendText
I start fvwm with -cmd "FvwmM4 ... .fvwm2rc"
In the console I see KillModule 10, and then I just get the builtin default config.  So I know its killing my FvwmM4 module for some reson.  Reverting to the previous version of libs/Module.c fixed my problem, so not to point fingers (the Changelog points them for me)  can we work around Matthias' need for an atomic SendText and a working startup.

Perhaps code bloat? Personally I'd compile GNOME out (and KDE support
for that matter). Having a switch won't hurt for now. If we change
our mind we can easily remove some of the switches. Some of the
switches have been compromised anyway (e.g. multistyle doesn't
cover the MenuStyle rework).

The idea of enabling modules to draw the decorations sounds neat,
but the decoration you describe sounds too "enlighted" :-)

A fix will go in tonight. FYI: the problem was that every Style command
would override the layer, even if no explicit layer was given, thus

Style "*" Layer n

works as expected, but any layer Style "*" without explicit layer
option would bring everything back to layer 0. Fixing it requires
an extra has_layer flag in struct name_list. Unfortunatly, there was
no room in the unsigned longs used for flags, thus Ill put in
a bitfield tmpflags similar to the one in FvwmWindow. I assume
that the GSFR will also turn the name_list flags into a bitfield ?

  sr> 	* remove icons to a separate distribution

  sr> Is there anyone besides me that thinks this is a good idea?

I'd prefer they not (all) be removed.  Certainly I think the icons
directory needs a good, stiff cleaning.  There's lots of stuff in there
which is either useless or only marginally useful.

But, I'd like fvwm to come with some basic set of icons and not require
them to be downloaded separately.  And I think that we need _more_ of
some kinds of icons, not less: mini-icons in particular, which are
harder to find on the 'net in my experience.  Most of the mini-icons I
use I've snarfed from the fvwm95 dist; they have a much nicer set of
icons than fvwm2.  Although, they have a lot more junk there too :).

Dominik committed an ifdef'd out first-whack at the GSFR bitfields.
I've looked at it and have been _trying_ to find the time to post some
comments...

  sr> 	* Evaluate the backlog of new style ideas.

  sr> ?

I don't necessarily think we need to implement a bunch of new styles in
the same release as the GSFR, "just because we can".  I'd prefer to get
a GNOME-aware release out with all the other new stuff we have, and
leave that kind of more "pie-in-the-sky" stuff until later.

Oops, I meant to ask about the use of these GNU extensions. 
I happen to like them. 

Id vote for conditionally including them in libfvwm on systems 
without them.

The message is a forgotten debug message in KillModule. 
The problem of FvwmM4 being killed sounds more serious. Ill look into
this at home.

snprintf() isn't a GNU extension; it's in SingleUNIX v2, for example,
although not in POSIX.1 I don't think.

  mc> without them.

We'd have to find a version.  Note that the one in glibc may well not be
usable, as it probably uses internal glibc functions etc.

Also, thinking about this further, note that this function isn't really
that easy to emulate without rewriting all of the *printf() features.
We can look into it, though.

If you want a GPL'd snprintf, you may need to get xsnprintf.c from the
Apache distribution.  glibc's snprintf makes a LOT of assumptions on how
printf is coded (it basically assumes you are using glibc for all
formatting).

I discovered this in another application that I was porting.

I believe the Apache source license would allow FVWM to co-opt it, but
you better check it to be sure.  The application that I was porting was
a private one and not commercially (or publically) distributed.

I recently posted the following to the fvwm mailing list. 

   Is there any way in the latest fvwm to use styles to have autoraise
   turned on/off selectively for different classes of windows?


The general consensus was that, with the current lack of linkage between 
styles and modules, this was not currently possible. Bob Woodside
<proteus@pcnet.com> suggested that I register the feature request in the
bug 
tracking system, so that it didn't get lost. 

Thanks for all the work on fvwm

Graham

Now that FvwmEvent can pass the window-id to the functions
it calls it would be useful if the WindowID command could
take an optional condition like the Current command.  This
would enable conditional auto-raise/auto-focus based on window
name/class/resource e.g.

*FvwmEventCmd
*FvwmEventPassID
*FvwmEvent add_window add_event
AddToFunc add_event I WindowID $0 (xterm) FlipFocus
+ I WindowID $0 ("Netscape Download") Iconify
+ I WindowID $0 ("Geocities Popup") Close

Hi,
if you start fvwm with the following command
	fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -debug -m4-prefix -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwm2rc"
to get m4 processing, the logic in modules/FvwmM4/FvwmM4.c which emits an
m4
changequote command, forgets that it needs to prepend a 'm4_' because of
the
-m4-prefix option.

Here is the patch I applied to FvwmM4 to correct the problem. And an
entry for the modules/ChangeLog file.

Enjoy,
nathan

     I'll send it to you this evening.

     Maybe I'll try to minimalize it a little more, too. My current
.fvwm2rc
is little more than a series of Reads of a bunch of other files that do the
real work.

Here's Purify   output on the latest  CVS.   The  "Array bounds write"
shows where  the image path problem is,  and I think the "Array bounds
reads" may have something to do with the atomic send problem.

I haven't studied either yet.  (I don't want to take all the fun
away.)

Purify also complains that line 701 in misc.c is referencing
uninitialized data.  I think it may be right:

misc.c 701 :  if (!pops->flags.f.has_poshints && fValidPosHints) {

Declaration of "pops" as "mops" in builtins.c line 994:

  MenuOptions mops;

Initialization at line 998:

  mops.flags.allflags = 0;

Wouldn't:

memset(mops, 0, sizeof(mops);

be the way to go?

I don't have any symptom to relate this to.

I'm working on some updates to cvs.html and I notice we have categories
for adding and deleting files, but no instructions for renaming files.
Since I'm going to try to do some renaming in the near future, can we
decide what method we want to use for this?  Then I'll write it down.

What have we used in the past, and is that how we want to recommend we
do it in the future?

I've done some renaming in the past.  The method is to delete and add.

If you install system.fvwmrc, by definition, it has to be installed
in FVWM_CONFIGDIR, or the "read" command isn't going to find it.
Currently FVWM_CONFIGDIR is what configure is calling $SYSCONF.

They may be shareable, but they are being read with the fvwm2 "read"
command, so unless someone comes up with another idea, I think I have
to move them back to FVWM_CONFIGDIR ($SYSCONF).

I think using the "read" command is the right  thing to do to read the
form  definition in  FvwmForm.   They   contain module  commands,  and
regular  fvwm2 commands, and  I thought they should   go thru fvwm2 on
their way to FvwmForm.

The current logic for unqualified names looks to me like 
$HOME/ANYTHING, $SYSCONF/ANYTHING.

There are performance impacts in looking in too many places.

How about:

1. During fvwm2 startup look for a $HOME/.fvwm directory.
If found, "export FVWM_USERHOME=$HOME/.fvwm/"
otherwise, "	export FVWM_USERHOME=$HOME/".

2. Change "read" to read $FVWM_USERHOME/ANYTHING, $SYSCONF/ANYTHING.

3. Extra credit, a command that sets $FVWM_USERHOME.

The current "save" logic in FvwmForm is an "echo" in a shell.
Having the environment variable, makes it pretty easy to write
in either place.

The only useful thing to know is that the delete should note the name of
the new file and the add should note the name of the new file:

cvs delete -m "Renamed to newfile" oldfile
cvs add -m "Renamed from oldfile" newfile

(I think...)

	Well, I finally chopped the .fvwm2rc down to the bare bones, a bit at a
time, to no avail. The minimal .fvwm2rc is attached as the first
attachment, and the output from the test run as the second.

	In the process of cutting things out, I did manage to get a couple of
the real segfaults (as opposed to my manufactured one in safemalloc).
For these, gdb always shows a stack trace something like this:


#0  0x4017375e in __libc_free (mem=0x616d7869)
(gdb) bt
#0  0x4017375e in __libc_free (mem=0x616d7869)

    action=0x756c636e <Address 0x756c636e out of bounds>,
Module=0x582f6564)
    at modconf.c:157

Hmmm...stack smash in SendDataToModule...? Matter of fact, it does look
a bit fishy: check the line with the "Fixme" note.

Oops, that last part should be: "export FVWM_USERHOME=$HOME."

And this part should be: $(FVWM_USERHOME)ANYTHING, $SYSCONF/ANYTHING.

That is, deal with the dot and the subdirectory with the same
mechanism.

OK.  Seems a shame to break the history; the renamed file looks like a
brand new file in this scheme, instead of the old file renamed.

There are fancier methods, all with various advantages and drawbacks,
discussed in the CVS manual (which is why I asked) but if this is the
way we're going that's OK w/ me :).

Too bad CVS hasn't implemented directory versioning--ClearCase has the
most kick-butt implementation of this I've ever seen (and I've seen a
lot of these :).  It's completely excellent.  You can rearrange the
entire tree to look completely different, including renaming files,
moving files, etc., and switch back and forth from old to new with a
flick of a file.  _And_ all history, labels, merge arrows, etc. are
perfectly preserved.  Nice.  But, big $$$ too :).

	Good ol' Purify! Wish I had it. I hadn't read your message before I
sent my reply to Steve, but it certainly looks like we're on the trail
of the culprit now. I feel much more confident that I haven't been
hallucinating.

	Of course, I was too busy trying to figure out what was happening with
ImagePath to follow any atomic send discussion. Oh, well, back to the
archives...

Submission from: (NULL) (157.95.212.5)


Mouse 2 W M Move

Does not recognize the Sun meta key.  It maps instead to Alt, i.e. the
above
mouse binding causes Alt-Button2 to perform a move and meta-Button2 is
passed
to the Xserver (not sure if that's the correct lingo).  I tried using
xev to see what the meta key shows up as.  xev reports up and down events
on Meta_L
(and Meta_R for the right meta key) correctly.

G'day,

I seem to have a problem getting ./configure to
successfully locate the XPM lib and header files
are installed in a non standard place.

The software tree is namely /gppr/local,
under which is a "stow" based installed GNU tree.

Now for the XPM library location:

[578][08:09:22][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/lib
$ ls -la libXpm.*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 ekxran   ekxadm        37 Sep 23 11:36 libXpm.a ->
../stow/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib/libXpm.a
lrwxrwxrwx   1 ekxran   ekxadm        38 Sep 23 11:36 libXpm.so ->
../stow/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib/libXpm.so
lrwxrwxrwx   1 ekxran   ekxadm        43 Sep 23 11:36 libXpm.so.4.11 ->
../stow/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib/libXpm.so.4.11

and these exist: ...

[579][08:09:38][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/lib
$ ls -laL libXpm.*
-rw-rw-r--   1 ekxran   ekxadm     83380 Mar 19  1998 libXpm.a
-rw-rw-r--   1 ekxran   ekxadm     63956 Mar 19  1998 libXpm.so
-rw-rw-r--   1 ekxran   ekxadm     63956 Mar 19  1998 libXpm.so.4.11

For the XPM include header file:

[511][08:15:15][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/include/X11
$ ls -la xpm.h
lrwxrwxrwx   1 ekxran   ekxadm        45 Sep 23 11:36 xpm.h ->
../../stow/xpm-3.4k-solaris/include/X11/xpm.h

And this file exists:

[512][08:15:23][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/include/X11
$ ls -laL xpm.h
-r--rw-r--   1 ekxran   ekxadm     16644 Mar 19  1998 xpm.h

Just a test using bash ...

[515][08:19:43][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/include/X11
$ if [ -f xpm.h ] ; then echo YES ;else echo NO ; fi
YES
[516][08:19:51][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/include/X11
$ if [ -L xpm.h ] ; then echo YES ;else echo NO ; fi
YES
[517][08:20:05][ekxran@sun3e030] /gppr/local/include/X11
$ if [ -x xpm.h ] ; then echo YES ;else echo NO ; fi
NO


According to ./configure -help:

  --with-xpm-library=PATH   use xpm library (for coloured or shaped icons)
  --with-xpm-includes=DIR  set directory for xpm headers


Now, when I do a ./configure in /gppr/local/src/fvwm-2.2
with the following options:

./configure --prefix=/gppr/local --enable-extras \
--with-xpm-library=/gppr/local/lib  \
--with-xpm-includes=/gppr/local/include/X11 \
--with-rplay-library=/gppr/local/lib \

No. The problem lies within GetMenuOptions itself. The flags variable
is only initialised if action != NULL (lines 547 and 550):

-->  while (action != NULL) {
       /* ^ just to be able to jump to end of loop without 'goto' */
       gflags = NoValue;
-->    pops->flags.allflags = 0;

This has to be copied to the line before the loop:

-->  pops->flags.allflags = 0;
     while (action != NULL) {
       /* ^ just to be able to jump to end of loop without 'goto' */
       gflags = NoValue;
       pops->flags.allflags = 0;

Could you apply and test this?

Bye

At first I didn't want to comment on this thread, but now that you start
recommending ClearCase as a good tool for directory versioning I have
to disagree. In theory it can do all you describe, but when it comes
down to versioning branch directories it's heavily buggy. You can get
a host of unwanted effects (like seeing a file of a different branch
or even three different versions in just two branches). And don't
let us speak about being able to delete files without checking out
the directory. ClearCase has given me a lot more headaches than CVS
has, and I use CVS much more often.

Its part of glib, thus part of gtk. It should be present if configure
thinks that gtk is there. (I'm not fond of the "g_"-madness going
on in glib, but using g_snprintf seems to be a cheap way to avoid
problems with snprintf in FvwmGtk. )

After applying this, I get the same UMRs.

I'm still not looking closely, but isn't "pops->flags.allflags"
a different area than "pops->flags.f.has_poshints" which is the
area Purify is complaining about?  Note that "allflags"
is initialized in the calling routine.

Well I checked against the current CVS and the atomic send problem is
still there.  But I don't to see any more array bound errors anymore
just UMR's from the XCalls at startup (as expected).

So either I'm not getting far enough into a config to see the array
problems or they have been fixed but either way

________________________________________________________________________
And to recap for those not following the problem was with the new atomic
SendText when I start up fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 ..." I see a kiillModule 10
(left over printf in killModule), which means by M4 is getting killed
without doing anything at all, so I just get the builtin config.

No, it's a union. I'll have to take a closer look at home.

No, it isn't.  Versioning and branching directories works exactly as it
should, once you grok the logic (which is almost identical to how UNIX
filesystems work, handily enough), and is actually much simpler than
versioning and branching files (mainly because merging directories is
always simple).

This is 'way offtopic and we can continue it offline, but I've been
using ClearCase intensively every day for almost 4 years now.  I've
implemented a sophisticated (if I do say so myself :) changeset system
on top of it, so I know a lot about the nooks and crannies.  I've also
used a lot of other systems, from raw SCCS and RCS, to PVCS, to CVS, to
Perforce, to various free and homegrown systems.

Our changeset process makes _extensive_ use of branches, including
directory branches; you can't add, remove, or move a file without
branching a directory or two.  We have almost 10,000 branch types in our
largest project right now, and we add more every day.  Works perfectly.

ClearCase has some serious problem areas, without question, but this
(directory branching/versioning) is not one of them.  There is only one
possible hazard with branching directories, and it's both unavoidable
(IMO) and easily handled by installing a trigger script.

I've been using it since ClearCase 2.0 was released (1995); I've heard
that CC 1.0 had some very strange "features"; maybe that's what you're
thinking of?  It's come a _long_ way since then.

  dv> You can get a host of unwanted effects (like seeing a file of a
  dv> different branch or even three different versions in just two
  dv> branches).

Only one version of a file or directory can ever be selected by the
view (config spec) at one time.

If you construct your config spec specifically to see different files on
different branches at the same time, then you certainly can do so.  This
is a feature: for example, unlike CVS where when you create a branch all
the master files in the repository have a branch created, in ClearCase
typically branches are only created for files which actually change on
the branch: the config spec provides you with a "cascading selection"
mechanism to deal with this.  This is 'way cool, for lots of reasons.

The config spec is very flexible.  Playing with its more powerful
features, like time-based rules, etc., can definitely create some odd
effects, I admit.

  dv> And don't let us speak about being able to delete files without
  dv> checking out the directory.

I'm not sure what issue you are trying to bring out here: you cannot
"rmname" ClearCase elements without checking out the directory--are you
saying that's good or bad?

Removing (or moving or renaming) an element in ClearCase, just like the
UNIX filesystem, actually modifies the directory the element is in (and
the target directory if you're moving it), not the element itself.
Certainly you can't modify any element, even a directory element,
without checking it out first.  This is A Good Thing (many would say).

  dv> ClearCase has given me a lot more headaches than CVS has, and I
  dv> use CVS much more often.

Correlation? :)

If CVS could do all the things ClearCase can, it would by necessity be
similarly complex.

Obviously if you don't need the complexity, then it's better to go with
something simpler.  We certainly don't need the complexity for
FVWM--although (full circle...) it would be nice to have real directory
versioning...  To paraphrase Yogi Berra, you never need the complexity
until you need it :).

I updated today and noticed that no modules (except FvwmTalk and

After a little digging I found some pointer-messing in
libs/Module.c:SendText ... My Solaris/Sparc box does _not_ like accesses
to unaligned pointers...

If I revert Module.c to v1.10, everything works..

this is the same problem I'm having its just that I only get as far as
running FvwmM4, which I just noticed does dump core however when I run
gdb this is what I get "/home/bgiaccio/core" is not a core dump: File
format not recognized

anyone see that before, yes I'm running the same build version of gcc
and gdb.

I understand the desire to keep the build process simple.  And it is an
important one.  But consider: 

1. We don't currently install icons anyway.  Neither did fvwm 2.0.46.  
   Removing icons to a separate distribution will affect the naive
   intaller only marginally.  Instead of

	./configure && make && make intall
	[starts fvwm] 
	"hey, why don't my icons work?"
	[reads docs]
	cp icons/* /usr/local/share/icons

   the sequence becomes

	./configure && make && make intall
	[starts fvwm] 
	"hey, why don't my icons work?"
	[reads docs]
	[downloads icons-1.0.0 from net, unpacks it]
	cd icons-1.0.0 && make install

2. This only affects the first-time install.  Subsequent intallations
   will use the old icons, no problem.

3. The icons directory is large and unchanging compared to the source
   code.  The icons take up more disk space (unpacked) than libs/ or
   any module, save one.  Since going to CVS, exactly one icon has been
   removed (due to copyrights) and one added.  Since 2.0.46 (about 
   a year and a half ago maybe?) only 13 icons (of about 140) have been
   added. 

4. Icons ought to be distributed with their applications, not the window
   manager.  Why?  Well suppose I have an emacs icon I like that came with
   emacs.  Suppose further that fvwm has its own emacs icon (it doesn't).
   If fvwm installs its icon over mine, I'm going to be pissed.  Yes, we
   can play games with not installing the icon if the same name already
   exists, or suggesting that admins keep their own icons in a separate
   place on the ImagePath.  But these just mask the initial flaw that the
   icons are associated with the *application* not the *window manager*,
   and should be distributed with the former.

5. Sharing icons with other window managers is a bit tricky.  Yes, we have
   an ImagePath, so fvwm will search more than one place for a given icon.  
   But suppose both fvwm and some other window manager, say 'f', come with 
   icons a.xpm and b.xpm.  How will you arrange the ImagePath if you like
   fvwm's version of a.xpm, but prefer f's version of b.xpm?  Yes, there
   are some obvious solutions, but you end up trying to do some kind of
   merging or pruning of icon sets.  Upon upgrading WMs, you're faced with 
   doing it all over again.

Which perhaps illustrates that the current icons are not adequate.  

Historically, icons weren't distributed with applications, and I know that
this is why WMs come with icons.  We could either spend energy keeping the
icons directory up-to-date, or promote the idea that icons belong to
applications.  Over time, the burden of providing icons will lift from
WMs, [he says, perhaps over-optimistically].

Of course it would be unrealistic to simply dump all the application icons
and leave it at that.  For one thing, if we wait for all application to
ship & intall icons, we'll be waiting a long long time.  For another: 
where would they install their icons anyway?  There's no real standard
that I know of; /usr/X11/include doesn't count -- the X11 include
directory is non-standard anyway, it doesn't typically hold non-xbm's, and
it is prone to getting wiped out during upgrades.  

So we need a collection of icons for existing applications.  And it needs
a mechanism for coordinating the install path with WM.  It would be nice
if it were WM-independent, but I'm not volunteering to do that ALONE, :-) 
though I would help in the effort.  If such a collection does not
materialize, I suggest as a first step to put icons useful to fvwm into
its own distribution, and put it up on fvwm.org.  I can't think it is
_such_ a burden to install the icons package for the first fvwm install. 

Certainly fvwm is an application, so any fvwm-specific icons should be
shipped AND INSTALLED by fvwm.  These won't disappear from the icons
directory.

Ouch!  No, no.  Very bad.  Will fail on any RISC processor.  Very
non-compliant C.

You're going to have to calculate the offset padded for integer
alignment.

I recommend s'thing like:

  * declare buf to be an array of long ints, not char.  This lets you
    index it as an integer array and ensure the offsets are
    appropriate.

  * when writing the message, add enough to the offset to handle the
    padding.

For example:

  long buf[256];    /* 1024 bytes where sizeof(long) == 4 */
  long *p = buf;
  int w;

  if (message == NULL)
    return;

  *(p++) = window;

  w = strlen(message);
  *(p++) = w;

  strncpy ((char *)p, message, 1000); /* bogus magic number :( */
  p += (w / sizeof(long)) + ((w % sizeof(long)) != 0);

  *(p++) = 1;

  write(fd[0], (char *)buf, (char *)p - (char *)buf);

Or something.  May require a little testing, this is totally untested :)

Providing Jason is willing to set up some way for us to create an
"icon" distribution I don't see any problem in separating it from
the main CVS tree.

It is the CVS tree you guys want to get it out of isn't it?

Or is it the distribution?  If its just the distribution, we
should be able to create the proceedures to create more than
1 tar file.

If we (you guys?) want it out of the main CVS tree, do you want
another CVS tree just for icons, or something else?

Can't you get configurable highlight using decors?

Oh, I just read the BorderStyle man section and it only allows
TiledPixmap so you can only get configurable hilight if you provide
pixmaps. And the shadow colours are calculated from the Hilight colour.

I think we should concentrate on making BorderStyle a bit more identical
to TitleStyle/ButtonStyle.

Tim.

I'd suggest

I was thing along those lines but I think we want a calloc a lot of
compilers don't allow variable size args in array declerations.

??

That's not variable.  sizeof() is evaluated at compile time, not
runtime, and the resulting expression is thus constant.

We do this kind of thing all the time.

There I go mixing programming languages again, just ignore me on this
one I got a little confused.  I've gotten in the habit of thinking of
evertyhing as a function and of course you are right the compiler takes
care of sizeof.

Matthias, could you put a few lines describing the
'session' compile optin into INSTALL.fvwm?

Ideally icons must be distributed with applications, but this will lead
to a set of icons of different size and style, so it will be hard to use
them on one desktop. So practically you need some set of icons in one
place and having fvwm-icons is not bad idea.

Actually current fvwm-icons are all of different size and style and not so
nice. IMHO massive clean-up must be done. Lets decide which icons do we
need (application icons, mini application icons, button icons, side menu
icons etc.) and choose at least their sizes, when possible. For example,
48x48 for desktop icons, 16x16 for mini icons. Voting? I think we must
drop all icons which are not of the chosen size and prepare new icon set.
Pat Rogan has interesting icons in fvwmiconpack.

I can help with this once we decide about which icons to have, if any.

Yes, you can, but this is a bit extreme for so simple a feature.

How embarassing! I've reported this 'bug' quite a while ago
and now (I've got a new machine and had to set up X again)
that I simply had my modelines screwed up so the rightmost
pixel column was not displayed. I guess I can close the
'bug' now.

I know it's been quite a while, but finally I found the time to check
the code. The reason is simple. There is no such option in FvwmTaskBar.
This must be a fvwm95 specific option.

At least on old SunOS, you had to run an xconsole to make it all really
go away.  Just start one -iconic and ignore it.

Oh ugh.  Readline isn't so bad, but now we can't build dists on anything
except a Linux box with gtk installed?

That seems like a Very Bad Thing...

Yes, I was thinking of this one. Is there any particular reasons
why we remove the compile time options? I always thought they
were there for people who don't want them. At the moment few
people will be using the session support if barely any application
supports it, so why should they be forced to compile it in?
With this reasoning we could remove nearly all options since
most of them are more a matter of personal taste.

Who said anything about Linux? GTK builds on almost anything afaik..
Even win32 (different tree now, being migrated into 1.3.x currently)

Well, I guess I was thinking ahead to GNOME and KDE support.  I know
those are _supposed_ to build on anything, but I've had no luck getting
KDE to compile on my Solaris system and compiling GNOME looks like a
nightmare, with all those prerequisite libraries...  maybe this isn't a
big deal: it depends on how the GNOME/KDE integration is done.

Even so, requiring gtk in order to create dists seems a bit steep.  If
we do, we do, and we should document it.

I just realized I _do_ have gtk installed on my Solaris system :).  I
forgot I installed GIMP.

Anyway, I notice there's no option in configure on where to look for GTK
libs?  I have mine installed in a non-standard place.

I wonder if we shouldn't redo the way we handle this in configure.
Rather than having specific options for each library, can't we do
something like:

  --with-libs=path1:path2:path3
  --with-includes=path4:path5:path6

or similar?  I dunno, seems like it'd be easier.

If I have understood the gnome/kde support correctly, we won't link to
any libs, just setting some X-properties here and there as

I've had no problems with GNOME on Solaris 2.6/Sparc...

Not very often we need to create dists.. right? (should be documented
tho.)

As long as gtk-config is in your path, you shouldn't need to specify
anything more.. we should have a --with-gtk-exec or something...

gtk (and many libraries nowadays) is a bit special, since gtk-config
gives you everything you need to know.. for instance where to find the
platform-specific glibconfig.h etc..

I just took a look at the list of prerequisite libs GNOME needs and gave
up for the moment.  It's daunting.

I expect so, although I don't know for sure.  But libraries really
aren't the issue: in order to get the dependency info for the file you
need to be able to compile it (since it's GCC that creates that info).
If you can't compile a file, you can't construct the right Makefile.in
dependency info during the make dist phase.

If all the GNOME/KDE stuff is inserted into other files, it should be
OK, but if there are files like "gnome.c" that can be compiled only on
systems that have GNOME, then we won't really be able to generate
dependency info on non-GNOME systems.

Hi

I've noticed that SnapAttraction doesn't affect the resizing of windows.
Not a huge issue, but it would be rather handy if resizes could snap to
other objects on the desktop...

Cheers

	I think this would work fine... Does anyone have objections to
implementing something like this?  (I would be willing to work on it)
Maybe making it an extended-info fvwm->module message-type?

	I was thinking about this in terms of theme-configs... the ability
to assign short-help-messages to buttons.  The theme module could
configure the pop-up help module.

	heh. This does sound a little "enlightened"  but the overall idea
is great.  The ability for a module to be responsible for decorating
windows I think would be great.  It would certainly make it apealing for
things like the gnome project and whatnot, as it would allow fvwm to look
however someone wanted it to look, and would keep fvwm's bloat down.  That
would truly make it a 'Flexible Virtual Window Manager' (Virtual in a new
way)  

The other thing that we could then do is save the real fancy style-ish
stuff for a module... so that we aren't bloating fvwm-core
with gradient-code and dithering and you-name-it-for-next-week features.

Leave the basics in... but let the module(s) handle the next bit.  I'm not
convinced it would require much by-way of extension of the current fvwm
code.  We would want to allow the module to specify frame dimensions
before fvwm starts building it.  Then the module could build into the
frame and call fvwm functions and whatnot based on the module's config
for user actions.

What are everyone's thoughts about adding these to the list of FVWM goals?

	Provide ability for modules to be responsible for window
decorations... (and others? menus?)

	Provide ability to get more info on windows (frame, button window
id's, etc) for functionality extension in modules.

Whenever I hear about modules handling decoration, I wonder if it
wouldn't be interesting to consider changing modules from separate
processes communicating by pipes into dynamically loaded object
modules.

In this way you could get much closer and faster integration between
modules and FVWM, while still leaving FVWM lean (it would only load the
modules you were interested in).

These days, with so many apps doing "plug-in" like functionality, more
and more OS's are providing things like dlopen() and making them work
correctly.

Well, obviously longer term but I wonder what people think.

One advantage to the current method is that it's harder for a broken
module to screw up the WM proper--but, not impossible as we've seen even
now.

I'd have to agree with Paul here I've started three times now at trying
to build all the prerequisites libraries for GNOME and gave up (the
first time I ran out of diskspace on a 1 gig disk, yikes!!!).

granted building gtk isn't as bad, you have to have gimp, eventhough
the current stuff doesn't playy nice with an 8-bit display anymore (but
problem not yours).

I'm not too familiar with dlopen() and module-programming in this way..
For my own education, what would be the advantages to using a module like
this over just handling the window-decorations directly in a module and
communicating over the module-interface?

Would this mean that we would have... say... a 'decor' DLM, which the 
user could replace with some sort of custom module?  Would the 'default'
decor types have to be in a module as well?

Yes, the current optional-library stuff is horrible.  

I'm not sure whether I like what you suggest, or whether to just leave it
up to people to set CFLAGS before configuring.

Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'!

Bob, Since we get so many requests about this could we put the patch
somewhere in the distribution for people so it all stays together, and
then make a FAQ entry (if there isn't one already) about it?

you forgot the man page update for this, and I can't seem to make it

Thanks for those!

Just for my peace of mind and legalities, please could you add some
sort of README or COPYRIGHT file to the tgz saying that you are the
author, hold the copyright and under what conditions you are
releasing it (e.g., GPL)?

Thanks,

Would anyone object to me creating a globalopts pair:
WindowShadeShrinks/WindowShadeRolls? WindowShadeShrinks would make the
animated WindowShade just shrink the window from the bottom up without
rolling the client up into the title bar.  The reason for this is to
stop transparent Eterms having fits trying to stay transparent and
getting shaped windows to shade nicely.

I'd also like to make negative values of WindowShadeAnimate steps mean
the number of pixels to shrink by per step.

Cheers,
Tim.

The good news is Layers are working great for me now thanks to the last
Style related fix.

Just one thought I don't know if this is possible but could we add a
setting for SnapAttraction so it only works on windows in your current
layer, I think I would like to see this as an enhancment and I'm sure it
will come up once we release as an official request

We should probably stick with the current convention of doing <int>p to
mean pixels like we do for Move and a few others

      Please do. After the GSFR=AE, I think we definitely want to revis=
it the

WindowShade logic and make this a Style option. We may also want to thi=
nk

about other options, like the maximum size of a window for which we'll
      animate

the shading.

     I was planning to hack the option into the current CVS source in the
next couple of
days. The change includes man page documentation; but you're right, there
should be a
FAQ entry on this as well. So, the feature should be in the next dist, no
assembly required.

     I'm not sure how this will interact with the new layer paradigm,
though. I haven't had
much chance to look at the new layer stuff. I've been too busy trying to
get my standard
config to work again (are decors with gradients/pixmap textures supposed to
be working
again now? - mine don't).

Essentially, the advantage is you're running in the same process and so
can share memory, datastructures, etc.  In other words, we wouldn't need
to pass all kinds of data over pipes between processes, they could be
accessed directly.

It wouldn't have to be, but why not?  Then it could be swapped out if
the user didn't want it.

Oops yes, that will follow tonight. In short, the new syntax is

CursorStyle context cursor-num-or-xpm [ fg bg ] 

cursor-num-or-xpm can either be a number, indicating a standard
X glyph cursor, or the name of an xpm file. fg/bg are the colors
(defaulting to B/W).

And, I we found that

AddToDecor <decor>
AddToDecor <decor> Widowfont fixed

works, so this is listed as a "+" problem.  I'm not sure but
I think Dominik indicated that he might have caused this and
was going to look into it.

Hmm, it works for me. Have you tried it all on one line?

I think the dlopen path  is worth looking  into, but we haven't really
fully   exploited the current module  approach.   In my mental list of
pending things to do  is  enhance "send_configinfo"  so that  you  can
indicate the particular module you want config  info for.  This should
cut down the pipe traffic for modules considerably.

>From a quick look at the patch, it wont work at all like this with
layers. We will need a different idea, perhaps a new command
to move override-redirects in a specific layer or just a global
option to make the Layer/Raise/Lower commands also work on 
override-redirects. For this to make sense, there would have to be
a way to determine the layer of an o-r window. Proposal: the layer of
an o-r window is the layer of the next lower managed window in the stacking
order.

This seems to be a borderline case for the principle of leaving 
o-r windows alone, since the stacking order is not really a per-window
resource, but rather something global.

I wonder, is there any programmatic way to allow the X glyph cursors to
be selected by name, as well as number?  That seems like a very nice

I also had this thought that some kind of shared mem access to the 
window list would be much nicer than maintaining the same list in 
every other module.

Er, um, did I? I can't remember. I had some trouble setting up
my new machine in the last two days and had no chance to touch
any code. It might be quit a while before I find time for this,
so if anybody else looks after this I'd be grateful.

Just a note:

This works not on every platform. Some implementations of grep/sed require
the backslash befor '(' and ')' and some require that it's not there.

Have folks tried my fix to SendText() for RISC systems?  Does it work?

  Unfortunately, I'd need more (please sir!) - with this patch, yes, I can
bring windows above these popups, but I still can't move the smeggers.

  What'd be nice is a CompletelyIgnoreOverrideRedirect option. I guess
ol[v]wm must do this by default ...

  BTW - this patch broke my animated menus!

Install it and we'll see if it breaks 8)

Well, long term I see it as a style option and I thought GlobalOpts was
the place for future styles. I know I'd end up with something like:

+ I WindowId $w (oclock) WindowShade shrink
+ I WindowId $w (Eterm) WindowShade shrink
+ I WindowId $w (!oclock) WindowId $w (!Eterm) WindowShade scroll

this gets very wide if you have lots of names to test.

  My mistake! I hadn't noticed before that menu animation only kicks in
/really/ close to the edge of the screen. I'd thought it kicked in
whenever the parent menu would be covered more than the offset defined.

  Sorry!

Now you confused me. What do you mean with 'really close to the edge of the
screen'? Of course animation should be started anywhere on the screen if
the menus overlap more than the offset defines (with a tolerance of a
few pixels). The position hints are taken into account too, though.

The problem was 
AddToDecor <decor> Widowfont fixed
+IconFont fixed

I realize it works all on one line the anitial problem was that bob and
I had both had broken configs with the new start logic I we both finally
traced it down to doing AddToDecor followed by pluses now this used to
work right up until the new start stuff.  So both of us have replaced
those pluses with AddToDecor's the complaint was that the shortcut no
longer works

Hi,

I've been using fvwm for ages, and at some point I put together a new
command called PrevPage. What PrevPage does is that it toggles between
the current page and the previous page. I.e., you can rapidly flip
between the last two pages without having to explicitly specify them. In
my .fvwm2rc I have bound this command to KP_Enter, and, personally
speaking, it is probably the most frequently used command that fvwm has.

For those interested, I have attached a patch for this command that
should be applied to fvwm-2.2 source. It would also be nice to see this
appear in the fvwm distribution.

Thanks.

	Actually, CompletelyIgnoreOverrideRedirect is what the old FVWM
handling does. This, however, includes not decorating them or attempting
to manage them or interfere with them in any way. While this is
impeccably correct, it's probably not what most people really want.

	Hmm...have you tried doing a Recapture? I have no idea whether this
would work, but give it a try. FVWM maintains a linked list of control
blocks representing the windows it manages. When a window is created (or
detected on startup), and it has override_redirect set, FVWM does not
create an entry for this window. Thereafter, it knows nothing of that
window's whereabouts, and simply ignores any events associated with it.

	During a Recapture, FVWM reparents all the top level windows back to
the root (and destroys its list); then it chases down the list of all
root's children looking for any it would like to adopt. At this point,
if you've turned off override_redirect, it seems to me that FVWM might
decide it's ok to decorate and manage the window.

	I don't have any apps like this to test the theory with, so I could be
overlooking something, but it's worth a try. Of course, I don't know how
your app will react to suddenly finding its window are being managed....

	(Just out of curiosity, can you tell us what the GUI builder is?)


> Just to clarify - is this option going 'properly' into fvwm?

	This was my intent. I still want to do something that will give the
same relief from anitisocial windows, but my informants tell me that the
patch as written for 2.2 won't really fit too well with FVWM's new layer
paradigm. We'll have to work on it a bit.


>   Is there any way of making it, instead, a Style opt., to apply to
> known dodgy apps./windows ("ForceManaged")?

	I think this is worth looking into, but I don't see it happening
quickly. There are a number of nettlesome issues to consider. For
example, styles are only applied to windows that FVWM is managing, so
how do we apply the ForceManaged style....

	Before we could do that, we'd have to make the heretical decision to
provide a non-standard, deprecated option to manage such windows in
spite of the app's instructions. As it is, they're not part of FVWM's
known universe, and events associated with them are just singular blips
from across the event horizon.

	I was thinking more along the lines of being able to define a layer
with the property of being eligible to be raised above non-managed
windows.

Hi,
The FvwmGtk module in the current CVS-tree does not build properly, if
fvwm is built outside the source tree. (The compiler fails to find some 
of the header files.) The problem seems to be an erroneus definition
of INCLUDE in modules/FvwmGtk/Makefile.am

Hi everybody,

Sorry for the delay in spotting this one, I was quite busy because of the
end of the semester (yes, in Japan the business semester ends in March).

Is this my FvwmStyleCmd module? If it is, let me try to explain what has
happened.

First of all let me explain the history, and give an update of, the Perl
modules for Fvwm, as concisely as possible. On Fvwm 2.0 there was the
fvwmmod.pl module, however it is not maintained anymore and was taken out of
Fvwm 2.2. There is a new module called X11::Fvwm which subsumes fvwmmod.pl
(see http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm), but its author (Randy Ray)
prefers to distribute it separately from Fvwm. When Fvwm 2.2 was released I
was going to remind you about X11::Fvwm so we could add a link to it from
the Fvwm Homepage but (among other problems) X11::Fvwm won't compile with
2.2. I think that the changes to make it work again are minimal. I contacted
Randy, but he said that he has been "working heavy overtime" so it seems
that he won't have time to update it soon. I'll offer to help him: Perl
makes writing (and/or prototyping) modules *very* fast, and it is worth to
have X11:Fvwm working again.

Finally, about my module. I wrote it for fvwmmod.pl, and it is working
nicely on Fvwm 2.2. I might make a X11::Fvwm version also. However, I prefer
to have its features included in FvwmEvent. See
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9812/msg00494.html. I haven't worked on
this yet.

Dominik, for short:
- You may erase the module if you want, it won't be included in Fvwm.
- If anybody asks for something like a StartMaximized feature, tell him/her
to e-mail me.
- It could be put in the unofficial_patches directory or any other suitable
place (but first let me re-pack it including fvwmmod.pl).

Last, but not least, a question:
- When installing X11:Fvwm it uses the Fvwm sources to read the packet
types. This is good because you get the latest packet types, but this is bad
because you need the Fvwm sources. If I copy the packet types and other
information to X11:Fvwm to solve this problem, how is the X11:Fvwm license
affected by this?

Yours truly,

                         Fred Maciel

Subject: patch for the Fvwm FAQ
From: fred-m@crl.hitachi.co.jp
To: dominik_vogt@hp.com

Dear Dominik,

Here is a patch for the Fvwm FAQ. I'm sending it to you directly because (1)
my mailer may mess the newlines of the patch (2) I don't know how well the
fvwm-workers mailing list handles attached files.

Apart from spell checking and minor corrections, I put a user-oriented (not
developer-oriented) explanation for the odd behavior with FvwmM4/Cpp
(motivation: when I switched to fvwm2 it took me hours to solve this one
:-). If anybody solves this problem (as Tim Phipps seems to be trying to),
please remind to update the FAQ.

Yours truly,

                         Fred Maciel
                         E-mail  fred-m@crl.hitachi.co.jp

P.S.1 - On the FvwmStyle module: I just sent a mail to the mailing list,
give a look.
P.S.2 - Who the heck is Fred? It's me!!! 8^)   (See FAQ if you didn't get
the joke)

We won't get any ...Requests from the server for them, thus managing them
will not be possible. If we want to go that route, I'd propose to write
a little tool xmanage which would allow to select a toplevel window 
(like xprop does) and unset the override-redirect flag on it. The fvwm
can start managing the window after recapturing.

This would keep fvwm cleanly ICCCM-compliant (with some little helper
doing the dirty work :-)

I don't know how well applications would grok their override redirect windows
being managed by the wm though. I would expect them to be very surprised
by anything other than a move or stacking-order change. This is probably all
fvwm should ever do to such formerly-override-redirect windows.

Wasn't there a change to omit all directories from #include's recently ?
Maybe FvwmGtk missed that one.

This sounds good, it's a shame that it would require a recapture though.
I don't like the way recapture loses state (i.e. it resets window states
back to the initial style). There is an enhancement request for a
recapture that reuses the FvwmWindow list.  I don't know how difficult
that would be to implement. If it's too difficult maybe a Capture
command is called for that just goes looking for uncaptured windows.

Cheers,
Tim.

If it is simply to make fvwm aware of the formerly-override-redirect,
couldn't the hypothetical xmanage simple unmap/map the window after
removing the override-redirect ? I can't imagine what consequences
that could have for the offending client.

The Capture command would also be nice. And it should be possible to
reuse most of fvwm's initial capture code for that (you just have
to add a way to skip already-managed windows).  We could even
remove the builtin capture-at-startup and just call fvwm -f Capture...
hmm, could this perhaps even help to solve the problems with the 
initial capture happening too early ?

I can barely follow the discussion here, but to me we seem to be getting
beyond the boundaries of what I think is appropriate for a 2.4 release;
are you guys thinking of making these major changes soon?  I'd like to
request they maybe go on a branch or be deferred until 2.5.x starts up.

If I understand things correctly we seem to be _really_ going out of our
way to implement very complex functionality to handle a very, very small
subset of windows; I don't think I have _any_ (except maybe a splash
screen or two) in all the apps I use.

I'd prefer to get what we have now stable, plus the GNOME patches and
_maybe_ the GSFR stuff if we can come to a resolution on that, and
seriously consider calling that 2.4.0.

Thoughts?

I agree, although we do need some consistency, ie we shouldn't spell
behaviour with a u and then spell favorite without. It's an
English/American thing as far as I can see, so we need to choose one way
of doing it.

     Not terribly. I just haven't gotten around to it yet. The greatest
difficulty I foresee is reaching a consensus on what states should be
preserved, how to specfy state preservation options, etc.

     For the first pass, I was only going to do the grunt work of reusing
the FvwmWindow structure, but not preserve any state information. This
should be, as they say, completely transparent; no one should observe any
different behavior, other than a decreased propensity for crashing when a
Recaptue is done from a complex function.

     This sounds like a handy thing to have anyway, though.

The one that annoys me is Sticky (I don't like recapture resetting it). 
I think this is one to postpone until after the GSFR.  If we can split
the behaviour bits from the appearance bits we might get closer to an
easy decision - recapture preserves the behaviour flags.

If someone writes a capture_the_blighter_dammit utility that does an
unmap/map I think a Capture command would be unnecessary.

     Whew! I think maybe we ought to do a 2.3.x beta or so before that!
:-)

     Seriously, I think that's probably an ambitious enough load for 2.4
(with the GSFR infrastructure included, but not a slew of new styles and
stuff). I think we should stabilize what we have now - and that's quite a
lot - and do a 2.3 beta, then work on the GSFR.

     The reuse-FvwmWindow bit that was mentioned was on the agenda for the
next release anyway, as a bug-fix (I forget the bug-track number). The
capture_the_blighter_dammit stuff is getting way too ambitious for 2.4,
IMO.

     We should do something to accommodate users who have problems with o_r
windows, not because of the number of such cases, but because our changes
broke behavior that people could formerly count on; and since we're
venturing down that path, I think it makes sense to do an even better job
than was done before. All of which argues for putting it off till after
2.4.

OK, these are "thoughts", sorry if they are all over the place.

If there   is  one feature slated     for 2.3 that   people  have been
requesting its the GNOME  stuff.  (I have no current  use for it.)  Do
we have a target date for that?   I know Jay  was doing some debugging
with the GNOME people.  Even after the patch  is applied, do we have a
feel for how long it will be before the  GNOME stuff will be ready for
beta test?

I think we have  to go  through long periods  of instability,  and now
seems like a good time for it.  On the other hand, there are some neat
enhancements in the NEWS file.  And, (I seem to have one more hand), I
think our users are still digesting 2.2.

As  far as creating   2.4 and making the   transition to 2.5 aren't we
pretty far away from that?  We haven't decided on  a 2.3 beta yet, and
we aren't in a state where thats feasible.

As far as splash screens go, FvwmBanner is a "splash screen".  Perhaps
it should have an option to create itself as an unmanaged screen so we
could get a better idea what this "problem" is all about.

X11:Fvwm wouldn't even build against 2.0.47d. The trouble was that
while the docs stated you needed => 2.0.46, it was reading the VERSION
from the source tree and doing a
if ( $string == '2.0.46' )
kind of thing! I hacked that and things were happy once again. It's
still working under CVS sources, even though I compiled against
2.0.47d. Come to think of it though, I think X11:Fvwm needs to be
compiled with an accurate command table, in which case my X11:Fvwm is
probably broken, though i haven't noticed... I don't think there's
anything else that'd need fixing, other than perhaps dealing with the
recent changes for AtomicSendText().

 Brad)  well 
 Brad)  AddToDecor <decor> 
 Brad)  + Widowfont fixed

 Brad)  definetly fails

An additional state was integrated into builtins.c without enforcing
mutual exclusion. So if you defined any function before the
AddToDecor, for example, it wouldn't get routed properly, e.g.:

[FVWM][AddAnotherItem]:  last menu: (nil) last func: 0x8086678 \
			last decor: 0x8088538
[FVWM][AddToFunction]:  Adding to function TitleStyle -- flat

Only one of the last_* vars should be active at a time.  I've just
committed a fix for this, hopefully it should work ok now.

I've just checked in some fixes related to moving and paging.
Could you check again?

I wondered why we are using these weird pan frame windows
anyway. Couldn't we simply check if the pointer is within
a few pixels of the screen border (as defined by EdgeThickness
command). Instead of triggering the HandlePaging function
when the pointer enters a pan frame we could check this
for each MotionNotify event.

Any ideas why these pan frames were used in the first place?

Try this:

1) Click on title button 1 to open the windowmenu of some
   window.
2) Select the 'Move' entry.
3) Move the mouse over a page boundary. Title button 1 is
   drawn depressed.
4) Click to end the move. The title button stays depressed.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I've noticed a strange thing with events that causes a bug in
menu handling and possibly at other places:

I have the window menu bound to title button 1 of all windows
(with mouse button 1) and another menu bound to mouse button 1
over the root window:

  Mouse   1   R      A   Menu WorkMenu Nop
  Mouse   1   1      A   Menu WindowMenu Delete

Now, when I click mouse button 1 once over the root
window, the menu handling code does not see the
ButtonPress event (this is correct since it has been
eaten up by the main event loop in HandleButtonPress())
and only gets the ButtonRelease event.

When I do the same over title bar button 1 the menu
code gets a ButtonPress event. I'm puzzled. How can this
happen?

This breaks the 'default action' of menus:
If you click once in the title bar button (if yor're
fast enough) fvwm executed the default action and closes
the window although you only clicked once.

Perhaps related to this I noticed this:
When I click on the root window (i.e. press and release)
the menu pops up immediately when I release the button.
If I only press the button there is a slight delay between
the button press and the moment the menu pops up. I've tracked
that down to HandleButtonPress. The delay already happens before
HandleButtonPress is ever called.

All this applies to fvwm-2.2 too.

Could someone help me here? I'm not familiar with our event
loop.

Bye

Dominik

Hah, I always knew it. The folks in the US don't speak English! ;-)
Not that I'm a fan of this idea, but the American way of spelling is
much easier to achieve now because it's already used most of the time.

If you give me some time I'll apply a slightly modified version that
does it as an option to GotoPage instead of a new command (easier to
find in the manpage).

I have only very recently been able to chisel out enough spare time to actually
build 2.2 on my machine and verify that it even works for me. Most of what
free time I've had in recent weeks has been taken up by some kernel-oriented
problems on my box (a laptop) that were mostly due to oddities of the box
itself, not Linux (though recent patches to the 2.2.X line have helped my
stability greatly).

I think that the config.h produced by configure may actually be of greater
use to the Makefile.PL that configures the module for building. As for the
code itself, the only compiled C code is an auto-translation of constants from
the header file into a "constant" subroutine defined within the X11::Fvwm
namespace. Unless there have been some major changes to the set of constants,
this should work fine. I also need to check to see if any of the message
packets have made noteworthy changes to their structure/format.

I appreciate the interest that has been demonstrated, I had begun to think I
was the only one using the module :-). As for distributing it, I prefer to
keep the distribution controlled by CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network. This serves a dual purpose: I can release bug-fixes and upgrades
independant of FVWM, and the FVWM distribution isn't further bloated. However,
a pointer to it in the relevant files would be great, and after I get it up
to speed with 2.2, I'd be happy to even write a longer blurb that can be
dropped in alongside the README file (or whereever apropos).

All my windows use ClickToFocus.  The problem is, any new windows that are
created automatically steal focus from whatever window had it.  (If I
launch an xterm from another xterm, the new one gets the focus).  I'd like
the behavior to be changed so that the new window gets raised, but not
focus.  SloppyFocus doesn't have this problem/feature.  Any ideas?  Thanks.

Why do we need to have consistency?

[It's a rhetorical question.  I'm not really interested in this debate.]

Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'!

I just want to say, every time this subject came up, I was one
of the people that didn't think it made much difference whether
we had an "extras" directory or not.

Now that its done, I see the value in cleaning up the mess.

Nice work Steve.

I'd be interested to hear if the following little program solves
everybodies problems with windows stuck at top of stack. In particular,
I don't know if it solves the problems with Exceed (are the non-X windows
override-redirect, technically ?). If this is the case, I'd propose 
to leave fvwms stack handling as it is now and put this program in 
the utilities dir together with a FAQ entry. 

What it does is: it lets you select a  top-level window and
toggles the override-redirect flag on it. This, together with
a unmap/map pair, lets fvwm get control over override-redirect 
windows. It is of course likely that using arbitrary window
manager functions on an o-r window will crash the client, 
but raise/lower/move are probably safe. 

I have also appended a minimal test-case program which puts
an override-redirect window permanently at top of stack.

I've hacked up a patch for Maximize to allow "adaptive" maximizing.. it
expands window to maximum available space until it hits something. You
can combine it with any other maximize flags.

Maximize 0 -1     - Increase height to max avail
Maximize -1 500p  - _first_ set height to 500p, then inc width
Maximize 500p -1  - _first_ set width to 500p, then inc height
Maximize -1 -1    - _first_ inc height, then inc width
...

The idea has been taken from enlightenment (a useful function too 8)

Would be nice if people could test this with funky setups.. I haven't
been able to make it freak out yet.. (only in e 8)

Nice patch, I like it!

Comments:

With the recent move from numeric arguments to strings for the
toggling arguments, wouldn't it be more reasonable to use 
a string like "available" instead of the rather arbitrary -1.
I also seem to remember that there is a note in the TODO file
about using negative arguments for something else.

I guess we need some options to influence which windows are 
obstructions to maximization. Things like: ignore lower layers.
But it would also be useful to maximize "under" some clients in
higher layers (for eg a clock), so we might also want to mark
windows for this with a style option like 
"MaximizeUnder/DontMaximizeUnder".
"MaximizeOver/DontMaximizeOver" might also be useful

But the patch still won't help with the Gnome panel, since it
is override-redirect, no? How does Enlightenment deal with that?
(probably with some quick-and-dirty root property blessed as a 
 Gnome wm hint?!)


Matthias

PS Speaking about maximization, I notice that with current cvs
the maximize title button stays depressed after unmaximizing.

What the hell is going on here?  Why do these @#$%&* Makefile.in files
keep re-appearing?

I just don't get it.  It must be a bug in CVS.  What version of CVS are
you using?

Have you tried removing and checking out a brand new copy recently?  Do
you use the "-P" option on your update line, or have it in your ~/.cvsrc
file?

It seems like once a week or so a commit adds back some of the .in
files.  Extremely aggravating.

Because the CVS/Entries still list them for people.

EVERYONE: Hunt down those Makefile.in in CVS/Entries everywhere.. zap
those lines.

Should be taken care of by CVS, but doesn't seem to... so we have to do
it manually.. (or do rm -rf;cvs co ...)

Subject: transient pager vs. middle button

Full_Name: Matthias Clasen
Version: 2.3.0
CVS_Date: Sun Mar 21 01:12:27 CET 1999
OS: RedHat Linux 5.1
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (132.230.142.176)


The new transient pager feature doesn't work correctly with
the middle mouse button. I can pop up a transient pager
and then use mb2 to move the input focus between windows.
This works for some time, then the pager vanishes, but leaves
the pointer grabbed to the rectangle of the vanished pager window.
It seems there is some

if (is_transient)
 {
   XUngrabPointer (dpy);
   exit (0);
 }

missing in the code path for button 2 release, but I'm not
sure where to put it. Dominik ?

-P is my way of my .cvsrc:

Me> cat ~/.cvsrc
update -dP
diff -uBb

I'll check out a fresh copy.  It's been a few weeks since the last one.

Sorry.  Eventually it'll get under control.
I looked for it, but didn't see it happening.

No, it wasn't autogenerated, it was the prototype.  No wonder I missed
it in the first checkin.  I thought I was correcting a mistake, when I
was making a mistake.

The  logic  in FvwmForm is  cloned  from  FvwmRearrange.  Something is
marking them executable without the chmod.

Nope, not necessary!

Since it is listed in a  _SCRIPTS variable, the install rule will use the
"install" program, which does the chmod for you.

The ability to add to a path is a useful one, but I wonder if this is the
right way to go about it.

1. There is no way to replace a path wholesale.  You may not find this a
useful feature, but others will.  Ditto for the ability to append rather 
than prepend to the path.

2. ImagePath and ModulePath now differ: one sets the path, the other adds
to the path.  This is an unnecessary confusing difference.

3. I'm not sure we even WANT a builtin path --- I was moving to get rid of
it.  It is more confusing than useful to have something settable at both
build- and run-time.  We could, instead, put the default path into the
sample fvwm2rc files.


How about doing both ImagePath and ModulePath in the following way.  The
command will set the path, but a special token --- say '+' --- indicates
the previous setting.  Thus you could do:

	ModulePath /usr/local/special/modules:+

to prepend or

	ImagePath /a/b:+:/c/d

to both prepend and append to the image path.


If this sounds familiar, it should.  This same issue came up last fall in
the context of ModulePath, and someone suggested exactly this '+'
mechanism.  However, an alternative mechanism was implemented, by
having fvwm export an environment variable FVWM_MODULEDIR so that one
could use "ModulePath /user/local/special:$FVWM_MODULEDIR".

I strongly urge that we adopt a uniform mechanism for all path-setting
commands.  

Exporting a variable, while expedient, is not the best idea.  It is
backward from traditional practice.  Typically users export the variable
to modify a program's behaviour, rather than programs exporting variables. 
Sure, there are exceptions like DISPLAY or SHELL, but these ought to be
exceptional for a very good reason.  There is no compelling reason to have
FVWM_MODULEDIR exported. 

In fact, there is a compelling reason to NOT export it.  It came up on the
list a few weeks back.  Someone wanted the ability to override the
built-in module directory setting at build time, a reasonable request. One
decent way to do so is to set FVWM_MODULEDIR before configuring, and have
configure set the default module directory based on whether or not this
variable is set.  Ooops!  It is always set, because your shell is a child
of fvwm.  It is always set to what the *installed* fvwm is using, so
configure can't use this variable in any useful way. 

In summary: both ImagePath and ModulePath should behave in a similar
fashion.  Both should have the ability to reference the previously-set
path.  I don't much care what the chosen token is, but environment
variables are not a good mechanism. 

In fact, if they used the same token, you can implement all path setting
in a single function "setPath(char** path_pointer, char* newValue)".  One
can set the image path with "setPath( &ImagePath, newvalue )" and the
module path with "setPath( &ModulePath, newvalue )".


Finally: I don't much care for the idea that a function frees memory
allocated by its caller:

	void SetImagePath( char* newpath )
	{
	...
	free( newpath );
	...

This style is extremely confusing and error-prone in my experience.  And
if you desperately want to adopt it, it must be documented in big red
flashing bold letters somewhere!!!

I keep wondering if there was some strange interaction when I removed the
Makefile.in's but then added .cvsignore files containing Makefile.in at
nearly the same time.

Perhaps if the .cvsignore file got created first, then the command to
remove Makefile.in was ignored?

At any rate, everyone should try

	find . -name Entries -print | xargs grep Makefile.in

to see if there are any leftovers.  If so, you'll have to remove both
Makefile.in *and* .cvsignore, then

	cvs remove Makefile.in && cvs commit -m 'removing Makefile.in'

... or just pull down a fresh copy of the entire tree.

'S not your fault, Dan.

It's unquestionably a bug in CVS.  If you update to the latest, then
there's no way files that were deleted in that latest should "reappear"
in the tree, under any circumstances unless you explicitly add them
back.

Still, it's aggravating :)

I agree that (a) we should use a uniform method and (b) typically users
export env. vars. to modify subprocess behavior, but I _strongly_
disagree there's no compelling reason to export the environment var.

I use that variable in many of my scripts.  For example, I have a shell
script I run a fvwm init time that creates a menu of all the builtin
modules; I need to know where to look for those modules.

My argument for the env. var. being exported by fvwm is still quite
relevant, I think: _if_ we are going to change the directory name with
every single release, then there should be a simple, programmatic way to
obtain that value in scripts, modules, etc. from FVWM.  Otherwise you're
virtually gauranteeing that people will be editing some part of their
setup every release.

Plus, on a purely practical level, the env. var. exists in 2.2 and I'd
be very opposed to removing it in the future without excellent reason,
on backward-compatibility grounds.

And finally, I don't think it's all _that_ strange.  Plenty of tools
that invoke subprocesses use the environment to pass information; that's
a perfectly common and respectable method of doing so.

  sr> In fact, there is a compelling reason to NOT export it.  It came

  sr> fvwm.  It is always set to what the *installed* fvwm is using, so
  sr> configure can't use this variable in any useful way.

Yes, I agree that that's a shame.  But this is an obscure situation and
easily worked around; I don't think it rises to the level of being a
compelling argument for removing the env. var.

  sr> In summary: both ImagePath and ModulePath should behave in a similar
  sr> fashion.  Both should have the ability to reference the previously-set
  sr> path.  I don't much care what the chosen token is, but environment

Contrariwise, I think it _is_ important to provide the modulepath via
the environment, since it's so variable, and it's needed both within the
config file and by processes the config file invokes.

Imagepath I'm less concerned about, since it won't change
release-to-release, although it would be nice to still have a "write
once" mentality and allow that value to be changed in one place and
allow anyone else who might need it to get it without changing.

I don't care if we modify the behavior, either, but I don't want to lose
any functionality.  If we remove the existing env. var., some method
must be provided to take its place.

  sr> In fact, if they used the same token, you can implement all path
  sr> setting in a single function "setPath(char** path_pointer, char*
  sr> newValue)".  One can set the image path with "setPath( &ImagePath,
  sr> newvalue )" and the module path with "setPath( &ModulePath,
  sr> newvalue )".

Of course, if you use env. vars. you don't have to do _anything_, since
they already allow env. vars ;).

Why? Won't people with more than 255 colours want to have this too?

I can't see this bug but I put that missing code before all
calls to 'exit'. Does it work now? I had assumed that X would
release the grabs when the pager dies. Shouldn't it do that?

What exactly have xou done with FvwmTalk, Dan? Did you reimplement
it with FvwmForm?

Yes, a string argument would be much better, even though parsing
gets a bit more difficult.

Purify is probably complaining because the other half of the union
has been initialised, but not the flag itself. I've tried to fix
that. Could you check that again, Dan?

I think so, but the transient pager is still not entirely transient:
If I pop it up and use button 2 to move the focus between windows,
it will stay up until I click on the background. I think it should
exit after the first button release, regardless which button it was.
The leftover grabs are gone with your fix.

OK, you've convinced me ;-)  that's a pretty good reason for subproceses
knowing about FVWM_MODULEDIR that I didn't think of.

It may be common; I don't know.  I couldn't think of many.  I'm
comfortable with using environment variables *if and only if* there is no
better way.

OK, but hold on.  For modules, we are only exporting the "system" DIR, not
the entire PATH.  Maybe we should instead really *be* exporting the path?

The module-menu script that you mentioned currently has access only to
fvwm-installed modules.  One might desire the entire path instead.

OK, how about allowing these paths to be used as arguments in "Exec", like
the $d, $w, $x, and $y expanions?  $ModulePath and $ImagePath, perhaps?
Then you could invoke your module-menu script via

	AddToFunc "InitFunction"
	+	  "I"			Exec module-menu $ModulePath

No?

I agree with Steve (before it was converted by Paul (: ). Setting
environment variable to inform about fvwm compile-time information is not
good. What if fvwm will need provide other information in the future.
Do we need to flood environment space of every spawned by fvwm process
with environment variables (FVWM_MODULEDIR, FVWM_STANDARDIMAGEDIR,
FVWM_MISC..)? I think, no, if there is other way to provide fvwm
internal information.

Being able to know module dir is nice, but if environment variable is
used for this it restricts you. You can run your scripts *only* inside
fvwm run. Your scripts will not work *before* lanching fvwm.

The solution can be having fvwm-config utility (like gnome-config,
gtk-config, glib-config etc.), which can be queried by shell scripts,
about all fvwm info, like:

  fvwm-config --moduledir
  fvwm-config --imagedir

Or even fvwm executable iself can provide this info.

Implementing suggested above method will break recent scripts based
on $FVWM_MODULEDIR, but will make things more consistent in the future,
when new info must be provided by fvwm.

I can't see why they would want approximate  colors when they can have
accurate colors.  I  could be wrong  for the case  of 16 bit displays,
but for Truecolor (24 bit), I think its the right way to go.

Mainly, I have an 8 bit and a 24 bit display  at work, and I'd like to
avoid a preprocessor and use the same config file.

All these arguments make sense to me, but bear in mind what I am after
is a way to make the old "PixMapPath" + "BitMapPath" continue to work.
Since they   added to each   other,  rather than  replace one  common
variable, we were  breaking existing configurations with the ImagePath
enhancement.

In the case of image path, I don't see much harm  is leaving old stuff
at the end of the path.  Not unless you intentionally  want an icon to
be  not found.  I'll  read   the rest of  the  thread  and see if  the
solutions proposed  include a    way  to deal with   keeping  existing
configurations working.

As far as  freeing something malloced by the  caller, I saw the caller
doing the malloc when I didn't need  it anymore, and inertia caused me
to be sloppy.  (The callers malloc  isn't required anymore.)  I'll fix
it up.  (Too late   to  claim I  would  have  fixed it without   being
caught.)

Hi, two minor bugs surfaced while I continued to play with external
menus:

[(1) already solved]

2) When the Move command is sent from a module, it behaves differently
depending on wether it is sent in root or window context. Try sending

WindowId <some window id> Move

from FvwmTalk and compare to just sending Move and picking a window.
In the first case, the window origin jumps at the first pointer motion.
I think the jump distance is determined by the distance origin-pointer,
but I'm not sure.

Eh.  In GNU make I check in files like ANNOUNCE.in which contain things
like @VERSION@ and @DATE@, then these are processed during "make dist"
just like other .in files.

Then I never have to remember to update them :)

After 2.2 maybe I'll take a pass at the fvwm files in a similar way.

Hi all !

I am thinking about using Unicode and dynamic fonts in window titles.
For example Netscape uses some special Escape sequences
to inform that some part of window title is in other then default
iso-8859-1 encoding (ESC-B etc.). So window manager should be sensitive to
that sequences and dynamically change font to desired encoding for that
part of text string. 

If we use -*-courier-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* font window
manager should dynamically use proper encoding (default could be set in
config file or be quessed from locale setting or just be iso8859-1).

Generally speaking it would be nice to use some kind of virtual Unicode
font (one using real fonts with different encodings) to display text 
in utf-8 or Netscape escaped format. I've looked at 9term and willy
programs. 

It just an idea to get good looking multilingual window/desktop manager.

I just noticed the follwoing: the window borders do
not change their appearance upon buttonpress, unless
I disable the MWMButtons style. But I'd like
to have both. Is this a bug or a feature ? The 
relevant code is in borders.c, line 440, but I
didn't have time to figure out how to correct it.

: This would, IMHO, be pretty tricky to implement.  It would be fun to be
: able to resize the borders and handles individually (as in TOP, LEFT,
: BOTTOMRIGHT, etc.), giving you the ability to emulate GNUStep-like
: window managers with (say) the following:

for that matter, it'd be cool if you could make the corner handles a different 
width than the side handles.

another cool thing would be to allow the title bar to sit on whatever side of 
the window you wanted it to, and perhaps even be a different width than the 
window, so you could have beOS style title "tabs".

"fvwmbug"?  Sounds good to me.

Hi

This would, IMHO, be pretty tricky to implement.  It would be fun to be
able to resize the borders and handles individually (as in TOP, LEFT,
BOTTOMRIGHT, etc.), giving you the ability to emulate GNUStep-like
window managers with (say) the following:
	
	BorderStyle TOP Width 0
	BorderStyle LEFT Width 0
	BorderStyle RIGHT Width 0
	BorderStyle BOTTOM Width 10
	
	HandleStyle TOPLEFT Width 0
	HandleStyle TOPRIGHT Width 0
	HandleStyle BOTTOMLEFT Width 10
	HandleStyle BOTTOMRIGHT Width 10

With only the bottom border and bottom handles visible.  Admittedly,
this is far-fetched, and perhaps a bit of a major code rewrite this
close to the 2.2.0 release (I hope...;-)  Perhaps a "Style" option, to
customize individual windows?  All things considered, this may bloat
fvwm's size unacceptably, but it would make the window manager a _bit_
more customizable.

Anyway, if it's improbable (once you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains... Yeah, we got it), just ignore this.

Have a nice one
Koos

Hi

Another thing (extension of the first suggestion) would be a 
"WindowList" MenuStyle, which would apply only to the WindowList
builtin menu, as it looks rather drab (in my eyes) without the
side pixmap:

	MenuStyle "WindowList" SidePixmap winlist.xpm
	MenuStyle "WindowList" SideColor green

This is a suggestion only; I can live without it if neccessary,
and I'm not going to figure out the source code to patch fvwm.
I'm just too lazy, I guess.

Would it be possible to add an option to either SnapGrid or SnapAttraction that
would close to a window with a specified amount of padding in pixels. Like:

SnapPadding 2

would put the window 2 pixels away from surrounding windows rather than right
next to the border.

I see, but I would still argue that the extra space is NOT needed regardless
of whether one has MINI_ICONS defined or not.  The WinList is dynamically
sized and so if MINI_ICONS are all of a sudden included the size would
(should) increase on a need basis.  In other words,

--> spawn an xterm titled "XTERM"
--> note WinList size
--> spawn an xterm titled "LONGER.XTERM"
--> note again WinList size; its increased to accommodate the longer string.

I would assume MINI_ICONS could take the same approach with the extra spaces
coming in _only_ when they are needed and being excluded otherwise
irrespective of whether one compiled with MINI_ICONs or not.

Am I completely 'out to pasture' on this ?

How to find:
1) Login on a slow machine (486/25 or equiv)
2) Fire up 2+ FvwmPagers
3) Fiddle with toolbars in gtk/gnome-programs (borderless windows that
"tries to follow the mouse"..)

Watch the lag (the window doesn't follow the mouse quite well).

4) Kill one pager

Watch lag become less

5) Kill the last pager

Watch lag go away totally


The display of the pagers lag when dragging stuff around... Is this a
problem with fvwm feeding data to the pager(s) over a pipe, and having a
hard time keeping up with user-feed at the same time...?

So this synchronicity of threads in the fvwm list and here about popup
menus got me thinking... It'd be pretty nice to be able to popup a
menu with dynamic contents and have it act as a proper popup with the
menu tree and all that.

Now I haven't had more than one coffee yet today, and I'm at work so
I can't really spend a lot of time looking at sources, so bear with
me, but maybe we could add a menu builtin called PopUpExec or
somesuch. PopUpExec would expect to be given a Function, and the
Function would be expected to issue a PopUp, preferably one whose
contents had been dynamically negotiated. fvwm could run the function
and then watch for the popup request, which it could reparent to the
appropriate place? Sound feasible, and if so, like a good way to do
this? Or should I go drink some more coffee?

There are machines with more than 8 plane CLUT modes.  Some SGIs have a 12
plane mode so they still have a restricted number of colors (4096).  Of
course, they could still turn color limiting on if they wanted.

In general it doesn't make sense for truecolor visuals, only for
pesudocolor visuals, and these are essentially independent of the number of
planes.  If it is possible to simply extract the type of the visual from
the server, it might be better to decide whether or not to limit colors
based on this since there are also 8 plane truecolor modes.  (Of course,
such modes are pretty ugly but they do exist.)

Well, there are always _different_ ways.  Quite often, better is in the

Yes, I've thought of that too.  My position at the moment is that the
important thing is to provide this particular information, since we have
modified the installation such that it changes with every release.

Presumably the other paths are much more "fixed" and hardcoding them
isn't as big an issue.

Anyway, it's one justification :).

Well, it's OK with me but we, in effect, already have that now because
env. vars. are expanded here.  This is basically exactly what my code
does now, use the env. var. on the command line.

I've often wished fvwm's config had variables, but the prevailing
attitude seems to be to use cpp or m4 for that...

    enough... or it may not be.

    In particular what if we do away with a default imagedir altogether?

    Only a fully-initialized fvwm2 with the config loaded has _all_ the
    info needed.

 b) I worry about versioning issues; what if the version of fvwm2 you
    run and the version of fvwm-config you run don't match?

    What if you have fvwm2 for most people, and fvwm2-2.3.1 for others?
    How will you know how to run the right fvwm-config script?

  mg> Or even fvwm executable iself can provide this info.

This could be more accurate, but given the strange invocations people
use with m4, etc. it would be impossible to just invoke "fvwm2
--modulepath" and get the path.  You could still do the simple builtins,
of course.

The config script stuff is very nice and simple for straightforward
installations, but I have a very complex installation here with many
different OS versions installed in essentially the same filesystem,
different versions all available at once, etc.

Hmm, if nobody complains... Wasn't there some kind of 15 bit visual too?
Or doesn't X11 support that?

Duh, all buttons should behave like button 3 in the transient pager.
What exactly did you do? Which button pops up the pager? E.g. like this:

  - press button 3 to pop up the pager
  - keep button 3 down and click button 2 to focus a window

Is that what you did?

No, I did

AddToMenu StartMenu
+ "Transient pager" FvwmPager -transient

Then the button used to pop up the menu is already released when
the pager comes up. I can then use button 2 in the way I described.

Ah, yes. I didn't think about this case at all. Well, I see no
reason why the transient pager should be limited to the button
3 action. Should be fairly easy to implement.

I can't help with your problems Dominik but I thought you should know
that todays CVS is broken for key press handling.  fvwm is no longer
eating up key press events associated with menu hot keys and other key
bindings.  The functions and menu picks still work but I keep getting
extra characters typed into windows.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hmm, probably related to my binding cleanups from yesterday.
Still I can't fathom what could cause the problem. Any ideas?

fvwm doesn't ask for MotionNotify events at the moment so entering the
pan frame is the only way to tell that the pointer is at the edge of the
screen.  I don't know how much of a performance hit turning on motion
notify events would be, I don't notice any slowdown with xeyes but it
does generate a lot more network traffic.

Tim.

The performance problem is even bigger. We had to call HandlePaging
not just for MotionNotify but for all events. Furthermore we couldn't
wait for events but had to do a check, pause for a few microseconds
and call Handle Paging. So I guess this solution isn't feasible.

Change cutoff point for no ColorLimiting to 20 bits.  (Perhaps
detecting TrueColor is a better way to do this, but if you have
21 bit color, the number of colors you can display exceeds the
likely number of pixels on your display.)  If anyone else feels
there is a better way, thats OK with me.  Mainly, I feel there
should be no colorlimiting when the user has a 24 bit display.

Anyone else notice the FvwmTalk replacement looping?

It was working for me, but with this mornings CVS, it never appears
and instead uses lots of CPU.  I may not be able to fix it
until I go home this evening.  Sorry about that.

As they say, if you want to bake a cake, you have to break a few
eggs.

Hmm, I'd fetch new sources and 'make clean' and try again.
The title buttons should already work again. I can't
explain all these error messages, key bindings may indeed
be broken.

Upon further inspection I see that the problem is not with titlebuttons
but that Iconify with no args doesn't seem to work any longer.

I can confirm some keypress problems when I use key binidngs the foucs
window receives a character.

Now this may be related to some of my config lines not being used but I
can nootice a signifigant delay even on small menus between the mapping
of menus and the displaying of its contents

well the problem now is that I dump core as soon as I try to move, but
I can't get a stack trace from gdb it tells me that core is not a core
dump.

once I get the problems fixed in the other thread I can try and track
down exactlly where I dump core

Can something be done about the pan frames always "being on top" then?
Right now, if you have a window whose border is in the "pan frame" area,
you can't access the functionality provided by that window's border --
instead, fvwm2 thinks you are clicking on the root window, because the
pan frame is apparently mapped to the root window. I complained about
this on the fvwm mailing list back in March of 1998.

Example: xterm window has bottom border at bottom of current desktop.
DesktopSize is 1x4. Move mouse to bottom of xterm window and click in
border. Instead of doing a "resize" (even though the cursor changes
to the resize cursor), the "Root" menu pops up (since that is what I
have bound to button 1 clicks in the root window).

Another (unrelated) request:

Can we change the window placement policy in move.c so that you can
resize a window that hasn't been mapped yet (while it is still in
rubberband mode) WITHOUT depending on the "EmulateMWM" flag? Currently,
if EmulateMWM is NOT set, you can use button 2 to resize a window 
while it is still "rubberbanded" (very nice feature). If EmulateMWM
is set, you have to usr Shift+button 1 to accomplish the same thing (yuck!)
Why not just make it button 2 OR shift + button 1 ALL the time? You can't
map this functionality to anything else via the config files anyway.

Is:

          if(((Event.xbutton.button == 2)&&(!Scr.gs.EmulateMWM))||
             ((Event.xbutton.button == 1)&&(Scr.gs.EmulateMWM)&&
              (Event.xbutton.state & ShiftMask)))
            {
              NeedToResizeToo = True;
              /* Fallthrough to button-release */
            }

Should be:

          if(((Event.xbutton.button == 2) ||
             ((Event.xbutton.button == 1)&&
              (Event.xbutton.state & ShiftMask)))
            {
              NeedToResizeToo = True;
              /* Fallthrough to button-release */
            }

Also, how about implementing a feature from (v)twm that while a 
window is in the "rubberband" state (before it has been mapped, you
are deciding where to place it), you can click button 3, and it 
places the window and automatically resizes it vertically to the
bottom of the screen. Very useful when opening an xterm; you just
have to position the upper left corner, tap button 3 and you have
a nice (tall) xterm.

In summary, it would be nice if during window placement (rubberband
mode), the following actions worked:

  Button 1: Place and map window (already in place)
  Shift+Button 1: Lock window location, mouse motion then resizes the 
                  rubberband frame (already in place if EmualateMWM set)
  Button 2: Lock window location, mouse motion then resizes the rubberband
            frame (already in place if EmualteMWM is NOT set)
  Button 3: Place top left corner of window, automatically resize vertically 
            so that bottom of window is positioned at bottom of screen.

Button 3 functionality could be added with functionality something like this
in "AddWindow":

        int     new_width, new_height;

        new_width = tmp_win->frame_width;
        new_height = Scr.MyDisplayHeight - 2 - tmp_win->frame_y;
        ConstrainSize(tmp_win, &new_width, &new_height);
        SetupFrame(tmp_win,tmp_win->frame_x,tmp_win->frame_y,new_width,new_heigh
t,TRUE);

Lastly, is anyone working on a "WarpToTransient" feature? I hate the fact
that windows like "Find" require me to move the cursor into the window so
I can type in it...

You can turn them off with EdgeThickness 0. I don't think there's much
point in having them if they're not at the top.  Since they are
InputOnly and therefore invisible you wouldn't know where to put the
pointer to get scrolling if they weren't guaranteed to be on the top.  

In the current CVS and when 2.3.0 gets released you will be able to turn
the pan frames on and off in functions, This means you can have the pan
frames off most of the time and have them come on during a Move with the
following:

AddToFunc PanMove I EdgeThickness 2
+ I Move
+ I EdgeThickness 0

Is this useful?

This will probaly get fixed after the great style flag rewrite.  Fvwm
has run out of bits for style and several features are overloaded on top
of others.  It's going to happen honest!

This will be possible in 2.3.0.  FvwmEvent has been changed to pass the
windowId when triggering events, and the WindowId command has been
changed to take conditions like Next/Prev.  If you get FvwmEvent to call
a function on a map event you can have the following function:

AddToFunc MapEvent I WindowId $0 (Transient) WarpToWindow

You can even have certain windows deleted as soon as they pop up if you
know their name.

Cheers,
Tim.

Right now  fvwm2 is hanging  in "Recapture()" while run  under Purify,
but before I figure out why, there is a new UMR to report:

This is in Parse.c function GetSuffixedIntegerArguments(), line 438.

Looks to me like the correct fix is:

  if (suffixlist)                                        <-- Remove this?
    suffixes = (suffixlist != NULL) ? strlen(suffixlist) : 0;
  for (i = 0; i < num && action; i++)
  {
    action = GetNextToken(action, &token);
    if (token == NULL)
      break;
    if (sscanf(token, "%d", &(retvals[i])) != 1)
      break;
    if (suffixes != 0 && ret_suffixnum != NULL)          <-- Line 438


Is it only me that would prefer:

suffixes = 0;
if (suffixlist != 0) {
  suffixes = strlen(suffixlist);
}

Just curious.

I haven't studied the entire function, but I can report that the above
change cures the UMR.

Once I figure out the reason for the hang, I should be able to check
out the menu code...

Purify still complains about a UMR on the same line.

Hey, this one is great! I can run under different resolutions and
still have my windows where I want them. There is a bug however:

The feature does not work if applied to windows on a different
than the current page. That should really be fixed. If you do
that, please remember to consider 'sticky' windows too.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

P.S.: The patch is already in CVS.

Oops, I was looking at the wrong line all the time. I've committed
another patch.

Dominik, I still see the transient pager stay up after multiple
releases of button 2 to switch focus. Btw. the apparent leftover grab 
is also caused by this: If you use button 2 to assign focus to a
window under the transient pager, it is raised and hides the pager,
but its pointer grab is still there.

But Maximize without the patch doesn't work on offscreen windows either.
It always moves them to the current page.

I don't have any mention of layers in my .fvwm2rc and everything
defaults to layer 0. The man page states that the default
DefaultLayers is 4 & 6. I get the feeling that a Style * StaysPut
would fix it.

Yes it would, but by strange coincidence I just commited a change
to make styles without any explicit layer-setting options
(ie no StaysOntop/StaysPut/Layer) to behave like StaysPut.
You will get everything in layer 4 now.

Fvwm dumps core if there is a space between the parenthesis 
and HGradient in a TitleStyle function the configuration file as below

TitleStyle ActiveUp ( HGradient 16 rgb:c0/60/77 white)

A space after the "white" causes no problem though.

Some very weird stuff has appeared once again..

Some windows seems to be connected to eachother somehow, causing window
B to follow along to a new page when you move window A across the screen
border.

It seems to be related to the stacking order, since I can make some
other window follow along if I lower/raise some windows...

Can anyone confirm this? (If you don't see it at first, try moving away
some other window while watching what happens to the others)

This did not happen ~3 days ago..

I checked HandleButtonPress in events.c and it looks good. I think
the problem is that the buttons are simply not redrawn although
SetBorder is called. This is easy to verify:

  1) Choose 'Move' from the windowops menu of a raised window.
  2) Title button 1 is still up.
  3) Move the window so that tb1 is obscured by the move feedback
     window.
  4) Title button 1 is now depressed.

Tim, are you familiar with SetBorder? Can you figure out why this is
happening?

Bye

Jason, would you please install this script that Steve wrote

had to be added somewhere in this script

Fine. The only one outstanding is the Pager-Drag-In patch then.

I like the '?' operator if the result fits on a single line.
The UMR was caused by rewriting the if condition to '?' syntax.
I forgot to delete the if statement. Dan, could you apply this

Unfortunately I have to install the autoconf/automake stuff on the FTP

I assume date +%Y%m%d generates an appropriate version string?

Great, that's what I was hoping for.

That was pre-2.2. Obviously, the fix didn't get in CVS up to now.
I'll investigate later.

Hi everybody,

I'm really sorry, it was quite a blunder of mine to forget the British
spelling... :-(

>
>Why do we need to have consistency?

Fvwm is made by a "commission", so lack of consistency in the documentation
should be expected and, hopefully, tolerated.

I re-made the patches bringing the text back to the original "behaviour"
(those of you not satisfied with this solution are invited to add an entry
to the BUGS file :-). Dominik: see if these patches work, I changed some of
the diff parameters and directories, too many perhaps -- if they don't work,
e-mail me directly, and I'll send you the FAQ file.

Sorry again,

                         Fred Maciel
                         E-mail  fred-m@crl.hitachi.co.jp

I want to check, but first of all I have to get it. Is there any way to:
- Use CVS through a web/ftp proxy server to obtain the sources? I'm behind
such a proxy here. (I consulted the CVS manual, it does not seem to work
through proxies).
- Or instead, is it possible to download tar-balls of 2.3.x from somewhere?

(I can pull 2.3.? from ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources with wget,
but I am hoping that there is a more elegant solution...).

Yours truly,

                         Fred Maciel

Ah, I have already applied your old patch by hand (without the
'behavior' change) :)

I'm using a java program that simulates a 'socks proxy' to
do this. A colleague wrote that and perhaps he allows me to
give it away, I'll have to ask. Anyway, within a day or two
there should be dayly snapshots available from our web site
to solve the problem you have.

I gave you a bit of a red herring saying that parts of the border are
redrawn if their windowID matched PressedW.  They are redrawn if
PressedW matches the windowId of the InputOnly window corresponding to
that part of the border.  I'v commited a fix for this (pass None as the
expose_win and the entire border is redrawn).

PCL-CVS very well.

Brad,

  You are too quick.  Thats me and PCL-CVS not getting along.
Plus it detected some conflict markers I left in by mistake, but
finished the commit anyway.

  I believe CVS should be OK now.

  I know, I know.
Compile, test, "cvs update", compile, test, "cvs commit".
Or something like that.

Dan, 
I was to quick I did get the file with the conflicts first then I
got the file again and after receiving this message I tried once more
and what is currentlly in CVS is giving me the compile errors it looks
like you are missing/loosing some variable declerations.

I have made a patch from the other side: instead of using Tmp_win
I pass PressedW as the  expose window. might this break something else?

P.S.: Can anybody explain whet 'red herring' means? I've seen that
many times but could never figure out the exact meaning.

We have this oh so cool online dictionary at work:

*red 'herring n (a) smoke-cured herring. (b) (fig)
 irrelevant matter  introduced to distract attention from the  subject  being 
 discussed.  neither  fish,  flesh,  nor  good red herring, of a doubtful or
 ambiguous nature, which  cannot be defined.  draw a red herring across the
 trail, introduce  irrelevant  matter  to  distract attention from the subject
 being discussed.


Hope this clears it up.

Yes, it breaks the drawing of borders. The resize handles are now
InputOnly, these are what PressedW will be set to when you press a
button in the resize handles. SetBorder draws in tmp_win->frame if
expose_win = tmp_win->frame. Passing expose_win == PressedW does nothing
which is why you see the button pressing having no effect until you move
the window of screen or under the feedback window (which generates
expose events on ->frame if you're lucky).

Cheers,
Tim.

But expose_win == PressedW *fixes* the problem. With that the pressed
button *is* redrawn. And still I think the expose_win should be the
title button window the button was pressed in to minimize redrawing.
Correct?

Has a thesaurus, too.  I actually bound a button on my button bar to a
script that grabs the current selection and sends it to Netscape to pop
up this site, so I just select some word and click mouse-2 on the
button, and bingo!

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'SET_MASK' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'
FvwmPager: Can't find font '-*-lucida\ sans\ typewriter-bold-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*', using fixed.

the set mask error seems to be coming from FvwmIconMan when it starts.

as for the pager font I have always specified that font like that,
escaping the spaces and it worked fine.  Now I've had quite a bit of
trouble with commits since Friday breaking things so I haven't yet
pinpointed where the problem is.  Additionally I usually had to escape
my args into FvwmM4 specifically the begin and enquote as \{ and \} but
now that fails treating \ as my begin and end quotes, so did something
happen with escaped args if it did then this will substanlly break old
configs.

With respects to my previous problems:  

Key bindings - seem to be working again without passing keystrokes to
window
Iconify works with zero args again
Maximize button looks depressed without switching pages (not my
complaint but it is fixed).  
Slow menus -- seems to have been do to some unread config lines due 
to other problems

I was mistaken here the error was from FvwmAnimate and I missed its
complaint about Send_ConfigInfo as well

Hey, that's perfect for the 'hints from the developers' section
of the FAQ. Could you hack in a description there?

This is correct for the title bar and buttons but not for the resize
handles. It would minimize redraws to pass the PressedW as expose_win
but only for the title bar and buttons.  If you can think of a way to do
that and pass Nonw for the resize handles then do it.  I'm beginning to
think that making the resize handles InputOnly was a mistake.

Cheers,
Tim.

So far, I can't reproduce it.

Both commands, "SET_MASK" and "Send_ConfigInfo" are valid commands.
A while ago they broke due to some changes Dominik made to functions.c.
(He removed the underscore.)  Those changes were reversed.

You may want to check your copy of functions.c.

Did you do that in your border changes? Where is the border drawn
now. Into the frame?

Yes & Yes. After I took tmp_win->bw away FvwmBorder styles were broken. 
It was easier to get the FvwmBorder look into the frame than put it in
all 8 resize handles plus the frame but the cost is extra drawing. I
also had the mad idea that it would be easier to implement gradient
borderstyles if there was only one window to worry about.

Cheers,
Tim.

Is it possible that different implementations of the string
library have different opinions it upper case letters come
before or after a backslash? The list in functions.c seems
to conflict with what Dan said earlier: that the underscore
is in between upper and lowercase letters. Since upper case
letters have the higher ASCII code the '_' should be before
them, but I tried it and came to the conclusion I had to
put it behind the letters in the list.

And make sure that you have compiled all modules after the reversal
of the changes. (I usually just recompile fvwm proper and thus I 
had those error messages for some time after the reversal - but I knew
why)

And now you think you were wrong? I don't think so. Don't let a few

I have problems like this frequently. I think the dependencies
might not be generated properly. Any comments by the automake
experts?

Login, I get 2 xterms (layer 4), fvwmbuttons (l3), fvwmpager (sticky,
l6), xconsole (l3), xdaliclock (sticky, l6) and a transparent Eterm
(sticky, l1).

----
EdgeResistance 0 10
EdgeScroll 100 100
Mouse 1 W M Move
----

I grab one of the xterms and the xconsole follows to the new page _in
some directions_, but not all directions.

If I move the xconsole, one of the xterms might come along.. if I
change stacking order of the xterms, another will follow instead.

I'll try to make a very small fvwm2rc tonight with exact instructions
how to reproduce.. (Or just check exactly what has been changed since it
worked..)

well thinking that was the problem I did make; make clean; make; make instal-strip

Now I just specifically went into FvwmAnimate and did a make clean; make install-strip exited fvwm and restarted

and now I get :
FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'Send_ConfigInfo' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'Send_WindowList' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'Send_WindowList' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'

The executable is running but if I go to my control animation menu it doesn't pop up. now if I kill the exe and restart it I get:
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'read' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'read' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'read' in ModulePath '/home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0'

but I get the control animation menu and the animation now works.

and yes I did do cvs update and I got no problems except for some
.cvsignore files I added some missing files to.

Just to second this. There is a problem withthe module comms, I don't
know what it is though but I'm also getting error messages about missing
commands.

Cheers,

If you're using the proper versions of the tools I have no idea; I don't
see this myself.  Things always rebuild correctly for me.

As someone else pointed out, you should be sure to build from the
top-level fvwm dir, not just within the fvwm subdir, otherwise things
like libs etc. won't recompile.  There's no rule within fvwm/fvwm that
jumps to fvwm/libs to make sure everything's kosher there, for example.

If you can reproduce it, we can look at it.  Next time something doesn't
rebuild properly when a header or something is changed, check the
.deps/foo.P file for the .c file that didn't recompile and make sure it
has the proper dependencies listed.

Whoops!  You're exactly right!

And probably fvwm.c and read.c, too, right?

The fvwm/Makefile.am has a problem: it defines some explicit rules for
these three objects.  But these rules don't do all the fancy dependency
handling stuff that the implicit rules for the other .o's do, so
there're no dependency checks at all for those files!

We'll have to fix that :-/.

I don't see yet, how the module communications can be involved
since the commands that come as invalid are plainly valid.

Purify reports that the line with the arrow has  a "BSR" (beyond stack
read).

            DoGetNextToken [Parse.c:279]
                 if (tmptok == NULL)
                   *token = NULL;
                 else
            =>     *token = strdup(tmptok);
                 return end;
               }

I don't know if I screwed it up or not.  Looks like there were a number
of recent changes.

Hi All,

Quick question regarding "fvwm cvs".

Is there some way for people who live behind a firewall to obtain the
current fvwm tarball using ftp or http? I live behind a firewall that
unfortunately won't allow CVS to cross it. I noticed the presence of an
HTTP interface to fvwm cvs, but that requires a file-by-file approach to
downloading fvwm. I've also looked at the code under
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources, and found that it was an
incomplete image (e.g., misses "configure").

Would someone be willing to volunteer to generate snapshot tarballs and
make them available on ftp.fvwm.org? Probably on a weekly, biweekly or
even monthly basis would be more than sufficient...

Thanks,

Nagi Aboulenein

This change resolves the BSR I reported earlier.  I simply changed an
automatic variable to static.  The change removes the BSR but I doubt
making the variable static is what the author had in mind.

The change seems to help with the unrecognized commands, but I don't
think everything is back to normal yet.

Perhaps you weren't yet on the list earlier today; I promised to have
something going in the near term.  You can also just fetch the current
sources from /pub/fvwm/devel/sources if you find that simpler than getting
the whole tarball.  It will be quicker for small changes.

I'm trying to build a snapshot without reinstalling my whole bloody system.
A new m4, automake, autoconf, manual hacks on both to get them to run, and
how make blows up on FvwmCommand.pm.

The system in question calls perl4 "perl"; a modern version is "perl5".
Changing this would require the update of a bunch of other infrastructure
that probably doesn't work with perl5.

The make fails like so:

if test -n "/usr/local/bin/perl"; then /usr/local/bin/perl ./findcmd.pl /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.0   \
        < ../../fvwm/functions.c > FvwmCommand.pm;                              \
else echo Did not find perl during FVWM install > FvwmCommand.pm; fi
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../..  -I/usr/openwin/include    -g -O2 -c FvwmCommandS.c

syntax error in file ./findcmd.pl at line 54, next 2 tokens "create_pm("
Execution of ./findcmd.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
make[4]: *** [FvwmCommand.pm] Error 255

If I can get around this, I can build snapshots.

Try 

	PERL=/usr/local/bin/perl5 ./configure

Yeah, I know.  configure should ensure it really got a perl 5.

Ah.  So if that's the case, how about just fixing PixmapPath and
BitmapPath (in functions.c:pixmapPath_function and bimapPath_function,
respectively)?  You can use GetImagePath and SetImagePath to do what you
want.

This next change has gotten to the point where I'd like to describe
the state its in.

Changes so far:

fvwm.c: remove builtin command table, from function "SetUpRCDefaults"
instead, issue command "read FvwmDefaults".
Export environment variables "FVWM_USERHOME", "FVWM_CONFIGDIR".
FVWM_USERHOME is ".fvwm2/" or ".".

New installed    file "sample.fvwmrc/FvwmDefaults".  Contains commands
from builtin  command table.  All mouse  buttons  on the root activate
the  builtin menu.  The   Help key and F1   on  the root activate  the
builtin menu.  A new  menu entry in  the builtin menu invokes  "Module
FvwmForm FormFvwmHelp.".

New  installed file "sample.fvwmrc/FormFvwmHelp.".  Contains help text
for a new user.  A button invokes the commands:

  "!/bin/cp ${FVWM_CONFIGDIR}/FvwmSetup ${FVWM_USERHOME}fvwm2rc"
  "Restart fvwm2"

New  installed     file    "sample.fvwmrc/FvwmSetup"  is     based  on
system.fvwmrc.   Module  menu invokes  all  the new Fvwmform builtins.
The module  definitions   are separate   files   accessed with  "Read"
commands.

New installed files "sample.fvwmrc/":
FvwmButtonBar, FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmPager, FvwmWinList,
(so far).  The users .fvwm2rc is created with reads for these files.

Comments:

Right  now, the forms  are in "sample.fvwmrc".   I think they might be
better located in "fvwm" and the appropriate "module" directories.

Exporting the environment    variables   was necessary to    make  the
installation form  work.  I was recently  discussed,  its not  good to
flood the environment with junk.  So far its only 2 new variables.

The   ".fvwm2"  is currently hardcoded.   This    seems to  be  normal
practice.  So  far, the user  creates  the directory from  the command
line.

So far the config file naming convention is:

Forms: "FormFvwmXxx.". Example: "FormFvwmHelp."

Command config files: "FvwmXxx". Example: "FvwmSetup"

Builtin menus: "MenuFvwmXxx". Example: "MenuFvwmBuiltin".

Builtin functions: "FuncFvwmXxx". Example: "FuncFvwmFocusAndWarp".

Yes, I changed a lot. I expected something like this to happen.
Token parsing is done in a static buffer now. This removed the need
for the same code in several functions (like GetNextToken vs.
PeekToken or the new CheckToken). There is a #define somewhere
that specifies the maximum allowed token length i.e. the buffer
size. I bet this number is too small. Previously it was used in
one call from one module (in PeekToken).

Oops, it *is* the right way to fix this. How could I simply
return data from the stack...

Of course. Data read from uninitialised stack space is a bit
random. I wonder how this could run for me.

I didn't follow this thread, so correct me if I'm saying something
stupid. But won't fvwm screw up completely if it doesn't find its
builtin command table and no other config file? Or it the FvwmDefaults
do not contain at least an exit entry in a menu? This would
completely lock your X server. Since I use some custom installation
procedure I think this will happen on my system if I delete my
.fvwm2rc.

Jason, could you put a link to the snapshot in the web page
(with a warning that snapshots are not intended for testing only
and that they may not even compile)?

This seems to have taken care of all my unrecognized commands,
now I just have some escape problems.  Now this always worked
before so, I have 
*FvwmPagerBalloonFont -*-lucida\ sans\ typewriter-bold-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* 

in my config, and this previouslly always worked now it complains font
not found.  I also use to call fvwm with args like this 
-m4-squote \{ -m4-equote \} 
but now I have to do this 
-m4-squote { -m4-equote } 
which make things difficult if I try and switch back and forth between
2.2 and 2.3

Any thoughts on what could have changed this?

I think you missed the point.  In  "DoPeekToken" the variable "tmptok"
was automatic.  Its address is being returned to  the caller by way of
"char **token".  This   caused  the BSR.  I  changed  it  to  a static
variable, but in general  I don't think we would  want to have a bunch
of static areas   to hold intermediate parse  results.   If you  don't
mind, then forget it.  I didn't detect any area being too small.

There is no thread yet, this was the first response.

The file "FvwmDefaults" is installed in the "sysconfdir" no matter how
you run  configure.  If a user is  so foolish as  to remove  it, fvwm2
reverts to how it used to behave before we had the builtin menu.  That
is, you can't do anything with it.

I think thats a problem,  but a small  problem.  The advantage is that
you have 2 easily editable  files, "FvwmDefaults" and "FvwmSetup".  If
you are  familiar with the builtin default  setup, the  only thing you
can do with it is "exit".  It even lacks enough bindings to give focus
to a window.  (Or so it seemed to me.)   I'm finding it much easier to
decide what belongs in each file now that they are external files.

I'm guessing that "FvwmDefaults" will  grow considerably now that  its
an external file.

Do I need to do anything to FvwmWinList/Makefile.am?  These two files
have an extra include now (fvwm/fvwm.h).

If the ordering is a problem, then the solution is simple: sort the list
at startup time.  Surely the quicksort() and bsearch() functions ought to
agree *on the same machine*!

Thanks for the "heads-up", Dan, but I'm afraid that I've gotten lost in
all the discussion. 

Before you commit, could you remind us why you are doing this?  What is
the problem you are trying to solve, and how will these changes help?  It
would be nice to discuss this before commits go in.

Any idea if "/bin/cp" works on VMS?

Two more environment variables is three too many: remember that we are
working to get rid of FVWM_MODULEDIR.

Environment variables are the run-time equivalent of global variables. 
They are only to be used as a last resort.

I don't know if it is normal practice.  I do not think it is *good*
practice.  One ought to be able to set it.

I meant the config file thread.

Duh, I never install fvwm with 'make install' but copy the files with
a script (much easier to adapt). This change will force me to set some
environment variable.

But if you modify this file fvwm might even crash. Some functionalities
absolutely require an initial config command or they will not do what
they should or even coredump. MenuStyle is a good example. The first
MenuStyle command is interpreted to give the default menu style. If
the first MenuStyle command does not use the '*' style you will not
have '*' as the default style. I know there are other commands that
simply cause a coredump (can't remember which).

Perhaps we could leave a minimal builtin config that just initialises
all the necessary structures and can be overridden by the file. But
at least you should be able to terminate fvwm.

I like the idea too, but we can't rely on such a file for the most
basic functionality.

I have tinkered with parsing a bit to make it more consistent.
There may still be a few problems.

No, I don't mind since the static area is nothing new. It was in the
code before.

Nope.

The only time the .am file needs to change is if you added new file to
the directory.  You don't need to change it if you just modified what
files are included: the dependency checking will take care of all that
for you.

What's the difference between FvwmDefaults and fvwm2rc/system.fvwm2rc?
Why not just remove SetUpRCDefaults and let the default startup file
reading do the work.

Could we have ".fvwm/" instead of ".fvwm2/"?  Better yet could fvwm take
note of these variables if they are already set and use them unchanged? 
There would be no need to do a scan for ~/.fvwm/, just use the already
set value if there is one, or export FVWM_USEHOME=".".

These variables only need to be exported for modules don't they?  It
might be better to not export them for Exec's so as not to grow the
users env too much. Same goes for FVWM_MODULEDIR I think.

Cheers,
Tim.

No.  You need only edit the makefile if you add or remove source files.

But _why_?  I just don't see any practical purpose in allowing this to
be configured.  Under what circumstances would you want to change it?
_How_ would you change it?

We don't allow you to change the name of the ~/.fvwm2rc file and no one
seems to care about that; why would we allow changing the name of the
~/.fvwm2 directory?

I don't know of any other app, anywhere, that allows you to customize
the name of the user's config directory or filename (at least not
without changing the source).

Looking at what's in SetRcDefaults I'd guess that not having XORValue,
DefaultFont, DefaultColors, HilightColor and "style * color ?/?" could
all cause core dumps.

I have some sticky windows, whose icons are also sticky (my mail reader
for example).  With current cvs I see the window start do deiconfiy
and then I get switched to the last page I was on when I iconified the
window.  Anyone else see this?

Er, we can already do it:

  # fvwm2 -f my_config_file

Not that I want to say that we need it as an environment variable.

Good question.

The part about FVWM_USERHOME lets users get the clutter out of their
home directory.

The part about the Form being invoked from the startup menu automates
the creation of the users .fvwm2rc.

Pulling  the table out  of fvwm.c makes it easier   to change and just
seems like  the right thing to  do.  It slightly   reduces the size of
fvwm2.

Exporting the environment variables  seems like the most expedient way
of letting  commands  like the   "/bin/cp"  below work.   I  also need
FVWM_USERDIR  in  FormFvwmDefaults. and  the FvwmAnimate customization
dialog.

Overall, I'm trying to lay the groundwork for automated customization.

Not a clue.  I thought of implementing some kind of "Write" command
in fvwm2, but something like this seemed preferable.  I believe we
have OS2 users also.  I could use plain "cp" but I don't know yet
if that would help.  The forms default dialog is currently using
"/bin/echo" and "/bin/date".

I agree.  I  tried to get FvwmDefaults to   pass thru "sed" by  making
changes to Makefile.am and got  nowhere.  Any hints would be  welcome.
That would help with FVWM_CONFIGDIR but not with FVWM_USERHOME.

A while ago I posted a list of all the "dot" subdirectories in my home
directory.    Not one package  gave   me  any control  over what  that
subdirectories name was going to be.

So far,  there is nothing about   the way I've  implemented this, that
wouldn't  let  one change it  by  writing a command  to give  it a new
value.

Is the window switched back or the viewport?

Yeah, I think this is a good point.  The builtin defaults (SetRCDefaults)
were intended as a fail-safe, not as a useful minimum, right?

Indeed.

Better yet: leave a fail-safe compiled in that lets you start an xterm to
fix things, or exit fvwm.

Then install a useful default system.fvwmrc if none already exists.

I meant to say, the default name.

We could even re-use that switch; just stat the path given with -f and

Good, I've got you doing it.  (Its really "PixmapPath" and "IconPath".)

No problem,  but then  I have 2  obsolete  commands doing something no
other  command     does, so   I'll have  to     add  the   new command
"AddToImagePath".  Of course  I could go  with the ":+:" change, but I
really wanted to just get  existing configurations working, and  spend
more time on customization.

I  really  think we  need  builtin   paths.  I'm  trying   to simplify
installation  and    customization.   Making each    user  know  where
everything is installed won't help.

I would vote for making ModulePath work the same as ImagePath.

Any more votes for "AddToImagePath" in addition to "ImagePath"?

I agree with this.  There's no backward-compatibility issue so we should
use ~/.fvwm.  Plus if everyone starts moving there it'll be that much
less painful if/when we decide to change the config file back to
~/.fvwmrc :)

Look at the way it's done in fvwm/Makefile.am.  Basically, you specify
that FVWM_CONFIGDIR should be substituted in the configure.in file, then
you use $(FVWM_CONFIGDIR) in the Makefile.am, like:

    -DFVWM_CONFIGDIR=\"$(FVWM_CONFIGDIR)\"

No seds necessary! :)

Hang on, alright just ignore me, in the function I call to deiconify
or possible run apps I was for some reason doing a prev FlipFocus,
and that was the culprit, so just disregard this problem.

Oops, Brad

The  difference is  that  FvwmDefaults will  continue  to be read even
after  the user creates a  .fvwm2rc whereas the  system.fvwmrc is only
read if fvwm2 doesn't find a .fvwm2rc.

I seem to be blind to the problem.  If you install fvwm2 correctly,
the file will be there and fvwm2 will read it.  If you don't install
fvwm2 correctly, it doesn't work.

I can't quite envision why one wouldn't install fvwm2 correctly.

The "xterm" part was recently added to the builtin table, I haven't
removed it from FvwmDefaults, but I found I was unable to get the
window to take focus so I could do something with it.  I might
have been doing something wrong.

Individual taste, for one: see Tim's email on .fvwm versus .fvwm2.

> _How_ would you change it?

On the command line of fvwm.  In the rc file.

I'm not terribly concerned about a SINGLE rc file, such as .fvwmrc.  I
grant you that is common practice.  

However, we seem to be moving into splitting the configuration into a
zillion files.  First of all, I'm not sure exactly what problem we are
trying to solve.  Nor am I convinced this is the best way to solve it. 

If we *do* require a directory to hold a zillion config files, then .fvwm
is a reasonable DEFAULT choice.  But is it so hard to make this
customizable?  I think not.

You may not know about it because it is not commonly done, but trn and
pine allow it.  Pine and elm and trn also allow customizing of the
directories typically called ~/News, ~/mail or ~/Mail.  Etc, etc.  I'm
sure there are others, but that is beside the point.  The point is: why
hardcode if there is a way to make it customizable?

In this case  I don't care.  I  was going to go  with ".fvwm" until  I
read  Robert   Ford's description   of   his use of   a  configuration
subdirectory that he called ".fvwm2".  I took his post as one vote for
".fvwm2".  Now I see 2 votes for ".fvwm".  Lets assume I am now on the
".fvwm" bandwagon.  How many objections to ".fvwm" are there?

Yes, but inconsistency is not a problem with obsolete commands!

I'd rather spend the time now on a consistent behaviour than have a lot of
add-hoc nonsense that is impossible to remove later.  [How did we come to
have two image-paths, anyway?]

> I  really  think we  need  builtin   paths. 

Yes for modules; no for images.  We don't install images to any standard
place.  

In a perfect world the icon package (fvwm-icons) would install itself with
a script that FVWM's configure could query to find out where the icons
live.  *THEN* a built-in path would make sense.

> I would vote for making ModulePath work the same as ImagePath.

Absolutely.
 
> Any more votes for "AddToImagePath" in addition to "ImagePath"?

We need the ability to both PREpend and Append to the paths.  I would
rather one powerful command, say ImagePath with some '+' token, than three
commands: SetImagePath, AppendImagePath, and PrependImagePath.  But maybe
that's just me.

Thats   fine for   C  programs, but  in this    case, I  need  to  get
FVWM_CONFIGDIR into a command  generated by a form  file.  Here is the
form file in question:

Oh I see.  Yes, I think that is a useful thing.  I never did understand
why the startup logic read "system.fvwmrc" OR ".fvwmrc", and not both.
It makes it terribly hard to set useful site defaults and allow users to
override them.

But this begs the question: why invent a new name?  Why not read
system.fvwmrc, then the users .fvwmrc?

Nevertheless, people do.  I've done it in the very recent past -- that's
why I stuck in the "xterm" option.  ;-) 

I'd really prefer to have a compiled-in failsafe menu that allows me to
open an xterm and fix my goof.  It would only be used if the defaults file
couldn't be found.

Oh.  In that case you should name the file FvwmFormHelp.in, then add it
to the list of AC_OUTPUT(...) files in configure.in.  Then it will be
processed as any other .in file, during configure, and all appropriate
markers replaced during a translation to plain FvwmFormHelp.

Then you can do things in FvwmFormHelp.in like:

  de> *FormFvwmHelp.Command   Exec exec /bin/cp @FVWM_CONFIGDIR@/FvwmDefaults ${FVWM_USERHOME}fvwm2rc

and the @FVWM_CONFIGDIR@ will be replaced by the appropriate value (if
you've called AC_SUBST() on it in configure.in).

I *never* install fvwm in the intended way. Why assume the user

This doesn't work.  FVWM_CONFIGDIR is set to ${sysconfdir}, which is not
known at configure time.  It is only known at build time.  That's why
there are exceptional rules for fvwm/{builtins,fvwm,read}.c that pass
these values in via '-D' options, rather than getting it from config.h.

I think sed is the only possibility in the case of non-C.  For the perl
script FvwmConsoleC, I stole the following from cvs, which I think is
adaptable for Dan's purposes:

FvwmConsoleC.pl: FvwmConsoleC.pl.in
        rm -f $@
        sed -e 's,xPERLx,$(PERL),' $< > $@-t
        mv $@-t $@
        chmod +x $@

(although, come to think of it, the "chmod +x" at the end is unnecessary,
since it is listed in a _SCRIPTS primary)

Oh yah.  I forgot about allowing makefile overrides.  Very important,
though; I do it myself relatively frequently and always curse autoconf
packages which break this kind of thing :)

It seems reasonable to check for the variable before looking for the
directory.  I see we also have an "SM_SAVE_DIR", so this wouldn't be
the first one.

fork(),

   putenv(),
   exec().

I'll try it.

To avoid bloat.
To reduce confusion in problem reports.
To avoid mysterious behavior.  (I removed a lot of junk from my .profile,
and now fvwm2 doesn't work.)

Bear in mind that right now, I've agreed to let this be set by way of
an environment variable.

No   one has  addressed the  issue    of how/when this directory  gets
created.  Right  now the  path for  the novice  user is, fvwm2 creates
lots of files in their home directory.  They get frustrated, hopefully
read some documentation,  do a mkdir, move  a bunch of existing config
files,  and restart.  Instead of  thinking about more and more control
over every aspect of  fvwm2 behavior,  I think we  need to  think more
about making things work well automatically.

Maybe I'll add a mkdir option to FvwmSetup.

Message from user in 2010:  You removed the obsolete command "PixmapPath"
which I still use because its the only command I found that worked.
Please but it back.

I believe one was for Pixmaps (color) and the other for Bitmaps (black
and white).  Realizing later that the world isn't so neatly organized,
both commands set paths for both image types.

I think the new "FvwmDefaults" will include menus.
As it is, system.fvwmrc refers to a number of icons.  I intend to install
the icons that are directly referred to in the new FvwmDefaults.

So the "perfect world" is not so far away, and I think we need builtin
icon paths.

This is not so clear.  I intended my sentence to mean that
both ModulePath and ImagePath would adopt the behavior of the
new ImagePath.  Both commands would add to the front of the path.

Why do we need all  this elaborate control over  the imagePath?  Isn't
this unnecessary bloat?

I started to try to code one of those "+" thingies.  It was taking too
long,  so I settled  for  just  plain  prepend,  which acts just  like
setting the path unless you want  to NOT find  something.  I can't see
why you would want to not find an image (or a module).

As you all might have noticed, I dived  into ImagePath, did my damage,
and now I'm out.  I don't mind going back  in to change ImagePath back
to its old behavior, as  long as PixmapPath  and IconPath continue  to
work as they once did,  but if anyone  else wants  to tackle the  more
elaborate "+" stuff, explain why we need it and then go for it.

The crazy thing is, the logic is,
read $HOME/.fvwm2rc,
not found, read $FVWM_CONFIGDIR/.fvwm2rc,
not found, read $FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwmrc.

So logically, system.fvwmrc should have always been called .fvwm2rc.

In this list, we previously recognized that some users followed the
instructions at the front of the "system.fvwmrc" and made local
customizations and installed the file.  If we start installing the
file under that name, we are going to break fvwm2 installations
that run without $HOME/.fvwm2rc files.

Besides that, I think we need a new, more consistent naming convention.

As  for the  last part, we  don't   want to  read "system.fvwmrc" then
".fvwm2rc".  We  want to  read "FvwmDefaults"  (or the  builtin array)
then  ".fvwm2rc".  The system.fvwmrc file is  a starting point for the
users .fvwm2rc file.

Darn, I still think removing the builtin is a really good idea, and
I appear to be all alone on this one.

Someone agree with me that hardcoding all this junk in fvwm.c
is unnecessary.  There are lots of programs that won't work if you
don't install all their parts.

I intend to remove the need for lots of users to configure the
pager, fvwmident, etc. by having prewritten configs for these modules
in sysconfdir.  They really will need to install fvwm2 correctly
for any of this to work.

Oh well, its not  necessary to remove the  builtin array for  what I'm
doing, but I'm not convinced that the hardcoded table is a good idea.

I had found this and tried to duplicate it, and couldn't get it
to work.  Is there something else going on outside the Makefile.am
that makes this work?

The above rule gets the ".in" file from the source tree to the build
directory.  I believe I ran into problems getting the file from
the build directory into sysconfdir.

What file do I put into the config_DATA list?

No, I won't agree. We *need* a setup that allows fvwm to come up
and at least allow the user to exit always. I agree that much of
the stuff can be taken out. Crshing or locking up the X server
just because the installation did not work as it should or because
someone took a vital command out of the file is not acceptable
behaviour.

I'm not saying the fvwm should run well with a screwed up installation,
but that it must not take down the whole system. With a locked X server
you may even have to unplug the power cord of your machine. And this
only because a single non critical file was damaged.

No it won't, it will force you to copy one or more additional files.
You already have to do that for the FvwmTalk replacement.
Nothing I've done yet forces you to set an environment variable.

The exports that I described above are done by fvwm2.

Groan.  Is this program called fvwm or fvwm2?  Are we going to call
the config files fvwmrc or fvwm2rc?  Surely the directories should be
then be called sample.fvwm2rc and all files similarly?

FVWM 1.xx never looked in a .fvwm/ directory, so why can't we use that
for the current FVWM by default, maybe looking for a .fvwm2/ directory
if that fails?

[I've just created a Debian version of FVWM 2.2 which uses the
~/.fvwm/ directory to look for "hook files".  I don't particularly
want to have to get everyone to change their stuff in six months' time
when 2.4.0 is released, so it would be great to know whether this use
of .fvwm2/ is intended to remain that way, then I'll make the change
now before too many people have used it.  BTW, the hook files are a
really nice idea: the system.fvwm2rc has a basic structure, with
Read .fvwm/foo.hook commands scattered through it, allowing the user
to customise bits of fvwm2 without having to write their own full
.fvwm2rc.]

Gee,  everywhere  I've  ever   worked we produce   a design  document,
schedule one or  more meetings for review,  etc.  I like this blizzard
of e-mail much better.

The changes I've accepted so far are:

1. Default FVWM_USERHOME to ".fvwm" instead of ".fvwm2".

2. If FVWM_USERHOME is already exported, don't even do a "stat()"
to check for the directory, just use it.

3. Only export the 2 new variables for modules.  (Keep them
out of Exec'ed commands.)

4. Make sure fvwm2 exits or the user can exit if there are no
usable config files around.

Don't groan,  after todays discussion, it will default to ".fvwm".

I hope I don't cause you any problems.  The new logic would take
"Read .fvwm/foo.hook" and would look for
"$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm/hook.foo".
       ^^^^^^^^^^^

Can you control the "Read" commands so that they can be easily changed
to "Read hook.foo"?

I heartily agree.  The effective setup really ought to be:

 - Read some sort of system defaults, be it in an FvwmDefaults file, a
   system.fvwm2rc file or the like, but only *one* of these; there
   should *either* be a defaults file or a system.fvwm2rc file, not
   both.  What advantage is there in having two configuration files?

 - Then read the user's .fvwm2rc file.

I am also puzzled as to why we need to enforce a myriad of config
files.  A user should surely be able to run FVWM with no config files?
If they wish to configure stuff, let them create the files (as
described in the docs, which our average user *will* read, right? ;).
There should be "sensible" defaults for everything, and the personal
files only modify the defaults, they don't replace them.

So I would envisage system.fvwm2rc being something like:

ModulePath $FVWM_MODULEDIR:/usr/local/lib/fvwm
IconPath /foo/bar:/foo/baz
PixmapPath /foo/bar:/foo/baz

MenuStyle "*" ....

etc., and then the user's .fvwm2rc modifies this.  How does that sound?

And if we wish the user to be able to add things at various points
during the reading of the system.fvwm2rc, we can have commands such as
 Read .fvwm/colours Quiet
at the appropriate points.  (And if we're also catering for Americans,
we can also check for .fvwm/colors ;)

One advantage of the latter approach is that precisely one file needs
changing, both upstream and in individual installations, and that is
the system.fvwm2rc file.  This seems far easier than coding a lot of
stuff into the executable code, and it makes the result far simpler

That bit's easy.  A question I then ask myself, though, is: will this
directory be automatically created?  How much of the stuff in it will
be essential?  Can the user lock themselves in knots by accidentally
deleting any given file from this directory, or, indeed, the entire
directory?  If the answer's "no" to the latter question, I'm happy.

In the CVS code as of last night (I hadn't updated in several days),
newly-created ClickToFocus windows fail to get the focus automatically
*if* there is already a window on the same page that has focus. Has
anybody else been noticing this lately?

	If the currently focused window is on another page, the focus transfer
behaves normally.

Something has moved the flags in fvwm.h. I think it's the
dissapearance of the OnTop bit.  A quick grep for STICKY in
modules/*/*.h lists FvwmIdent, Save & Save desk as broken.
There may be more.  The fix is for those modules to include
fvwm/fvwm.h

FvwmCommand 'Desk 0 0'
xv &
FvwmCommand 'next (xv) MoveToDesk 0 1'
FvwmCommand 'next (xv) Stick'

Since xv is now sticky it should appear on desk 0. This
confuses some modules too.

I've observed this bit of strangeness for some time now, but it seemed
intermittent, and I didn't have a handle on the conditions that
triggered it. I think I have now.

	If I iconify a Motif app, then move the icon, then deiconify it, the
window is only partially drawn - usually just the first item in the
menubar. If I move the window a little, then it gets redrawn in its
entirety.

	This doesn't happen with some apps, but I can consistently make it
happen with any Motif app. Hmmm... just tried it with xv, and it does
the same thing. Do this on the initial screen, and when it deiconifies,
only a little fragment in the top left corner gets drawn.

	Well, ok, I just tried a variety of programs, and it happens with a lot
of them, not just Motif. Happens with xterm, doesn't with rxvt. Doesn't
happen with several KDE apps I tried. XForms apps just freak out and
silently die - but they're prone to that.

	Has anyone else observed this?

But SM_SAVE_DIR is *not* exported - why should it ?

Because of the many complaints I've created another style that
allows to configure this. The default has changed so that the
focus is not grabbed by new clicktofocus windows. The style to use
is

  Style * ClickToFocus, GrabFocus

	But I never complained....  :-)

	I remember seeing that change fly by, butI didn't notice that you'd
changed the default. Thanks. Now to try to catch up with the "setup
change" thread....

I want to announce fvwm-icons project. The purposes of the project are:
  * separating icons from fvwm distribution
  * creating efficient standardized wm-independent icons distribution

There are already several people, including Steve Robbins, Pat Rogan and
Michael Han, supporting this project. Anyone from fvwm-workers mailing list,
willing to join the project, is welcome.

More information can be found at:
  http://milonka.ml.org/fvwm-icons/

Please contact me if you want to participate in this project. We could
setup a mailing list to discuss all project nuances (there are many) if
there are enough enthusiasts. Or maybe fvwm-workers is a good place for
fvwm-icons discussions? :) I don't really think so.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

Just after hitting "SEND", I noticed something else.  After getting xterm
into the weird state, I can recover by: resizing the window, or flipping
to another screen and back.

Hopefully this will ring a bell with someone who is familiar with this bit
of code.

Yup, I can do it consistently with xterm, too.  In fact, it doesn't matter
HOW little I move the icon.  When I deiconify, the xterm not only fails to
refresh, but only the top-left corner of the text area does anything at
*all* anymore.  The area is maybe 15 pixels tall by 50 wide.  Not even a
"full reset" of xterm will convince it to use the rest of the window.

Sorry, perhaps that sentence isn't clear.

I was referring to the new requirement to read an environment variable
(FVWM_USERHOME), and I was   looking for other  environment  variables
read by fvwm2, and I found this line:

session.c:692:  path = getenv ("SM_SAVE_DIR");

Hmm...15x50.  Sounds like the size of an icon.

Perhaps you should do a make clean.  I know I was still having
problems until I did one earlier today.

	Nope, that's not it. I don't build in my CVS tree. After I do an
update, I copy the tree to a test directory where I build it; so I
always do a clean "from scratch" build following each update.

	This problem's been around for some time. I just didn't hit it very
often, and it was only today that I noticed what I'd done to trigger it.

What if the user has no .fvwm2rc file?

The point of the system rc file is for exactly this case: if the user
has no personal config then it provides some kind of usable setup.  The
user can copy that and modify it as he/she likes.  Note I'm _NOT_
holding up the current system.fvwm2rc files as a good example of this.

I'm not sure why people are confused about why we don't automatically
source system.fvwm2rc.  If all you want to put in there is some default
styles, sure, go ahead, I guess.

But as soon as you start adding anything that might stand for a
replacement of the user's .fvwm2rc file, now you're talking menus, etc.
Then if the user _does_ have a .fvwm2rc file, and both get sourced, he
has to go in and undo all that stuff from the system rc file!  Bogus.

When I write my .fvwm2rc file, I want the menus, etc. I've defined, and
nothing else.  Without a lot of work :).

Pls. don't, at least for FVWM_MODULEDIR!  Thx.

PS. I think some of these others will be useful to Exec'd commands, too:
    for example FVWM_USERDIR would be very handy for writing generic
    scripts, esp. if the user is allowed to change the thing with the -f
    option or something.  We find $HOME handy, right?

    I still don't really grok the aversion to environment variables, but
    if we really want to get rid of them please provide some equivalent
    way of obtaining that information from a shell script.

    Chuck Hines emailed me and suggested using properties on the root
    window (I lost his email) which could be retrieved with xprop; this
    is a funky idea but it seems too complicated to me--then again, I
    prefer the simplicity of environment variables so what do I know :)

Well, if many people like the old behaviour I can easily chnge the default.
What do you think?

Don't foget that we're not discussing changes to the way Read treats
absolute paths.  If Julian changes his reads to "Read
$HOME/.fvwm/hook.foo" it will always work no matter what we do to the
read-relative logic.

Just another snow-flake,

I would agree if we could be certain that the junk to be removed doesn't
actually prevent any core-dumps/lock-ups in the event that a user starts
fvwm without any rc files or strange rc files.

Take for example the AddToMenu in SetRcDefaults(). One side effect is
that the "+" command has something to add to.  If fvwm didn't execute an
AddTo* before the users rc file did a "+ I Exec xterm" the "+" command
might core-dump on a NULL reference.

I'm not saying that it will, just that we should make sure before
removing stuff.

Cheers,
Tim.

Not that I use ClickToFocus but on the principle of least suprise
shouldn't the default be the old behaviour and the fix for complaints be 

Style * GrabFocusOff

I made FvwmWinLIst include fvwm/fvwm.h to define STICKY etc. It
shouldn't matter what happens to the bits now.  The GSFR is going to
break it but then the GSFR will require the module protocol to change as
the flags won't be constrained to an int so it won't be just FvwmWinLIst
that need attention.

Tim.

Well, that depends on how many people will dislike the change. If most
are happy with the change the new default is probably okay. In the end
the question is how we can make more people happy. Wouldn't people who
dislike the new behaviour ask what has happened? Probably more often
than new users would try to find out how to turn it off. Or am I
totally wrong here? I don't care myself what the default is. Any
votes which one to use?

Great idea! Just a quick moan though: could you specify the text and
link colours for this page as well as the background, white on pink is
difficult to read.

	After playing with this for a bit, I see a bit of a problem with it.
When you pop up a transient - like a string search dialogue in your
favorite editor - you usually expect it to get focus automatically. But
with this change, it doesn't, and you find yourself typing the search
string into the file you're editing.

	Any thoughts on whether transients should automatically get focus,
regardless of the GrabFocus setting?

	As to the default, I'm inclined to agree with Tim on the principle of
least surprise.

I'm living with this for ages now (Sloppy Focus). There should be
another global or style option that allows to set this for mouse
and sloppy focus too.

I've just checked cde's dtwm. It also grabs the focus.

Suffer no longer. You can fix this with FvwmEvent with the PassID config
option and a functions called on add_window events:

AddToFunc map_event I WindowId $0 (Transient) your_focus_and_warp_func

It's not perfect, that would mean checking that the transient is a
transient of the current window, but most of the time transients don't
just pop up from nowhere.

Cheers,
Tim.

I've only applied it to FVWM_USERDIR.

I would prefer environment variables over properties also.
If we come up with a use for FVWM_USERDIR in an Exec'd command,
I will move it to a place where its available for Exec's.

I think a  few truly global and useful   environment variables are  no
problem.  Putting them where they are not needed is a problem.

Actually if you just move the window, at least with xterms it works.  I
have actually noticed this for about two weeks but the only thing I have
icons for is a few xterms and my mailer (rxvt).  Now rxvt doesn't do it,
but the xterms I have if, Dominik remembers, active icons.  Recentlly
I noticed if I move the active icon it shrinks to a bogus size, if i
deocinify I get about a half height for the window text, move the window
all the text comes back, and then iconify and my icon is the right size
again.

Hope this description might jog some more peoples memories.

Note that you don't need to build in the source tree, so you don't need to
do any copying.  From the top of your cvs repository:

	rm -rf build
	cd build
	../configure [opts]
	make

#$^%$@! How could this come up again? Does it still work with 2.2?
If not, can you find out the last beta that worked?
Could any of the recent changes in events.c(HandleConfigureRequest) has
caused this?

  1999-03-05  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>
         * fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): use BroadcastRestack.

  1999-03-02  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>
          * fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): allow clients
          to resize themself if shaded, but not if maximized.

  1999-01-09  Bob Woodside  <proteus@pcnet.com>
          * fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): added resynchronization of
          * the stacking order ring when an app requests a change in its window's
          * place in the Great Chain of Being.

The second one seems to be a good candidate.

This illustrates my point, I think, of the danger of making ad-hoc
changes.

It is for ModulePath that I want elaborate control, for the same reason I
like to have elaborate control over PATH.  ImagePath just happens to
inherit this behaviour.

Well it definettly still worked in the 2.2 release, I unfortunatelly
don't have any old 2.3 executables lying around to test against.
Begining of March deffinetlly sounds like the right time frame for this
breakage.  It's possible that all three of those commits could have
cause a problem, since they all involved HandleConfiureReuest.  I'll try
throwing some prints in that function and see what I can come up with.

I agree with this last sentiment!

I'm sorry if I'm being really slow about this, but I honestly don't see
the problem we are trying to solve.  I never had fvwm create "lots of
files in my home directory".  In fact, I don't think it created any!  I
created & edited a .fvwmrc file myself. 

Of course, having a monolithic .fvwmrc file is a pain in the ass to
understand or maintain.  So splitting the config into small bits that are
read by the master file is a fine idea.  

However, we can do that already: witness the debian hook scheme.  [What
config scheme does RedHat use?] This is my main objection: as far as I can
see you are adding a feature that already exists, and hardcoding in C
things like the pathname to boot!

I guess I have to ask the question again: what problem are we trying to
solve that *cannot* be solved by existing mechanisms?

The one you want to install; i.e., the generated one.  

You probably also have to put the ".in" file into the EXTRA_DIST list, BUT
DON'T PUT THE GENERATED FILE in any _DIST.

I will specify. You seem to revert default colors of your browser to get
white foreground. Anyway it is best viewed with lynx. :)

We will start the discussion today. It will be outside fvwm-workers,
because fvwm-workers already has heavy traffic and I am not sure that all
volunteers are its subscribers. Contact me if you want to be included.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Changed my mind about this.  Anybody object to me hacking FvwmIdent?
It's a bit broken already (has OnTop instead of Layer) and it will
probably be assimilated by FvwmBorg####Form 8-)

I think I want to create a new module packet, something like M_NEW_LOOK
that has the following unsigned longs

header
  0xffffffff
  M_NEW_LOOK
  packet length
  timestamp
body
  Visual *visual (for the fvwm -visual future option, what about depth?)
  GC xorGC - used for rubber bands
  Colorset 0 (set by DefaultColors & DefaultFont)
    struct colorset_info {
      repaint_needed:1;
      pixmap:1;
      pixmap_width:12;
      pixmap_height:12;
    } info
    Pixel/Pixmap (depending on info.pixmap)
    GC foreground (with a color and font, usable with
XDrawString/Text/Line)
    GC relief
    GC shadow
  ColorSet 1 (set by HilightColor)
    struct background_type {pixmap:1; stretch_horiz:1; stretch_vert:1;}
    Pixel/Pixmap
    GC foreground
    GC relief
    GC shadow
  ColorSet N
    ....


The idea of the info struct is to give some flexibility for different
types of background rather than just a color.  If pixmap is True then
the next packet item is a Pixmap rather than Pixel.  If pixmap_width is
non zero the pixmap should be stretched horizontally from this size to
fit the window being drawn.  Ditto for pixmap_height.  After stretching
the background should be tiled with the result. This paves the way for
fvwm to have tiles, Hgradients, Vgradients  Dgradients and full size
pixmaps as backgrounds (4095x4095 should be big enough).

I'm not sure if a Font member should be included in each Colorset.  It
might be easier to get the font height etc. rather than query the font
struct from the foreground GC.

How many color sets should there be?

2 should be enough for classic fvwm.

I know CDE can have up to 8 color sets. (CDE doesn't have a foreground
color, it's either black or white, there is only one font and it has a
trough color which I think is bloat)

>From gtk.themes.org it looks like 5 (normal, prelight, active, selected
and insensitive) for the color definitions but then it goes off about
different widgets and it gets huge.

I couldn't figure out KDE.


I'm not going to rush this, I'll work on getting XorGC a bit more static
first, then colorset 0, then I'll have a crack at FvwmIdent with
colorset 0.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hmm...it assimilates one species and already its a Borg.

It would   be interesting for  FvwmForm to  become   very aware of the
characteristics of the  window  that   spawns  it, but  if   replacing
FvwmIdent was the ONLY benefit, I don't see much point.

I wasn't  the one that proposed  replacing some of our current modules
with a "super module" but it seems like a reasonable way to go.

I'm only joking.  Actually FvwmIdent could become a lot simpler if it
just created a form and started FvwmForm on it.  Can FvwmForm pop up
under the pointer?

Cheers,
Tim.

Right now you would have .fvwm2rc, .FvwmForm, and .FvwmAnimate,
if you used the features that create them.  It seems to me,
we might be creating a few more.

Are you proposing that fvwm2 adopt the Debian hook scheme?  I would if
I had access to it and  knew what it was.  I  sent mail to this list a
few weeks back  asking if  there was  a good  customization scheme  we
could  adopt, since I  don't  want to create   something if it already
exists.

I don't think I deserve the hardcoding rap.  I think you are referring
to the $HOME/.fvwm directory.  If I hard code it in the first checkin,
its all of 10 minutes work to create a command to change it.  Come to
think of it, I've aleady added a getenv for FVWM_USERHOME so I guess
I don't know what hardcoding you are referring to.

> I guess I have to ask the question again: what problem are we trying to

I'll have to ask you which feature you are referring to.

I'll try to guess:

FVWM_USERHOME  is needed since  FvwmAnimate, FvwmForm and FvwmDefaults
have to have  some way to  know where to  write the users config file.
Someone on  this  list said  3 fvwm  config  files in the  users  home
directory are 2 too many.

The new form FormFvwmDefaults automates the initial .fvwm2rc creation.

But to be more general, imagine you have a Win**** user who also has a
UNIX workstation on their desk.  This user doesn't know how to operate
any  editor, let  alone vi.  Suppose  you also  thought that this user
would benefit from using a more robust desktop environment.

Right  now  it can  warp  the pointer to its  position,  start up at a
specific position, or default to the center of the screen.  Popping up
under the pointer would seem like a useful feature.

I'm not making any large scale changes to FvwmForm right now.

Getting FvwmForm to create variables for things like window height
and geometry shouldn't be a problem...

OK, I'll do a rebuild.  BTW, my script ended up being the following:

#!/usr/local/bin/zsh
VERSION=snap-`/usr/local/bin/date +%Y%m%d`;
SNAPDIR=/home/ftp/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots;
cd ~/fvwm
/usr/local/bin/cvs update -dPA                   && \
/usr/local/bin/automake --add-missing            && \
/usr/local/bin/autoreconf                        && \
./configure                                      && \
 /usr/local/bin/make PERL=/usr/local/bin/perl5   && \
/usr/local/bin/make dist VERSION=$VERSION        && \
mv fvwm-$VERSION.tar.gz $SNAPDIR                 && \
cp -p ChangeLog NEWS $SNAPDIR

The build takes what seems like an eternity on this ancient box (Dual 50MHz
Sparc 10).  If someone tells me I need to stick a make clean or a rm
config.cache in there I'll go batty.

If I get independent verification that these snapshots are coming out OK,
I'll fix up the web page.

I don't remember: has the strokes library been added to the FVWM 2.3.x
track?  If not, is there intention to do so?

So you read it without generating an error if it's not found.  The
system.fvwm2rc file must be fully functional without it.

But what happens when Mr. Sys Admin decides to install a new or
modified version of FVWM with files in different places, or with new
options, or with different hardcoded defaults or....  This is why I
hold that the *basic* configuration should be global, in
system.fvwm2rc, with the users able to modify any bits that they wish
to without having to copy the system one and having to keep up with
any important changes.  See my next post with the Debian
system.fvwm2rc as an example.

Easy to undo, again, see my next posting.

Of course ;)

I'd be interested in this project -- please add me to the list.

I've inherited the Debian FVWM package, which contains a whole load of
icons which seem to have originated with the FVWM 95 project.  I want
to tidy them up for Debian and then provide a coherent tarball of the
up-to-date union of them both back to the two projects (FVWM and
FVMW95).  By the way, does anyone here know how the FVWM and FVWM 95
projects inter-relate, if at all?  I'd be interested in knowing this,
especially as FVWM 95 seems to be basically derived from FVWM 2.0.43.
I might try seeing how possible it would be for the two to be merged
to some extent; at least how easy it would be to just patch FVWM to
give the effects of FVWM 95 -- it seems ludicrous having two
essentially independent groups performing the same debugging tasks.

The following is a slightly curtailed and simplified version of the
current Debian system.fvwm2rc, with the boring bits removed.  My
comments for this forum are indicated by introducing them with ###.

===========================================================================

# For the benefit of emacs users: -*- shell-script -*-
# Configuration file for FVWM 2.xx originally by Lars Wirzenius
# modifications by Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>, copyright March 1999
#
#
# This file can be used both as the system.fvwmrc and the per-user ~/.fvwmrc.
# It uses certain `hooks' (files stored in /etc/X11/fvwm or ~/.fvwm) to allow
# the system administrator and user to modify menus, colors, and so on without
# having to change this file.
#
# The defaults that this file sets up follow my own taste.  They attempt to set
# up a nice, easy, comfortable environment for the "ordinary" user.  However,
# using the hooks, it should be possible to change anything.
#
# Please read /usr/doc/fvwm/README.sysrc.gz for more information.
#
# Hopefully, you will never have to modify this file.
#

#
# Section: pre.hook
#
# Use pre.hook for things that need to be done before anything else.
# For example, various paths (IconPath, PixmapPath, ModulePath) might
# be defined here.
#

### If FVWM is changed to automatically look in the ~/.fvwm directory
### for relative filenames, the second command here will be replaced
### by "Read pre.hook Quiet".  Easy, eh?

### Note also that for every hook, we provide both a system and
### personal hook.  This means, for example, that a sysadmin can have
### a form displayed on screen on startup or the like without having
### to edit the distributed system.fvwm2rc itself.

Read /etc/X11/fvwm/pre.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/pre.hook Quiet


#
# Section: Various global settings
#
# These settings are personal.
# If you need to modify them, do so in post.hook.
#

### post.hook is read after the rest of the file.  The following are
### "sensible" defaults (i.e., I like them!) which are easily modified
### by the user with no effort in their posthook.

#
# DeskTopSize sets the size of the desktop in units of physical screen
# `pages'.  I prefer to use a single desktop with multiple pages,
# but many people like having multiple desktops.  I thinks its confusing.
#

DeskTopSize 3x3

#
# I like to be able to move between pages or desks simply by moving
# the mouse against the screen border.  I find it very useful.  The
# following command enables this behaviour.  To disable it, the
# command EdgeScroll 0 0 could be placed in the post.hook.
#

EdgeScroll 100 100

#
# When moving a window against the edge of the screen, it is
# nice to have a small resistance before the window is moved outside
# the screen.  This makes it easier to line windows against the
# edges.  I have also added some resistance to scrolling at the edges
# of the screen
#

EdgeResistance 250 100


#
# Section: Styles, colors, fonts, and related things
#
# This section defines the looks, behavior, and other attributes of windows.
# These are also quite personal.  Modify them in post.hook.
#

#
# The following sets window colors.  This is highly personal,
# of course, and I (jdg) have changed it to something I like!!  Feel
# free to destroy my choices in your post.hook!!
#

# Put the defaults in a separate decor so decor users can ignore them
DestroyDecor default-decor
AddToDecor default-decor
+ HilightColor Black OrangeRed
+ WindowFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*

# We have five buttons in the default style: on the left, we have iconify
# and close; on the right: maximize horizontally, vertically and fully.

+ ButtonStyle Reset
+ ButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x75@1 25x25@1 75x25@1 50x75@0
[...]

### And if you don't like these, and you know what you are doing, the
### single ButtonStyle Reset command allows you to start again.

#
# The following sets the window decorations: the window title, borders,
# and the handles in the corners.
#

# make the default decor the default:
Style "default-style" UseDecor default-decor, Color Black/DarkOrange
Style "*" UseStyle default-style

[Various Style "*" commands elided, and also some Style "Fvwm*"
commands and other more specific ones.]

# Add icons to some common programs
Style "emacs"       Icon gnu-animal.xpm
[...]
Style "*"           Icon default.xbm

### And these are easily modifyable, too.

#
# Section: Init and restart functions
#
# This section defines the functions InitFunction and RestartFunction.
# InitFunction is executed automatically when fvwm first starts.
# RestartFunction is executed automatically when fvwm restarts itself.
# They share a common hook, init-restart.hook, and two specific hooks,
# init.hook and restart.hook.
#
# init-restart.hook should be used for starting fvwm modules, such as the
# button bar.  init-hook should be used to start other applications; they
# should not be started again, when fvwm is restarted, since they don't
# die like fvwm modules do.  restart.hook exists mostly for completeness;
# tell me if you find any use for it.
#
# InitFunction runs the script setup-background, which looks in
# ~/.fvwm to see if the user wants some specific background color or
# image.
#
# The init.hook, init-restart.hook and restart.hook files should
# contain continuation lines, eg:
#   + "I" Exec xterm
#


DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ "I" Exec setup-background

### All setup-background does is to set up the background using xv or
### xsetroot or similar, using an appropriate config file.

Read /etc/X11/fvwm/init.hook Quiet
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/init-restart.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/init.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/init-restart.hook Quiet

DestroyFunc RestartFunction
AddToFunc RestartFunction
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/restart.hook Quiet
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/init-restart.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/restart.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/init-restart.hook Quiet

### The defaults hook files are usually empty, except
### init-restart.hook starts a pager as explained below.  But if you
### are unhappy, you can always use DestroyFunc {Init,Restart}Function
### in the post.hook.

#
# Section: Menus
#
# This section defines a small menu structure.  The main menu contains
# some typical entries, and uses a hook (main-menu.hook) to allow the
# user to add new entries.  Most of the default entries are submenus,
# which are also defined here.
#

#
# MWM style menus are easier to use and better for Windows refugees.
#

MenuStyle * mwm, Foreground black, Background grey, Greyed white, \
  Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*

#
# Read in system and user menu definitions.
#

# Read system and user menu prefixes
# The title of the main menu will be provided by the menu-methods script
# which creates an AddToMenu /Debian "Main Menu" Title command in
# menudefs.hook.
#

### The /Debian menu is the main menu, with lots of programs listed in
### sensible categories.

AddToMenu /Debian
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/main-menu-pre.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/main-menu-pre.hook Quiet

### The main-menu-pre.hook will contain things to go before the main
### contents of the main menu.  (Bit obvious, really.)

### This next bit is interesting.  Debian uses an automatic menu
### generation system which works as follows: each package which wants
### to install an item in a menu places the details in a file
### /usr/lib/menu/<package>.  Each windows manager provides a
### configuration file /etc/menu-methods/<wm> which succinctly
### describes how to generate a menu entry from the given
### information.  Then whenever a package which provides a menu file
### or a windows manager is installed or removed, the menu system
### recreates all of the menus.  For example, the first entries of
### menudefs.hook on my system are:
### 
### AddToMenu "/Debian/Apps/Editors" "Editors" Title
### + "&Emacs 20%/usr/share/emacs/20.3/etc/emacs.xbm%" Exec /usr/bin/emacs20
### + "&Textedit" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/textedit
### + "&Xedit" Exec /usr/bin/X11/xedit
### + "&jed" Exec xterm  -T "jed" -e /usr/bin/jed

# Read the auto-generated menus
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/menudefs.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/menudefs.hook Quiet

### And after the system generated stuff:

# Add in user additions
Read /etc/X11/fvwm/main-menu.hook Quiet
Read .fvwm/main-menu.hook Quiet

### Of course, if you want your own menus, either ignore /Debian
### completely with your rebound keys/mouse buttons, or use the
### DestroyMenu function.

# Tack a quit entry on to the end; this version uses a submenu, but it
# is easy to use a pop-up window instead to ask the user to confirm,
# MWM-style, using FvwmForm.
AddToMenu /Debian
+ "Exit Fvwm"  Popup Quit-Verify

#
# The Window-Ops menu is for manipulating windows.  It is invoked either
# from the main menu, or directly from the root window.
#

DestroyMenu Window-Ops
AddToMenu Window-Ops
+ "Window Ops"               Title
+ [...]


#
# The Quit-Verify menu checks that the user really wants to exit.
#

DestroyMenu Quit-Verify
AddToMenu Quit-Verify
+ "Restart Fvwm"   Restart fvwm2
+ ""               Nop
+ "Really quit"    Quit


#
# Section: Mouse bindings
#
# This section defines the mouse bindings, that is, all the things that
# can be done with the mouse.
#

#
# Each button gives a different menu from the background (root window).
#

Mouse 1   R  A  Menu /Debian
Mouse 2   R  A  Menu Window-Ops
Mouse 3   R  A  WindowList

[Lots more mouse bindings elided]

#
# Section: Key bindings
#
# This section binds some actions to keys.  The bindings have been inspired
# by MWM, Windows, and nightmares.  Everything that these key bindings do,
# can be done without them.  Therefore they should not be too much of a
# burden on new users, but it definitely _can_ be confusing to press a
# key by accident and have it do something completely unexpected.
#

Key Tab   A    M    Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab   A    MS   Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
[...]


#
# Section: Functions
#
# This section defines various functions.  Not all of these are used by
# the default bindings, but they can be useful for a user who wants to
# customize things.
#
#
# The following functions operate on a window or menu.  The
# names are systematic: foo means "do foo"; foo-or-bar means
# "do foo, if mouse is moving, bar if click"; and foo-or-bar-or-baz
# adds "baz, if double-clicked".
#

DestroyFunc move-or-winmenu-or-deiconify
AddToFunc   move-or-winmenu-or-deiconify
+ "M" Move
+ "C" Popup Window-Ops
+ "D" Iconify

[lots more functions elided]

# Configure a FvwmButtons module for the modules menu, but make sure
# user can easily override it with their own - so name it DebianFvwmButtons.
# To use this config, you need to invoke it as:
#   "Module FvwmButtons DebianFvwmButtons"
#

*DebianFvwmButtons(Title emacs, Icon gnu-animal.xpm, Action 'Exec "Emacs" emacs &')
*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "FvwmPager")

### Note that DebianFvwmButtons must be invoked from one of the hooks
### or by using something like FvwmCommand; it is not invoked by
### default, but provided to make the user's life a little easier by
### providing a usable default.

#
# Configure the FvwmPager module
#

### ... which you are, of course, at liberty to modify.

# We start the pager in the InitFunction and RestartFunction, so that the

### that is, the default system init-restart.hook contains the line
### + "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0

# user has control over whether it starts or not.  We do this by placing
# it in the system init-restart.hook, so that either the administrator
# can remove it or infividual users can kill it or set it up differently
# by placing something like the following in their personal
# init-restart.hook:
#    + "I" Wait FvwmPager
#    + "I" KillModule FvwmPager
#    + "I" Module FvwmPager 0 3

### OK, this is not a one-line solution for the DIY enthusiast, but

# example, key bindings.
#

Read /etc/X11/fvwm/post.hook Quiet

==========================================================================

This is the model I have been using until now, and provides a very
nice balance of partial configurability and decent, usable defaults.

I know this one must have been addressed, but I can't seem to find the
solution in the archives.

How does one configure FVWM to move the focus (er, is "warp" the
proper term?) to the frontmost window when the frontmost window is a
child window of the currently active window.  For example, with
Netscape running, if I invoke the Find window, the focus doesn't move
to the find window, but instead stays with the main Netscape window.
I'd like it to automatically jump to any child windows of Netscape as
they pop up.

Also, if there is an easy solution, could it be added to a FAQ
somewhere?

Thanks,

Second question of the day...

I have what appears to be a bug or some sort of strange interaction
with FvwmAuto.  Here's what happens.

Let's say I'm running Netscape in a full-screen (but not maximized)
window, and I have several other full-screen Netscape windows
iconified.  Let's call the current full-screen window "A" and the
iconified ones "B", "C" and so on.  If I switch to the window list (I
have it bound as alt-tab :) and pick "C", C will animate itself up on
top, and then almost instantly pops down (lowers) to below "A".  If I
look at the window list, it shows "A" then "C" (as it appears on
screen) rather than the preferred and expected "C" then "A".

I also note that this doesn't always happen.  In fact, if "A" and "C"
were both non-iconified, the window list picking works as expected.  I
believe it almost always happens when "C" is iconified and brought to
the front via the window list.

One other thing.  When this happens, I see that the pointer jumps to
the upper left of the screen.  I have a feeling the problem is tied to
the FvwmAuto module, as in "if C pops up a few pixels to the right of
A but the cursor jumps to the upper left of the screen, the cursor
will be on A immediately after C is popped up, therefore A will
quickly be auto-raised."  Also, is the pointer supposed to jump to the
upper left corner when a window is popped up from the window list?

I'm open to suggestions as to the best way to pare down my .fvwm2rc to
reproduce this problem.  I can also patch in some code as need-be.

Thanks,
Lee

Hi,

  I noticed that if you minimize a window, and then drag it to another
screen, if you place the mouse pointer over the icon/window title, it
doesn't get highlighted/expanded.  Yet if you drag it back to its original
screen and place the mouse over it, the title gets highlighted/expanded.

  So it seems that placing the mouse over the icon will highlight the
window title if and only if the icon is on the same screen that it was
minimized on.  Is this the intended behavior?  My guess is no.  :)

  If this is just a misconfiguration on my part, feel free to lambaste me 
with insults, and/or pointers to what in my configuration may be causing
this behavior.

Thanks,
Jason

A small point of marginal relevance to this list is that XEmacs has a
window manager mode, winmgr-mode.  This is automatically invoked when
working on .fvwm2rc or similar name.  The initial line may cause
shell-script mode to be used instead.  That is probably the right
thing to do for Emacs, so feel free to ignore this comment if your
users use both Emacs and XEmacs.

These are two seperate problems.  The problem with X-servers on NT is
that NT windows are outside the X universe.  There is nothing that can
be done via X to manage them.  The only way to get an X window above
them is to do an XRaiseWindow which I think is incompatible with layers.

The other problem is with X windows that have override-redirect when
they really shouldn't.  I thought o-r was for menus only but it seems
like some programs have a ego problem and think they have a right to
force their behaviour on the user.

xmanage works nicely on Eterm.  I think it should go in utils but I'm
not sure if everyone has libXmu.  Coule it be rewritten to only use
Xlib?

Cheers,
Tim.

I really think the right place to discuss that is the fvwm-workers list.
Personally I would like to read a mail or two from time to time about
this, but I definitely won't subscribe to another mailing list. As long
as we are discussing about the fvwm distribution the workers list is the
right place to do it.

In my eyes it's not even necessary that the snapshot compiles.
I thought they are only a way to fetch the source code in its
present state. It will happen fairly often that the snapshots
won't compile.

True, but I wouldn't mind an automated message getting posted if it does
fail.

If everyone thinks fvwm-workers is the right place to do it, we can start
these threads here. Actually I didn't see any interest here on icon
topics. Also this will force potential artists who want to participate in
this project to subscribe to fvwm-workers. Remember, we try to make it a
wm-independend project.

Alternativelly, I can publish all messages on the web, so you can read
"mail or two" from time to time.
Any ideas are welcome.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I agree with Dominik.  The discussion should take place here until we
cause so much traffic that we get booted off ;-)

I think the immediate goal is to produce a package of icons for use with
fvwm.  This will interest fvwm-workers inasmuch as it affects the content
of the FVWM source tree.  Once there is general agreement about icon
packaging, the discussion will drift into topics less specific to fvwm,
and it'll make more sense to be on a separate list.

I'm attracted by what I know of the gtk model.  My idea is to install a
shell script that one can query to find the location of installed icons. 
At a minimum, one ought to be able to get a list of installed icon
directories. 

Of course, the location for icons must be selectable by the installer.
I propose a scenario such as:

	<download wm-icons-x.y.tar.gz>
	tar xzf wm-icons-x.y.tar.gz
	cd wm-icons-x.y
	make install prefix=/my/favourite/place

This would install icons into ${prefix}/share/wm-icons, and the query
script into ${prefix}/bin.  Prefix defaults to /usr/local.  

The icons would probably be classed into subdirectories under
${prefix}/share/wm-icons, maybe by size (14x14, 16x16, 10x40), or maybe by
a more vague notion like mini, std, side.  I suspect that one wouldn't get
very far if we decreed "mini icons are 14x14".  Somone is going to say
"well, my screen is so huge that I want 18x18 mini icons".  One way around
this is to install both into icons/14x14 and icons/18x18, and make a
symlink icons/mini to the appropriate one.

The query script (wm-icons-cfg?  what is the naming convention used by
gtk and gnome?) would be callable as "wm-icons-config --icon-path" which
returns the full path names of all installed icon directories.  A window
manager configure script would be able to use this to find out where the
icons live on the system.  In the specific case of fvwm, we could use this
info to generate a system.fvwmrc with the appropriate ImagePath.  Heck,
you could even arrange to run wm-icons-config at fvwm startup time to set
the ImagePath!

Comments welcome!

I think size is more useful (just an opinion, though).  Personally, I
tend to dump all my icons into a single directory.

Speaking of which, I have a rather large collection of icons that I've
created and collected over the last couple of years.  I imagine that
a lot of other people on this list have done so as well.  Is somebody
going to act as a repository for these, providing some common color
choices, etc. and cleaning up copyright/trademark issues?

Looks like the discussion just moved back to fvwm-workers.

Steve, it looks like you just made a proposal.  Ie. to classify icons
by directory name.  Currently fvwm2 classifies icons by file name.
At least some of the time.  (I am referring to the "side." and
"mini." convention.)

If you have enough sub-directories, there is a performance penalty
to be paid in all the searching unless you start referring to icons
as "14x14/mini.destroy.xpm" in the window manager config file.
I realize you probably wouldn't put both 14x14 and 16x16
in your imagePath.

It might  be helpful to  identify how  many  categories of icons there
could be.  These are a few I  can think of: "Desktop Icons", Textures,
Titlebar  buttons,   mini-icons, color  theme, 2D vs.   flat,
shaped vs. rectangular vs. square, color hungry, and size
variations (small, medium, large?).

The other item thats been proposed is size, Ie. 16x16 and 48x48.
I think the Motif default is 50x50, but rounding off to a multiple
of 8 sounds logical.  Isn't winblows using 16x16 and 32x32?

I believe you have indentified a bug.

Another interesting symptom is that if you move an icon to a different
screen, deiconify it, go back to the orginal screen that it deiconified to,
and iconify it again, the icon disappears until you change desks and
come back again.

I'll send all of this to our bug tracking system.

Hopefully not!  A goal of committing code is always that you're sure it
at least compiles, even if it doesn't work :)

Anyway, I agree that in one way it doesn't matter it compiles.  But on
some level, it must compile: the source tree (I think) should be
buildable by people who don't have the complete developer's suite
(that's why we're doing make dist after all!) so it has to compile far
enough to allow the dist to be built.

A naming scheme that produce 'ls' listings that are sorted by
icon size would be very nice. Perhaps some kind of prefix would
help (e.g. size classes A, B, C, D, E or whatever).

In theory, yes. But what are your plans to ensure this? I believe
most of us are very careful before committing, but sometimes it
just happens. The last time I checked in some conflict markers
I was relying on CVS to complain about this as I've seen before,
but not this time (why?).

I'm not saying it will never happen, but you said it will "happen fairly
often", which IMO is something altogether different: almost like it's an
expected occurrance.  I think it should be rare enough that it's always
a source of some amount of embarrassment :)

  dv> (why?).

CVS doesn't search your file for conflict markers (if it did, how would
you put some text that happened to match them in your file?)

What it _does_, I think, is check timestamps/filesizes/something.  If it
noted a conflict during the update and then you commit and it sees that
you haven't changed the file since the conflict, it complains.  Also
note that as long as you haven't changed the file, subsequent updates
still leave the file marked as "C" (conflict), but as soon as you do so
the status of the file reverts to "M" (modified) again, even if some or
all of the conflict markers are still there.

If you change the file, but don't remove all the markers, it won't care;
it just thinks those markers are part of the normal text of the file.

You shouldn't rely on this kind of thing for error detection: building
is the only surefire way to know.

Since recently when using FvwmCpp a '//' in the config file is
interpreted as a comment. This breaks existing config files and
in fact I spent about an hour debugging before I found out.
I would prefer to change this back to the old behaviour. If it is
so important it has to be at least documented prominently somewhere.

Hello,

Restarting Fvwm2 causes my viewport to move to the upper left hand corner
of
the desktop. Can Fvwm2 be customized so that this does not happen upon
restart or at
least so that Fvwm attempts to move your viewport back to its original spot
upon
restart?

Thanks.

I believe you have indentified a bug.

Another interesting symptom is that if you move an icon to a different
screen, deiconify it, go back to the orginal screen that it deiconified to,
and iconify it again, the icon disappears until you change desks and
come back again.

I'll send all of this to our bug tracking system.

Unfortunately it has been said that the 'make' step is required for the
dependency information to be correct.  Otherwise I'd just do 'make dist'
and leave it at that.

Perhaps my English is failing me again. With 'fairly often' I meant
that you know it will happen from time to time and you are not surprised
to see it, even if it happens three times in a row. Probably my fault
was to translate the German 'h"aufig' to 'often'. In German it can
mean either 'frequently' or denote a wide range of frequencies. This
phrase may convey what I wanted to say in a better way: 
'not very frequently but more often than rarely'.
I am willing to learn. How would you have expressed this?

Yes, that's exactly what I expected. What I don't expect is this.

1) check out the complete sources; some conflicts occur
2) commit your code without touching any sources or compiling;
   the commit works fine

Not really. We had that problem with dependencies already.

Anyway, there is not much you can do to prevent commits at
3 AM in the morning :) Perhaps we should install some kind
of test that checks your mental awareness when you ty to
commit something 8-)

Not at the moment. Perhaps we could save some states as X properties
before a Restart?

Hmm. But the dependencies are generated even if compiling fails.
Correct?

Dominik, 
This may also be related to my problem withnotr being able to

No; it's the compiler that generates the dependencies--this is why GCC
is required for development: it can generate both a .o and a .P file
containing dependency info at the same time.  If it weren't for that,
any old compiler would do.

Actually, Tom has plans for the next version(?) of automake to allow for
a variety of dependency generation schemes, so developers won't be tied
to GCC anymore (GNU make would still be required, of course).

Anyway... I suggest you (Jason) run the make with the -k option.  Then
it would continue to at least build all other the .o files, even if it
can't link something, which will give you the dependency info for all
files except the ones that don't compile.

That's probably good enough for a snapshot.

Hm.  Well, maybe commit doesn't care at all ?

I can't say I've either (a) tried this or (b) know enough about CVS to
say one way or t'other.

I do know about the update switching from "C" to "M", though :)

Hi,

  There is a particularly annoying 'feature' that I can't find how to
alter (and yes I looked at the manpage), with regard to de-iconifying
windows.

  Say I iconify a window on screen A, then drag the icon to screen B.
Now, if I deiconify the window, it opens up back on screen A!  I'd like to
be able to drag the icon to screen B, deiconify it, and have the window
open up on screen B.  Is there any way to accomplish this?

  It seems to work sanely in the opposite direction; that is, if you drag
a non-iconified window to any screen B and then iconify it, it iconifies
on screen B.  This seems to suggest that de-iconification should work
similarly.

Thanks,
Jason

No, it appears to be broken.  My guess is that this problem and
the previous problem you reported are all tied together.

You might try making the icon sticky, then switching to a new desk
then unsticking the icon.

I'm adding this to our bug tracking system also.

Thanks for taking the time to report the problem.

No, it appears to be broken.  My guess is that this problem and
the previous problem you reported are all tied together.

You might try making the icon sticky, then switching to a new desk
then unsticking the icon.

I'm adding this to our bug tracking system also.

Thanks for taking the time to report the problem.

  What do you want to document?

  The man page is clear that the actual parsing is done by an external
program.  Are you using /usr/lib/cpp, or gcc with some flag?  Is there
some flag you can pass to your pre-processor to stop it from accepting
C++ comments?

That the behaviour has changed compared to earlier versions of FvwmCpp.
If you'd ask me I'd simply change it back and document nothing.

This was directed to Steve. He did something to activate this. I didn't
bother to check what.

Iconifying xterms with is badly broken. First of all, when
you start an xterm with '+ai' (active icon), you don't get
an active icon at all. Second, if you move an iconified
xterm and then deiconify it the xterm is screwed up.
Although it is the right size it seems to think it is
still only the size of an icon, i.e. it draws only into
the first few dozen pixels in the top left edge.

Whoever will fix this (I guess it's Matthias' task), please
make sure that active icons work also: iconify an xterm and
move the icon around. With the old bug it would shrink to
the size of one character.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

First try at improving fvwm/Exceed relations. Make RaiseWindow
raise all windows without changing the stacking order (in addition

To try this, configure with --enable-exceed-hack (and fix the vendor id).

I got one. You just have to make sure there is no applicable
Style command with an Icon or NoIcon  option.

Well, I didn't break it, but I just committed a change that
fixed it for me. The culprit seems to be a piece of code
that was added as ETERM_SUPPRORT. It sends synthetic ConfigureNotify 
events during opaque moves, but unfortunately, it always sends them
to tmp_win->w, even if we're moving the icon!

Hello,

The WindowShade feature is not working on maximized windows.

Also, upon restart, WindowShade'd windows are unshaded, making

restarts a little cumbersome.

Dominik,

I haven't the faintest clue what you're on about.  I may well have broken
something, but I haven't touched FvwmCpp in recent memory.  Not since Jan
10, if the ChangeLog can be believed. 

So if you want to be helpful, please be more explicit about what the
problem is.

This message is large. But it is not me who wanted to discuss fvwm-icons
(or wm-icons) questions here. :)
My server is down until tommorow. Fortunately, I can read web-based mail
archives on fvwm.org (updated once a day...)

Lets leave other types of icons, like decorations and side images, for now
and first discuss application icons. I think the word 'icon' refers to an
iconified picture of an application. Probably we need to refer to other
types of icons as images or decorations sitting in different directory tree.

This is a good idea. We can have directory names based both on a size and on
a more common notion. For example, we can have directories 16x16/, 32x32/,
48x48, 64x64/ with mini/ symlinked to the actual directory, say 16x16/, and
std/ symlinked to 48x48/.

This all is very unusual (but nice!), because if we decide on this scheme we
don't subdivide all application icons on standard and mini, they are just
links to different sets which have exactly the same files. Now, if one
would want to add an icon, he must add it to every sized set, which has
own advantages (consistency and a wider user choice) and disadvantages
(difficult to create). Lets suppose we choose this scheme.

Configuration files will use forms mini/emacs.gif and std/emacs.xpm, and a
user can easily switch to another set without changing the configuration
(.fvwmrc) at all. Just resymlink. In this case, it is enough that ImagePath
points to a base directory, say, /usr/local/icons. To be more compatible
with the current icon scheme, where mini-icons sit in mini/ subdirectory of
standard icons, we can add to ImagePath also /usr/local/icons/std and then
refer to standard icons as emacs.xpm and to mini-icons as mini/emacs.xpm.

Here is, however, a practical problem here. Icons are not always resizable,
they only resizable if we have very qualitative original icons, this is not
our case, otherwise icons must be redrawn for each specific size. And we
must ensure that every sized set has all icons (emacs.xpm). I think we can
start with only two sizes (standard and mini) and then probably add others.
Or we can find artists to draw qualitative icons (Patrick? :) ).

So, must we recognize mini-icons just as a differnent set of icons without
any functional difference? It seems to be logical. KDE and GNOME behave
similarly. Although, GNOME creates mini-icons on the fly (by resizing down
standard icons .png) and KDE has a separate directory for mini icons,
created from standard icons (.xpm) by an automatical (or half-automatical)
process. the GNOME solution is currently not possible for most window
managers (which are not using imlib or the like). Am I wrong?

The only reason for creating 2 subdirectories 14x14/ and 16x16/ is that they
would contain exactly the same files. Otherwise one mini/ is more
preferable. You must have only one or none mini-icon directories in
ImagePath, not two.

And is not the previous scheme just more preferable? Not mini.emacs.xpm or
mini-emacs.xpm, but mini/emacs.xpm. This is also not the first scheme which
doesn't use the "mini." prefix in file names. Look at KDE, they have two
sets of icons: standard 32x32 and mini 16x16, while mini icons sit inside
mini/ and do not have any additional prefix.

I suggest having more levels here, like:
  icons/    (different sizes, including standard & mini)
    size1/    (the same set
    size2/     of files in each)
  decorations/
    buttons/
    ..

or:
  icons/
    appl/
      size1/
      size2/
    appl-color-reduced/
      size1/
      size2/
    decorations/
      ..
    textures/
      ..

Complex, isn't it? This is why I suggest first to discuss only application
icons.

I think it is just natural that every directory contains icons of the same
size. Every such directory has a full set of icons of the same size.
You can find all installed sizes by `ls -d $ICONS_BASE/[0-9]*x[0-9]*`
or yet better: wm-icons-config --size-sets.

Concerning icon names. I think icons must be all lower-cased with one point
in the name before .xpm extention with dash used as word seperator, say
fvwm-pager.xpm.

So, putting it all together, we can have:

/usr/local/icons/
  16x16/
  any-other-size/
  48x48/
  48x48-other-style/  (?)
  mini/ -> 16x16/
  std/  -> 48x48/

where /usr/local/icons is configured by *wm-icons makefile and returned
by wm-icons-config --base-dir or similar.

Here is one of the two possible variants for .fvwm2rc:

# ==== Variant 1 ====
ImagePath /usr/local/icons
Style "emacs*" Icon std/emacs.xpm, MiniIcon mini/emacs.xpm

# ==== Variant 2 ====
ImagePath /usr/local/icons/std:/usr/local/icons
Style "emacs*" Icon emacs.xpm, MiniIcon mini/emacs.xpm

First variant is more consistent, but second is more compatible with the
way it is now. I am not sure which is better. One can use any.

Please upload any original icons you have tar-gzipped to
  ftp://milonka.ml.org/incoming/fvwm-icons/    (starting tomorrow)

If we choose to have sets of icons that differ by the size, we must decide
on the full list of icons in every such set (emacs, netscape, games,
fvwm-modules..) and create all these with different sizes. I am not sure yet
if this is practically possible, but it seems to be nice.

Mikhael.

Yes it would be possible, but source code changes would be required.

The problem is that only the "NoIcon" modules (FvwmIconMan, etc.)
know where the other end of the animation is.  Until those
modules are changed, FvwmAnimate only has 1/2 the information it
would need.

Until we come up with a motivated developer that likes animation
and wants to use one of the "NoIcon" modules, and has the time,
this project is pending.

This has been mentioned before, but just so we don't loose track
of this issue, I've added this request to the fvwm2 bug tracking
database.

Oh, how embarassing, I've seen some commit message from CVS the day
after I found out what happened (I didn't read my mail that day) and
just saw 'removed' and '//' in the message and instantly assumed you
had changed something there:

  Mon Mar  8 17:21:09 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@lear.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

          * FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c:
          (RedrawWindow): removed C++-style // comments.

I'm really sorry. On the other hand that raises the question how this
has changed. I don't think it's somewhere in the code but more likely
has something to do with the way FvwmCpp is built (?)

Sorry Matthias, I deleted your reply to my mail, hence
the new thread.

Your patch fixed iconify/move/deiconify in general, but
active icons are still broken. I cant get an active icon
at all with the current code.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Ok.. pretty straight-forward and easy to reproduce..
Start a single-window session (just one xterm, no more, no less).
fvwm2 -f the_file_from_below
And then move the xterm named 'Move_me' down across the page border, the
xterm you
started fvwm2 from will follow (but not 'Ignore_me'). Move it back and move
the
fvwm2-start-xterm window instead, 'Move_me' will follow ('Ignore_me'
won't.)
(The titles are just cosmetic, won't affect anything)

Seems like some linked-list problems somewhere..
(Can't try with current cvs because Dom forgot to commit a file..)

I agree that it is important to support those people (such as myself)
who use 640x480 monitors.  But what about those who use 1200x1024 or
even higher resolution?  For them, a 16x16 icon is probably almost
invisible.  So what about having three sizes of icons: 16x16 (mini),
48x48 (medium) and 64x64 (big)?  That would solve both ends of the
problem.

Boy, this is *slow*! Each ignored modifier doubles the number of XGrabKey
and XGrabButton calls. With 4+ modifiers this can take ages to complete.

Configure is involved to the extent that it figures out which
"cpp" parser FVWM_CPP points to.
It looks thru "$PATH:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/ccs/lib"
(in that order) for a "cpp" program.
You can look in "config.status" to find the cpp
that you are using.

Do ./configure --help to find out how to override configures
choice, it looks to me like you can just export FVWM_CPP.

FvwmCpp just invokes the preprocessor found by configure.

We have decided to support different icon sizes by providing full 
one-sized sets. It is not clear yet, though, will this be an automatical
process or redrawing of the entire set to support additional size.
However, because of a large amount of work, the first release may contain
only two one-sized sets (or more).

I removed a C++-style "//" comment from the C code file FvwmTaskBar.c.  I
guess gcc accepts this sort of thing, but not all C compilers do.  This I
discovered when compiling with SGI's /bin/cc. 

But surely this has nothing to do with FvwmCpp breaking!

Can you give us more details about what is happening?  Maybe it will jog
some memories.  You say that you "found out what happened".  What do you
mean by that?  What exactly did you find out?

I can't follow you. When should this have worked? I've checked 2.3.x,
2.2, 2.1.4 and 2.0.46 and they all show the same behaviour. Neither the
code in fvwm2 nor the code in FvwmPager.c has changed as far as this
behaviour is concerned.

Fixed.

I found out that I can't use `sed -e "s/foo//g"` anymore in my
config file anymore since FvwmCpp causes everything behind the
'//' to be removed before the file is passed to fvwm2. This did
work with 2.2.

When I run fvwm2 and then try to start it again from a
rxvt, my running fvwm2 is killed. No error message, no
coredump.

--- 15 minutes later ---

Both wm's are closed as soon as the XSetSelectionOwner
call in icccm2.c, line 82 is flushed.

--- 20 minutes later ---

This happend because the new fvwm2 tries to take over
wm functionality from the old one (as defined in icccm2).
Unfortunately the X server doesn't like this since the
original fvwm2 is the last client started in my .xinitrc
file. As soon as it exits the X server dies.

There *must* be a better way to implement this. It's
unacceptable that all your applications are killed
because of a typo (you do save often, do you?).
Matthias, any ideas?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

The right bugfix. I've seen similar reports a few times, but always
with uncommon applications that none of the developers have handy.
Would you be willing to help debugging this? A good place to start
looking would be HandleConfigureRequest() in events.c or SetupFrame()
(borders.c I believe). It would be helpful to know exactly what
requests are received and what parameters are set in SetupFrame.
I think there is some debug code that can be activated by compiling
with DEBUG or DBUG set.

Dominik,

one way to get an active icon xterm should be:

fvwm2 -cmd 'Style xterm StartIconic' & xterm +ai

Works for me.

Did anybody ever notice that doubleclicking on an icon to
maximize is does not always work? About one time out of five
I get my root menu instead. The setting that might be related
to this are:

  ClickTime 250
  Style * SloppyFocus
  GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises
  Mouse 1 I A Function "MenuOrIconify"
  AddToFunc MenuOrIconify
   + "Click"       Popup WindowMenu
   + "Motion"      Raise
   + "Motion"      Move
   + "DoubleClick" Iconify

This is nothing new, I see it for several months now. I'm not
even sure it ever worked as it should.

Hmm. This line in my config file overrides the active icon:

  Style  "xterm"      Icon Terminal.xpm

If I remove it I get the active icon again. THis was not the case
with 2.2.

Thought as much. I've investigated this a bit further and now
I can't make '//' work the way it used to with 2.2 or even 2.0.46.
I tried to convince the preprocessor to ignore '//' with the
-lang-c option that explicitly describes this in the manpage but
it still comments the '//'. In my config.cache i found two lines:

  ac_cv_path_FVWM_CPP=${ac_cv_path_FVWM_CPP=/usr/bin/cpp}
  ac_cv_prog_CPP=${ac_cv_prog_CPP='gcc -E'}

/usr/bin/cpp is a link to /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.1/cpp

Anyway, I don't think that matters since I used
'-Cppprog /usr/bin/cpp' in my .xinitrc file.  The only way I could
find to get the behaviour I'm used to is to put this line in my
.xinitrc:

  exec /home/avatar/bin/fvwm2/fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp -Cppprog
  '/usr/bin/gcc -ansi -E -' $HOME/.fvwm2rc"

Or better: replace the -ansi with -C.

My problem is not that I can't get the active icon (see
previous posting) but that it's broken. I don't use
active icons.

Bad. Perhaps I never noticed this problem since the last
program ran in my .xsession file is xsm.

Run a session manager ?! Or put a dummy program after the wm,
like an extra xterm ? Seriously, I'll reread the ICCCM on this.

What exactly is broken with them ? I don't use active
icons for xterms either, so I don't know how they should
look like.

I would suggest that, as a policy, we decide upon the sizes to be
supported, and create one icon of each size which says "TODO", called
todo.xpm.  Then any missing icons at a given size can be softlinked to
todo.xpm of the correct size.

In this way, the necessary resizing work becomes absolutely explicit,
we have somewhere to put all of our currently usable icons, and we can
lay to rest the question of sizes before the first release.

A thought: do we wish to use names or rgb values for the colours,
given a choice?  My personal feeling is that names would lead to
greater consistency.

Log message:
* removed the special rules for fvwm/{builtins,fvwm,read}.c
- auto dependency tracking should now work for them

* removed some useless chmods in makefiles

* ImagePath and ModulePath are both implemented the same way: the new
path overwrites the old (rather than prepending) but there is a '+'
expansion to allow appending and prepending, as desired.

* Obsolete IconPath and PixmapPath will now prepend to imagepath,
hence they will now "add together" in a manner similar to the
behaviour before ImagePath came into being.

Agreed.

I am still not sure what is the right way. Having emacs.xpm in several
variants (for different sizes) or a single qualatative large emacs.xpm and
doing resizing and/or color optimizations at the instalation time.
First way insures, at least, that current icons can be reused and every
icon is created manually (which is better than automatization). But it is
hard, if not impossible, for extension, if a user wants non-standard
sizes, which is trivial for the second variant.

Mikhael.

This depends on whether you want to look at your .xpm file as
  * a binary file, which must be open with graphics viewer only,
  * a configuration file to edit,
  * a C-file to #include :-)

I don't think it is very important. You can create a script, which
replaces rgb's by closest matched color name if you find it useful.

Mikhael.

Argh, these parallel mail threads are driving me nuts :)
I can't get an active icon as long as I explicitly define
an 'Icon' style for xterms:

  Style xterm Icon foo.xpm

==> no active icon

Without this line I get the active icon. This is not how
is should work. Defining a default icon must not prevent
applications from providing their own pixmap (this is not
the same as providing their own icons). This is different
from how 2.2 worked.

Bye

Hi,

I did some code cleanup in a seemingly-neverending quest to make 'gcc
-Wall' a viable option.  Right now -Wall generates too many warnings to be
useful. 

I have the libs/ and fvwm/ directories down to only two warnings (using
linux).  I think the final two warnings are real errors in that the
variables in question CAN be used without initialization in some cases. 
But the functions are too convoluted for me to follow.  If someone who
understands this has some time, would you please look into fixing these:

../../libs/Bindings.c: In function `ParseBinding':
../../libs/Bindings.c:245: warning: `keysym' might be used uninitialized in this function

../../fvwm/builtins.c: In function `WindowShade':
../../fvwm/builtins.c:456: warning: `new_width' might be used uninitialized in this function

I don't think so, but I'll check that. It's more likely that
the problem has the same roots as the one that causes root menus
not being able to cope with doubleclicks always.

This is not an error. Although keysym is passed uninitialised to another
function it is never used there since type == MOUSE_BINDING. Feel free
to initialise keysym with some value. Doesn't matter.

Seems to be a bug. I don't know how it's right though.

Possibly. I tried to change the GrabFocus/GrabFocusOff default. Do you
use one of these? If yes, before or after the SloppyFocus style is set?
If not, could you try GrabFocusOff explicitly in all lines with SloppyFocus?

After looking a bit closer I guess in line 555 new_width has to be
replaced with tmp_win->frame_width:

554  XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent,
555                tmp_win->frame_width - 2 * thmp_win->boundary_width,
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
556                max(h - 2 * tmp_win->boundary_width
557                - tmp_win->title_height, 1));

Nope.

This didn't help.  There was only one line (quoted above) that had
SloppyFocus on it.


But my fvwmrc didn't have a wildcard focus style command; so I tried
adding one: 

	Style "*" SloppyFocus, GrabFocusOff

and that appears to work.

Uh, yes, I assumed 'ClickToFocus' was the default style and put
a corresponding command into fvwm.c. If that's incorrect, what
used to be the default focus style?

OK, we can focus on application icons for the moment.  But I think
eventually the other things like backgrounds and gradients will be in the
same package.  So it is likely we want them in the *same* directory tree,
say ${datadir}/wm-images, with subdirectories icons, backgrounds, etc.

Yes, in principle.  Although requiring that an icon exist at all sizes may
be a heavy burden as you point out:

This sounds reasonable to me.  We seem to already have some "standard" 
sized and "mini" sized icons.  Could we build the first wm-icons package
around these?

I'm glad that someone is checking out what approaches already exist.  I'd
like this to end up being WM-agnostic, so we should be careful to not be
incompatible with others.

I wouldn't want the package to require automatic resizing, but to take
advantage of it if possible.

Yes, that is a good point.  I like Mikhael's suggestion that we do just
that: refer to icons as "mini/destroy.xpm".  That's pretty close to the
current practice of "mini.destroy.xpm" and shouldn't add too many
directories to the ImagePath.

I like this approach, myself.

The hierarchy will end up with more than just icons, so how about
/usr/local/images, with subdirectories icons, backgrounds, etc?

The man page says the default was MouseFocus; see the Style entry.

Use another separator character, e.g. `sed -e "s?foo??g"`.

This sort of problem was bound to come up sooner or later as more C
preprocessors start to grok C++ or C9X.

Yes, I'm already doing that, but that's not the problem. I'm
not discussiong this because my config isn't running anymore
but because it's difficult to find and can give users a hard
(and unhappy) time debugging.

The funny thing is that my preprocessor hasn't changed in about
a year.  I wonder how you will compile old code with new preprocessors
if they don't allow you to switch back to the old behaviour.

Sorry. I compile all the time.  I think it must be that I keep edit
windows open when compiling/testing but close them before a commit just
in case a conflict or merge happens.  My editor does an auto-save when I
close it so there's a chance I stuffed up, didn't save, compiled, saved
and then commited.

CHeers,

We should all. After the tremendous amount of work we did in the last
half year we should ask Jason to shut down the servers for a month
and slow down for a while.

I think "every once in a while" is correct here in the States too,
but the part of about making sense isn't applicable.  Since when
does English (or American) make sense?

This is also what I suggested. "Different directory tree" ment outside the
icons/ directory. I think wm-icons distribution can be responsible for
icons/, wm-backgrounds for backgrounds/ etc.

When I wrote this, I thought about icons, backgrounds, decorations inside
/usr/local, but it is configurable. Non-icon images can be included into
wm-icons (wm-images?) only if there are entuthiasts to standardize this
issue.

We must create a list of icon names for the common set. I will put my own
list on http://milonka.ml.org/fvwm-icons/ soon, when I'll have free time.
Suggesions are welcome.

This also opens another question. A new standardized icon list, which we
together will hopefully create, will break the existing .fvwm2rc in the
sense that some icons (and at least all mini-icons) will not be accessible
without editing the .rc. Must we still ship the supporting package
fvwm-icons-2.2 for those who want compatibility?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Here's the patch for GNOME window manager hint support for the CVS head
version of fvwm.  I noticed the session managment is working much better
these days; I'm going to try layers next.

GNOME hints are enabled by the --enable-gnome flag to the configure
script, and are off by default.  Everything is #ifdef'ed in a similar
fashion to session managment.

This patch also adds the function GNOMEButton which can be set on mouse
clicks.  This is for proxying root-window button clicks.

I'll try to get a nice sample gnome.fvwm2rc file to sumbit; perhaps using
the gtkmenu module.

This may be related to the bug report I submitted on February 16th
(#176) that is still in the "Incoming" folder. Since bug #176 is
reproducible via a Java applet, anybody should be able to reproduce
it, although I've only verified it under Solaris.

Here it is for easy reference:

Datek's "Streamer" does not resize under FVWM2

Go to http://www.datek.com/streamer (with Java enabled in Netscape)
and wait for the "Streamer" java app to appear. Sometimes it takes a
few tries if their servers are busy.

Enter anything for a user name and hit "Ok" (it doesn't actually check
username/password until you try to add a stock symbol). Now click the
"Settings" button, and then the "Resize" button. Click the "Make bigger"
button and notice that the Streamer window does NOT grow; the contents get
bigger but NOT the window itself. Click "Make bigger" again and see the
same thing again. Also notice that the windows shifts up and to the left.

This happens under both 2.0.46 and 2.1.12. *It works fine under vtwm.*

This merely demonstrates the problem; it makes the Streamer applet fairly
useless in everyday use because you can't display more than two quotes
since that is all that fit in the default window size.

Just a suggestion that it may be related,
Eddy

Subject: configure assumes LD_LIBRARY_PATH for nonstandard libXpm location

Full_Name: Kai Grossjohann
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: SPARC Solaris 2.5
X_Server: OpenWindows 3.5
Submission from: (NULL) (129.217.20.113)


On my system, libXpm resides in a strange location.  It was not sufficient
to
give the right arguments for --with-xpm-library and --with-xpm-includes, I
also
had to add the library directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, like so (continuation
lines for easier readability):

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/app/unido-inf/sun4_55/libxpm/3.4h/lib \
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw/fvwm-2.2 --enable-extras --with-x \
	--with-xpm-library=/app/unido-inf/sun4_55/libxpm/3.4h/lib \
	--with-xpm-includes=/app/unido-inf/sun4_55/libxpm/3.4h/include \
	--with-readline-library=/app/unido-i06/share/devel/readline/2.1/sun4-solaris/lib
\
	--with-readline-includes=/app/unido-i06/share/devel/readline/2.1/sun4-solaris/include

I think it ought to be sufficient to give the right argument for
--with-xpm-library.

Thanks for restating your instructions, the last time around I tried
it, and couldn't produce the window.

Anyway, I tried and got this:

fork> xwininfo -size

xwininfo: Please select the window about which you
          would like information by clicking the
          mouse in that window.

xwininfo: Window id: 0x38074d9 (has no name)

  Normal window size hints:
      Program supplied location: 5, 3
      Program supplied size: 909 by 130
      Program supplied minimum size: 609 by 108
      Program supplied maximum size: 609 by 108
                                     ^^^    ^^^
      Program supplied window gravity: NorthWestGravity
  No zoom window size hints defined


As you can see, "Streamer" has set the window manager hints
for a minimum and maximum size of its window.  Fvwm2 being
a ICCCM complaint window manager is just doing what its told
to do.

I'd be interested to know if Barry Warsaw's application
does the same thing.  (I've copied him.)

I don't know if we should add the ability to ignore these hints,
or see if these applications can be fixed.  If Barry wanted to
hack out a solution just to get away from CDE, he should look
in fvwm/add_window.c for max_width and max_height and set
them to some other value.  (I haven't tested anything yet.)

I don't know whether Netscape's AWT code is based on Sun's implementation,
but if it is, god only knows what nasty interactions are going on with the
WM.  There are so many dtwm-specific hacks in AWT it ain't funny, and the
interesting interactions with Java apps just don't stop.

I've tried tracking some of these down in the AWT code, but aside from some
obvious (and commented) hacks, I haven't been able to find anything
particularly wrong (to my Motif-untrained eye).

I don't suppose by any chance Codewarrior is written in Java, is it?  :)

Jay, nice to see the gnome support appear...

Not that it changed its name to FvwmGtk (and is in CVS now) and it
also does dialogs these days.

The subject line says it all.  These are the hints shown

There was some discussion about the behaviour of icons wrt
deiconification and focus recently. I have spent some time
tonight to investigate the issues and I'm not sure there is 
any bug to fix; maybe we just need a more thorough explanation
of icon behaviour in the man page...

Here is what i found:

If you iconify a nonsticky app, the icon will deiconify to the
old location (which may well be on another page if the icon is moved)

An icon takes the focus only if it represents a window on the current 
page - ie after moving the icon across a page boundary it will become
unfocusable.

Icons of sticky apps or icons with stickyicon style will deiconify to
the current page and thus they are focusable on all pages.

Okay, thanks for the hints, I'll try to turn on the debugging

I don't think this is what's happening for me.  Attached is some
output of xwininfo (I included a bit more than just -size).  Nothing
jumps out at me, so hopefully you'll see something I'm missing!

It's even worse than this, before the app tries to resize to Program
supplied size is 1 by 1 so we can't do a quick fix by letting PSS
override the min and max sizes.

It should not be too difficult to produce a sed based script to rename 
the icon files in the .rc.  Here's a quick bash at one.

sed -e 's?mini[-.]\([a-zA-Z0-9_.]*\.xpm\)?mini/\1?g' \
    -e 's?\([^/a-zA-Z0-9_.]\)\([a-zA-Z0-9_.]*\.xpm\)?\1std/\2?g' \
    .fvwm2rc > .fvwm2rc.new

Some flavours of sed may prefer parentheses without backslashes.

In any case, there are to be changes with PixmapPath and IconPath
being replaced.

But you wouldn't want the program supplied size to override
the minimum and maximum.  You'd want something like:

Style "Streamer" IgnoreSizeHints

then   the   minimum  would   be   zero  and  the  maximum   would  be
MAX_WINDOW_WIDTH and MAX_WINDOW_HEIGHT.  But the application is
broken, putting junk into fvwm2 to fix it should be a last resort.

Here's the section of code that tries to pick a better visual

  /* grab a TrueColor visual */
  if (XMatchVisualInfo(dpy, Scr.screen, DefaultDepth(dpy, Scr.screen),
                       TrueColor, &vizinfo)) {
    Scr.viz = vizinfo.visual;
    Scr.depth = vizinfo.depth;
  }
  else
  {
    Scr.viz = DefaultVisual(dpy, Scr.screen);
    Scr.depth = DefaultDepth(dpy, Scr.screen);
  }

This works fine but the following call gives a BadMatch error

  attributes.event_mask = KeyPressMask|FocusChangeMask;
  attributes.override_redirect = True;
  Scr.NoFocusWin=XCreateWindow(dpy, Scr.Root, -10, -10, 10, 10, 0,
Scr.depth,
                               InputOutput, Scr.viz,
                               CWEventMask | CWOverrideRedirect,
&attributes);

Can anyone shed any light on this?

Cheers,
Tim.

Good idea.
The script above supposes that the user uses only icons from the fvwm
distribution. Also, icon naming will probably be changed.
Actually, I prefer something like this:

perl -e '$_ = join("", <STDIN>); \
  s!OLD_MINI_ICON_NAME!mini/NEW_CLOSEST_MINI_ICON_NAME!s; \
  ... \
  s!OLD_STD_ICON_NAME!std/NEW_CLOSEST_STD_ICON_NAME!s; \
  ... \
  # changes to (IMAGE|PIXMAP|ICON)PATH
  print $_;
' < .fvwm2rc > .fvwm2rc.new

Also, the old directories icons and icons/mini in (IMAGE|PIXMAP|ICON)PATH
must be deleted and replaced with one new icon base directory.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm trying to install the sources on a new machine. I downloaded
and installed the newest auotoconf and automake. The I did

  # automake --add-missing
  # autoconf
  # ./configure
 
but get an error:

  ./configure: line 530: syntax error near unexpected token 'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(fvwm,'
  ./configure: line 530: 'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(fvwm, 2.3.0'

Any ideas?

Ugh, could you please back out my hotkey patch? I've got a few pending
problems with it, including a coredump... Only discovered them after
submitting the patch and was quietly hoping they'd disappeared into
the ether... Alas.

I just tried with the gnome-hints, both smart window placement and
"funky maximize" sees the panel and avoids it as any other window.
FvwmPager sees it too..

There seems to be some issues when you fiddle some when both fvwm and
gnome pagers are running..

Does "works for me" mean "the string is correct" or "the EXCEED_HACK works" ?

I *do* see the described behaviour/bug. Perhaps "follows" is not
a very exact description; when moving "Move_me" across a page
boundary, the original xterm behaves as if it was sticky.

I have fixed one typo in MoveViewport now, improving the situation
somewhat. But there is still a problem with window_being_moved:
Try the following: move a large window (large enough to exceed 
OpaqueMoveSize) to a new page (ie watch the window stay where it
was and the rubberband move to the new page) without releasing the
button. Now move it back to the original page, still holding the button.
The window being moved has disappeared! It wont appear again until
you release the button.

With Tomas setup, I get a different problem: During moves, the
windows behave as if they were sticky: If I move the rubberband
to a new page, the window appears in its original position on the new page
and canceling the action with esc leaves the window on the new page.
I have no idea why this happens in Tomas minimal setup.

Well, docs/DEVELOPERS has this to say.  Perhaps it is important.

After the *initial* checkout of the sources, (see cvs.html) you will
need to execute the following commands from the top of the source
tree.

    automake --add-missing
    autoreconf

There will be some warnings, which are ignorable as long as you get a
working configure script: the configure script will fix all those
problems.

Is there something wrong with this?
I don't see how there possibly could be:
The waterbed's on fire, 
but everything else is as it should be.

Hi,

I ran gcc -Wall on libs/ and fvwm/ again, and found some new warnings.  I
think the first was a typo where

	if ( x = 1 )
was supposed to be
	if ( x == 1 )

The second also seems like a bug, and I'm hoping one who understands the
code has a look.  Thanks. 

../../fvwm/menus.c: In function `menuShortcuts':
../../fvwm/menus.c:466: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value
../../fvwm/menus.c:414: warning: `newItem' might be used uninitialized in this function

If you look closer at my mail you'll see that I have done this.

Why? If there are problems we'll fix them. What do you think is
broken?

No, the greyed items are never drawn in any other colour. Did you
fix this already or do you use some peculiar hilighting options?
What are your hilighting styles?

Now that Gnome support has been committed, how should we
handle the GSFR in CVS? Should we branch and do the work
off the main branch? Or is it better to do it there and
break the sources for several days (i.e. won't compile
for a while)?

I vote for doing it on the main branch since it is already
enough work without keeping up to date to the current
sources. And perhaps more people participate in the effort
when the new framework is ready.

Comments?

-----

Paul (PDS), would you write the macro prototypes to access
the style flags as you wanted them? I think it's best to
put all this in a new header file, perhaps styleflags.h?
(I want to move away from the one-header-for-everything
approach anyway). I volunteer to do all the renaming and
moving of the flags. When the new 'API' is ready we can
begin rewriting the code.

I don't have gnome and so I don't bother to compile this option.
If there are problems other than with gnome.c I need your input.
I'll add gnome.c. If that's not enough, tell me.

With current CVS source (30-Mar-1999), fvwm fails
to start up properly if .fvwm2rc contains a 'Module'
command. I tried this with FvwmWinList, FvwmTaskBar
and FvwmButtons. With WinList no windows
were mapped at all but some of my bindings worked
(no menus but page flipping with function keys as
well as the transient pager on mb2). With the
Taskbar only the taskbar window appeared. Is that
related to the new startup logic (Tim, Dan)?

Not quite; your mail says you ran "autoconf"; the instructions say to
run "autoreconf".
         ^^

The latter does lots of extra stuff.  I'm not saying it will definitely
solve the problem, but it's a good first step...

I'm currently trying to track down two problems I know of with my
changes:

1)  PopUp a menu; move the mouse out of the menu area; hit a shortcut
key -- you should dump core just as menuShortcuts() enters the block
of code I added.

2) I get inconsistent (and wrong) behavior if there are *exactly* two
instances of a shortcut key, and one of them falls at either end of
the menu... This may actually generalize to problems with two menu
items duplicating, which sounds an awful lot like an "off-by-one", but
if it is, I haven't yet figured it out... It's driving me nuts,
actually. An example of a menu that should demonstrate the problem
might be:

"&A"
"&B"
"&A2"
"&C"

Well, no; you said you did "autoconf".  The docs say to do "autoreconf".
Yes, it is a subtle distinction.  Too subtle?

Yes, too subtle. I'd never noticed. It worked last time becuase I
copied it with the mouse. This time I had no working mouse :(

Coredumps are easy to fix. I'll look at this at home.

The menu code always gets inconsistent when you touch it. In its
current state its nearly impossible to do something without
breaking something else. It's rather touchy.

There is something very wrong with the functions.c that you just
commited (the Repeat patch).  It core dumps on me, I don't have a
working gdb so I can't tell you what's wrong.

When does it coredump? Before anything is started? After the config
file has been parsed? Any error messages about commands not found?

It's after the config, winodows get decorated but none of the
initfunction modules appear before the crash.

Well, I thought both but on checking found I hadn't got a #define
EXCEED_HACK anywhere even though I ran configure --enable-exceed-hack
(after deleting config.cache).  I put it in config.h and, yes, the
string works but, no, the code doesn't.  I've committed what I believe
is way to get it working.  It will cause more redraws than necessary if
you raise a window and there are windows in layers above it that overlap
but it is the only way I could get Exceed to really raise the window. 
Exceed gets in a mess when XRestackWindows is used.

The code used to do a raise of the top most window (probably a pan
frame) followed by a restack, now it gets the stacking order from the
server and works it's way from the window being raised to the top,
raising each one in turn. It does cause excess redraws on its way to the
top but it does get X windows and NT windows stacked right when it has
finished.

I don't know what you want to do with the #define.  I'd vote for putting
this in always and not having a configure option.  If you're not and
Exceed user it will have no effect.  If you are and you have configured
Exceed to not need it (going full screen) you can always change the
vendor string.

Cheers,
Tim.

Sounds like it, the new startup logic made it necessary for
me to move FvwmAnimate into the InitFunction instead of just
starting it.

I see no problem if we can't compile for a while.

	Is it possible to build (right now) a fully functional FVWM with
Gnome support?  (are there any other major bugs in the current snapshot)
I ask because I know some people using gnome apps are itching to get off
of Enlightenment.  

If so, can we leave the last snapshot that works (with Gnome) somewhere
people can get it?  

Jay

No, not immediately. There are some pretty serious bugs in CVS right
now.

I know that people are itching to do the GSFR, but maybe the Gnome stuff
is a good reason to call a feature freeze and work towards a beta release?

Can you mail me a config file that shows the problem? When I'm home
the first thing I'll do is fix this (well, after feeding and stroking
my remaining cats ^_^).

Well, I didn't mean to let that change to functions.c slip through,
but it did let me use the current CVS sources.

Dominik, when you go to fix the Purify problem in functions.c
around line 220, you will see that I commented out the "free".
I don't think this is the right fix, but at least I was able to
start fvwm2.

Just as well I suppose.

Just looking thru awol's fvwm2 pages and on this page:

http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/~flc/fvwm/frames.html

I notice a collection of mini icons that are in circles.

So far the the proposed naming scheme would not identify
mini-icons in circles.  (Or any other image design "theme".)

Of course I may have missed something...

With the current CVS, some root keybindings don't work until I pull
up a menu with a mouse.

Some of my menu keybindings don't work, for example, the first hotkey
in a sub-menu.

Yes, this was my first idea for implementing it, since I already had
the feeling that XRestackWindows may be too clever for the troublesome
X server.

Yes, if it works now, the #define can probably go away. I just put
it in since I had no way of really testing the code.

Probably fixed now (at least I can't see this after the patch

not just that it has a transparent background, it even has a few
holes which blend perfectly into the background :(

Hmm, there is a lot of stuff to keep broken applications happy
in fvwm already (e.g. lenience and the double reparenting). By
default we could check if the application supplied min/max size
seem to be nonsense (min > max or current size < min or current
size > max) and ignore it then.

Well, you can stop tracking. The coredump was caused by miCurrent
being zero. Your other problem was the exit condition of the for
loop. You had to make sure the body was executed at least once
before comparing with miCurrent. A simple do-while loop does this
well.

My fault. That was a bugfix to prevent the window to flicker to
its original position when flipping pages. Doesn't work with
rubberband moves, however. It's fixed.

I suppose you refer to naming subdirectories by size.
Yes, probably, we need to name them by size-theme/, like 56x46-3dpixmaps/.

Proposed naming scheme would simplify creating new theme icon sets.
We just need a volunteer to rename all icons in circles to use wm-icons
names for icons and put them to, say, these directories:
  48x48-gray_circles/
  24x24-blue_circles/

I will try to put things together and show a pre-alpha version of
wm-icons soon (maybe tomorrow) with several one-sized sets.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ah... Cool. And I see you fixed the problem I forgot, that it failed
to hit the first item in menus... Also having to do with the exit
condition in the loop, I imagine. Well, thanks for fixing my bugs!
