FvwmEvent doesn't support being invoked with an optional second
argument as a substitute to being sym-linked.

The code to do so is quite simple, if argc = 7, use argv[6] as the
program name.  FvwmForm is a good example.

Since Fvwmevent is so generic, it needs this feature at least as
much as FvwmForm.  Besides I think it should be considered a standard
part of the module interface.

I am trying to start FvwmEvent with FvwmAudio as the second argument
to minimize what I change in my config files.

nor did FvwmAudio.

I'm waiting for the module_setup() function to handle this for any module.

I imagine using argv[1] as name replacement
if not supplied argv[0] is used.
the next two args are the pipe handles, so there can't be any confusion.

The module_setup() function should adjust argc & argv, so that the module
just has to parse its own parameters.

It'd be just a temporary fix with the module setup to be consolidated
anyway, although I'd do it if enough people request it. 
(request mails to me)

yep. and module writers shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel, but share
code.

when clicking on a title (i.e: mouse down -menu appears, title under
cursor- mouse release. e.g: single click on root window), I always get:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /homes/albrecht/bin/Fvwm/
Permission denied

This doesn't happen, if I move the cursor out of the title and back in (!),
so it can be considered a bug.

the definition of the menu is as follows:

DestroyMenu Tools
AddToMenu Tools "Tools"			Title

So the click seems to be starting an exec with "" as the command.

if I cange the definition to

DestroyMenu Tools
AddToMenu Tools "Tools"			Title	xterm

nothing changes (same error)

Sounds reasonable.

I didn't want to wait, so I changed my copy of FvwmEvent.

I then went on to do this:

#*FvwmAudioPlayCmd audioplay
#*FvwmAudioDir /opt/sounds
*FvwmAudioCmd "Exec cd /opt/sounds;audioplay"
AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "FvwmEvent - Audio" FvwmEvent FvwmAudio

This worked, but   I question  if  the  need  for  quotes  around  the
"*FvwmAudioCmd" is  the behavior you intended.   I don't see it in the
man page.  (It may be implied,  but I didn't pick  it up.) The problem
is  that  when the command   is  parsed,  its   parsed by  a  call  to
GetArgument().  This  pulls one token out  of the "*FvwmAudioCmd" line
null terminates it and uses it as the command, the rest of the line is
ignored.

I am noticing that with 2.0.47c that sometimes when I quit and restart
fvwm2, it doesn't seem to know where the focus is.

Ie,  I use "MouseFocus",  the pointer is over  a window, and I press a
key I have bound to "Iconify", and  nothing happens.  After I move the
pointer out and  back into the window with  the mouse the key bound to
"Iconify" works again.

This seems   to be something   like what the  "don't  focus off-screen
patch" fixed, but it doesn't happen after quitting Netscape.

This seems to be new with 2.0.47c.

I don't think this is  a 2.0.47c issue,  but I notice that  KillModule
doesn't seem to understand the modules "alternate arg 6 name".

If I  start "FvwmEvent   FvwmAudio",  "KillModule FvwmAudio"  has   no
effect, but "KillModule FvwmEvent" does.

I haven't looked at any code...yet.

I did check  the   "TODO" file and  the   "BUGS" file and  this  isn't
mentioned.

I haven't looked at the patch, but I don't like the idea of new patches
being applied so late in the game.  If Brady and others like the
changes, maybe the code can be integrated into the development tree.

In the meantime, you're right that there is a bug in the isgraph() --
some vendor-supplied isgraph() functions just do an indexed lookup off
the passed in argument, and will segfault (linux's doesn't have this
problem).  My working version has this fixed -- just add:

isascii(keysym) &&

before each call to isgraph(keysym) (there are three, all in menus.c).

Brady, this is essential to do before release-- it is a bug with an easy 
fix.

I can't tell what the problem is without looking at your code, and
probably won't have time in the near future to do so, unfortunately.
Just beware that the menuing code changed a lot under the hood since
2.0.46, and use only the new code as a reference as to how things work.

Good luck!

I agree 5,000%!  :)

We simply _MUST_ get a new version of fvwm2 out.  Fvwm2 has never
actually had an "official" release, just betas, that's why so many
people are still using (and vendors still shipping) Fvwm1.

As I've said here before, lengthy release cycles are very vicious.  We
have to get the "first" release done, and all work should be geared
towards attaining that goal as quickly as possible.  In the past we've
never gotten to "release" point for precisely this reason: it takes long
enough that someone has a "must have" change, then there's a round of
bugfixing, etc. and it just goes on and on.

A line must be drawn; at this point, major changes like this, no matter
how desirable, simply _MUST_ wait.  Hey, I'm giving up on getting
autoconf support for Fvwm 2.2, remember!  :)

All IMO, of course.

Hopefully when Jason gets back he can set up a CVS tree, then new
features can be integrated on a development branch.

Paul,

  I'm in the same camp, possibly at about 3,000%.

  Since FvwmEvent issues have come up, I would be  in favor of putting
FvwmAudio back  into the release.  so  that the FvwmEvent  issues that
have come up don't defer the  "official" release.  (Leave FvwmEvent in
too.)

  Want an example of things that  broke with the removal of FvwmAudio?
The  fvwm2 man  page, one of   the sample  fvwmrcs.  I haven't  looked
everywhere.

  Of course,  there is another  side to  this, "leave  out everything,
except my features".  But we really do have to  be careful what we add
or subtract in this case.

also the new FvwmButtons keeps starting up new copies of xload & xbiff...
despite my using "UseOld,NoClose,Respawn"

*FvwmButtons (	Action "X @@", Swallow (UseOld, NoClose, Respawn) xclock "X xclock")

also started with UseOld,NoClose,Respawn.

I noticed a third pager at one occasion:
oddly enough 2 pagers had the same pipe filedescriptors, while the third
had another one (the first number was different).

if you need my .fvwm2rc, it's on my homepage:

I think it's simple.  Bug-fixes only.  The unique complication is that
some of the bugs are missing patches that people have been using
reliably for a long period of time.  Brady's got a hard job taking over
from Chuck at such a late date!  (Three cheers for Brady!)

there is no shutdown event any more.
Sorry, but shutdown is indicated by a broken Pipe to fvwm.
But if the pipe is broken, it's no use sending a command to it.

Has been a hazard anyways, since many library calls are disallowed from a
signal handler.


Chuck wanted to elude on a shutdown message of some form (ordered shutdown,
not just cutting the pipe) ...

we will have to discuss that for 2.3

I have to aplogize for posting inadequately tested patches for the
geometry "hop" that occurs with the FvwmWinList when items are added and
deleted.

Serious testing revealed the real problem and here is a diff just to fix
this one bug and I'd like to see the bug fix at least integrated into

One of the other items from my original patches is to fix FvwmWinList so
that left justification is not forced. This patch is relative to 2.0.47c
and the previous patch for FvwmWinList.c to resolve the geometry bug
will also apply cleanly to 2.0.47c.

        Sounds like it's due to not having the MouseFocusOnStartup
patch (my Fvwm2 translation of Greg Badros' patch for Scwm). It's in
unofficial_patches: I suspect that a number of 2.0.46 users have it 
applied, and I'm pretty sure you're one of them. (Scan fvwm.c or
misc.c for the string CoerceEnterNotify if you want to be sure.)

        Brady: it'd be nice if we could get this one in.

	OK, no problem, I will wait until 2.3 serie starts up. I will 
keep improving it as much as I can. In the meantime I will keep it in 
2.0.46 for my personal use-- I just like it too much :)

	Talking about .fvwm2rc I think it's time to organize an archive
to keep them available, although I have nor the time neither the 
experience to do it... but I think it would be great if we also keep
a Xdefaults or even a app-defaults.tar.gz with config options for several
apps, as fvwm2 is just a WindowManager and do not config the appearence of
other apps and it would be nice to have some kind of Themes wich will change
the appearence of your desktop as a whole. And we all have spent a long time
configuring our desktop in a nifty way, we may be able to save other 
people time.


PS: Greg the isgraphic() bug is present in the glibc version of the X11 
libs, at least in my version (XFree86 6.3 compiled under 
glibc2.0.7pre3 and gcc-2.8.1)

I assume the isascii(c) && isgraph(c) changes takes care of it, though, right?

Good lord, I don't know. I just looked in the tar file Chuck gave me and it's
there too. Anyone brave enough to try out the patch?

Hi There,
	I'm having problems due to the way that AnimatedMove moves the cursor
with the window.  Could this be stopped?

I have an FvwmButtons at the bottom of the screen and I run an FvwmAuto 
that moves the FvwmButtons up when the cursor enters and down when it
leaves (just like  the Windows95 taskbar).  The problem with
AnimatedMove moving the cursor is that when I move the cursor out of the
FvwmButtons the AnimatedMove fights with me as I move the cursor (it
wins).

I can see that it is desireable to move the cursor when a menu is being
moved aside to make room for a submenu but I think that the cursor
moving should be done by the menu-popping thing rather than the
AnimatedMove function it calls.  The menu-popping thing already moves
the cursor back so it shouldn't be impossible.

Cheers,
Tim.

Could you please not send patches mimed? Since they don't have hi ascii

Hmm. That's tricky. I suppose the easiest way would be to have fvwm store the
alternate names it sees when the module gets started. I would rather not do
that at the moment. And since I've put FvwmAudio back into the modules
directory, there's less need, eh?

Apparantly not. 

I've changed the function to return void.

I'm not sure if this ever has worked for me. I've tried for years to prevent
FvwmButtons from starting a new xdaliclock when I restart.

The patch failed, perhaps because of an earlier version of the patch. Anyhow, 
Here's what this section of FvwmWinList.c now looks like:

  if (WindowIsUp && (new_height!=win_height  || new_width!=win_width))
  {
    if (Anchor)
    {
      if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==NorthEastGravity)
        win_x-=(new_width-win_width);
      if ( win_border > 0) win_x+=win_border+1;

      if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==SouthWestGravity)
        win_y-=(new_height-win_height);
      if ( win_border > 0) win_y+=win_border+1; 

      XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, win_x, win_y, new_width, new_height);

#if 0
      if(RESIZE_BUG_HACK)
      {
        if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==NorthEastGravity)
		win_x+= win_border - 2;
	else
		win_x-=win_border;

	if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==SouthWestGravity)
		win_y+=win_border - 2;
	else	
		win_y-=win_border;
      }
#else /* ckh - need to come up w/ better way to calculate win_x & _y */
        if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==NorthEastGravity)
		win_x+= win_border-3;
	else
		win_x-=win_border;

	if (win_grav==SouthEastGravity || win_grav==SouthWestGravity)
		win_y+=win_border-3;
	else	
		win_y-=win_border;
#endif /* 0 */

    }
    else
      XResizeWindow(dpy, win, new_width,new_height);

    XSync(dpy,False);
  }

This doesn't seem to work at all. Every time my xterm title changes, the
window moves upwards (Using *FvwmWinListGeometry -0-1).

Scwm has options to let you control whether you want the mouse to move
or not, but I think they came after I stopped working on fvwm2.  It'd be 
an easy patch for someone to generate, and just require an extra option
to AnimatedMove.  See the scwm code for details.

Took me a while to remember what that was (had to dig though the
patch).

I believe it's to make mouse button bindings take effect in proper
order.  Say you have the right mouse button bound to Lower on the
title bar (which I do) and you use ClickToFocus (which I also do).  If
you click the right mouse button on the title bar of a window that
doesn't have the focus, it gets the focus, RAISES it, *then* lowers
it.  I believe that after that patch is applied that the window will
just lower without raising (perhaps not getting the focus either).

Don't recall who submitted it, as I don't have a reference to it (that
I recognize anyways) in my notes of what I was attempting to get into
2.0.47 before I gave up.

I've released 2.0.47d at ftp://fozzie.cs.arizona.edu/pub/fvwm

Changes from c:

1. Put FvwmAudio back


	27. Changed Fvwm.tmpl to use the CCENVSETUP Imake variable when
	    building executables to fix problem where run-time load path
	    wouldn't be set correctly on solaris.
	28. Added Albrecht Kadlec's SetupModule() routine to fvwmlib.
	29. Integrated MouseFocusOnStartup patch.
	30. Put my fvwm configuration in sample.fvwm/BradyMontz.

Still a bunch of bugs to fix.

Builds and runs fine on Solaris 2.6 with Sun's compiler.
I no longer see the no-keyboard-focus problem on startup.

Are you keeping a list anywhere of the stuff you want to have fixed

Try it without Respawn.  UseOld,NoClose only works well for me and
eliminates the extra copies across Restarts.  If the app dies, I do a
killmodule FvwmButtons and then run it again (all in one Function!),
which isn't pretty, but happens rarely enough that I can live with it
as a workaround.

You have to make the moving of the cursor an option -- you can't just
turn it off.  Sometimes it's the wrong thing, as you (or someone else?)
has pointed out, but just as often it's the right thing.  Just add an
extra argument to the move primitive and select the right behaviour with 
a test on that argument at run-time.  It'll be a much more useful patch.

you have to allow for a little bit time to really unswallow these apps
(re-map on desktop, I suppose, after unmapping Fvwmbuttons.)

2 wait FvwmBanners (in restart- & ... functions) worked for me all the
time, until 2.0.47

see my .fvwm2rc on my homepage.

I don't think it's worth changing at this stage, after fvwm3 starts
maybe.

Cheers,

Hi All,
	Subject says it all, try the following:

DestroyFunc test
AddToFunc test "I" DestroyFunc testfunc2
AddToFunc test "I" AddToFunc testfunc2 "I" Echo Hello

Then in FvwmTalk try typing "test" a few times and then "testfunc2".

Hope it's an easy one to splat,
Tim.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


The previous patches I sent for fixing FvwmWinList were inadequate. I ended up
re-writing the code after discovering the mechanism used to check on the
x,y co-ordinates of the FvwmWinList window was unreliable. Serious stress
tests were done this time and the code is very straightforward this time.

I'm including the patches for bug fixes only in this message.  Separately will
be the patch with the sort option for FvwmWinList.  The patches are relative
to the FvwmWinList directory (modules/FvwmWinList).

Rocky.

feature for FvwmWinList.  Below is the same set of patches to 2.0.47d
plus the man page update.

Hi All,
	FvwmEvent seems to be stripping the las char from my config lines.  If
I try

*FvwmEventCmd Echo
*FvwmEvent focus_change focus

I get "No such module Ech" in the log file

If I use

*FvwmEventCmd EchoX
*FvwmEvent focus_change "focus changed"X

it works fine.

Cheers,
Tim.

Oops,
	Forget this, it seems to be a problem with FvwmTalk.  FvwmEvent works
fine from config files.

Sorry all,
Tim.

I reported the problem starting with the fvwm2.0.47a, then with version "b" and
I still have the problem with version "d".

I have had no resolution and unfortunately I have not had the time to debug the
problem.

My same config files running with version 2.0.45 behaves as expected.

If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

I'm sorry, I haven't been following this, but my FvwmButtons works
fine with -1-1.

Unless you are trying to get -0 working, -1 should be OK.

OK, it's been over three weeks.  I'm back and am getting adjusted.
Fortunately while there were several sets of hardware problems and such
while I was away, things aren't in too much of a shambles and I'll be able
to put some effort into FVWM infrastructure soon.

What I plan is to wait until the next test version comes out, then build a
CVS tree from that, then hang the other services (rsync, CVSweb, etc.) off
of it.  I'll be experimenting tonight or tomorrow; if anyone wants to point
out any useful goodies I'll be hapy to take a look at them.

Can't say, it goes to +1228+133 for me.

There seems to be some debugging logic in FvwmButtons for this, try
defining DEBUG_INIT and re-build and run again.

Sounds good. I'm busy working on a paper at the moment, in case anyone wonders 
why nothing seems to be happening.

Well I tried defining all the DEBUG flags and saw nothing of use.
Of course -1-1 works as the geometry that is where it is putting
everything I try.  I am really unfamiliar with the Buttons code but I can
take a look at it unless someone else wants to volunteer

Jason,
since you are setting it up I'll assume you have the knowledge I need.
Could you point me and I'm sure others to just a simple HOWTO on CVS I
have spent most of my time using RCS and have never actually used CVS so
if you wouldn't mind just pointing me in the right direction so I know how
to work all these tools that others are requesting of you.


Thanks,
Brad

Well, get CVS and docs from cyclic.com.  There's an AutoFAQ there
somewhere, too (which may be something we'll want to look into running.)
Then look at <URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/majordomo/#cvs> for the
instructions I give for Majordomo (which I will put on the FVWM page once
everything is done).  If you're going to develop, the only other thing you
need to know about is 'cvs diff -u' to generate patches and maybe 'cvs
commit' once write access is given out.

Rsync is, I think, at <URL:http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/>.  Jitterbug is
at <URL:http://samba.anu.edu.au/jitterbug/>.  (I'm going to set up
Jitterbug for Majordomo; I'll be happy to run it for FVWM if we think a bug
tracker is a good idea.)

Okay this finally got me irritated enough so here is the 2 line fix that
takes care of it.  My patch command never quite works right so let me know
if this diff is correct.

I just checked out the fvwm mailing list archive (I was unable to
access it recently but it seems to be back now) and I saw a number of
messages about the possibility of extending fvwm with a real extension
language. Some of these posts cited scwm in several ways:

* To suggest that a future version of fvwm should use a non-Scheme
configuration language to avoid redundant development.

* To suggest that maybe scwm should eventually be renamed fvwm3, and
should actually be the future version of fvwm, this being a big win
for everyone involved.

* To mention that the last time this was discussed on fvwm-workers,
the idea of renaming scwm to fvwm3 was opposed.


I would just like to clarify some points about this. I'll be repeating
some of the things I said the last time I posted here, but I hope
people don't mind.


When I originally started the scwm project (this was quite some time
ago), I didn't even consider the possibility that it could actually be
the successor to fvwm. As I saw it, fvwm was a major project that was
in extremely wide use, with relatively closed development, and no one
would have taken me at all seriously if I suddenly posted that I had a
hack to fvwm to replace the configuration

The main reason I chose to base my work on fvwm was because, out of
existing window managers, it was the closest to what I wanted. It
already supported a great deal of configurability.


Now, the last time this possibility was raised, I said that I
personally would not be averse to scwm being fvwm3, but I was doubtful
that this was what the fvwm community really wanted, as fvwm seemed to
have a slightly different set of goals. In particular, I got the
impression that many people in the fvwm community were more interested
in low resource consumption while providing a fair amount of
configurability, than in total configurability. 

However, it seems there are now many people interested in seeing an
extension language in fvwm, possibly including the current maintainer.

As I said the last time this came up, I personally feel honored that
nayone would even think of making scwm into fvwm3. I don't know about
how the other scwm developers feel, but I spoke to Greg Badros, the
other main developer, who is also on this list, at Linux Expo, and he
agreed that a potential merge with another poject would be a good
idea.


I'm in no position to be making a decision about this on behalf of the
fvwm community, but I would like to give a few reasons why I think
guile is a good choice as an extension language. If people think these
reasons are good, then a re-merge, at least in spirit if not
necessarily literally in code, is worth considering.

* Using a made-up ad-hoc language is, I should hope, out of the
question.

* The best way to leverage existing work would probably be to use one
of the big four, Perl, Python, Tcl or Guile.

* Guile provides one of the best C APIs of any extension language. The
only extension language I've heard described as being as easy to
extend in C is Tcl. While interface to the user is important, the
interface to the programmer is important as well.

* Tcl is a bad language in many ways. Having a proper extension
language makes it natural to implement many parts of the window
manager in the language itself. Lacking true data types and any decent
support for modular code design 

* Perl has some controversial syntactic features which would make some
people hate it as much as others would hate Scheme.

* Python has nice syntax and semantics, but is not as popular as perl
or tcl.

* While Guile is currently only truly usable with Scheme, it plans to
support multiple languages in the future. Some people have attacked
this work as vaporware or as "hating other languages so much that they
will be emulated twice as slow". There is some fairness to the first
claim - the work has been on hiatus for some time. But it has recently
been dusted off, and is being worked on again. It is already possible
to use Guile with a C-like syntax, and work on other "real" extension
languages will likely proceed.

The important thing about this feature is not anything like "perl is
useless because we can just translate it into guile" or anything like
that. The important thing is that users will be given a _choice_ of
extension languages to use. I feel this is much better than any single
extension language.

An alternative approach to providing multiple extension languages is
to provide a generic interface int he core and use some kind of module
facility to connect to the individual languages.

I don't think this approach is as good. Integrating the extension
language in the core is important to properly handle the many times
the core needs to call back to user code if you want to properly
provide full programmability. Also, a good extension language provides
a number of useful data types which can be used by the core itself to
improve code organization without reinventing the wheel.


* All the hard work to make fvwm work with Guile is mostly done, in
the form of scwm. What we are doing now is cleaning things up and
adding new features. We're still working on extending the fvwm2 module
support, but it is already good enough to run the pager. A user has
recently mentioned code he has written to extend things even further
and support a number of other modules properly. We also have plans to
write an fvwmrc -> scwmrc conversion script, although this work has
understandably been delayed because scwm has been a pretty fast-moving
target.



There are some caveats however. Although scwm is already used by many
people and is fairly stable for such a relatively immature project, it
is still changing very quickly, and I wouldn't want people to rely on
it without knowing what they were getting into. I fear that a
premature change of name to "fvwm3," before the code is stable enough
to merit the name, would lead to this.

However, if people do want to work together, I think the increased
cooperation would be greatly beneficial.

I agree completely.  I think our goals with SCWM, in particular with
respect to loadable extensions to manage resource consumption, coincide
to a great deal with fvwm2's future.  I hope the other fvwm-workers will
consider this before pushing forward on a separate 2.3 branch which
might unnecessarily duplicate work.

That's interesting....

Should I draw the implication from this that a 2.2-branch fvwm and scwm are
slated to merge?

I'm in favor of this, if so.

I don't think `slated' is the right word, since there is no officcial
agreement as yet. However, Greg and I both think a merge would be a
good idea, and meshes well with the direction in which fvwm seems to
be heading. If the major parties on the fvwm side agree, we can
discuss things further.

I'm not.... I don't mind greatly if the config file format changes: I
don't want my WM to have to be running an interpreter all the time.

I don't think it's a Good Thing to require a Scheme (or Perl or Tcl or
Python or Java or COBOL, for that matter) interpreter be running in
order to have static menus.

If the push is to have an interface that will -allow- Scheme, that would
be okay, but that's not what scwm is about.

If I wanted 'active desktop', I'd run Windoze.

Loadable extensions have been a part of FVWM since the days of Rob
Nation.  They were part of FVWM's future long before SCWM was even
conceived.

I believe fvwm 2.2 is going to be the official name of the stabilized
2.0.47x line.  2.3 will be the upcoming branch for new development (if
merging with scwm doesn't happen).

> I'm in favor of this, if so.

Merging would be good.  We'd love to hear from fvwm folks about what
sorts of things they'd like in scwm to make it more to their liking.

I think making scwm fvwm 3.0 would be a great idea.  People who want
to use the old format can stick to the 2.2.x tree.  Also, many people
think that fvwm development has stalled (some of us consider the scwm
tree to be another fvwm2 split, which limits future development by
reducing coders).

But if all you want is static menus, then you probably can be happy with 
many simpler wm-s than even fvwm2.  Certainly there is overhead in
running a real languge, but fvwm2 already has a lot of the overhead of a 
real language while implementing only an underpowered configuration
dialect that aspires to be a real language.

Active desktop and configurable desktop are very different things.  Scwm 
is not directly hoping to be an active desktop --- the generality which
we hope it will have might enable such a thing, but isn't our purpose.

Like what?  I must be missing something -- my fvwm2 sources have
conditional compilation code everywhere and nothing is dynamically
loadable.  Perhaps you mean modules?  It's a system that works (we've
spent some effort to make existing fvwm2 modules work with scwm as a
migration path) but isn't satisfactory in a lot of ways.

In any case, we don't claim to be inventing the idea of loadable
extensions to a wm, only hoping to implement them nicely enough the we
satisfy both the power hungry users and those wanting a more lean wm.

Right.  And we hope to have a one-time translator to help people move
.fvwm2rc's to .scwmrc's to aid in the conversion process.

It's a bit unfortunate (but not unreasonably inaccurate) that scwm is
considered a split from fvwm2 development -- only because the idea of
splitting is looked upon reasonably negatively.  As someone who has
contributed code to fvwm2, I understand about the problems with losing
manpower, but at the time of the "split", fvwm2 development had really
stalled.  We may have made a mistake in not searching for more support
from fvwm-workers earlier.  I say only "may have made a mistake" because 
I'm fairly certain that early periods in a projects life-cycle can
benefit from fewer designers and coders with a more unified vision and
direction.  Maciej (and to a lesser extent I) provided that vision and
direction and have a project that is very usable now, well beyond the
proof of concept stages.

I don't want to have to backpatch fvwm2 with any of the more essential
bug-fixes or features from scwm development, but have tried to be
helpful in the months after the split to the code of mine that has made
it into fvwm2 over the years.  A merge will make that job easier for
me, and will reduce duplicated efforts from groups.

I want to say that I wholeheartedly support this plan -- and in fact,
the prospect of an fvwm/scwm makes me much more interested in working
on both.

As a user, I like fvwm2 a lot.  As a developer, I can't help but notice 
that fvwm2's configuration stuff is klugey and rigid and its internals
obscure in the extreme.

As a developer, I like the *concept* of scwm.  It's got to make a better
basis for future evolution than fvwm2.  On the other hand, I'd hate to
lose the fvwm2 look and feel, the interface-engineering tradition that
goes with it.

A window-manager that merged scwm's guts with fvwm2's glory would be ideal.

To those who object to carrying a Scheme interpreter around, I say pooh
on your prejudices.  We have only two choices here; embed a clean interpreter
or embed a lot of ad-hoc code to do logically equivalent things in a
much grubbier way.  This is not a hard decision, especially since a Scheme
interpreter can probably be made smaller than the ad-hoc code!.

What can I do to help this plan along?

Damn straight.  This is the really ugly truth about fvwm2; it's what's
kept me from being more than a passive lurker on the development list
so far.

Greg's point is valid and bears repeating until everybody gets it.  We
are *already* paying most (if not all; if not more than all) of the 
space and code-complexity overhead that embedding Scheme would cost us.
Going to an scwm-like organization would certainly give us a net decrease
in code complexity and quite possibly get us a decrease in actual footprint.

Let me stress that scwm is well beyond concept stages now -- your last
sentence, Eric, summarizes pretty well what scwm is!  We've got fvwm2's
glory.  With an equivalent .scwmrc, scwm feels a HELLUVA lot like using
fvwm2 to me.  The places where they differ are places where I could do
something more interesting with scwm.

Check out our distribution available from:

http://web.mit.edu/mstachow/www/scwm.html

And start using scwm and reporting (and fixing) bugs!  We're pushing
forward on the documentation front (which is unfortunately a bit
sparse), and have a bunch of projects like the .fvwm2rc->.scwrmrc
translator, adding documentation, event-system rewrite, improved fvwm2
module support, native scheme module support, constraints-based window
positioning and sizing, loadable menu styles, loadable decoration
styles, and lots more.  After a contribution or two and an interest in
further development, we're very open about giving write access to the
CVS repository (bazaar-style! :-) ).  Maciej has done an excellent job
maintaining the distribution and using all the auto-tools to make
building scwm a virtual no-brainer (even with the complexities of using
recent guile snapshots).

Thanks for your interest... hopefully others will join in our excitement!

Empirically speaking, it's a huge decrease in code complexity, and in
actual disk-footprint of the scwm binary (maybe now scwm binaries are
bigger, but that's due to new primitives -- they used to be smaller, and 
will be again when primitives can be dynamically loaded).  The process
image size is a little bit bigger than fvwm2, I believe, but I also push 
scwm pretty hard.  A more minimal configuration is more comparable in
running memory footprint to an equivalent fvwm2 configuration.

I can't get the look and feel I want with other WM's.  I'm willing to
bet money that the vast majority of fvwm users use static menus, with
perhaps an M4-generated config based on installed software.  The menus
certainly don't change during operation.

Modules are certainly dynamically loaded and unloaded.  Converting them
to .so files would be interesting, but not necessarily useful.  (The
only real advantage would be lower IPC costs, but, then, you also lose
the simulated multithreading that multiple processes gives you.  A
bigger gain would be made by having libfvwm2 a shared object.)

I'm willing to bet that most users also leave the big-mondo-list of
config options intact except perhaps trimming out XPM's if they still
haven't gotten around to installing libXpm.  The overhead of making XPM
support a .so file would not be worth it.  Nor would 'BorderStyle' or
'Shape' or 'WindowShade' or any of the others.

You seem to be arguing that they SHOULD be .so's, since by 'Loadable
extension' you are stating that modules are not what you mean and the
only other runtime loadable extensions would be .so files.  Again, I
think that far more code would be spent on the overhead of .so's and the
hassles of REALLY ugly code.

For example, WINDOWSHADE is invoked like this a handful of times:
  if(check_allowed_function2(F_MAXIMIZE,tmp_win) == 0
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
     || (tmp_win->buttons & WSHADE)
#endif
     )
  {

There would be no benefit to allowing the capability to come and go:
you'd lose on 50 line function and a half dozen lines throughout
borders.c, builtins.c, functions.c and resize... but to use a .so would
use more than those half dozen lines to save maybe a couple K of RAM
and hurt portability.

There is a reason such things are in the core code (they are FAR cheaper
to implement there) and there is a reason they are #ifdef'able (some
people may not have the capability to use Xpm's or Shape extensions
or just REALLY hate any change in code size and #ifdef's are free to
execute and cost virtually nothing to compile).

Again, perhaps you don't mean 'shared objects' by terms like 'loadable
extensions' and 'dynamically loadable'.  You have stated that despite
Modules being loadable and extending and being dynamically loadable that
you don't mean them.  The only thing I think you could mean would be
shared objects.

Then what are the goals of scwm and why should it replace fvwm?  The
original post was a slightly more polite version of "Fwvm2 is dead,
quit using it or even working on future versions of Fvwm2:  work on my
code and we'll call it Fvwm3.  Be assimilated or die."

The day that fvwm requires an internal interpreted language is the day I
stop upgrading it.

Scwm was originally derived from fvwm2 code, and thus already provides
a superset of fvwm's interface possibilities. I think the greatest
benefit would be combining fvwm's name recognition and large user base
with scwm's flexibility.

Well, libguile already provides the Scheme interpreter, so it takes
basically no space in the program itself. libguile is a bit
heavyweight right now (adds 1M or so to program RSS), but there are
plans to separate out the core Scheme interpreter from it and make
everything else into loadable modules. That should be very small
indeed. In fact, by agressive separation of fvwm code into lodable
binary modules (which libguile supports portably already), it should
eventually be possible to achieve a smaller RSS than fvwm2 itself for
some configurations.

> What can I do to help this plan along?

I think at this point your vocal support is help enough. We will have
to wait and hear from the current core fvwm developers before we can
really proceed.

Changing to a new-format .rc file is hardly the same as "you need to
build a 370k language into your WM".

I have a seriously hard time believing that the config file parsing in
fvwm2 requires 370k -- yet that is the size of libguile on my system.

(And considering that fvwm2 is a whopping 176k, I doubt the overhead is
as claimed unless the rest of fvwm2 lurks in anti-memory space.)

But they should be able to change.  Why should you have to restart your
wm when you install a new application that you want accessible via a wm
"Applications" menus.

Tools exist to manage the complexity of dynamically loadable code in a
cross-platform way.  Once a framework is in place, having dynamically
loaded primitives is not a big problem.  It's not so much that, e.g.,
the window shading code should come and go, but more that if you don't
use window shading, you shouldn't pay for that code sitting around in
your process image anyway.  There's also an extensibility argument--
module communicate through a thin straw unsuitable for many kinds of
extensions like window decoration primitives.

FAR cheaper?  What dynamic linking system are you using?  Dynamically
loaded code is pretty damn lightweight, and can be done cleanly and
unobtrusively to the rest of the system.

So perhaps scwm isn't for you, but it sounds like you're happy with
fvwm2 the way it is and that's fine.  I'm pretty sure that the generic
plans for fvwm2.3 would've left your needs behind, too, and that's fine,
too.  Along the lines of minimalistic wm with static configurations, the
horse is dead and has been beaten for quite a while now.  For those who
want or need something more, perhaps scwm is the right direction.

Then use FvwmPipe and talk to it through a pipe.  I certainly don't want
it doing something like add_menu(`find / -type f -perm 001`) every time
I pull down a menu.  Or FvwmTalk.  There are lots of ways to add menu
items without restarting Fvwm2 or even putting them in a config file.
And I sure as hell don't want application software deciding that 'make
install' means to go fuck with my window manager.  Any software that
does that will be rm'd.

Are you talking about modules or about core code?  Windowshade, the
example cited, is CORE code.  There isn't a huge communications overhead
in something that is in, appropriately enough, 'builtins.c'.  Your last
sentence, then is yet another red herring.  If you don't use
Windowshades, the calls will STILL have to be made to see if the bits
are set because the objecting was that they were ifdef'd.  The only
'savings' for real would be the 50 lines or so of the actual function in
builtins.c.

Is that worth it?  You seem to think so, as so far the only argument you
have presented is that unloading and loading single functions like
WindowShade should be done with .so's.  Does it really take linking with
a 370k library to unload and load a 50 line function?

Subroutine calls to fpic'd functions are cheaper than an || to a bit?
(Never mind that the subroutine call will do the exact same || to a bit
and that in the process will clean your instruction prefetch cache
and other fun.)

You haven't answered the question: What are the goals of scwm and why
should it replace (not peaceful coexistence: you argued for replacement
and seem to have brought your own cheering squad along with you) Fvwm?

If you succeed in using the Fvwm name, I will be glad to provide
facilities and time for a fork for the people who wish to continue.

Again, mail -either- the list or me.  I really don't need two copies of
every piece of mail.

Your example is bogus.  We wouldn't have a function call to do that
test, the dynamically loaded code would be just the primitives to manage 
the shading.   The window shading feature is most definitely not core
code -- if I don't use it, I don't want it loaded if it's easy to avoid
loading.  But this is way off topic, scwm's main contribution isn't
dynamically loaded code (we don't use it at all aggressively yet)--
those remarks were to pacify people concerned about code bloat of
primitives they don't care about.

<snip>

We are not arguing for replacement.  Fvwm1 and fvwm2 have their place
and will remain.  We are simply suggesting that the future direction for 
the scwm coincides with some expressed interest in future direction for
fvwm2, and that perhaps scwm is far enough along in that direction that
it makes more sense for interested developers of fvwm2 to join forces
with scwm developers.  Fvwm2 could continue to develop and have bug
fixes, but replacing its configuration language has been done, and done
well IMHO by the scwm-team many months ago.

We have no need to use the fvwm name; scwm is a perfectly good name.  I
only wish to merge the efforts related to dynamic configurability, and
get more developers behind scwm.  Duplicated efforts serve no one well,
and I honestly believe scwm is far better positioned to be the future of 
fvwm2 users wanting more than fvwm2 is.  Those that don't need the
power/flexibility can stay behind as they did with fvwm1.  Scwm isn't
for everyone, but it probably is for those crying out for a better
language with fvwm2.

I'm building scwm now with a view to testing this assertion.  I have no
connection with Greg or Maciej, no code investment in either scwm or
fvwm2, and no axe to grind (except that I like clean design).

I'll report to the list on what I find.

During the last go-around on this, the "add one million bytes" issue
seemed like a show-stopper to me.

I did take the time to download Scwm and was impressed by how clean
the config files looked when XEmacs could fully understand them and
highlight them accordingly.

However  as I looked through the  config files  is  wasn't clear to me
what I would do with this new, more flexible language.  As I use fvwm2
now, I don't  use FvwmCpp, FvwmM4, or  FvwmPipe.  I support fvwm2  for
over 20 users,  and none of  them report the  need  for a more  robust
config language either.

Along the  same line, as we  get fvwm2 users  problem reports, I don't
recall hearing problems that made me think, "if  only fvwm2 had a more
robust configuration language...".

I have  a hint what  most users want  is a GUI of  some sort that will
magically  configure menus for new remote  systems to start Xterms on,
and the like.  It isn't clear to me that cleaning up the configuration
language will make fvwm2 more amenable to GUI configuration.

I  do make  extensive  use  of  fvwm2  macros.  Even  though the macro
facility is primitive, it hasn't let me down yet.

If, through some  magic,  all fvwm2 development  ground to  a halt, my
first inclination  would be to say fvwm2  is good enough.  To convince
me to switch I would need:

  a foolproof way to convert .fvwm2rc files to Scwm config files (Note
that the current fvwm1 to fvwm2 conversion tool is far from foolproof)

  a fully documented Scwm

  all current fvwm2 modules working

  something compelling in Scwm that I can't get from fvwm2

Thanks for this list.  Your perspective is appreciated.  There are
probably some features people have in their .scwmrc's that you'd really
like if you knew about them.  We definitely need a list of nifty things
people have done with Scwm -- the most recent that jumps to mind is
using our window-style's other-proc feature to customize the placement
of windows that meet a specific criteria -- e.g., making netscape's
popup windows go to a specific place (with all the power of scheme to
describe that place).

Again, thanks for your input.

Late response...

mstachow> I saw a number of messages about the possibility of
mstachow> extending fvwm with a real extension language. Some of these
mstachow> posts cited scwm in several ways:

If the fvwm employs another language as the configulation language, I
think it is not fvwm. We should not forget that why fvwm throw away
the configulation language which twm uses, and employs cpp/m4 as
higher level description language. Again, we should not forget the
great design policy of fvwm.

***

mstachow> * To suggest that a future version of fvwm should use a
mstachow> non-Scheme configuration language to avoid redundant
mstachow> development.

Yes, that's right, and it should be avoided. fvwm configulation
language is just like the one of sendmail; higher (and more human
friendly) language is not provided core-part of program. fvwm
configulation description language is just like x86 assemble language; 
we can use other higher level language as we like.

mstachow> * To suggest that maybe scwm should eventually be renamed
mstachow> fvwm3, and should actually be the future version of fvwm,
mstachow> this being a big win for everyone involved.

Why? Scwm should have its own success story 'cause it is not fvwm.

mstachow> * To mention that the last time this was discussed on fvwm-workers,
mstachow> the idea of renaming scwm to fvwm3 was opposed.

Last time we do the right decision. It comes from very obvious and
very simple reason, "scwm is not fvwm."

***

Why you want to "merge" the fvwm and scwm? If scwm is great, fvwm will 
be died by itself. You don't worry about that :-)

I don't subscribe to this list currently, and many people have been
replying on this thread without cc'ing me. I just read the list
archive, so I will respond to the messages here all at one go.

I saw several concerns from people who were opposed to the idea of an
fvwm/scwm merge, and I would like to clarify several of these points.


1) A number of people saw my message as an attempt to "hijack" fvwm
development, and read it as encouraging the fvwm developers to stop
work on fvwm2 immediately and bow down to me as lord and master of
window managers. That's not what I'm saying at all. 

* I don't believe fvwm2 development should stop now. Fvwm2 suits many
people's needs just fine, and it needs to be fixed up enough to be
released officially. Scwm is also not totally ready for prime time. It
is lacking (although we're actively working on it) good docs, an
fvwmrc->scwmrc translator, and a stabilization of the API provided to
the user by the config language before it could even be considered to
be as much of an end-user solution as fvwm.

* Some people want to use a real configuration in future versions of
fvwm. If this is a real goal shared by many people, I suggest
cooperation as opposed to reinvention of wheels.

* In fact, some people have suggested in the past that an fvwm/scwm
merge. At the time, it was unclear that this was feasible, or that it
was something any significant proportion of the fvwm community wanted.

* I am not trying to steal the fvwm name just to gain instant fame and
popularity. It is true that a larger base of users/developers would be
a great thing for scwm, but I would only want to pursue this if the
fvwm community feels they would also benefit from a merge.


2) Several people expressed concerns about the additional resource
consumption of embedding a real configuration language in a window
manager. In particular, brian moore <bem@cmc.net> had a lot to say
about this. He also mocked the idea of extension through dynamically
loaded code (.so files), citing WindowShade as an example of something
that was better off being right in the core.

* The cost in resources is not high, and is potentially negative
compared to what fvwm does now. Right now, scwm will use about 1.5 to
2 times the memory of fvwm with a typical config (i.e. about 1 meg
extra). However, scwm and guile are both at a point where essentially
no major work has been done to reduce memory consumption. Guile will
be split into a much smaller core, with much functionality split out
into loadable modules. The interpreter Guile ultimately traces it's
descent from, SIOD, provides just the code Scheme language and is
extremely small. I believe the Guile core will also be quite small
when Guile is more mature. The same will be done with scwm, in terms
of breaking out code into loadable modules. With scwm specifically,
there is the additional benefit that many Fvwm primitives are
redundant, or offer redundant optional functionality, when combined
with a real configuration language. Further, many Fvwm modules, which
incur the overhead of a whole separate process of compiled code, can
be replaced with a few lines of compact, interpreted scwm
configuration language code. Ulimately, I don't believe scwm will use
much more memory for comparable configs, and possibly will use
less. At the same time, it will allow you to do a lot more.


* The example brian cited with WindowShade is, IMO, a case where the
Fvwm code is broken. Maximize should not be checking whether a window
is shaded or not to see if it's OK to maximize it. One of these two
tracks should be taken: the core window data structure should have a
CannotMaximize flag which would be set by any window operation that
precludes maximizing the window; or, better yet, shading a maximized
window should work (it should just put the title bar in the size and
position it would be in if you'd maximized and then shaded, and set
the window so restoring it after shading and maximizing will
DTRT). The latter is the track we took with scwm. Following this
philosophy, WindowShade could reasonably be broken out of the core
into a loadable module


3) Some other people questioned wether there was any real benefit to
having a real configuration language. In particular, Dan Espen
<dane@mk.bellcore.com> mentioned that he'd never run into a problem he
thought could be solved better with a real configuration
language. Makoto MATSUSHITA <matusita@ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp> expressed
the related sentiment that Fvwm made the right choice in providing
only a simple, low-level configuration language. He said that the use
of CPP or M4 as a higher-level language was a deliberate design
choice, commparing the built-in fvwm config language to x86 assembly.

* Here are several things we've done in Scwm so far that I believe
were enabled by having a real configuration language built-in:

** A number of primitives, and in some cases modules, could be
replaced by a couple of lines of code in the configuration language
that are loaded on demand. This is not a case where we've solved
problems that Fvwm didn't per, se, but are a case where I believe we
have solved them in a better way.

Some things we have done this way include: Maximize, FvwmAuto (not
quite a one-liner as someone posted a while back, but pretty close),
WindowList, Scroll, None, Next, Prev and many others. All of these
could be implemented in terms of other primitives once a real language
was available.

** A couple of uses of dynamic menus, suck as to display an xlock menu
that shows all the modes of the installed xlock, as determined by
querying it, and a menu that parses Red Hat's /etc/X11/wmconfig. No,
they don't fork weird, complicated processes every time they run, but
you can refresh them any time you want if you upgrade or install
anything relevant.

** Make windows start in other viewports (not just on other desktops).

** User-defined window placement (this is a recent one).

** Lots of other neat stuff. I dunno, other scwm users tend to be more
creative than me at coming up with good uses for total
configurability. There are a lot of people for whom this satisfies a
very real need to customize their environment in complex
ways. However, they are not the only ones to benefit. Look at Emacs. A
lot of people might say that the vast majority of users don't need a
programming language in their text editor. It is true that most users
don't write their own syntax hilighting, debugger interaction mode,
news reader (!), etc, but many benefit from these things existing.


* Here are some we plan to do in the future:

** We have plans to make the existing Tk and Gtk bindings for Guile
Scheme available from within scwm. This will allow built-in GUI
configuration that updates automatically. In fact, Sam Steingold has
already done some preliminary work on built-in dynamic configuration
using scwm's existing menu facilities only.

** Lower-by-one. Ever wanted to lower a window just below the next one
in the stack it overlaps, and not all the way to the bottom?
Implementing 


* I think one of the best uses is for deploying a large, site-specific
(or product-specific) configuration. This needs to adapt to individual
machine differences, allow user customization of particular parameters
dynamically, adapt to changes, and so on.

Red Hat uses FvwmM4 to get this effect. I'd guess many other sites and
individual users do as well. As people can probably guess, Greg, who
originally did the M4 stuff they use, agrees that a real language is a
much better olution to this.


* The comparison to x86 assembly is a bad example. In that case, both
the language you are compiling from, and the assembly language target,
are turing-complete. The fvwm config language is far from turing
complete. If fvwm internallly had only a bytecode interpreter and any
language facility was provided externally, I could buy this, but a
good bytecode interpreter would be harder to implement and perhaps as
costly in resource consumption as a good real interpreter.


* The sendmail config language is not, IMHO, an example of good
design.



Finally, I think people who are opposed to a real configuration
language at all are, IMO, missing the point somewhat. There are
already a number of people who want Fvwm to evolve towards having a
configuration langauge. I did not think this was true in the past, so
I thought it was inevitable and OK that Scwm should go it's separate
way. However, now that I know that at least some Fvwm developers want
to go in a similar direction, I think that vision of Fvwm's future and
my vision of Scwm are similar enough that cooperation would be a good
idea. 

It is not up to me to decide wether Fvwm will have a real
configuration language in the future. But if it does, I suggest that
cooperation is better than duplication, because the scwm team has
already done most of the hard parts. And if that happens, people who
don't want a configuration language will probably not be happy with
the future of fvwm anyway. I'd rather hear from people who _do_ want a
configuation language in fvwm, and whether they have any conccerns about wet

First comment: this discussion seems to be humming along nicely. However, I
suspect that the anti-extension language people are holding back. Either that, 
orall of the people that responded to my posts on this subject a few months
ago are all on vacation.

Back before I became fvwm maintainer, I sent mail to the scwm people
suggesting the exploration of essentially make scwm fvwm3. I still think that
this might be a good idea, and would even be willing to give up head dude
status (I admit, once I became maintainer, my natural human instinct to
maintain posession reared itself).

However, my private feelings in support of (a) adding an extension language to 
fvwm, (b) that this language be scheme, and (c) rewriting large chunks of fvwm 
are merely my feelings. Before I became maintainer I did some hard lobbying in 
support of an extension language. At the current time, I feel that taking such 
a stance would be irresponsible. 

I suspect there is a huge segment of fvwm users who are quietly using fvwm
without using a large fraction of its current features, and who are either not
watching this discussion, or are watching it with the quiet horror akin to
that some have towards emacs. Fvwm is first and foremost a unix window
manager, and has reached its current level of success by sticking to the
philosphy common to many unix applications: small, fast, configurable, and
easy for a single programmer with no connections to improve. 

Here is my advice:

Fvwm in its current form will not last. The source code I have on my pc at
home, and the patches I keep receiving, are for a program which is not filling
a well-defined role. It is becoming too big and complicated to make the
minimalists comfortable, and it is not extensible enough to please the
"extension language" people. If I were to pick an analogy, I would compare it
to the vim project. I love vim and use it every day, but if I want to edit
something with graphical windows and fonts and make complex macros, I just use
emacs, not some vi clone that's been hacked up with python, perl, motif, etc.

I see three potential directions, each worthy of discussion:

1. Return fvwm to its roots, rewrite it, strip it down, and either find a way
   to move all of the extra functionality people have been grafting on it into
   modules or just get rid of them. People supporting this will have to make a 
   case that such a program will survive, stay supported, and not disappear
   and strand its users.

2. Find a way to balance the needs of the minimalists and maximalists. I don't 
   personally know of a program which has truly done this (although vim
   actually has done a good job, since I can turn off everything I don't want, 
   so I still like vim - no hard feelings), but it can probably be done "good
   enough." I suspect this will involve taking large portions of scwm, but
   being able to compile both fvwm and fvwm-lite. People supporting this have
   to demonstrate that it can be done.

3. State the memory is cheap, people who don't upgrade their hardware probably
   don't upgrade their software, and keep expanding fvwm. While the scwm
   binary is efficient, and small, I suspect that it will go a similar path to
   other such programs with users needing increasingly large amounts of scheme
   code installed somewhere to get what they want. People arguing this case
   have to demonstrate that while (probably) nobody uses the complete feature
   set of fvwm 2.0.46, every piece of it is used by lots of people and that
   going to an extension language is the most efficient way for everybody to
   get the pieces of this feature set they want. They also either have to get
   people to want to use scheme, and this is easier said than done, or
   convince them that they wil never have to touch any scheme.

I think that #2 may be the way to go. I think that scwm is a valuable project
to the Internet, and even if people don't use it, they will benefit from the
work that it does and inspires in spin off projects (particular other guile
projects). I also suspect that it may be hard for (some or most of) the scwm
people to "settle down" and make a stable version that their users like but
perhaps they don't. I also think that fvwm could use a lot of the stuff that
scwm is doing, so they should stay, at the very least, sister projects. 

I don't think people will ever agree on an extension language. Hell, the
xemacs people have been cutting themselves up over whether to use scheme or
common lisp. If you can't get people to agree on which dialect to use, its
unlikely to get people to settle on python vs scheme vs C vs ...

One approach which I would like to explore (those who've recoginized that I
work on the Scout project won't be surprised by this) is the option of turning 
fvwm into a window manager toolkit, from which managers of various complexity
could be written, but which would maintain compatability in the important
things (like the module interface).

I'm not the one that started it.  Greg said that everything should be
dynamically loaded instead of #ifdef'd.  The things that are #ifdef'd
either -MUST- be #ifdef'd to allow for people to not have XPM, Shape or
other libraries or extensions or are features that cost very little.  I
see no reason why Shade (one of the features that doesn't have to be
ifdef'd as far as I can see) should be ifdef'd or even dynamically
loaded.  The cost of stripping it out, making an FvwmShade.so.1.0,
loading it and unloading it is FAR higher than the 50 lines of code that
it is.

Greg then confused this by wandering on about "small pipes" for IPC,
which means nothing to a core function.  -WHAT- IPC?

And what indication is there that suddenly time will be spent on
reducing memory and CPU requirements of Guile?  The track record, per
your statement, is that "no major work has been done to reduce memory
consumption".  Why will that be different in the future?  All
indications of the Guile pushers are that it doesn't matter.

Saying "it is based on something that was small, but it is now really
fat" is not a good indicator of the future size.

Again, my fvwm2 is a wopping 176k.  Guile is 370k.  Even if I'm nuts and
attribute 100% of the fvwm2 code to configuration, Guile would need to
be cut in half before it would be the same size.

I dislike the handling of Maximize with WindowShade, but ripping it out
and making it a .so file would not change that.  I could compile fvwm2
as an a.out file and it still wouldn't change it.  What do file formats
and loading have to do with the logic of code?  Maybe if I don't strip
the executable it'll behave differently, eh?

I see about 80 modes in my xlock... I don't think I want a menu of all
of them.  I have a menu with a half dozen modes and 'random'.

nope, I use lower to get something out of the way that I'm not ready to

It's excellent for what it does.  I wouldn't use it to write the tower
of hanoi, but for parsing mail addresses and rewriting them it's very
nice.  (And, no, I don't M4 my sendmail.cf's.)

It's interesting that you dislike turing complete configuration
languages in your mail daemon, but not your WM.

You're using loaded terms.

FVWM does have a configuration language.  It's not turing complete, but
it is nonetheless a language.  Even twm has a configuration language.

I see no reason to make my WM turing complete.

I still find your presence here to be akin to the worms that move from
MUD to MUD saying "come to Gizmo MUD, it's better than this one!"; or
the people who wander into newsgroups to tell all the users of the
GadgetOS that GizmoOS is better and they should format and install it now.

The post from Greg (who at least has been reading this list), followed
by your "Oh, gosh, Greg, what a great idea, I agree with you fully!" chorus

Whew, it's a good thing you're stepping back into the discussion since
folks are getting pretty ornery on this topic. My sense is that
consensus *can't* be found here, since it looks like the issue is
devolving into a question of religion.

But it seems to me it's about time some folks got alienated for good
though... Look, I don't see that it's feasible to keep fvwm a
RAM-consumption mouse *and* provide a well-designed option for a
turing-complete configuration language. I *could* see returning to the
earlier notion of extending the modules interface so an interpreter
could be made sufficiently functional as a module, but I don't think
*anyone* will be happy with that... No one will really grumble too
loudly, but no one will be happy either, I suspect. I really don't see
a good way to build a consensus here and a decision has to be made
here.

As far as fvwm's design and architecture, I haven't got a lot to say
since I'm far too unskilled to offer an intelligent opinion. But I am
curious to know:

    When we talk about embedding an interpreter in fvwm which is
    managing the configuration, are we saying that the same language
    will *also* provide the basis for writing extension modules? I.e.,
    will FvwmPager, for example, be entirely writable and runnable
    from what essentially used to be .fvwm2rc?
    
    I'm assuming that an implicit assumption of those who resist an
    embedded interpreter is that similar functionality could be done
    as a module, if the module interface were expanded/improved. What
    kind of impact would such an expansion/improvement have on fvwm's
    core's size? I don't expect anyone's saying that adding a proper
    interpreter *somewhere* is a Bad Thing, people just don't want it
    as the single-available option in the core...

I *will* comment that as a *non*-programmer, setting up my fvwm2 has
really seemed a lot like programming at times. *Especially* when
working with my modules configurations. It becomes the *most*
pronounced when I start thinking a cute little FvwmForm could solve a
little problem for me. FvwmForm basically exposes the XForm toolkit to
scripting through Fvwm's configuration language... This is an oddity
and really makes the division between programmable extension language
and configuration language blur and make me go dizzy...

I suppose that if one has to choose one of the extreme options (since
I don't expect any compromise is feasible) it's important to finally
decide what's fvwm's design principle. At heart, this discussion, it
seems to me, is about the question, "Is FVWM 1) a small, fast wm
foremost or 2) ultimately, a highly-configurable wm?" The trouble is
that proponents for each side see that there's already something quite
good at each end: twm on the one hand; scwm on the other...

Just some thoughts from a (not completely) satisfied fvwm2 user.

I'm inclined to believe it when I see it.
So far we are being told that Scwm is at least 1 meg larger than fvwm2.

Here's whats I found on the TO-DO list that I  think is related to the
config language:

  - Access to certain window attribs from .fvwm2rc funcs, and
    simple if/else capabilities (or perhaps a module to do so)??
  - Simple static variables for .fvwm2rc functions (for toggles, etc)??
  - Add $d variable for functions to get desktop number?

Is this 1 meg of code?

I   think Greg has    said as  much.  We   need  to understand  what a
full-blown configuration language is going  to do for fvwm2 before  we
pay the price.

It seems to  me, if we are talking  about a 20% overhead increase, the
average end user should see some benefit.   Any more than that, should
come with a dramatic improvement.

Don't forget my prior point  about the conversion  script.  I have  my
doubts that  a fully  functional fvwm2 to  Scwm converter  is going to
appear.

As far as Brady's comment about the  huge segment of users watching in
quiet horror, don't forget this is the  workers list.  Most users have
no cause to be on any fvwm list, let alone the workers list.

I don't think my reaction is quiet horror, but I am concerned.  I very
much   appreciate Gregs  prior   contributions, and I  try   not to be
negative about new  ideas,  but I think  Scwm  is ahead of   its time.
Someday we may look back and wonder why we had dozens of configuration
languages, but that seems to be years off.

If   XEmacs,  Netscape and Scwm   were  using  the  same configuration
language from a  common  shared library,  that  would be a   different
story.   We just haven't arrived  in that particular  heaven yet.  Nor
does it seem to be on the horizon.

I think Scwm is a very interesting project. For  now, I am looking for
the fvwm2 project stay on track and serve its user base.

This is a really bad way to go. Hacking on features to the language
one at a time will result in a total mess, and will end up bloating
the code more, ultimately, then adding a real language will. The other
problem is that such simple mechanisms will severely limit what kind
of programmability a user can use in his code, because the interpreter
will be really slow unless you take great pains to design it
well. Some timing tests of SCM, the Scheme interpreter Guile is based
on, indicate that it beats the pants off _any_ other interpreted
language, and beats most byte-compilers except severely statically
typed stuff like Java. Guile has lost a bit of that speed, but Aubrey
Jaffer, the author of SCM, has offered to do a lot of speed
optimization on Guile once the basic code stabilizes enough. This is
important because it allows you to safely write code in the extension
language that does complex things, and yet still runs reasonably fast.

> 
> Is this 1 meg of code?

I have to correct a misconception here, scwm does not have 1 meg more
of _code_, it is one meg more of _memory usage_, due to the large
amount of stuff libguile puts on the heap. And my statement about this
was acutally incorrect. I get RSS of 1.7M with a simple setup now, as
opposed to 1.1M with fvwm2 and this is still while we are in feature
explosion stage, with a _lot_ of subsequent trimming to happen later.

The scwm _code_ itself is actually smaller on disk than the current
size of the fvwm binary (and that's not even counting the fvwm modules
you can get the effect of using it, without having to run them) if you
don't count the large amounts of extra functionality (synthetic key
and mouse presses, animated moves and window shades, user-levele X
Property handling, and many others) which are orthogonal to the
configurability support itself, and which will go into dynamically
loadable shared modules pretty soon.

Well, we're down to 60% overhead or so in some cases, and this is
again _before_ the _huge_ amounts of work that will go into reducing
the memory footprint before this is considered an end-user ready
product.

I just started one today. Some parts will be tricky, but I expect to
have most of the functionality done in two days (i.e. pretty much
everything but modules).

I think it is fewer years off than you may think. This is an attempt
to plan for the future early.

Both Emacs and thus presumably XEmacs will be using Guile in the
future. So will gdb, and probably other FSF-maintained apps as
well. Netscape probably will stick with JavaScript, I'd imagine.

I don't think anyone is even suggesting otherwise. There is no
question that Scwm is not yet fully end user ready. I think the 0.x
version number makes clear that, although it may be useful to many
people, it is primarily a developer/hacker release for people who
really like playing with their window managers. And certainly, the
concerns about the current memory usage, and the current lack of an rc
file translator, are very valid.

The question is really what should happen when the fvwm2 series
stabilizes. What comes in the next developer series? A number of
people have suggested configuration languages like python, perl or
tcl. Some have even suggested scheme, and as a result, Scwm was
mentioned. I suggest that to avoid duplicating work, if that vision is
really the future of fvwm.

I will remind everyone to please make sure that <mstachow@mit.edu> gets a
copy; as a (the?) primary scwm author who is not a member of fvwm-workers,
he needs to see this discussion.

I've seen some good arguments as to why it won't work to have the
configuration language be a module.  I've yet to see mention of the idea of
having more than one core (being the configuration language plus builtins)
and have everything else be modular (or in a shared library).  (In other
words, two essentially different window managers sharing a whole lot of
code.)

In the end, I'm really partial to saying that fvwm3 will be new and
different, while fvwm2 will continue to be supported in perpetuity.  That
ensures that "fvwm" (as a project) will still go somewhere, while fvwm2
stays small (because you can tell people to just use fvwm3 if they want
some particular feature).

I think, though, that for anything to be called fvwm3, it has to at least
try to stay true to what fvwm has always stood for.  It needs to be
functional (no argument about scwm here) and frugal.  Fortunately frugality
is relative; making it "small" should always be a goal, even if that means
telling people not to use some available features to save space.  It
doesn't have to be within some percentage of fvwm2's (or 1's) size, because
computers really have advanced and memory doesn't mean quite what it used
to.

BM> Fvwm in its current form will not last.

I agree.  It is being pulled in (at least) two directions and it's
impossible for a maintainer to just split the difference.  That's why
development usually splits in the first place.  (Well, that and stagnation,
but we seem to have fixed that lately.)  But instead of a complete split, I
think it would be worthwhile to have two programs, one oriented towards
features and another oriented towards size, both sharing as much code and
programming effort as possible.

Can it be done?  I don't know.  We'd have to start by comparing
functionality and feature sets and see what can be put into libraries that
can be used by two different cores.  It is not a simple task.  (Both scwm
and fvwm would be better for it if it were done, though, even if nobody was
talking about a merge.)

I think so, too.  As a person who's not in either the fvwm or scwm camps,
but who's been around the track a few times, I may have a strategy to suggest
for accomplishing it.  It'll take a little give and goodwill on both sides.

I can see a merge working given three commitments:

1. The scwm people must provide a fully capable .fvwm2rc-to-.scwmrc
   translator.

2. Scwm must support all existing fvwm2 modules.

3. The fvwm people must accept that for the first few releases (until
   guile gets space-tuned), the scwm/fvwm3 code may have a bigger footprint
   than the existing fvwm2.  

In other words: if the scwm people will live with a requirement that
scwm be painlessly upward-compatible with fvwm2, and the fvwm2 people
will cut them *temporary* slack on the footprint issue, we can all
make this work.

There's a reason I emphasize `temporary'.  We're talking about replacing
the ad-hoc config code with Guile.  A key advantage of this is that it
would allow fvwm to leverage lots more brains than just the fvwm workers.
Better dynamic-loading and modularization for Guile is critical-path
for lots of projects besides ours.  It's much more likely that Guile 
will improve dramatically than that we will ever get motivated enough to
clean up the ad-hoc cruft in fvwm2's present guts.

Eventually, here's what I hope we can all agree to deliver:  a version of
scwm that, when called through a link named fvwm2, reads .fvwm2rc,
translates it on the fly to Guile, and runs just like fvwm2 (modulo
bug fixes).

The program used for .fvwm2rc-to-Guile translation should, of course,
be available standalone for people who want to go pure Guile right away.

Nope-- I think you misunderstood... scwm is a bit larger in process
image size --- the code is actually smaller, I think (it certainly used
to be, and hasn't grown all that much).

Last time I built scwm it was not appreciably smaller code:

-rwx------   1 bem      users      170908 May  8 19:16 scwm

And the scary one:
% ldd scwm
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6.3
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.1
        libguile.so.2 => /usr/local/lib/libguile.so.2.0.0
        libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2.0.8
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.7.14
        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.9
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.4.44

Termcap??  WTF?

For comparison, 2.0.47d with a single patch for fixed-size icons that
Ian Speilman gave up getting into the tree, so which I now patch myself:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     system     176632 Jul 16 11:51 /usr/bin/X11/fvwm2

So the savings is about 6k.... before you start snarfing in 370k shared
libs.  (At least termcap is almost always loaded by something else.)
The scwm build was stock, both executables are stripped.

Considering you and Eric (and Brady?!) have decided that all the config
loading code was complicated bloat and that huge savings would occur by
removing it, you'd think it would show up in the size of the executable
to have so much less code.   But it doesn't.

It's the same size plus a 370k library.

Nobody said lots smaller--- it's smaller, even with a plethora of added
features through clean generalization.  Please get the chip off of your
shoulder.  You want a small wm, you have plenty of choices.  For the
fvwm2 people who want extensibility, they're gonna have to pay for it in
space somewhere... better to use an existing solution that's improving
on its own than further hack the fvwm2 configuration "language".  That's
all.

As another outsiding tossing in commentary, I just want to point out
that you are doing nothing to help your cause, which seems to be
approximately: "Don't let anyone change fvwm2 any!"

Your arguements are largely unrelated to the issues at hand, like this one:
 
> Termcap??  WTF?
	[snip]
> libs.  (At least termcap is almost always loaded by something else.)
	[gee.. a non-arguement per your own comment]
 
> It's the same size plus a 370k library.

	What machine are you using that 370k is such an issue? An Ultrix
box? An i486 with 16M of RAM? For our edification, please tell us what
system you are running, and what it is that you want out of fvwm2/beyond. 
If you are perfectly happy with your current build, (or perhaps your build 
+ some patches that could be integrated) then lets hear it. If you will be 
unhappy if *any* more features are added, say so. 

	Once you have listed all the features that you, as the de facto
governing party, deem acceptable, explain your reasoning. If memory size
is the overriding goal, explain why, and why fvwm1/fvwm2-current aren't
good enough to stick with while we move to the next century. 

	It just sounds to me like you have configured yourself the way 
you like, and can't bear the thought of having to ever change your 
configuration. In that case, it is your perogative to stick with your
the version (which is fairly stable) and unsubscribe to this list.

	If this isn't the case, stop harping on the same subject 
(370k 370k 370k 370k!!!! Aiiigh!) and be constructive. We already know
full well that you don't want anything to do with scheme. Well, Brady
put foward several possible options; why don't you comment on those
for a change.

Please get your preaching out of my mailbox then.  You've spent months
cleaning up the code, which, I will agree (as will no doubt anyone here)
is needed in fvwm.  To only remove 6k is not the great savings that you,
Maciej or Eric have said would happen.

Again, it is incredibly rude and arrogant for you and Maciej to show up
on this list with the attitude of zealots trying to convert the masses.
What would you think if the Windowmaker folks showed up on your lists
and started telling your users to stop working on Scwm since they were
the greatest thing since sliced bread (though far less stable)?

I wonder if Eric would like people on fetchmail-friends insisting that
mail-getter was better and that people still working on fetchmail were
wasting their time.  Perhaps fetchmail needs to have a guile interpreter
built in.

When you preach at people, expect them to be annoyed and expect them to
question your supposed facts.  That's true whether you stand on a street
corner with a Bible, or in the airport with carnations, or on a mailing
list with The Latest Gee Whiz Toy.

Your words:

It's not a "huge decrease": it's 6 bloody K.  You claim this "huge
decrease" will show up in the "disk-footprint" even.  The "little bit
bigger" in RAM is at least 30%.  So 30% smaller would be a "little
smaller"?  For most of us, 30% is large, and when 6k = 3%, 6k is
small.  Consistent use of words would be helpful.

As I stated: if fvwm requires guile, I will, within 48 hours, have a CVS
repository, web pages, mailing lists and other toys for the people who
refuse to use your creation.

Cool your jets, dude.  You're being a lot ruder right now than either 
of those two have been.  And guess which one of the three of you sounds
like a zealot?

If you keep this up, "small-is-beautiful" will lose a credible

Maciej on their toes about the economy and footprint issues.  I was
expecting it would be you, but you're sabotaging your own arguments
rather effectively by flaming and making these peevish threats to

Fetchmail doesn't have Guile because fetchmail doesn't need Guile.  As
presently designed, fetchmail is just a keep-it-simple-stupid mail
transport agent.

If fetchmail were going to do content-based filtering or something
else that suggested it needed a Turing-complete language, I'd bolt
Guile onto fetchmail in about a nanosecond.

When you get down to it, POP and IMAP just aren't very complicated.
Because this is true, fetchmail can be both right and *simple*.  The
semantic domain of window-manager configurations, OTOH, is much, much
richer; enough so to suggest such a language.

BTW, if you'd like to join fetchmail-friends and trash my design, feel free.
I'm sure the response from the regulars there would be, hm, well,
"entertaining" is the word that occurred to me second.

False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for
one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because
it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils
except destruction.  The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of
such a nature.  They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined

I won't have to keep them on their toes because they have yet to offer a
compelling reason to bloat the code.  It's interesting to hear someone
that has supposedly pondered the nature of open source criticizing
forks.  When program development doesn't meet the needs of a
significant number of users, it is time to fork.  I believe that
requiring guile will not meet their needs and that users will stick
with an unsupported and undeveloped product instead of "upgrading".

I believe they deserve better than that.

You think it's "peevish" to not want to follow the direction of the
current maintainer of code?  Perhaps you should add that wisdom to your
essays.  "People who don't like the way code is going dare not try to
take it in a different direction."  It will show a whole new side of
you since it contradicts much of what you have written before.

And why would FVWM benefit from Guile?  I have asked that repeatedly and
gotten silly answers.  Since you jumped right on the boat stating it
would be good, please explain what functionality would be added.

Not the general code cleanup that has been done and is sorely needed in
Fvwm, but the linking of Guile (or, for that matter, requiring any
language to be built into the core).

Would you mandate it?  If you did, you can bet people would fork it.

And a WM isn't that complicated.  Some very respectible WM's exist that
have no such language.  WindowMaker, AfterStep, Enlightenment -- none of
which require such a language.

I didn't trash their design: I asked what functionality it would add and
was treated with 'features' like listing all the screen savers for
xlock, moving Netscape windows, and a supposedly smaller footprint. 
The first two are 'features' that are not worth the added size of the
program (and I've seen the first implemented with a shell script and
the second with FvwmScript), and the smaller footprint isn't true.

So precisely, why should I accept more complexity in the program
(certainly adding an interpreter is going to add complexity) instead of
just cleaning up the existing code?

Or is it somehow wrong to actually ask "WHY" before a feature is thrown
in now?

        I've not had time to look into other-proc, but this funcionality has
been available to Fvwm2 users for nearly a year with my StartsOnPage patch.
It's been floating around in Limbo, because Chuck didn't have the time to work
it into a release, but a number of users are quite addicted to the feature.


        But I digress....

        My main reservation about a merger of Scwm and Fvwm is the same
one voiced by Chuck in his parting comments. I think there's a need
for a WM with the capabilities of Fvwm that is stand-alone, not
requiring other large packages to be installed. (I think the cross-
package dependencies are more the issue than the memory/disk footprint.)

        I have both Fvwm and Scwm installed on my personal machine at
home - indeed, I have most of the WM's currently in popular use, and
actually use most of them from time to time - but I might not have
the option of installing Scwm, Guile, et. al. on certain machines at
work, whereas the current Fvwm would be no problem. (If this scenario
sounds familiar to anyone, please speak up!)

        From my own experience, I'd have to agree with Dan's 
observation: I've not felt the need for a "more powerful" configuration
language. However, to play devil's advocate for a moment, I'll concede
a major benefit to be derived from plugging in a "standard" language -
consistency. This is because the existing configuration "language" is 
subject to the whims/inexperience/personality-quirks/whatever of 
whoever is patching in a new primitive when it comes to syntax and 
parsing. This could definitely stand improving.

        I think that the only way a merger can satisfy the needs of
both the self-contained and the extensible-WM camps is with a 
restructuring of the WM into a configuration layer and a core layer,
such that the configuration layer is effectively a plug-in, and does
*not* creep into the core layer. A rigorous layer separation with 
well-defined interface points should allow the core layer to serve 
as a common WM-engine - almost like a toolkit, actually - that could
serve to build both an Scwm and a  conventional guileless Fvwm (with
its existing, though doubtless much-modified, config layer). 

        I know you're going to object that there are certain "core" 
functions that could be better handled in Scheme - and you're probably 
right, but we might want to consider whether that implies that they 
shouldn't really be considered part of the core layer. Also, I don't
suggest that it should be illegal to override a core primitive function
with an extension ("hey, override that core method, Greg, the original 
code really sucks!").

        I may be pipe-dreaming - the two code bases may already have
diverged far enough that this approach is no longer practical - I 
haven't had time to look over the Scwm code in enough detail to judge.
Or, there may not be enough people who agree with this idea. But it'd
sure be nice to have a common base so that both groups wouldn't 
constantly need to be reinventing the others' wheels - like the Great
Style Flag Rewrite, which has long since been done for Scwm.

        Now...time to wade through today's mail and see where this 
thread's gone while I was at work.

It's obviously a ton more general than that.  We've not yet even begun
to scratch the surface of what you can do with our primitives and
infrastructure.

One other remark -- one shouldn't look at guile as just a configuration
language in the same sense as fvwm's language is a configuration
language.  SCWM is exceedingly dynamic, and gets that in part from using
guile.

Read more carefully next time.  You appear to have oversimplified my

That's not my argument.  I think it sounds like a good idea because I
think the existing configuration language is ugly, ad-hoc, and
un-extensible.  As it is, I don't want to touch it.  But I don't have
a specific wish-list of added functions, just a design sense that the
existing language is far too impoverished to really capture the
configuration domain.

OK.  You concede that we need "code cleanup".  Why resist embedding
Guile as a tactic for actually accomplishing this?  There is after all
evidence (in the form of scwm itself, 6K smaller) that the tactic works.

Nope.  I'd probably make Guile and filtering a build-time option.  Not
because I'd fear a fork, but simply for parsimony's sake.

And, IIRC, all of these are "one-true-way" WMs designed to enforce a
single theory of interface-gesture design.  Not analogous to fvwm2 at
all.

I think your premise is wrong and Greg Badros is clearly right about
this issue, if perhaps vulnerable on others.  Embedding Guile will actually
*lower* total complexity by banishing the nasty ad-hoc code that gives
rise to so much of it.

Yesterday I believed this on general design-engineering grounds.  Today
I believe it because I've dipped into the code and configs enough to
see that it's specifically true of scwm.

You aren't going to win the total-complexity argument, because you're
simply wrong there.  You might win the big-footprint, compatibility,
or stability arguments.  I suggest you focus on those.

We concede all of those points (and have from the beginning), knowing
full-well that things are getting better on a daily basis (except,
perhaps for the footprint, which will get lots better down the road a
bit, but is of only tangential concern while we're developing).

No, it's Please Back Things Up With Accurate Data.

I dealt with the Fvwm1.24->2.0 changes long ago.  Change isn't a big
deal.  MANDATING that an interpreter be built into the WM (or anything:
I would be pissed at the Apache Group if they made mod_perl mandatory
and I'm not thrilled that the default vim build will link perl if it
finds it without asking -- I don't use vim, though, so have only griped
about it a couple times) is uneeded.

I have asked for just why this code is needed and been given answers
like "it's not really that much code, and besides it's really SMALLER
now, not bigger!" [which is demonstrably false] or "you could do really
vital things like have a menu item with all of xlock's modes!".

Perhaps you find that a compelling argument to require an extra meg of
RAM, an alpha-level library and all else that goes with it into
something as critical as your window manager.  I don't.

No, it's -20 points for requiring a pointless library, reduced to -19
since at least there's reasonable odds that another application has it
in RAM already.

Sun3's with 16-20M of RAM, SS2's with 64M, and a couple Pentiums with
32-64M.  scwm was noticably slower on them when I tried it in May.  (I
didn't bother trying it on the Sun3's.)

All I ask is that before the RAM footprint is increased by 30%-50% and
performance noticeably affected that some compelling need is shown: 
some real advantage.  Having a pulldown menu with 80 some modes of xlock
ain't it.  Nor is making Netscape's menus start in a fixed location.
Yet those are the reasons given.

Nonsense: I change my configs all the time.  I have built every release
of fvwm2 since 2.0.9, I believe, and have changed my config to deal with
the things that broke at every version.

I have asked for a REASON for this change.  That's hardly non
constructive.  Or is the current trend in development "let's throw all
the crap in we can because some year it may be useful"?   This is not a
minor change: for perspective, it is tripling the effective code size by
linking a library that is twice the size of fvwm2.  So far, there has
been only some pretty silly reasons for such a thing.

If we were talking "lookie, a silly feature that adds 50 lines!" and a
bunch of people thought, "it's stupid, only you will want it", it
could be ifdef'd out.  There is no choice with scwm.  You either load
an extra 370k (again, twice the size of fvwm2:  the number -is-
relevant, in that if fvwm2 were 50M we wouldn't blink at 370k) or you
don't use it.  I wouldn't object to even the stupidest features ("I want
all my menus to print upside down!") being in the distribution as long
as they were trivial to disable for people who didn't want them.  If it
were an .fvwmrc file option ('GoofyMenus On') I wouldn't care much if it
were in the default build: it's only 50 lines, after all, not twice the
size of everything else.

Brady's comments in <t8btqp1zgf.fsf@helvetica.cs.arizona.edu> are on the
mark for the most part.  I think his unnumbered item in the last
paragraph would actually work the best in the long run if it could be
pulled off: not so much with scwm, but with scwm, afterstep, the
abandoned/adopted fvwm95, etc.  It is an incredible waste that AfterStep
(which is actually not a bad WM, though I dislike it's configuration
methods) and others have forked off instead of working on the core and
perhaps enhancing the module API to do what they need.  If he could
bring them back into the fold and enhance the API for modules (or
perhaps as compile/link time modules like Apache modules for better
execution times, or as the same thing but dl'ing like Apache 1.3 for
flexibility) that would be a Good Thing for all the spawns of fvwm.
(Hell, FvwmWharf is stolen from AfterStep and I use it all the time.)

I said as much a couple months ago on the users fvwm list when I asked
what exactly it was missing from the module API that forbade making
'FvwmPerl', 'FvwmPython' and a non-existant Scheme module do
everything that people wanted.  See <19980504151535.D32688@cmc.net>
posted on May 4th.  No direct answers as to what was missing -- just a
long "I want HTML", "I want Scheme", etc thread about what language it
should be, not why it could be less specific.  I asked how embedding
TCL would add anything in <19980429130655.G8755@cmc.net> on April 29th
(no answer).

Again, I have no objection to having hooks for generic module support of
ANY language: if people want to build COBOL into their desktop, that's
fine by me.  I dislike mandating Thou Shalt Link Guile With Thine
Window Manager for such dubious benefits as xlock-menus and fixing
programs that refuse to honor geometry specifications.

Perhaps you should write more clearly then.

You argue that it is 'peevish' to hold your ground on whether or not a
feature should be installed.  I maintain that is the nature of Open
Source, whether it be Linus insisting that certain code won't make it
into the kernel or whether it is the Apache group deciding that NCSA
wouldn't do what they wanted and weren't taking patches so they'd do it
themselves.

Linus has a lot of charisma and so far has not had a serious challenge
to his decisions.  Some year, no doubt, he will, and there will be a
fork, just as the BSD's seem to fork every two years.

Again, I said the same thing two months ago on the users list.  I really
dislike the format of .fvwm2rc (and .fvwmrc, for that matter).  Not in
that they are incapable of doing some impressive things: some of the
configs people have make it clear that with patience modules like
FvwmButtons are amazingly flexibly, including being able to fake the CDE
bar's appearance fairly well.  I dislike them because they are ugly,
rife with +'s and ""'s and other junk.

I won't, however, argue that including an interpreter (again, be it
guile, perl, tcl, python, whetever) in the core is a Good Thing.  It's
certainly a good thing as a module, and modules like FvwmCpp and FvwmM4
show that it's possible to have a module provide config files for the
parent.

It doesn't, however, belong in the core.

No there is no such evidence.  I could trim fvwm2 down to a 10k binary
by dynamically loading the other 160k.  Heck, my perl is only 10k by
that logic, since it uses a dynamic library.  The real footprint is
going to include libguile, as I have no other programs that I use that
require it: the disk space and RAM will not be shared by anything.

'Conceding' a code cleanup is needed is nothing new: it's been known for
years.

So why not in this case?  It's trivial to #ifdef things.  Until the
Great Style Rewrite, lots of things in fvwm2 will be ifdef'd.  That's
not what's being argued for, though.

What's being asked is not parsimony, it's assimilation.  "We want to
call scwm 'fvwm3' and will require linking an interpreter into your core
WM."

It's not "we have cleaned up the core a lot, and even fixed the weird
2-space indents in places, want to merge the cleaned up code back into
the core".  It drags along a hefty price tag in memory, execution and
disk space that you keep ignoring.

Not really, unless you restrict yourself to configuration via menus.
With AfterStep, the scattered remains of .fvwm2rc are even clearly
evident (just scattered amongst piles of directories).  It will still do
most of the fvwm2 things (of a year or so ago, anyway, before their
fork) I've tried, it's just a pain in the rear end to edit a million
files and create files with the name I want appearing in the menu.
As I said, AfterStep is still close enough to Fvwm2 that 'Wharf' works
fine and dandy and is buried the extras directory.  My main objection is
their new-improved-scatter-the-rc code.

Enlightenment is about as far from 'one-true-way' as you can get, in
fact.

I still disbelieve that: when I look at the code, I see that Greg has
done a fine job in cleaning up the patch-after-patch-after-patch that
fvwm2 is.  I don't see the gain from being the linking of Guile.
Perhaps the linking was the motivation, but that's not WHY his code is
cleaner.  If all the guile hooks were removed (or #ifdef'd), the code
would be no more messy except perhaps for the scattered ifdef's.

Are you confusing the "Greg has done a massive cleanup" advantage with
linking in Guile?  The code to interpret configs is not that large a
part of fvwm (we'd have a more readable config format if it was).

All I see is that he has cleaned up the code well.  That is good: but
that doesn't answer whether embedding a language is good.  They are
seperate issues.

Again, for total complexity, you need to include libguile.  You seem to
keep forgetting that it's not a dl-stub, but a genuine library larger
than the code it is being linked to.  Does it really add no complexity
to a program to add an interpreted language?  Then, what the heck, let's
link in libperl, and tcl and python as well: why stop with one, when it
will be no more complex?

Or is your math off?

This is really ripe.  They're (in part, if not in whole) because both I and
the current maintainer of fvwm have expressed dismay at the split and much
interest in the possibility of at least working more closely.

So you're volunteering to head continuing development fvwm2 in the event
that some of the speculation about what might possibly end up being fvwm3
comes true?  I think that's a nice gesture, but we have a long way to go
before it comes to that.  After all, fvwm2 doesn't even exist in a release
form yet.  Or are you saying that you'll split development now if someone
even says that that is the plan for a far future major version increment?

Termcap is needed by some versions of Guile. It's only really needed
if Guile is built to use readline, and if not, it shouldn't even get
paged in.

Note that scwm has had _many_ extra primitives for quite some time
that provide extra features that fvwm does not. Before we added those,
scwm was about 2/3 the size of fvwm in compiled code.

Both these extra primitives and many of the old fvwm builtins will be
moved out of the core once we have our loadable module infrastructure
going, which should be easy - Guile provides near-transparent support
for that.

OK, then -- how would you feel about a design that used Guile to interpret
configs and then threw Guile away?  Would that count as being "in the core"?

Wouldn't accomplish anything, as you correctly point out.  Moving a lot
of the complexity into Guile is a different case -- because the complexity
cost of Guile is somebody *else's* problem, specifically one for the clever 
specialists on the Guile team.  And one of the underappreciated benefits
of code re-use is that when lots of projects depend on a common facility
like Guile, it tends to improve much more rapidly than ad-hoc code would.

I certainly wouldn't be opposed to having "stock" fvwm2 and scwm generated
from the same source base, if that turned out to be possible and that's
what you mean.

Greg doesn't think they're separate.  And since he co-implemented, and
I understand in a general software-engineering way how he might be

        Well, I just fell into using the same term several others have
bandied about, but you're quite right, it's a good deal more. Actually,
even Fvwm's is. What I was describing as the "config" layer is really
more like the command layer, including both the configurational and 
operational directives: relatively static in the case of the present
Fvwm, very fluid in the Scwm implementation.

        But don't forget that both mailing lists are archived on the Web
site at 05:00 each morning, so anyone with a browser can follow the
discussions, subscribed or not. That's often how I catch up on the 
previous evening's goings-on, since I'm not subscribed via my account at
work. It's not quite a private club (nor should it be, IMO).

Would guile be mandatory, or could I preprocess them by hand (or with
another module, or cpp, m4 or even awk?).  If FvwmGuile was akin to
FvwmM4, I'd have no problem with it: it would be purely optional.
I mentiond something similar back in May.  I'd love for menus to be
written something like:

Applications {
     "The Scrape"   =>  /usr/local/bin/netscape,
     "Workman"      =>  /usr/openwin/bin/workman,
etc, with flags and icons and such shoved in in a similar style...
sorta perlish, not really, though, and as long as it wasn't laden
with "" and "+" and "I" and other magic incantations that fvwm2 has,
it would be a Good Thing.

But that complexity adds a layer of confusion.  Try working with a
project like perl's Mail::Cclient.... are problems because of my code,
perl, the modules, or c-client (especially when the developer is working
with a -dev release of perl and I have to use a production version)? 
Or PHP's imap.so, again, using c-client.  Are problems in PHP,
imap.so, or c-client.  (Can you tell I'm playing with IMAP a lot
lately?)

Finger-pointing isn't fun.  (I'm sure Tom Dickey likes that he can
reconcile (vile|lynx)/xterm/ncurses strangeness himself, since he
controls both projects.)   Building projects around -dev code isn't fun.

-dev window managers are dangerous beasts considering the WM's role in
things.

That's exactly what I meant and what I have said for two months.  I'd
even like to see things like more stuff moved into libfvwm and libfvwm
made into a shared library, since there is a lot of duplicated code in
some of the modules (like IconMan has a pile of stuff that is in core:
those who use only core would pay a small cost to move the contents of
icons.c into libfvwm.so and the there would be a savings in IconMan to
share (both on disk and in RAM) the same library.

The current .a file only makes for 'convenience' functions without any
real benefit to the user and still there is tons of duplicated code
in the tree.

It's not about piles of optional extensions, no.  But, then, neither is
a mandatory and very large extension.

He's right in that it was the motivator for cleaning the code.  If the
code wasn't so wierd (2-space tabs at the start of lines, 4 or 8
elsewhere, depending on mood, huge functions that extend for pages that
look awful similar to other functions, macros for skipping white space
in a config file instead of functions, etc) and he didn't want to
implement a lot of changes, he wouldn't have needed the rewrite.

The same general code cleanup is a major reason The Great Style Rewrite
hasn't happened, despite years of knowing it was needed (and tons of
features being left out for lack of bits).  If someone wrote a
way-cool-new-style-flag and was as motivated to get it in as Greg was to
get Guile in, then they would spend the time to clean up the code.

I think scwm was the kick in the pants to make him say "ugh, I need to
clean this mess up before I can do anything with it", not that by
linking in guile the code magically cleaned itself.

Were it that easy, then the Great Style Rewrite would be done and we'd
have clean code.

Then why don't you solve the problem by hacking the scwm code base so
it can be built sans guile, rather than haring off in another direction
with code you admit is ugly and ad-hoc?

I haven't said where the first release would come from: just that it
would retain the functionality of fvwm2 without mandating Guile.  I
would even like to snarf code from AfterStep (excluding their
config-directory code): I like their pinnable menus, for example,
and the texture of their menus would make a nice option.

Afterstep is nice and compact, too.

Not in SCWM (that's not to say that it couldn't be done that way, but
that's not how things work for us).  In particular, primitives in scwm
are more truly primitives.  Scheme code then builds on top of the
primitives useful functionality that fvwm2 had as primitives.  e.g., the 
window list code is a Scheme procedure in SCWM, but was a native C
primitive in fvwm2.  The advantage:  The end user can customize
virtually anything about the window list w/o mucking with the C code.
fvwm2 is #ifdef-fed to death.  We use very few ifdefs in SCWM, and then
only in reasonably structured ways.

This is certainly true.  Building SCWM has an extra dependence that
fvwm2 doesn't have, but in general the stable releases build cleanly and 
are configure based (this only recently happened to fvwm2 and still
isn't mainstream I believe).

Debugging SCWM can be harder, but things will get better as Guile
becomes more stable.  Evolving with an evolving language has its
down-sides, but the guile folks are great, and development is active, so 
we know it's well worth our while.

It really did work *both* ways.  The cleanup that guile gave us for free 
was more closely observed by Maciej, as he did the original embedding of 
guile.  One simple example of how guile simplified a *lot* of code was
in the arguments to the primitives.  fvwm2 primitives each parse their
own arguments, sometimes using one of a bunch of somewhat standard
functions, sometimes in completely ad-hoc ways.  This makes the
configuration language far less uniform and understandable.  All of the
ugliness is take care of for us in SCWM, and our primitives are shorter
and more readable.

OK folks, here's my take on this:

Lets get Fvwm2 out first.

Then we can each figure out wether to go with Fvwm or Scwm.  I don't
think Scwm should be renamed Fvwm3 it's just going to be too different. 
>From my perspective the config language is the main feature of a window
manager after all most of them can cope with moving and iconifying
windows, their strengths and weaknesses lie in the users ability to
control the way in which their windows work.  I moved to fvwm from
mwm/dtwm because I couldn't get them to manage the focus in the way I
wanted.  Fvwm is better but not exactly what I want. What I really want
is to be able is to be able to write high level code that can get at the
window manager's state and window lists.  I'll probably move to scwm
when I get the time.

Cheers,
Tim.

I like the vi vs. vim vs. emacs analogy. vi and emacs represent

Reversing feature creep is very hard. At the very least, it is cruel
to tell people who like the new features (I'd suggest decors and
window shading are two examples of fairly grafted on features, and I
know that people do use them) that they are going away and the
featureful version will no longer be maintained.

First off, I'd like to suggest that using Scheme is not so bad. On a
superficial level, you could easily write a scwmrc that would look
like an almost literal transliteration of an fvwmrc, with a pair of
parentheses around each line. For example, if I write:

(menu-style #:fg "white" #:bg "blueviolet" #:stipple "blue")
(menu-style #:font "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")

(title-style #:font font12 #:justify 'left)

(window-style "*" #:fg "white" #:bg "navy" #:icon "unknown1.xpm")
(window-style "*" #:border-width 6 #:focus 'mouse
              #:random-placement #t #:smart-placement #t)

(bind-mouse 'title 1 interactive-move) 

I think anyone familiar with the fvwmrc language will know exactly
what this means. In fact, I claim this is actually _more_ readable and
understadable than the fvwmrc equivalent. That could be just because
I've been smoking too much Scheme, but I don't think so.


Second, I think it is quite possible that the majority of people will
not need to touch Scheme. I have four reasons for saying this (2 of
which are our vaporware, and 1 of which is someone else's vaporware,
so apply the appropriate weighting factor to those):

* Many people don't really touch the fvwmrc language as it is. Mostly,
they take what they're given, possibly frobbing the colors and
key/mouse bindings by finding where they are in the file and replacing
them.

* I believe it is possible to write an on the fly fvwmrc translator so
you can just write an fvwmrc in the fvwm2 format, possibly with some
extensions and have access to extra features. Right now, the focus is
on a one-time translator, but I'm perfectly willing to look into an
on-the-fly version if there is a lot of demand.

* We plan to have a GUI configuration that will let users set things
like visual appearance and mouse and key bindings without having to
touch _any_ config files. As soon as we have loadable Gtk and/or Tk
support in the config file (I'm working on both), this should be
pretty easy.

* Guile wants to ultimately be a multi-langauge extension language
through the use of translators. There is already a language with a
C-like syntax that users can use, although with some hassle. When it
stabilizes a bit more, we will start providing example scwmrcs in the
C-syntax format to ensure that this functionality works and is
convenient with scwm. The same will be done for other language
translators that become avialable (Perl, Python, Tcl and emacs-lisp
are among those planned). 

Some people may claim translators for real languages will never
happen, or that when they do they will be unacceptably slow. As to the
first point, I think it underestimates the tenacity of GNU hackers. In
fact, I will personally work on a Tcl translator if I don't see one
otherwise happen fast enough. As for the second, someone has already
written a version of Tcl that translates to a different dialect of
Scheme which runs faster than the original Tcl. Python is also not
exactly a super-fast language as is either. Perl is fairly fast, but I
think it is possible to come within 2x for most tasks through
translation. It will probably be necessary to steal the existing Perl
parser for this, though, as I don't believe the Perl syntax is well
enough specifi{ed,able} for an independent reimplementation.



I'd also like to suggest an option #4, which has some elements of both
#2 and #3 above.  This is to continue to maintain fvwm2 well after the
first official stable release is out, perhaps effectively in
perpetuity, and at some point also begin work on an fvwm 3.x that has
an extension language. This is for the moment putting aside concerns
about _which_ extension language (though I clearly have a personal
preference).

I disagree with this assertion. I think the time when we "settle down"
as you put it is perhaps some time off, since there are a number of
facilities we want to reorganize before we will feel comfortable
enough with the extension interface's stability to call a release
"1.0". But once that time arrives, I think we will be prepared to step
back and examine what needs to be in the release, and to seriously
consider backward compatability when making changes. Indeed, probably
_the_ major reason we have been in pre-releases for some time, and
will probably continue to be for some time, is that this way, we feel
no moral imperative to be backwards-compatible with old releases. This
is crucial because we _know_ some of the APIs as they stand are just
not right.

In any case, I think comparisons to the Gimp might be appropriate. For
a long time people thought that there'd never be a Gimp 1.0 and that
if there were, it would ccontinue to be a fairly crashy program with a
rapidly changing feature set and interface, and a host of possibly
broken extensions. But the Gimp team proved as capable of stabilizing
the program's interface, fixing the major bugs, and removing the
extensions that were just not ready for prime time, and came out with
a very nice release indeed, even if it took them a while.

I think the same thing will happen with scwm, whether or not a merge
with fvwm happens.

I agree with that in principle, although actual literal code migration
is becoming more and more non-trivial.

Oddly enough, the one category of post I have not seen yet (maybe
because I haven't read all of yesterday's mail on the archive yet) is
"I do want an extension language but not Scheme, anything but Scheme!"

This is especially odd, because these are the people I most wanted to
hear from, to see if there was a way to deal with their concerns.

The important and useful code in fvwm is, IMO, the large library of
window management builtins, along with the code that manages the basic
window data structures. As fvwm now stands, this code is not very easy
to reuse - each builtin takes the rest of the line it was on as a
string and does the parsing itself. Scwm has managed to separate the
parsing from the builtins themselves, but it's made everything
dependent on Guile's data types instead.

The module interface is somewhat less important when you have an
extension language, and it can also reasonably be implemented _in_ the
extension language itself (which is what we have for scwm). OTOH, it
would certainly be useful for window managers that differ only on look
& feel but have no real extension language to be able to share modules.

This option sounds good to me.  As everyone has observed: there is far too
much crud in the current sources. 

There were a couple of reasonable posts in the last 24 hours or so
advocating a cleaned-up core (preferrably in a shareable object) and
shoving all the "configuration" or "command" functionality into a second
layer built on top of the core. 

To my mind, it would be great if fvwm2 and scwm shared the same core.  I
can imagine having in the future, an fvwm2 binary linked to libfvwm, and
having an scwm binary linked to the *same* libfvwm, as well as to
libguile. 

Since the scwm folks have already gone through a "crud-reducing" phase
with fvwm sources, it would be nice to harness their expertise while doing
the same with the current fvwm sources.  There was one claim that they had
gotten the scwm binary down to 2/3 the fvwm2 size by cleaning up the code. 
I suggest that fvwm2 concentrate on the same task.  I realise that some of
the "savings" were derived from pushing the functionality into libguile,
and thus illusory.  Yet, it seems clear to me that there is much to gain
from a careful re-engineering of the sources.

To echo the point that grafting guile into fvwm was an impetus to cleaning
up the code: as I was trying to put the sources under autoconfigure, I had
to look at small bits of the sources.  I found some rather amazing coding
practices, such non-void functions that sometimes didn't return a value! 
(And yet, the return value was used by some of the function's callers)
There are many things that compiling with "gcc -Wall" would point out in a
millisecond.  I fixed the ones that I found, but the changes got lost as
the 2.0.47 versions were not based on the autoconfigured code.

Everyone agrees that scwm & guile are not stable enough for general usage. 
I can't see the gain in radically changing the direction and size of fvwm
to accommodate some alpha-quality interpreter.  I'm not interested in
claims that guile will be "lean and mean" at some unspecified time in the
future.  Such claims have to be viewed skeptically --- not that I doubt
the sincerity of the proponents, but what piece of software *ever* got
smaller? 

I do see gain in building a compact core of wm functions, to be used with
both fvwm2 or scwm.  Moreover, the process of teasing apart the "core" and
"command/configure" layers will be akin to what scwm did.  Hence, a
similar amount of cleanup and bugfixing should occur.

We want to do both of these things anyway, although your phrasing it
this way implies a much higher level of priority and a higher degree
of robustness and completeness.

I have to agree on this point and strongly emphasize it. Guile is
maintained by a group of people who are really smart about language
design and implementation. There are also a number of projects that
depend on Guile enough that people actively report Guile bugs, send
patches, and make actual improvements to the core that enhance Guile
in numerous ways. 

Furthermore, the Guile developers place a high priority on supporting
apps that use Guile. In particular, they have been very willing to fix
bugs for us and to listen to our feature requests and architectural
suggestions, even when these were things that were important for scwm
but perhaps not crucial for Guile per se. I can only imagine the level
of responsiveness increasing if fvwm and scwm merged, resulting in a
project that both worked the guile core really hard and had a really
high profile.

Although upward compatibility would obviously be essential, I am
unsure if this specific way of stating it (run through a link called
fvwm2 and get fvwm2 behavior) is necessarily the greatest thing. I say
this not because I don't think it's feasible, but because I think
people who want something that looks acts and feels just like fvwm2
should consider just using fvwm2. There's still a lot of people who
use fvwm1 because it better meets there needs. Of course, it is
possible that a guilified fvwm will be able to do everything fvwm2
does, only better, including the typical use memory footprint. In this
case, a very close emulation mode would be worth cconsidering.

Well, that's the way the initial version will work, at least.

The implication is quite intentional.  That priority and robustness
and completeness is the freight I believe you will have to pay (and
*should* have to pay) for actually becoming fvwm3.  Politically, if
not technically.

You have a basic decision to make.  Are you serious about world
domination?  Do you really want to become the mainstream of fvwm
development, and capture the fvwm name and associated reputation?
Then I don't think you can duck, dodge, or temporize away this
requirement.

So far, you and Greg have been very convincing in arguing the
increased elegance and flexibility of scwm and the superior
cleanliness of the scwm code.  You're vulnerable on three other
issues; stability, footprint, and compatibility.

My take is that you can get away with handwaving at most one of these.
If you try to fudge two or more, the fvwm2 community will likely yawn
and invite you to piss off -- *and be right to do so*.

You can't nail down the stability issue, not with Guile still in alpha.
You score at best a draw on footprint, depending on whether your
audience is willing to consider libguile a `sunk cost' like libc.

Therefore, you *must* nuke the compatibility problem.  It's the only
way you have to show the fvwm2 people you're serious about holding
up your end of a merge.

I realize that it was intentional, and I accept that in case of a
merge that your phrasing and it's implication are correct. In other
words, I personally accept these burdens. I think Greg will also agree
that these are fair requirements for a merge. My point was just that
these are things we are doing already, and accepting this burden only
means raising the priority relative to other things.

Please note that I did not say that it was technically infeasible or
even difficult. In fact, with a comple fvwmrc translator and 100%
compatible module interface (something that did not happen on either
count for the fvwm1 -> fvwm2 scwitch!), both of which I fully accept
need to happen, this is a matter of adding on the order of 10 lines of
C code to check argv[0] and run some special code if it equals
"fvwm2". So I have no desire to dodge this part of the requirement in
the sense of not wanting to put in the work. 

I just question whether on technical grounds, the specific issue of
having an "fvwm2" symlink is technically a good idea (for reasons
stated in my previous message). In fact, I almost decided not to raise
this nitpick for fear of being misconstrued as I seem to have been,
i.e. as ducking the necessity of 100% total backward compatibility.

I agree with all this, except that <nitpick>Guile is not still in
alpha, it is in heavy development between releases, but that is a
different issue.</nitpick>

But, I think it is fair to say about all three of all these issues
that we are working on them, and commit to serious improvement. Scwm
is in a phase of development where, for most of the current users,
adding features, fixing bugs and cleaning up the code are much more
important than backwards compatibility, stability (in the sense of
interfaces not changing as opposed to the sense of few bugs - scwm is
less buggy than some theoretically more mature window managers) or
resource consumption. But as the development cycle progresses, all of
these issues will be afressed on way or another. In case of a merge,
they will all get much higher priority earlier on.

In any case, I am already working on a fvwmrc->scwmrc translator, and
improvements to the fvwm2 module compatibility code are being worked
on by several people, including me. In fact, one person who just sent
me patches expressed the desire to personally enhance the code to be
able to run all exisiting fvwm modules perfectly.

In the FvwmIdent directory, are 2 spurious files:

FvwmIdent-de.c
FvwmIdent-foo.c

I haven't looked closely yet, but I assume they are the result of some
patches I  sent Chuck.  Basically I  patched FvwmIdent so I could test
the "aspect ratio" problem.

The testing part  should NOT be  added  to FvwmIdent.   I also patched
FvwmIdent to show the  aspect ratio if a window   calls for it.   That
part SHOULD be added to FvwmIdent.

It should be trivial to extract whats needed, but if needed, I'll post
some patches for this as soon as I get around to it.

I haven't determined  why,  but I normally  invoke FvwmIdent  thru the
keybinding:

Key F3          A       M       Module FvwmIdent

Starting with 2.0.47,  I have to hold  down Meta-F3 to see the window.
As soon as I release the key, the window closes.

It sounds to me as though most of the discussion is really concentrated on
a couple of points,

 1. Since to some it sounds like SCWM is the future of where FVWM ought to
    be headed, the SCWM guys (with some FVWM blessing) have been asked to
    come on the mailing list and make their case

 2. The concerns that have been noted are
    a. RAM  memory footprint
    b. disk memory footprint
    c. ease of coding (extensibility)
    d. cleaner interface (primitives)
    e. usefulness ?

Let me first start by saying that I am an avid Fvwm-1/2 user and have been for
the past 3-4 years.  I love Fvwm, but lack the necessary C-skills (and time)
to really delve into the code (alas, I've made suggestions in the past, asked
questions, assisted a few people, etc) -- I keep up by reading the archives on
an almost daily basis.

So I'm your typical user that wants to be involved, but stays in the shadows.

Let me address each point noted above separately (for whatever that's worth)

 1.  I don't have a problem with this point

 2a. Fvwm has _always_ prided itself on having a really small RAM footprint
     (regardless of RAM cost :-) and that is really important to alot of
     people (it usually translates to speed, etc).  The SCWMers have noted
     that Guile is in needed fat as is SCWM code TODAY and that they are
     willing to do their part to slim it down.  Guile is planned to slim
     a bit (I wouldn't hold my breath, but at least the issue is on the
     table).
  b. This really shouldn't be of much concern since we are talking about
     Kbytes that don't amount to much anyway.
  c.
  d. SCWMer have repeatedly expressed that they have a cleaner framework in
     place which certainly leads to cleaner/easier code - I'm not about to
     refute any of this since I haven't delved into the code in any great
     lengths (but what I've seen seems the to be the definition of ad-hoc).
     It sounds as though one will have a greater deal of control of the
     interworking of the WM with a more robust config language (again I
     don't know anything about Guile)
  e. Ah, the clincher !!  Is this at all useful or is it just plain 'old
     COOL to do ?  Now, I haven't really read anyone say anything that made
     me go "wow, that would be nice to do, but damn it Fvwm doesn't allow me
     to do it".  To be open minded, we don't know what we (FVWMer users) are
     missing until we are told that one can do this, that and the other
     (that's when ideas and options seem to abound)

OK, what does this all mean.  From my prospective here's how I look at it,

1. Let's get Fvwm-2.1 OUT
2. Let's have "The Great Style Rewrite" done with
3. Let's restructure the WM into a configuration layer and a core layer
   (per Bob Woodside's <proteus@pcnet.com> suggestion)
4. Let's have the SCWM guys spend more time and effort on memory footprint
5. If scwm's (including Guile) footprint is acceptable AND it mimics _all_ of
   Fvwm functions AND its as fast as FVWM, then I think the decision would
   pretty simple :-)

Again, I might be naive in saying what I said or in over simplifying life, but
that's my take on this.

Questions/Requests:
  + Could an SCWMer post an example of their .scwmrc file (for comparison) ?
  + I'm curious about what SCWM can do today (or in the future) that wouldn't
    be possible under FVWM ?
  + One thing to note is, in what ways will the end-user have to adapt or
    change to start using SCWM (if it were to be fvwm3) ?

I don't think my first attempt to sub to this list worked, as I
haven't gotten a flood of mail from it (in fact, nothing). I just now
subbed again, and I think it worked this time. So I won't be seeing
today's earlier messages until tomorrow, in case anyone wonders about

Okay, finally nailed it.... :)

There's a long standing core-dumping evil bug in FvwmAudio that I
finally nailed with Bounds Checking:

FvwmAudio.c:436:Bounds error: illegal pointer used in pointer arithmetic.

That of course, is bad.

The code (with line numbers)
434             while (1)
435             {
436                 if ((count = read(fd[1],header,
437                                   HEADER_SIZE*sizeof(unsigned long))) <= 0)
438                     done(0);

and the fun one from backtrace:

#5  0x804953c in Loop (fd=0x2074736f) at FvwmAudio.c:436

That's 'ost ' on an Intel bass-ackwards chip: looks like a stack
smashing.

A bit of digging near &fd and I see:
0xbffff6a0 <_serv_stayopen+3086390984>:  "`\013\bNetscape: FAQ: If the
IP address or host name of a name server needs to be changed, do all the
domains and network r"

There's the 'ost ' as part of 'host name'.

So, I dig around a bit more:

(gdb) print &fd
$10 = (int **) 0xbffff734
(gdb) print &body
$11 = (long unsigned int (*)[24]) 0xbffff698

Hrrrm... looks like body is overflowing.  There should be a check in
FvwmAudio (and probably elsewhere) to make sure the reported body_length
is < MAX_BODY_SIZE... but then we'll have to resync somehow, which will
be fun, no doubt.

Or it could get rid of that pesky fixed size buffer that will break on
long names, which is probably the best bet.

It looks like the code in FvwmEvent to discard the body will fail on
this as well: it will require a buffer large enough to hold the longest
window title possible because it keeps changing the offset into body[]
instead of really discarding the data.  Or it should have a patch like
the one below for FvwmAudio...

> Still a bunch of bugs to fix.

Yep.

Not to interrupt the flow of scwm mail.
But has anyone else seen a coredump in fvwm2
I built -g and the best I get is a SIGKILL in a _signotifywiat and a core
file. 

I've got
SunOs 5.5.1
Sparc Ultra 1
FvwmCommand
FvwmIconMan
FvwmButtons
FvwmPager
running.

and the core file is from fvwm2 to itself not the modules

Please send any replies to root@garbled.net, or this list.. I cannot receive
mail at the address listed in the reply-to.

I don't normally read this mailing list, nor any FVWM mailing list.. as a
matter of fact, I just kind of wandered into it on the FTP site, and was
wondering if there was any development still going on.  (You would never know
from the web page)

Now I see this scheme thing..  My first gut response to things like scwm
is pretty simple.. "Ack, I don't want to learn a new language, I just want
a WM."  There is an initial "fear" that a user will have when faced with a
language embedded configuration method.  And you cannot reasonably blame them.
Alot of the examples they see involve complex constructs that they can't
possibly make out. Sure you can make the point that it's really not that much
harder than the current .rc file is to configure, and you are probably right.
But the fear factor is a big deal..

Now to take it a step further, and have all this guile interpreter stuff in
the code.  Sure, thats a win for some people.  The idea that you can
reconfigure your menus, and have it take effect on the fly might be great.
It's not for me.  I use fvwm2 at work and at home.  At work I have a very
stripped down, basic configuration, with some very simple bindings.  Basicly
something I could do with 1.24 if it wasn't for the use of IconMan.

At home I use the same thing pretty much, except it uses more colors.

I don't like, or even *use* the menus.  At home, there are about 10-20
applications I use regularly, and I launch those from Wharf. (ripped right
out of afterstep, works fine)  I use a menu at work to lauch xterms to other
machines..  something that can be pretty much hardcoded (and is)

What is the gain to me of having guile float around my memory?  The *only*,
and let me stress _only_ reason I use fvwm, is that I like keybindings, and
the ability to make the borders look like I want them to.  As a matter of
fact, I've tossed around the idea of ripping 1.24 apart and throwing in some
of the toys from Afterstep, Fvwm2, and the like, and stripping out the rest
of the cruft.  All I want is a windowmanager with a pager, keybindings, and
a configurable border style and buttons.  If applications like Wharf and
FvwmButtons could be fixed enough that they were just normal X-apps, and would
work under any WM.. I would be a really happy fellow.

Someone else mentioned something about the BSD's breaking apart.  (A comment I
resent being actively involved with NetBSD) The reason the BSD's broke apart,
is because developers had significantly different ideas of what direction
the project should take.  This is a problem you might be hitting right this
second. You will never make users like me happy, who want static, simple
environments that do exactly what they want it to do, and have very little
cruft.  (Everyone's idea of cruft will be different) If you bring guile in,
you are liable to lose every user who doesn't want to use the features, and
thus the bloat of guile.  They certainly won't be staying with the old fvwm2,
because noone is supporting it anymore. They will look elsewhere.

So that leaves you with two options.  
1) Split.  Not allways a bad option, except you will eventually be unable 
to share code, and development will be slower on both fronts.
2) Merge, but keep the code ifdeffable.  This means you need to be able to
compile with -DNO_GUILE_EXTENSIONS and get a sane usable window manager out
of it.

Let me stress, that staying split, and then turning around and adding if/else
and variables to the parser, is rediculous.  If you want launguage features,
add the language.  Don't stay split, and then peice together your own 
language over the next 3 years.  Because eventually someone will want a for 
loop, or a case statement, or whatever.. and then what?

Thanks for listening to my little tirade.  I'm just a user here.  I certainly
am not going to side with anyone, or even have an ongoing discussion about
it with people..  I just wanted to make an outside ovservation/opinion 
to the relvant people.

I've got a problem with iconifying windows using a mouse button that
doesn't happen with a key press.

I bind mouse button 3 on the border to the function my_iconify and I
bind the keypad_decimal key to the same function:

Key KP_Decimal WTSF N my_iconify
Mouse 3 TSF A my_resizeiconify

AddToFunc my_resizeiconify
+			"M" Resize
+			"C" my_iconify

AddToFunc my_iconify	"I" Iconify 1
+			"I" my_prev

AddToFunc my_prev	"I" Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_previcon

AddToFunc my_previcon	"I" Prev [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_home

my_home warps the cursor into an FvwmButtons and my_focus raises and
focuses to the selected window.

What all this is supposed to achieve is that when I iconify a window the
focus moves to the previous window in the stack or to an icon if there
are no windows open (and the FvwmButtons if there are no icons).

This works fine from the key binding but with the mouse binding
something goes awry with the ordering of events.  The last window on a
desk cannot be iconified (well, it looks like it gets iconified and then
my_prev finds that window and runs my_focus which deiconifies it) and
sometimes whene ther are more than one window on the screen the wrong
window gets iconified (very annoying).  It feels like the first line of
my_prev is finding the last uniconified window on the screen and
focusing to it even though my_iconify has just iconified it.  The weird
thing is that it only fails if a mouse button is used.  The iconifying
of the wrong window might be related to the "Prev ... my_focus" moving
the focus before the Iconify 1 takes effect so it probably is one bug

Any ideas what changed between 2.0.46 and 2.0.47d that might be
involved?

Cheers,
Tim.

And the confusion... fvwm 2.* could be newer than 3.* ... hm.. no
thanks..

I'm against a merge.. I tried scwm a month ago or so.. (0.7 I think),
but it was far too slow for me.. (usually on pretty slow sun-machines,
50/50 running remote as well)

Also, I really don't like guile/scheme/lisp... Lemme quote tcsh:
"Too many ('s." 8)

I haven't studied the problem, the bad command stood out.

I tried it with the command on the same line as the AddToFunc and it
made no difference.  There really does seem to be a problem with Iconify
followed by Prev in which the Prev finds the iconified window even
though it shouldn't.  I expanded the functions to give the following
test:

AddToFunc my_resizeiconify "C" Current [!FvwmButtons] Iconify 1
+ "C" Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk] Focus
+ "C" Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk] Raise
+ "C" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] Prev [Iconic CurrentDesk] Focus
+ "C" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] Prev [Iconic CurrentDesk] Raise
+ "C" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] None [Iconic CurrentDesk] Next
[FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Focus

When there is more than one window on the current desk this works fine. 
Lines 2 & 3 get executed and the focus moves. When there is just one
non-iconic window on the current desk lines 2 & 3 should get skipped and
lines 4, 5 & 6 should get executed.  This doesn't happen, instead the
focus is set to the window which was just iconified.  I don't know
wether the iconification happens or not, it is too fast.

The weird thing is that if the above function is called from a keypress
(with the "C"'s replaced with "I"'s) it works fine.  If called from a
mouse button with "I"'s instead of "C"'s the iconification happens but
the focus doesn't get moved.

My head hurts,
Tim.

implemented.
