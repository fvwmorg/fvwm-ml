According to a comment in placement.c:

  Transients go on the same desk as their parents.

So, did that actually happen to you or is it just a safety patch?

It's never happened to me but dtpad reuses its windows and you can get
the find/change dialog popping up on another desk, It's not being
created on another desk just re-mapped. It's so annoying that I've made
FvwmEvent move it to the current desk.

It's a safety patch, you never know someone might move a transient to
another desk and close it, e.g. the netscape preferences window is a
transient for the netscape window that you called it from but you might
want to see the effect it has on another netscape window on another
desk.

Cheers,
Tim.

Okay, I'll apply the patch shortly, but please remember to provide
ChangeLog entries too (not for this patch, I've already written
one).

Is the behavior that when you have scrolling off (EdgeScroll 0 0) you 
still scroll when dragging windows normal?  i.e. set the edgescroll 0 
0, grab a window, and it still moves to the next desk.  Not a bad 
behavior sometimes, but annoying with VNC or multiple heads at times.

Thanks,
Nils.

Yes.  To disable this you have to add

  EdgeResistance 10000 10000

to your config file.

I consider all these fixed.

Are there any focus problems remaining to be fixed?

There is a small current Wait problem: in the Wait state if you delete a
window and then switch desk and return to the original desk, you see the
frame of previously deleted window, moving such unshaded frame "deletes"
it again until a new switch of desks. This only happens in functions:

  AddToFunc TestFunction I Wait "unexisting window"
  TestFunction

It is ok by me if this problem is not fixed. Ctrl-Alt-Esc fixes this well.

Mikhael.

There's still (cvs as of now) problems with focus in Nautilus.. I've
been busy+++ lately, but I will have spare time to spend now.. It
doesn't get any focus..

There is also a problem when an app sets it's (GNOME) WM layer before
the window is shown. It then sets a property on the window which level
it's supposed to be on, but it doesn't get read by fvwm it seems...
I see the code in gnome.c and style.c to read it, but I don't know which
order stuff is happening/supposed to happen, so it's a bit hard...

Attached is a test program written in gtk/xlib...
create some windows on layer 4 and then start the program.. one of the
windows is supposed to land on layer 3 (below the others).. then you can
raise/lower it with the up/down buttons..

If given any argument to the program, it will show (map) the window
before trying to set the layer which makes it end up on the correct
layer directly (almost.. you can see it starting infront of the windows,
then jumping back)

I though Dominik fixed this... Did not the Nautilus author plan to fix
this in Nautilus too without using rare ICCCM features?

1) There is a typo in the program, so it can't be compiled without a fix,
the variable "level" should be replaced with "layer" globally.

2) To compile it: gcc -o winhints `gtk-config --cflags --libs` winhints.c

3) I can't reproduce any problem with this program, it works just well
with or without arguments. Of course it is not consistent because it
first requests to place itself to "layer-1" and then to "layer".
But if you patch the program to replace "layer-1" with "layer" it will
become consistent.

A note, it is intended that a window is lowered in FVWM when it changes a
layer, say from 5 to 4, and raised - when changes a layer from 3 to 4.

% gtk-config --version
1.2.10

Am I missing something?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry.. I was quite tired when I sent this and I made some last second
changes without compiling..

Ok, I made some more changes to make it consistent now. The point is: It
doesn't matter what layer I request if I do it _before_ mapping the
window. Fvwm will still put it on the default layer. If you want to put
it behind everything (like the nautilus background thingie), you don't
want it to first cover the entire screen then pop back below everything.

There seems to be code to read that stuff when the window is mapped, but
I suppose it's called in the wrong order or something.

How to reproduce stuff:
1) compile with $CC -o winhints `gtk-config --cflags --libs` winhints.c
2) make a window cover most of the screen so there will be overlapping
3) run winhints .. if your normal layer is 4 (which is default), then the
  larger of the windows from 'winhints' should be below the window from 2) 
  but that doesn't happen.
4) Click on "Same" which will set the layer to layer 2 again but by
   sending an event this time, now it pops down to layer 2.
5) Clicking on up/down will raise/lower the window as expected.

If you give any arguments to winhints, it will first map the window,
then set the layer.. so it will appear at the default layer, then pop
back to layer 2.

You forgot to remind me to be less sleepy when sending in stuff :)

As I already said I can't reproduce this. With no arguments the window
is initialy placed on the layer 2, with arguments it is iniatily placed
on layer 4 and then immediately switches to layer 2, as expected.

In case I am not clear, the button "Same" never does anything for me
if I don't press other buttons.

I can reproduce what you say only if I have this (and this is expected):

  Style winhints Layer 4

BTW, this style option Layer once set can't be disabled without Restart...

Regards,
Mikhael.

Gah. I'm such a moron!
Guess what 'Style "*"           Layer 4' does? *smacks himself*

Ok, it wasn't a bug in fvwm, it was a bug in me :) Thanks Mikhael..

The focus stuff in nautilus still remains though.. (even with only
built-in settings :)

The one that Paul (PDS) reported with in conjunction with
FvwmAuto.  Of course I still hope he'll provide some more details.

Well, it's hard to fix without any feedback ;-)  I fixed the
problem with the "Globally Active" focus model.  I can't test

Fvwm does not honour GNOME hints, only GNOME client messages.  No
need to test code that is never compiled.

Is there anything we will do about the FvwmIconMan pipe problem?
It crashes quite often and I have no idea how to fix this or even
why it happens at all.

I know.. I've been quite busy (2-3 week old mailboxes etc..), but that's
over now...

There's no change now, it still won't get focus.. but if I do 'Style "*"
Lenience', it works just fine.. I'll dig into these problems with the
almighty printf() when I get home...

Yes, I think so.  I got it running too, but I do not get any of

This is not fully correct, the error message on Style Layer with no
argument was misleading. Fixed.

I posted this on May 1:

  OK, I think I have more details.  If I have mouse-2 bound to my
  Iconify-and-Compact function:

    AddToFunc Iconify-and-Compact
    +       "C" Iconify
    +       "C" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

    Mouse 2         I       A       Function Iconify-and-Compact

  then I see this behavior.  It's very easy to reproduce; create an icon
  box like "IconBox 2 -20 -1 -1", for example (I don't use any of the
  module icon managers, just the builtin IconBox).  Now place an xterm
  over the icon box.  Then iconify the xterm.  Then click mouse-2 on the
  xterm's icon in such a way that the window will appear underneath your
  mouse cursor when it de-iconifies, even if you don't move it (the
  mouse).

  If I change mouse-2 to run just "Iconify", I can't make it happen
  anymore.

  So, maybe this behavior is no longer supported?  It used to work until
  fairly recently; someone on the workers list suggested it (although I
  checked and it's not listed in the FAQ).

I never heard anything so I assumed it was expected behavior.

Oops, I didn't see this before my previous response.  I'll try it
again.  When I posted this I changed my keybindings, because it was too
annoying, so I don't know if it doesn't work.

I'll try it again.

OK, I just finished configuring my laptop (I'm on vacation :).

This behavior still occurs with the latest CVS as of a few minutes ago.

FvwmAnimate doesn't matter (I thought it did, but it was just a way of
getting the cursor to the spot where the window will pop up before it
actually gets there, on a fast machine.  You can reliably do the same
thing by putting the window in the space where the icon will be when you
iconify it, so you just click to de-iconify and you don't even have to
move the mouse at all).  I have it off now and it still happens.

FvwmAuto does make a difference, in this way: if I don't have FvwmAuto
enabled, then even a simple de-iconify, without the compact part of the
function (i.e., just "Mouse 2 I A Iconify") _does not_ give focus to the
new window, even though it appears below the mouse.  Also the
Iconify-and-Compact function doesn't, either.

If FvwmAuto _is_ on, then if I have the simple (no compact) setting,
then the de-iconified window gets focus; as before if the
Iconify-and-Compact function is used, then it doesn't get focus.

I'll try to do some debugging on this tomorrow night; it's late and I
need to be up for more diving tomorrow :).  It seems like the debugging
will be annoying: to trigger the bug I need a number of steps and it's
hard to know which causes which messages; I may need to fire up Xnest
and run fvwm in the debugger.

I think just tracing which windows get EnterNotify and LeaveNotify
events and recording what fvwm does in response may provide enough
info.

Paul, since you reported this I made several patches that may or
may not have fixed this.  Can you please try again?  If it still
does not work, could you please see, if fvwm gets an EnterNotify
on the window, and if it does, at which place it leaves the
HandleEnterNotify() function.  I guess it has something to do with
my code to ignore EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events triggered by
grabbing the pointer.  And please check if the problem persists
if you disable FvwmAnimate or FvwmAuto or both.

Bye

fvwm doesn't seems too support more than 5 mouse buttons, or at least
the parser doesn't allow number greater than 5; or it is quiet common
now to find mouses with 6 or 7 buttons (2 for the wheels, 3 buttons,
and 1 or 2 thumb buttons)

The error message is:
[FVWM][ParseBinding]:<<ERROR>>Illegal mouse button in line 6 R A
GnomeButton

This is because X itself does not support correctly more than 5 mouse
buttons as may be verified in X11/X.h file.

I should add that although fvwm does a good thing to ensure that all
buttons work correctly and fully, this check is a bit too conservative.

If you remove this check (button > NUMBER_OF_MOUSE_BUTTONS), and then
use this command to map buttons 123 to other values, say, 159:

  xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 5 9"

you will see that all "I" functions and many complex functions bound on
mouse button 9 work. However there are "small" problems, although "C", "H"
and "D" work acceptably ok, "M" is considered to be "C". Also "Mouse 9 W"
does not work in xterm (it works in xcalc), because xterm is, like FVWM,
also too conservative and does not accept buttons greater than 5.

I myself have a mice with 8 buttons (2 wheels and one thumb, 3 + 2*2 + 1),
I can configure X to recognize them all, but this has its own problems,
so I ended up to define only 5 (both wheels behave as one), that works
with no problems.

Since more than 5 mice buttons can't work fully in the current X, I leave
it up to Dominik to decide whether it is good to enable for users to use
more buttons on their own risk (yes, they only work partially, but work).

This is not actual for 2.4.0 anyway.

Regards,
Mikhael.

How are these mouse buttons addressed without the proper X macros?
Obviously there are no bits left for a "Button6MotionMask".  And
only Button6Mask and Button7Mask would fit into the free bits.
The button number itself is not a problem.

You may test yourself after remapping button numbers using xmodmap.
The important thing is that it is possible to detect press and release of
buttons with numbers greater than 5 and thus support "I", "C", "D", "H".
Of course, it is impossible to support dragging using mouse buttons
greater than 5. I gathered this info by tests only, it may not be full.

Mikhael.

Full_Name: Andrey Panov
Version: 2.3.32
CVS_Date: 
OS: linux-2.4.5
X_Server: XFree-4.0.3
Submission from: (NULL) (62.76.7.3)


I was running fvwm-2.3.32 for 8 days and it occupied about 10Mb of memory.
This is line from top: 
14091 panov      9   0 10432 1588  1280 S       0  0.0  2.5  12:32 fvwm2
For all this time I did not run any themes, pipes and so on. I use
fixed fvwm2rc file (but create gnome and kde menus on start with PipeRead
'fvwm-menu-desktop ...').
After Restart (from its menu) fvwm occupies about 2 Mb.
It looks like a memory leak in fvwm.
My system is i386, linux-2.4.5, glibc-2.2.3, gcc-2.95.3, XFree-4.0.3.
I configured fvwm with --enable-multibyte option.

This was (as some people guessed) an 8/24 bit problem within the application itself.  Thanks for the help and suggestions.

Note that the top output is hard to interpret and does not
necessarily mean that fvwm itself is using this much memory.  The
plain fvwm code has been tested for memory leaks very thoroughly,
so it's higly unlikely that we missed a leak this big.  On the
other hand the multibyte code is still experimental and has not
undergone extensive tests.  Please

 1) provide your config file.
 2) Send the output of "fvwm2 -version".
 3) Try to identify a any action that increases the size of fvwm2
    reported by top.

A general description of your day to day tasks (regarding fvwm)
might help to check the problem too.

Bye

I use fvwm on my desctop with usual tasks:
running konqueror, kmail, knode, xterm windows, nedit, licq, qps.
I have been using fvwm with config file attached for years with small changes.
I have used fvwm 2.3 series since 2.3.19.

~$ fvwm2 -version
FVWM version 2.3.32 compiled on May 11 2001 at 13:18:41
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, SM, Multibyte

It seems that opening of new window increases fvwm's memory size
by 10-20Kb and memory is not freed after closing of the window.

Hmm.  This is just to help collect data on this problem.

I'm using fvwm 2.3.33 from about a week ago.  I just created 11 rxvt's
with no impact on fvwm's size (not even 1K) as reported by top.

  Have ReadLine support?             yes
  Have RPlay support in FvwmEvent?   no: Can't find required librplay
  Have Stroke support?               no: Can't find required libstroke
  Have XPM support?                  yes
  Have GNOME Window Manager support? yes
  Have Session Management support?   yes
  Have GTK support for FvwmGtk?      yes
  Have GDK Imlib support in FvwmGtk? no: Failed on gdk-imlib, see config.log
  Have GNOME support in FvwmGtk?     no: Can't find working gnome-config
  Have Multibyte support?            no: This is the suggested default

This looks suspicious in add_window.c line 347:

static void destroy_icon_font(FvwmWindow *tmp_win)
{
  if (IS_ICON_FONT_LOADED(tmp_win) && !USING_DEFAULT_ICON_FONT(tmp_win) &&
      tmp_win->title_font.font != Scr.DefaultFont.font)
  {
    FreeFvwmFont(dpy, &(tmp_win->icon_font));
  }
  SET_ICON_FONT_LOADED(tmp_win, 0);
  /* Fall back to default font (see comment above). */
  tmp_win->icon_font = Scr.DefaultFont;
  SET_USING_DEFAULT_ICON_FONT(tmp_win, 1);
}

Try changing title_font to icon_font.
I have some work to do and can't check it myself until later.

This could lead to a core dump, but I don't see how this can be a
memory leak.  Fvwm does never load fonts more than once.

Ah, I remember we discovered several memory leaks in X11.  One
is in the XGetWMNormalHints() funtion which is called once for
every new window.  Maybe it's one of those.

Using multibyte and Adrey's config file I did see  a growing fvwm2 and
Purify reported these at termination:

MLK: 24576 bytes leaked in 8 blocks
  * This memory was allocated from:
	malloc         [rtlib.o]
	_XQueryFont    [Font.c]
	XLoadQueryFont [Font.c]
	load_font      [XSunOMIF.c]
	create_fontset [XSunOMIF.c]
	create_oc      [XSunOMIF.c]
	XCreateOC      [OCWrap.c]
	XCreateFontSet [FSWrap.c]
	GetFontSetOrFixed [GetFont.c:65]
	LoadFvwmFont   [GetFont.c:106]
	setup_icon_font [add_window.c:378]
	AddWindow      [add_window.c:1307]
	HandleMapRequestKeepRaised [events.c:1035]
	HandleMapRequest [events.c:999]
	DispatchEvent  [events.c:2766]
	HandleEvents   [events.c:2819]
	main           [fvwm.c:742]
	_start         [crt1.o]
  * Block of 3072 bytes (8 times); last block at 0x324d38

I don't normally use icon titles so I might have missed them
in previous tests.  Also I'm not sure if leaks at termination
are really leaks, if you are going to exit, theres no point in
freeing things.  It does look like there were 8 icon fonts allocated.
Thats close to the number of windows I created.

You can easily verify that with the patch you suggest (already
committed).  I see the growing size too, but to a smaller extent
(with the patch, I did not try before).  Sometimes some
application seems to freak out and start to consume memory slowly,
but I could not identify which yet.  I suspect it's either
FvwmButtons (unlikely) or one of the swallowed apps (xload or
xosview).  Well, perhaps one of these is simply recording a
history in malloc'ed memory.

The sizes I saw were less than the 10-20K per process reported.
I'd guess the memory lost by failing to free a font would vary
depending on the X server.

I'm only looking at the memory used by fvwm2, thats all that was
mentioned by Andrey.

Great news (assuming everything will come back).

I see the web site is back online.
Jason,

  If you can provide some copy,  I'll update the NEWS FLASH on our
main page just so people can know where we were.

Hi developers,

I just compiled the current CVS version of FVWM with the newly released
gcc 3.0. The compile finished successfully, but I got these warning during
the build:

Yes, everything is back.  And I finally have an Internet connexion at home
again so I can do some things that aren't strictly work related.

Hmmm.  I'm not in much of a writing mood right now, but let's see:

The remnants of tropical storm Allison which have been ravaging the gulf
and east coasts of the United States gave the University of Houston a
present to the tune of more than twelve feet of water in some places.  The
servers hosting fvwm.org are on the sixth floor and this were safe from
rising waters, but the building housing them suffered significant damage to
its power delivery system and will be without electricity for up to ten
weeks.

Once power was restored to parts of campus, the servers were relocated to
get things running again.   Currently all fvwm.org services are up and
running and will be for the foreseeable future.

Sound OK?

Perfect.

Thanks for your hard work, it sounds like a real mess.
By the time Allison hit here, we only got an inch or so of rain.

Could you set Purify to the cause and see if it helps identifying
any leaks here?

I have looked through the code to see which parts will work and 
which will not.  Basically, buttons 6+ will not work for moving,
resizing, strokes, bindings in the client portion of a window and
active button grabbing (needed in parts of the focus code).  In
other words: almost nothing works properly.  Many things will not
fail completely but lack some of the functionality or show erratic
behaviour.

Some of these shortcomings are hard to explain or may even cause
more or less random behaviour.  I am a bit reluctant to make a
code change official that is this problematic.

I'm not sure what you are asking for.
Would you like me to run FvwmButtons under Purify?

Hi!

If a window's icon is sticky, but not the window itself, and
you restart fvwm 2.2.32 with a current desk other than 0, then
this window will disappear from the desktop. As I have StickyIcons
by default, this makes _all_ icons disappear - ARGH! :)

The icon will still be shown in both FvwmPager and in FvwmWinList.
The only way to restore the normal behavior is to a) deiconify
the window once (using FvwmWinList or FvwmPager), or b) restart
fvwm with the current desktop 0.

When the icons are invisible, new icons are positioned correctly
within the icon box, i.e. if I had three icons before, then the
next icon will correctly place itself next to the three invisible
icons.


Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Hi!

There are two features I probably cannot implement using
fvwm bindings, but which I'm really missing:

  - as long as the shift key is pressed, disable edge
    scrolling

  - as long as the ctrl key is pressed, enable scrolling
    to the next DESK (not page) (which also means disabling
    a possibly activated edge scrolling wrap-around)

Please implement :-)

Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Hi!

I have a suggestion:

I would like FVWM to draw an XOR-rectangle even in OpaqueResize/Move
mode for the parts of the window being moved that are beneath other
windows. IMHO, this is a useful feature, because you can easily
arrange windows without having to raise them first, and lower them
after the move/resize operation.

Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Hi!

My screen layout is like this:

+------------------------------+
|                              |
|                              |
|                              |
| i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i |
| i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i |
| i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i  i |
| i  i  i  i  i  i  i   +------+
| i  i  i  i  i  i  i   |      |
+-----------------------+------+

In the lower right corner, there is a monitoring program, and
I want the icon box to fill the lower half of the screen, but
without the space the monitoring program occupies.

Using two icon boxes (in my case, for "Netscape*") doesn't seem
to work. Bug or missing feature?

Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Hi!

I wanted to display FvwmPager the desktops as a matrix, or
at least vertically instead of horizontally. Is that at
all possible? FvwmPagerRows/Columns doesn't seem to do
what I expected...

Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Hi!

Not many applications use window group hints, so why not
DIY? I think Enlightenment has the ability to do this -
or was that only an eterm feature?

Anyway, I want (not just 'I would like' :-) to have the
functionality of Xmerge (http://xmerge.mini.dhs.org/) built
into FVWM. I think I don't have to justify the use of this
feature :-)

Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

We know about the mktemp warnings already but don't know what to
do about it.

> readconfig.c:1094:3: warning: pasting "." and "buttonState" does not give a valid preprocessing token

This is the code:

  #define SET_MANAGER(manager,field,value)                           \
     do {                                                            \
       ...
	   globals.managers[id].##field = value;                     \
       ...
       }                                                             \
     } while (0)
  
  ...
   
  SET_MANAGER (manager, buttonState[context], state);

To me that seems as if the preprocessor is broken.  It issues a
warning as if

  globals.managers[id].##field

was expanded to tow separate tokens:

  globals.managers[id] .buttonState[context]
                     ^^^

and not to

  globals.managers[id].buttonState[context]
                     ^^

And even if it split the token into two it would hardly ever
matter since C does not care for the additional space.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

No, I mean fvwm itself.  If there is a memory leak, Purify might
be able to detect it.

Maybe I wasn't clear at the time.

I ran Purify before and after the fix was applied.
There was a leak before and the leak was gone after.

Neither.  Multiple icon boxes work quite well.  You probably
defined the icon boxes on two separate "Style" lines:

  Style * IconBox WxH+X+Y
  Style * IconBox W2xH2+X2+Y2

The second line overrides the first one.  To have both boxes, put
it all on a single line:

  Style * IconBox WxH+X+Y, IconBox W2xH2+X2+Y2

The information is in the man page but hidden well :-)

Nice feature.  But if it can be done with a third party
application I see no need to implement it directly in fvwm,
especially since it would be very disruptive to the current
binding related code.

Full_Name: Jeffrey Schwab
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 8
X_Server: Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (192.9.51.3)


According to the FVWM docs, M is supposed to refer to the Meta modifier
key.  Unfortunately, it actually applies to the Alt key.  The Meta key
would be much more useful for me, since using the Alt key is kind of a
pain
on Sun keyboards.  Is there a fix or workaround for this?  Is there some
letter other than M which refers to the true Meta key?

Thanks for your help.  FVWM is great!

It is not an FvwmAuto problem, it's RecaptureWindow.

I can reproduce what Paul describes without FvwmAuto with FvwmAnimate.
Or without FvwmAnimate, but when the original icon is already unfocused.
(It is possible to get unfocussed icon under cursor if you enter it during
All RecaptureWindow.)

But I don't think this problem is critical for 2.4.0.
I may help to fix it in 2.4.1.

Restoring focus may be done explicitely by adding to Iconify-and-Compact:

  + C Focus NoWarp   # or even: WindowId $w (!Iconic) Focus NoWarp

Does anyone think this problem is critical to stop the 2.4.0 release?

It also seems that a problem with not focussing of Nautilus is not
critical either, it may be fixed by Style Lenience.

We should move on. I think we agreed that 2.3.33 is the latest release.
I want to change the next version from 2.3.34 to 2.4.0. Any objections?

I also think that if we want to move, the code should be fully frozen now.
Any non obvious change (even a possible fix) should be voted, anyone is
able to veto if he thinks a problem is not critical to start to fix it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I wanted to debug the problem with the dying FvwmIconMan module
but can not find anything in the mail archives.  Does anybody have
the problem description handy?

Do you have an estimation for the date of this message?
I can't find any dying FvwmIconMan message in my 2001 archive.
I only see the message where you ask about what to do with this problem:

I don't think that the preprocessor is broken. It's just that it is more
strict ANSI conformant than it used to be. (Correct me if I'm wrong, I
don't have an exact Standards description handy.)

What the warning is trying to say is that you're not allowed to use ##
with non-identifier-characters (period in this case); at any rate, it
won't insert a white space in such a case. And, it is just a warning; the
preprocessor does the Right Thing.

Consider the following:

==================================================================
lorinder$ cat > example
#define PERIODLEFT(x) .##x
#define CHARLEFT(x)     a##x

PERIODLEFT(foo)
#line 100
PERIODLEFT(;)
#line 1000
CHARLEFT(bar)
#line 10000
CHARLEFT(!)
lorinder$ /usr/bin/cpp --version
2.95.2
lorinder$ /usr/bin/cpp example 
# 1 "example"



.foo  
# 99 "example"

.;  
# 999 "example"

abar  
# 9999 "example"

a!  
lorinder$ /usr/local/bin/cpp --version
3.0
lorinder$ /usr/local/bin/cpp example  
example:4:1: warning: pasting "." and "foo" does not give a valid
preprocessing token
# 4 "example"
.foo
# 100 "example"
example:100:1: warning: pasting "." and ";" does not give a valid
preprocessing token
.;
# 1000 "example"
abar
# 10000 "example"
example:10000:1: warning: pasting "a" and "!" does not give a valid
preprocessing token
 a!
lorinder$ 
==================================================================

Hence, the fix is to simply remove the ##. This certainly can't break
anything since, as you pointed out, even if some preprocessors (wrongly)
insert a white space there, this won't cause any problems.

Thus, the following patch, which solves these problems, can be safely
applied.

Cheers,

I am not a preprocessor profi, but the fact that the original ## existed
suggests that not all preprocessors recognize "field" as parameter here.
I would replace ## with a space to be sure.

Mikhael.

I'll try these; although I've had this compact feature turned off ever
since it broke and I haven't really missed it much... so that tells you
how important I think it is.

Personally I vote we leave 2.3.34 out for 1 week, and only fix the most
critical of bugs (and/or build/compile issues?)... and if there aren't
any at the end of 1 week we recut it as 2.4.0.

Some time between January and May.  Sorry, I can't be more
precise.  All I remember is that I noticed the problem during the
stress tests I made a while ago, probably when refining the
automated test scripts with Dan.  Something causes FvwmIconMan to
exit under some circumstances because it gets a timeout reading
from the pipe, maybe because of a busy cursor grab or something
similar.  I know I sent a detailed problem description to the
mailing list but I can not remember if it ever arrived.

Didn't you notice some problem with FvwmIconMan a few weeks ago?
At least I thought you had re-discovered the same problem.

No, not if it's not something general with focus/grabs and the
like.  Hm, I thought the IconifyAndCompact version was in the FAQ,
but obviously it isn't.

Icons suck anyway ;-)

Agreed.  I wish I could do something about the dying FvwmIconMan,
but if I can't even find the problem description this may not
delay 2.4 any further.

Ok, then you should refer to this thread:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0102/msg00162.html
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0102/msg00231.html

I thought this problem was fixed, but now I see notice that you asked
Chris to take a look at the remaining part of the problem.

Sorry, I don't use FvwmIconMan on a regular basis, I only verify from time
to time that the FvwmIconMan option, which some of our themes have, work.

I reported that I got this, which may or may not be related:

[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor:
- data available=N
- terminate signal=N

I patched some time ago fvwm to print a module name here and I saw that it
is generated by my personal FvwmEvent-NewWindow module when I switch
themes. The interesting thing is that FvwmEvent-NewWindow module is not
killed and remains functional, so this is only a warning (!?) in my case.
I turned off this module from StartFunction some time ago, but I may
reenable it later to help to fix this tight problem.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There, this is the proof.  Playing computer games addles the
mind.  All this time I was thinking the problem was still open
while I already fixed it.

At least this is the message that appeared when FvwmIconMan died.

Please do.  I'd like to find out if this a problem that will bite
us later if we do not fix it now.  Otherwise, I see no further
reasons to delay 2.4 any longer.  There is no need to hurry,
though.

Hey, they make sense to me.  (I'm not using this window now, I think
I'll make it small.)

I don't think the problem is worth delaying 2.4.

Full_Name: Adam J. Richter
Version: 2.3.33
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux-2.4.5
X_Server: XFree86-4.1
Submission from: (NULL) (216.218.142.42)


If you just do "./configure" with fvwm95-2.3.33 on a system that uses
ncurses instead of termcap, it will decide that readline wants "-ltermcap"
rather than "-lncurses".  The reason for this is that configure.in
relies on the autoconf macro smr_ARG_WITHLIB setting with_termcap to "no"
if there is no termcap library, but, in fact, smr_ARG_WITHLIB defaults
to setting it to "maybe", even if the library does not exist.

The following patch fixes smr_ARG_WITHLIB to set with_${library} to
"maybe" if the library exists and "no" if it does not.  I have tested
it under autoconf-2.50, and it results in a successful build,
automatically
determining that it should use "-lreadline -lncruses" (which tests both
the failure case, the test for termcap, and the success case, the test
of ncurses).  Here is the patch.

Well, no, smr_ARG_WITHLIB is supposed to return "maybe" in this case, and
./configure expects this (and not "no").

Let see if I understand this "problem". You have both libtermcap and
libncurses installed, fvwm chooses libtermcap to be used together with
libreadline, and you don't like this.

If this is the case, use: --without-termcap-library --with-ncurses-library
(only the first is really needed), like it is suggested in INSTALL.fvwm.

If this is not the case and there is actually a problem with building
fvwm, please describe it.

Sorry, but this is a really bad patch. :)

It only "works" for you because:

  1) your libtermcap does not contain "main" function
  2) your libncurses does contain "main" function
  3) your libreadline does contain "main" function

Libraries are not expected to contain "main", in fact my libreadline does
not contain it, as well as libXpm, so for me your patch breaks detection
of xpm and readline completely if they are not explicitely specified.

Anyway, thank you for your willing to help, sending patches is a good idea.

Regards,
Mikhael.

       No.  ./configure is supposed to autodetect these kinds of things
when it can if you do not give it arguments.  My patch fixes this problem.

Autodetect what? Please explain. I don't think that prefering termcap over
ncurses if both are available is a problem. Am I missing something?

Does "./configure" (without your patch) say you have ReadLine support?
Does "make; su; make install" pass?
Can you use keyboard arrows in FvwmConsole?

If the answer on all these questions is "yes", there is no any problem.

> My patch fixes this problem.

False, it does not fix anything, but introduces several big problems.

How many configurations on how many systems did you test?

If you want a patch for probing ncurses before termcap, you should move
the appropriated lines in configure.in, but your patch does not do this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Sorry, I misread this question before.  That is *not* the problem.

	The problem is that "./configure ; make all" results in a build
failure.  Termcap is not available on this system, and ./configure
acted as if it was anyhow, because the absense of termcap is not
automatically detected.  I do not care whether this program uses ncurses
or termcap if both are available, but if only one is available, it should
automatically use that.

	After I applied my patch, the FvwmConsole program linked correctly
(with "-lreadline -lncurses" instead of "-lreadline -ltermcap"), and
installed without errors.  I will try to figure out how to use FvwmConsole
to attempt the other test you requested.

	I believe that ncurses can be configured to install a symlink
from /usr/lib/libtermcap.a to /usr/lib/ncurses.a, or at least that older
verions of ncurses could, and that this may have hidden the problem before.

Ok, now I understand the problem.

I hope I explained why your patch seemed to work for you. It is a
combination of events that works on your system only.

Add this line to your fvwmrc and press Alt-F12 (after restarting):

  Key F12 A M Module FvwmConsole

Yes, this may be a problem. Please investigate whether you have good
libtermcap.a and/or libtermcap.so.

configure checks that a trivial program containing one call readline()
works with "-lreadline -ltermcap" and decides that termcap library is ok.
This is not a perfect check, but it was such since fvwm-2.1.x versions.

What build error do you get?

BTW, which mailer do you use, it does not add References: and In-Reply-To:
headers, so threads are not preserved...

	UPDATE: One thing that I have not noticed before is that I
was running autoconf before ./configure.  Just running "./configure" on
the pristine sources does seem to detect the absense of libtermcap somehow.
So, this is a more subtle bug, perhaps related to autoconf-2.50.  I am
looking into it.  The rest of this response applies to doing
"autoconf ; ./configure ; make all" on the fvwm-2.3.33 sources.

	Your explanation is wrong.  I did not respond to it initially
because I thought my clarification of the problem made it irrelevant.
Here is a response to your explanation:

| [The patch] only "works" for you because:
|
|  1) your libtermcap does not contain "main" function

	I have no libtermcap library on this system.

|  2) your libncurses does contain "main" function
|  3) your libreadline does contain "main" function

	Wrong.  See:
	
	baldur[510] nm /usr/lib/libreadline.* | egrep main
	baldur[511] nm /usr/lib/libncurses.* | egrep main
	baldur[512] 

	Using "main" as the function to check for in AC_CHECK_LIB
causes AC_CHECK_LIB to check for the existance of the library without
requiring a specific function, since "main" is defined in the body of the
test program.  This is the convention for achieving this result in autoconf.
A grep of our source tree shows 202 directory trees that use it, covering
just about every category of program you can think of (i.e., not just
kde, gtk-based software or anything like that).

>Add this line to your fvwmrc and press Alt-F12 (after restarting):

>  Key F12 A M Module FvwmConsole

	Thanks.  That works fine with my change.


>> 	I believe that ncurses can be configured to install a symlink

>Yes, this may be a problem. Please investigate whether you have good
>libtermcap.a and/or libtermcap.so.

	As I said, there is no termcap library on this system.  The symlink
was on some other older systems, not the one where I tried the build.

[...]

>What build error do you get?

	From doing "autoconf ; ./configure ; make all" on the pristine
fvwm-2.3.33 sources:

gcc  -g -O2  -o FvwmConsole  FvwmConsole.o -L../../libs -lfvwm -lreadline -ltermcap  
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.0/../../../../i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -ltermcap

To save a bit of time before the 2.4 release on one hand, and to
make sure all the dates and release numbers are correct in all
the files I suggest that we build fvwm-2.4.0-pre1 now with all
the version numbers and supporting files referring to 2.4.0.
This build would not be announced on the web page and can only
be downloaded from the alpha directory on the ftp server.  Does
this make sense?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

BTW, I compiled a list of files that have to be touched in the to
do list.  Could anybody have a look at it and add any files I
missed, please?

I hate to say it but I have a slight problem with CVS as of about 10
minutes ago.  I last updated on May 9.

My problem is that it would seem that FvwmTheme is not parsing my config
or accepting input from FvwmConsole

In my rc I had 
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 fg #d7dde8, bg #979797 # default color
*FvwmThemeColorset 1 fg #d7dde8, bg #596eb1 # hilight color
*FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg #d7dde8, bg #5b74a2, Transparent
*FvwmThemeColorset 3 fg #d7dde8, bg #43608e, CGradient 128 #979797 #596eb1
*FvwmThemeColorset 4 fg gold,    bg #43608e, Transparent #DGradient 128 #444444 #8b9dc3
*FvwmThemeColorset 5 fg pink,    bg #43608e, Transparent #DGradient 128 #444444 #8b9dc3
*FvwmThemeColorset 6 fg #d7dde8, bg #000e4f
which worked fine with the 2.3.33

After checking the man page I converted to 
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg #d7dde8, bg #979797 # default color
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg #d7dde8, bg #596eb1 # hilight color
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 2 fg #d7dde8, bg #5b74a2, Transparent
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 3 fg #d7dde8, bg #43608e, CGradient 128 #979797 #596eb1
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 4 fg gold,    bg #43608e, Transparent #DGradient 128 #444444 #8b9dc3
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 5 fg pink,    bg #43608e, Transparent #DGradient 128 #444444 #8b9dc3
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 6 fg #d7dde8, bg #000e4f

in FvwmConsole id do
echo $[fg.cs0] $[fg.cs1] $[fg.cs2] $[fg.cs3] $[fg.cs4] $[fg.cs5] $[fg.cs6]
I get: [FVWM][Echo]:  rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8 
So I try 
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg black
echo $[fg.cs0]
[FVWM][Echo]:  rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8

SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 0 fg black
echo $[fg.cs0]
[FVWM][Echo]:  rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8

*SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 0 fg  rgb:0000/0000/0000
echo $[fg.cs0]
[FVWM][Echo]:  rgb:d7d7/dddd/e8e8


It seems like all 7 colorsets I use are getting the bg, and fg of Colorset 0.
I'm at a loss I'm going to take a look at FvwmTheme now but maybe someone else could confirm this.

Well I finally tracked down the problem with Fvwm Theme it was dumping
core on
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 3 fg #d7dde8, bg #43608e, CGradient 128 #979797 #596eb1
while creating the gradient.

Which brings me to you Dan:
2001-05-14  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.telcordia.com>

    * libs/Graphics.c (CreateGradientPixmap): Avoid divide by zero errors
    in S,C,Y Gradients with the help of a very smart horse.

for it is here that it is crashing.  Reverting the section for CGRADIENT
back to the way it was fixes my problem but may break whatever the change
was intended to fix.

If you could give me some insight here it would be appreciated.

Brad

It crashes for me in this line:

  register double x = (double)((2 * i - t_width) * t_height) / 4.0;

with i = 0 and t_width = 255.  The problem is that i is an int
while t_width is an unsigned int.  The subtraction results in a
very large number.  This is used later to calculate an invalid
array index which causes the crash.

Well that makes sense.  I tried your fix and all is well for me now.
Thanks gdb wasn't letting me look at register values for some reason
so it was taking me a little longer to track down the problem.

Thanks,

I really hate that about C.  Everything looks fine, but it does
ridiculous type confersions without complaining.  That's why I
usually cast each and every variable in calculations nowadays.

Dominik you are so cautious.

I know you want each official release to be perfect,
but we can create 2.4.1 at the drop of a hat.

Ok, now you finaly supplied enough information for me to be able to
reproduce the problem. :-)

If I remove libtermcap, run autoconf from autoconf-2.50 package, the
resulting ./configure says "(cached) yes" for termcap, which is wrong.
But if I run autoreconf instead (which is more correct), everything is ok.

If I then run autoconf (all from 2.50), the problem appears again.
It seems for me that this is a problem in autoconf-2.50, at least this
behaviour is not compatible with autoconf-2.13.

Here is a patch that makes autoconf-2.50 happy in all situations for me:

--- acinclude.m4        2001/05/14 06:56:30     1.16

         ifelse($6, , ${$1_LIBS}, [${$1_LIBS} $6]))

I would not apply it before 2.4.0 unless it is really necessary.
I prefer not to risk, although it seems to work with autoconf-2.13 too.

I should agree with you, my explanation is not good.
Still it correctly describes that it is not portable.

Here is exactly what I said, but expressed differently.

The output with your patch on your system (without termcap) seems to be:

checking for main in -lxpm... yes
checking for main in -lrplay... yes
checking for main in -lstroke... yes
checking for main in -ltermcap... no
checking for main in -lncurses... yes
checking with ncurses... checking for main in -lreadline... yes

My output with your patch on my system (I have all libraries) is:

checking for main in -lxpm... no
checking for main in -lrplay... yes
checking for main in -lstroke... yes
checking for main in -ltermcap... no
checking for main in -lncurses... yes
checking with ncurses... checking for main in -lreadline... no

Currently I have no time to investigate why all these "no" appear after
your patch is applied.

But we have an even better check later in configure, we check that
readline() call works within the library, not only main().

The problem with autoconf-2.50 is related to caching. I find that caching
(which is hard to implement both correctly and effectivelly) usually
causes more problems than solves, it only reduces time a bit.

Mikhael.

Ok, just to be more exact, how about this:

  * change the developement version from 2.3.34 to 2.4.0 today/tomorrow
  * change all dates to be 2001-07-01 and versions to be 2.4.0
  * ask Jason to repack (unpack/rename/pack) fvwm-snap-20010630.tar.gz to
    fvwm-2.4.0-pre1.tar.gz and move to alpha directory
  * optionally add a link to fvwm-2.4.0-pre1.tar.gz in download.html
  * release a real 2.4.0 several days after that (make_fvwmdist)

I'd prefer not to build a new package but to release the
pre-release as 2.4 and simply re-tag the cvs sources.

Submission from: (NULL) (195.252.205.117)


Hi!

While RaiseLower works correctly in fvwm 2.3.32, it
does not in 2.3.33, instead it only raises a window.

Raise and Lower alone work, though.

This is the mouse binding I use for RaiseLower:

Mouse   2       WTFS    M       RaiseLower


Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

Can you please give detailed instructions how to reproduce this
(including a small config file)?  I see no problem with
RaiseLower.

Subject: Yet another unclutter problem

I don't actually think this is release critical, but I think it should
probably not be me to decide that, therefore I figured it would be
better to mention that anyway.

I have another problem with unclutter. Here's a minimal config:

Style   *       SloppyFocus
Key     Tab     A       M       Next [*] Focus

Reproduce:

1) Open two xterms.
2) Move the mouse on the title bar or border of one of these xterms.
3) Switch windows with Alt-Tab (but leave the mouse pointer where it is)
4) Wait --- When unclutter hides the mouse pointer, focus is switched
5) Even more annoyingly, you can't switch back with Alt-Tab, it will
   immediately switch back again.

This appears on fvwm-snap-20010603.

I tried to track it down, but didn't succeed yet. And, unfortunately I
have no time to devote right now. When I was inserting fprintf's in the
source, etc. I could no longer reliably reproduce part (5); maybe it has
to do with timing. So I don't know if (5) can be reproduced on faster
machines, for instance. (This here is a Pentium-133).

Greetings,
--Lorenz

I narrowed it down: When following option in ~/.fvwm/desktop
is activated, RaiseLower doesn't work (only raises) in 2.3.33,
while with 2.3.32, it works perfectly. Commenting out this
option makes RaiseLower work again in 2.3.33.

There was an unclutter problem I reported back about then, that was
fixed almost immediately.

You say you are using a snap from early June; the very first thing to do
when you find a problem, well before bothering to spend any time
debugging it yourself, is to try the latest code.

If it still happens there, please file a bug.

Thanks!

No, your problem was in May, not June, according to my archive. (That's
BTW why I entitled it `Yet another ...'.) Moreover the bug descriptions
don't match.

There are no suspicious changelog entries. While early June might seem
very old, let's not forget that fvwm-wise the time stood still for
several weeks between now and then. (I'm actually preety sure it's still
there.)

Anyway, in principle you're right; if I come around to, I'll try. (But
as I said, I have no time, so don't count on me doing that quickly.
Sorry.)

Description:
	If you have SloppyFocus, and the mouse positionned on the
	window border (or title bar) of an unfocussed window, whenever
	unclutter hides the cursor, the window on which (or more
	accurately on whose border) the cursor is positionned gets
	focussed.

	Sometimes you can't just switch back by Keyboard control; fvwm
	will just quickly focus the window you want to focus and give
	the focus immediately back to the window having its cursor over
	it.

Repeat-By:
	Minimal Config:
	Style   *       SloppyFocus
	Key     Tab     A       M       Next [*] Focus

	Steps to perform:

	1) Open two xterms.
	2) Move the mouse on the title bar or border of one of these xterms.
	3) Switch windows with Alt-Tab (but leave the mouse pointer where it is)
	4) Wait --- When unclutter hides the mouse pointer, focus is switched
	5) Even more annoyingly, you can't switch back with Alt-Tab, it will
	   immediately switch back again.

Probably-Related:
	Similar problem as reported by Paul D. Smith on May, 1st.
	However, my problem only occurs in window-borders; not
	everywhere. (Otherwise it appears to be the same thing.)

I can confirm that the problem exists with CVS from a couple of days
ago.

I just observed another problem that was fixed a while back and
appears to have come back.  As long as a menu is posted, fvwm
is causing X activity.

I don't see any X activity, but this may depend on the menu styles
you use.  Can you please post the relevant lines?

The problem is this:

When unclutter hides the pointer, it creates an invisible
subwindow to the window that currently contains the pointer.
Since the pointer generates an EnterNofity on the new window and
unclutter sends a synthetic EnterNotify on its parent so that the
application thinks it still has the cursor.

Now, while the cursor is hidden, unclutter waits for any
interesting event including FocusOut on the parent window.  If it
gets one, it destroys its subwindow, creates a new one and sends
another EnterNotify.

With SloppyFocus and MouseFocus this new EnterNotify moves the
focus right back to the old window.  There is not much we can do
about this in fvwm, it has to be fixed in unclutter.  fvwm
responds correctly to the events it gets.

It happens for me with no .fvwm2rc file at all,
just using the built in menu.

I've only got one computer at home, this is difficult to debug without
2 machines.

It seems to me that if you are using SloppyFocus or MouseFocus,
you want the focus to follow the mouse pointer.
Thats what it does.

The "Next [*] Focus" command violates that rule, but unclutter fixes
it up.  If you want to focus on a new window with either of these
focus models, warptowindow should be used.

I don't think theres a problem.

Can you get it to happen using Xnest?

You can either start a second X server and fvwm in an XNest
window:

  $ exec Xnest -full -sync -name "Xnest :3" :3
  $ fvwm2 -d :3 -cmd "FvwmCpp $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc"

Or start a second X server:

  $ exec xinit /bin/sleep 100000 -- :1
  $ fvwm2 -d :1 -cmd "FvwmCpp $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc"

Running fvwm in xnest is often easier to debug since you don't
need to switch screens, but moving the pointer out of the window
may generate unwanted events.

I'm at home.
I'm stuck with Exceed and W98.
Actually, I see that I can use a telnet window at the same time I have
a menu posted.

I'll see if I can figure out whats going on.

VNC is another good choice.  It's what I used to use occasionally for
debugging fvwm, along with XMX (which also worked fairly well although
sometimes that had bugs of it's own which interfered) and Xnest (and
occasionally in conjunction with xmon/xscope, of course).  It shouldn't have
any problems with the pointer leaving the window since the vncviewer window is
totally separate from the actual Xvnc X11 session.

I felt that using the virtual terminals (under Linux or AIX 3.x) for debugging
fvwm was rather difficult...

Thanks a lot for this description, now I see why it doesn't work.

I have implemented a new Style, NoMouseFocusWithoutMotion which causes
windows not to get focus because of the mouse pointer, if it hasn't moved
before.

Obvioulsy this doesn't only change the behaviour of unclutter but also,
e.g. of newly created windows: They no longer automatically receive
Focus just because they were placed below the mouse cursor. Another
effect is that focus of windows, which are moved by keyboard commands,
doesn't accidentially change.

Personally, I prefer this to the default behaviour.

I'll post a patch as soon as I've properly tested, cleaned up and documented 
that new style.

Without commenting one way or another on whether this is a good style or
not, you might consider changing the name to avoid the double negative.

Maybe just "FocusRequiresMotion"?

One inconvenient thing about warptowindow is that there's no programmatic
way to get back to the original window.  So if you want a command to
temporarily get you to a different window and then put you back as if
nothing had happened, warping the pointer doesn't work so well.

Specifically, I like to bring up FvwmConsole with a single keystroke.  I
get focus in the new window immediately, type whatever I need in it, and
when I hit ^D to get out of it, my focus returns to the window I was in
before (because the mouse hasn't moved).

Is there a better way of doing this?

I'm not quite sure what I should see in this trace.  To me, it
looks like a random piece of code recorded in a log file.  Is this
meant to demonstrate one of the busy wait cycles?  If it is, it
contains neither the start nor the end of the cycle.

It is meant to demonstrate the cycle.

I thought when it went from XQueryPointer at line 371 in menus.c
back to the same location I had the whole cycle.

In the sample I sent, it seems to fake a MotionNotify event
(line 1539, menus.c) and then start querying the pointer, I think
its looking for a release event.

If it still looks bad to you, I'll redo it.
I might have inadvertantly moved the mouse while trying to get gdb
to operate.

I'm also using a fairly new trackball mouse.

Probably.  A cycly should start at the beginning of the loop in
MenuInteraction().

Attached is a new trace.

The while loop in menus.c starts with:

flags.do_popdown_now = False;

thats line 1427 in this trace.

You will see that twice in the attached trace.  Actually, I see it
4 times, in pairs like this:

1427	    flags.do_popdown_now = False;
1425	    flags.do_popup_and_warp = False;
1426	    flags.do_popup_now = False;
1427	    flags.do_popdown_now = False;

I believe thats just the optimizer rearranging code.

To produce this  trace, I telneted into the  machine running fvwm from
the PC.  Then  I attached gdb to  the  running fvwm and  typed "cont".
Then I  brought  up  a  menu using the    keyboard.  The pointer   was
positioned on the first  item in the menu (below  the title).  Looking
at my cable modem, I could see packets flying back and forth.

I then hit Ctrl-Alt-Tab to select the telnet window.
This leaves the
pointer on the menu item but I can type commands into the telnet window.

I then hit ctrl-C to gain  control and single  stepped thru the loop a
few times.

In the attached trace, I took out the "(gdb)" prompts to make it
easier to read.

You committed your experiments with events.c, which you obviously didn't
want to commit.

I am restoring events.c. We don't want FvwmButtons panels, FvwmTaskBar,

"cvs diff [files] | less" before "cvs commit [files]" is a good idea.

Mikhael.

What you noticed is that fvwm periodically bumps out of the loop
where it waits for events (Each time the PopupDelay is over) and
checks if something has to be popped up.  In the process,
XQueryPointer is called three times.  This happens every 150
milliseconds, so this should hardly be noticeable.  I'll rewrite
a bit of code so that it only needs to call XQueryPointer once.

Although I can ping the CVS machine, it does not respond any CVS

If I correctly understand the question, here is how to achieve this:

  Style * StickyFocus
  Style FvwmConsole GrabFocus
  Key F12 A M FvwmConsole

The second way, which also achieves this (in 2.2.x it works differently):

  AddToFunc StartFvwmConsole
  + I FvwmConsole
  + I Wait FvwmConsole
  + I Next (FvwmConsole) Focus  # Focus NoWarp if 2 non-sticky FvwmConsole

I only post tested examples.

Regards,
Mikhael.
