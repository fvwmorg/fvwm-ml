I was one of those that said "sure, add my name" back then.  At the time I
though "well, this is a weird forum for something like this, but what the
hell, it's a nice sentiment".

And if you had started with something like this above dedication I wouldn't
have had any objections really.  I would have thought (again) it was a weird
forum for things like this, of course, but I probably wouldn't have spoke up
directly this time because of the fact that it's more of a political nature
and I tend to stay out of those - but as I said I probably wouldn't have
objected to you doing this dedication either.

But given the discussions that led up to this, and your final paragraph there
plus the email yesterday where you mentioned trying to stop the distribution
of fvwm that left a deafening silence on the list, makes you sound like a
child threatening to take away his ball because everyone else playing doesn't
want to play by his rules.

So as of this moment I've officially ceased caring about fvwm or it's future.

I've silently lurked the lists watching it's development because I did
dedicate a lot of time to it at one point and I liked the fact that you guys
(and you in particular Dominik) have continued doing good work on it, but I
just don't care what happens to it any more.  Which is a good thing, because I
can easily see actions like those over the past couple of weeks driving the
final nail in fvwm's coffin.

And this is the last thing I have to say on the subject.  I'm unsubscribing
from the lists with my next email.

Goodbye all, and good luck.

Chuck

I privately sent Dominik my OK to endorse this latest statement, but
after reading Chuck's well written critique, I've decided
that I agree with Chuck.
I'd like to withdraw my endorsement.

I am running fvwm2 2.4.15 with the default configuration file.

When I iconify from the pager by clicking a button black lines
are drawn to the screen that stay there until I erase them by
moving a window in front of them.

Can you please provide a screen shot, a minimal config file and

CVS_Date: 2003-04-1

Hi,

My problem is related to the configure scrip. When checking for fontconfig,
the configure script looks for a program "fontconfig-config", but this
program does not exist on my system. Instead pkg-config offers an option,
fontconfig, that I would guess is similar to what fontconfig-config would
do; pkg-config fontconfig. I think configure should check for pkg-config
fontconfig.

On a similar not, the configure script compiles a little program which uses
XftFontOpen(), but the compilation failes since it is not linked with
-lfontconfig. I guess this is a result of the above mentioned problem
failing.

John.

I urge everyone to stop all unnecessary run-ins.
Noone will win from ultimatums and wars.
Let's show we can do it peacefully without losing people.

Here is what we will do:

* Dedicate at least 2.4.16 and 2.5.7 to all victims of the war.
  Every developer will sign it as a sign of reconciliation.

* All statements except for GNU GPL are excluded from cvs.

* Everyone shows a respect to the Dominik's full years of work by not
  trying to attack him in the future, and Dominik reconsiders his prior
  steps.  Attacking each other on code related issues is ok. :-)

* We try to abstain from controversial talks on these forums.

* We forget all disputs and return to code and to the birthday
  preparations.

I hope this is reasonable. Please agree.

Dominik, OK?

Dan, OK?

All developers who are not signed yet, OK?

Everyone else who participated, OK?

Regards,
Mikhael.

	I think that's the finest thing we could do to promote peace and
cooperation...demonstrating it by example.

Dear all fvwm supporters,

  at last I'm writing to the list.
  Please don't be fooler than the fool (is it said like this in English =
?), that is, Dominik has agreed to go in a direction that wouldn't =
affect the future of the project. He went from a position he defended =
very strongly to something - I think - widely acceptable. Even though =
one doesn't agree with his initial position, one has to recognise the =
effort he made to fight against his profound beliefs, whichever they =
were, for fvwm's sake.
  Now if other contributors go from a 'no, maybe something else would be =
more appropriate' to a 'no-no', that's trashing Dominik's efforts. No =
more no less.

  I understand that other contributors were upset by some of Dominik's =
words or ideas. I though the idea of trying to prevent further =
distribution of fvwm was nearly an insult to the users/developpers =
community. But the insult of somebody who's about to lose control, a =
desperate man action. I was not far from giving up our dear WM, mailing =
list etc. Then came Dominik's new proposition. Can you imagine how hard =
he has fought against his own convictions to reach that proposition ? =
Let's acknowledge it by letting go those very bad things that were said.

  So here's my proposition:
  - let's forget all what was said before the new proposition. It's =
hard. But we CAN do it if we are willing to do so.
  - let's take the new proposition as it comes, and let's discuss the =
terms if needed.
  - let's say that nobody's upset anymore. Take a deep breath, think of =
something pleasant, another deep breath...

  Please let's stop that discussion. Please let's start again. I know we =
can do that. Forgiving can be painful, but it makes stronger.

  I've been an fvwm addict since 1993 or 1994, nearly 10 years. I'd be =
very sad to abandon it. And I appreciated every contribution to the =
project from whoever it came. That's all.

  Regards,
  Jeremie Petit

I have one question, and I really hope some can help me find an
answer.

Assuming I decide to forget all that has happened and stay in this
place.  How am I going to resolve the conflict between my
conscience and publishing my work without restrictions?  I believe
the fact that this conflict exists did not get the attention it
should have in the argument we had.

Bye

I think you should not feel any pangs of conscience by writting a good
software. Several people already said what I am going to say, but I want
to try one more time.

People invent and create things to make their lives more confortable.

For example, a tape can be used to listen to a nice music. But it can be
used to create strong noise. It can be used to physically hit someone.
Do you think a tape is a non-ethical invention? I don't think so.

Software is just a set of bits (or megabytes) linked together.
If we speak about such common software things like kernel, system
libraries (libc), window manager, shell, terminal emulator, image library
and so on, it is pretty clear to everyone that these things are neutral.
Just like computers by themselves are neutral, or an electricity is a
pretty peaceful invention. Without an electricity we would not have our
computers, food, clothes.

You are in no way help unethical people any more than computer firms or
other free software volunteers do. But you help nice people for sure.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't want to make light of your inner turmoil, but
evil people use that other OS.

There are no evil people using Fvwm.

Well, maybe some spammers, but I'm pretty sure not even spammers.

I don't understand why you see a necessary connection between
programming Fvwm and the war.  They don't have anything to
do with each other.

I'm guessing you just want a public way to express your
frustration with world events.

I respect your feelings that this war is wrong, but I think this
project is the wrong place to try to spread that message.
There are other people involved in this project.
I got the impression that they don't want to convert this
project to an antiwar project.

If you can convince them that they should, then you should
convince before you commit changes.  Just like we've done in
the past with other controversial changes.

Since I use and support Fvwm in a commercial environment,
I feel I have no choice but to not install software with
a political message.

I hope this helps.

Every act one performs has has effects, including "non-acts". Not working
on FVWM has effects. And so forth.

A window manager, like most productivity tools, is a neutral tool in
that any evil facilitated by it is a product of the evil of the work of
the user. Conversely, any good it does is a product of the good of the
work of the user.

One the whole I would expect that users of free software are idealogically
pro-cooperation and against conflict. Probably moreso than the general
population.

The mere possibility that FVWM may be used by someone who contributes to
violence and death, however indirectly (or directly) is not of itself
sufficient reason to cease distribution of the tool. This is because
even if you take the line that there is NO justification for death
and/or violence (which I gather is more or less your standard) it is not
sufficient because war and violence are not the ONLY causes of death.

The flipside is that disease and preventable accident also contribute
to death. It is therefore arguable that aiding the good (by whatever
criteria) users of FVWM may contribute to saving more lives than are
cost by aiding the bad users, given the (estimated) statistical moral
predisposition of the likely FVWM users.

Such an argument is of course dependent on the uses of the work of
the FVWM user population, and that is something you must estimate for
yourself. However, if you take the view that an evil user of FVWM is
aided by FVWM, thus placing a moral burden on you - one of its authors,
you must also accept the logic that good users of FVWM, deprived of it
by your withdrawal, are thus less effective and that this also places
a moral burden on you.

Weighing these two effects is of course something only you can do for
yourself, but both effects exist.

For myself, I think FVWM is a net win for good. I can't prove it.

I hope this gives you something new and useful to consider.

Cheers,

Hi Workers,

I would like to add some useful links to the new link page.
I think about desktop sites (deskmod), sites which offer
free background images, sites of tools like asmail,
xosview, procmeter, ... and maybe other resources, which
may enhance fvwm.

If somebody got (useful) links which should be placed on
the new link page, could you please send them to the list?
It would be nice if you provide a short description of the
link contents as well.

Regards, Uwe

I think the link to fvwm-themes should be placed on the main page.

Actually not the answer I expected. But I can do that.

BTW: I noticed the bug tracking system of fvwm. This is not
     in the fvwm-web tree. We might port it to php as well.

The bug tracking system is an actual installed application requiring
setuid binaries and such, so there's no way it could be in the CVS
tree.  I'll be investigating bugzilla for another project, so it might
be a viable alternative.  If you can implement something in PHP then I
certainly won't argue.

I would not work on a bug system now. It is really not so important now.
And I think all html templates are hardcoded in the C code anyway.

If you search for what to do next, you may work on the web design of
fvwm-themes.sf.net, just "cvs checkout fvwm-themes-web" as user uwepross
and commit. :)

After that you may create a mail archive search form or just use 2 links
to mail search from:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0301/msg00257.html

FVWM = F? Virtual Window Manger
fvwm = the FVWM window manager

FVWM is an acronym as CDE, GNOME, ...etc., it should be written with
(small) caps. It represents the all project (as CDE, GNOME,
...etc). FVWM is not a window manger it is much more (a pager, some
taskbars, some GUI builders, some utilities, ..etc.)
Basically it seems to me that FVWM is a lightweight X Desktop.

At the present time the distinction is not made in the documentation.
If we want to make the distinction we should re-read the all
documentation and replace each occurrence of fvwm (and of the ugly
Fvwm) by either fvwm or FVWM depending on the context. Of course, the
main problem is that fvwm.1 is the man page for both fvwm and FVWM.
Maybe we should rename fvwm to fvwm-wm :o/

Also we may want to write a small man page FVWM.1 with a small
introduction and the list of all the others FVWM man page and docs
with a small description (and noting that the general FVWM doc can be
found in fvwm.1). We can also add docs/COMMANDS to this man page.

I will try to fix this before 2.6, but this is difficult as the KDE
system tray is not a standard and I presume that different KDE version
can react differently. There is a system tray standard now which does
not involve the window manager (I hope that future or maybe current
version of KDE will use it).

What version of KDE do you use?

> I need more time to think.

Time is up, the uneasy silence has to end, life has to go on.  I
feel obliged to reply to some statements that have been made, some
of which are fundamentally in error.  Some of these were made in
private, but I hope nobody will be angry with me for quoting them.
And I do not want to belittle anyone by not quoting him or her.

> This is the fundamental assumption I think many of the other

I have to most fervently disagree with this opinion.  If moral
were private it had no meaning at all.  Moral must be shared by
many to make sense.  Sadly, this attitude is widespread nowadays,
at least in the society I live in.  Many people withdraw into
privacy, closing their eyes and comforting themselves with their
own morality - instead of making a difference.  Often, people who
demand ethics in public are chastised for their audacity.  I know,
being confronted with demands made by others can be uncomfortable
and is rejected violently by many people.  I firmly believe that
this society can not survive if everybody thinks (s)he can always
do as (s)he pleases.

--

> I think you should not feel any pangs of conscience by writting

I don't.  My conscience becomes important when I think about what
else I could have done with the time I spent writing software in a
moral-free space.

--

Try as I might, I simply can not understand the logic behind this
statement.  How can a place that is appropriate for exchanging cat
pictures - although it has nothing to do with the scope of fvwm, -
be inappropriate for talking about life and death?

--

> I feel I have no choice but to not install software with a
> political message.

Please do not blame that lack of choice on me.  One always has the
choices one chooses.  If I had to step on the toes of one million
people to save a single human life (*any* human life), I would do
it withouth thinking twice and not feel guilty afterwards,
although I would be sad about any dissent it brought.

--

Some people introduced the terms 'good' and 'evil' into the
discussion.

I find the notion of good and evil not only ridiculous, but I
think it is a dangerous simplification of reality.  Armed
conflicts and wars all over the world show it clearly.  Many
madmen claim to fight 'holy missions' for 'good' using it as an
excuse to commit deeds considered 'evil' by many others.  And they
never even notice when their 'enemies' claim exactly the same for
themselves, with the same rights, or rather the same lack of.

No, the ethics I demand are not brought upon people by judgement
of someone else.  They can be reached by convention only, by
spreading the idea.

--

Sorry, I do not want to hurt anybody, but I can not do this yet.

--

Finally, it has been noted by several people that making political
(I still think ethical is the right term) statements in this place
will not make any difference.  I have to disagree, and I think the
events of the last week prove it.  But surely, it is not the best
place to fight for peace either.

--

I wish I could make the right decision now, but the turmoil inside
me is too great at the moment.  As I said before, the silence has
to end.  I will abstain from the list for a week, hoping to reach
a decision by then.  I expect that this list returns to the normal
routine until then.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

P.S.:  I Noticed that I sometimes wrote the birthday was on 1st of
June and sometimes 1st of July.  I'm not sure which one is correct.
Someone should check this (fvwm was first released as part of
rxvt-0.5.something, I think).

Minor issue...

Have an app Styled Sticky and no icon.

Style XTerm Sticky 
Style *	NoIcon

Iconify it, restart and look at the pager.
Does it show the app as being open instead of iconic?

Let me know if you need more details to reproduce.

I tried to estimate how much is still to do on the fvwm-web
site. Bob and I agreed to finish all php-files for the new fvwm
site first. 
After this we want to make further layout for the site or
start working on fvwm-themes site. Maybe we can reuse the
web-site layouts from fvwm. This would reduce work a lot.

I'll keep that in mind. This might be done by writing a
small _fast_ parser in lex/yacc which is started by a
php-script. I think using grep or awk produces to much
processor load in the server machine. Maybe there are other
solutions ...

I think we should place collections of wm-icons and window
decorations on the new web site. Maybe provide download
links directly from the screenshot pages.
I am thinking about tarballs which contain pixmaps and
partial .fvwmrc configs so that the user achives what he
want fast. We need to define a naming convention for the
decoration pictures. Maybe compatible to fvwm-theme. 
Or, does such a naming convention already exist?

Shite! I was keeping quiet. I wish I hadn't said anything. I don't 
consider myself an FVWM developer at the moment, I haven't done anything 
for years but if you want my opinion here it is: I didn't sign up to the 
message about the World Trade Center attack and I won't sign up to the 
anti-war message this time. I can't forsee me putting my name to 
anything ever actually, I'm not even in the AUTHORS file. I think the 
only trace of me is a copyright on one of the wacky gradients I gave to 
my (now dead) budgie. That's the way I am.

That said I have no problem with the message being included in the next 
release and I promise to try to keep out of any future non-fvwm 
discussions on the fvwm mailing lists.

I hope everyone who wants to sign up does so without regret, if you feel 
it's the right thing to do don't worry about what others may say. You 
have to be true to yourself.

Cheers,
Tim.

Damn, I can't ignore the list right now because some important
dates are close at hand.

First, the release message of rxvt-1.1c with the fvwm-0.5 pre
release was posted on 1st of June, 1993.  Any references to 1st of
July are wrong.

Second, someone has to take care of the following since I am
determined to not lift a finger:

1) April, 10th
      * Write a short announcement message for the 1st of June and
        discuss it on fvwm-workers.
      * Write the logo competition announcement message and discuss it
        on fvwm-workers.

   Who will do this?

2) Also, someone has to make a list where to send the announcements.

   Volunteers?

3) And don't forget that the old web page needs some updates too.  At
   least it has to have a page with the logo contest rules.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Tim, thank you for your say.

Just a note, it is not an anti-war message, it is a human sympathy
message, otherwise I would not sign it, because of my ethical reasons.

On an other topic, I think everyone should be mentioned in AUTHORS,
including Joey Shutup from FvwmTheme module. I didn't see anyone updating
his entry for years, we should update them before 2.6.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think we will just switch to the new web site till May 1.
So probably announcements should wait a bit until a new design is ready,
It is ok if some pages would be still html for some time.

Another optional item in your plan:

4) Gather photos of the developers.

I already have photos of 9 developers. :)
(But not Olivier, Dan, Dominik, although I know how the last 2 look.)

Please every developer who ever contributed a patch (even it was not
really applied) or anyone who posted more than 20 messages on this list
(Neil Zanella, anyone?), send a close-up photo or two to me.

I don't really know yet what we will do with them.
Probably show on Juny 1.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Subject: FvwmForm core dump on colorset change

There appears to be a bug in repainting the label of a choice
when a colorset changes.

I have FvwmForm configured to use a colorset for text.

If I change a color in the colorset while the FvwmForm default display
is being displayed, the default form core dumps.

I've been trying to figure out whats going on, but I haven't made
any progress.

Here is the stack:

(gdb) where
#0  0x400ec014 in XSetFont () from /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6

#10 0x401ea5b0 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6

Here is the pointer "flf":

(gdb) up 4
#4  0x080540c6 in FlocaleDrawString (dpy=0x807be20, flf=0x808dac8, 
    fws=0x808da58, flags=1) at ../../fvwm2_5_7/libs/Flocale.c:1411
1411                    XmbDrawString(
(gdb) print flf
$1 = (FlocaleFont *) 0x807be20

Notice that the value for "flf" is really the value for "dpy".
The other args print OK.

I'm not sure whats going on.

Yes loading default FVWM font is slow (at least with XFree-4.x x < 3).
The default FVWM font:

#define FLOCALE_MB_FALLBACK_FONT \
	"-*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-*," \
	"-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*," \
	"-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*"
/* rationale: -*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-* should gives "fixed" in
   most non multibyte charset (?).
   -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-* is ok for jsx
   -*-medium-r-normal-*-16-* is for gb
*/

is too general but try to handle any situation. If the patch I sent
to XFree has been well applied I hope that loading such a general font
is really faster with XFree-4.3, there is/was(?) a bug in font
matching (I only check that they apply the fix to an enormous memory
leak in XCreateFontSet).
If you specialize your font I hope that font loading is really faster:

*FvwmPager: font -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-iso8859-15

or

*FvwmPager: font fixed

No?

What we can do is to add a default font for each known locale.
Or when loading the "default" font we can first try to add
the locale charset to FLOCALE_MB_FALLBACK_FONT.

Regards, Olivier

Can you give more detail? XFree version, FvwmPager config (the
fonts config line) and the output of "PrintInfo locale".
XCreateFontSet can be slow in some situation (XFree-4.3 has

but 0.2 seconds seems enormous.

5x7 is a bad font name :o) a better name is:
   -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--7-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
this way a user which use your config with a locale charset
!= iso8859-1 will have a font with the good locale charset.

Using font set is useful for the following 2 reasons:

- It is the only way I know (but xft) which allows to render
correctly multibyte text.
- *And* fonts are loaded in an intelligent way: say that your
locale charset is "foo-x" and you ask the font
     -*-fixed-bold-r-*-14-*
then with fontset a font which match
     -*-fixed-medium-r-*-14-*-foo-x
will be loaded. With font struct the loaded font will depend
on your X install and the loaded font will probably match:
     -*-fixed-bold-r-*-14-*-iso8859-1
(and I want a font which match -*-fixed-bold-r-*-14-*-iso8859-15).

In fact font set is not useful in the following situation:
The font is not a multibyte font _and_ you specify the charset
in the font name.

It will be very easy to disable the use of font set: Just return null
at the beginning of FlocaleGetFontSet in Flocale.c. So we may easily add
a --disable-fontset configure option. However, I am not sure this is
a great idea.
What we can do:

  1. Using: "-*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*," \
           "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*," \
           "-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
    as default font really speed-up default font loading
  2. If a font name contains the charset and it is != from the X locale
    charset use a font struct.
  3. Optional: If a font name contains the charset and it is not multibyte
    use a font struct (need a new entries in  the FlocaleCharsetTable).
    This not really needed has there is no "speed" problem here.
  Note: These 2 workarounds will not handle the case of aliased font name
        as fixed, 5x7 ...etc. Again using such name in a config file is bad,
        bad, bad! 
  4. Optional: adding a new flags in FVWM font name "nofontset" (to be put
     in the same place as encoding= and shadow=) to forbid the use of
     fontset.

I've committed 1. I will do 2. soon. If you want I can do 4. and I am
not sure that 3. is a good idea at all.

I am really surprised with your 0.2 sec pbs. XCreateFontSet can be slow
but 0.2 sec seems enormous. I will be interested to know if you still
have this 0.2 sec pbs after my "fixed the default font name" commit.
Also, can you send the output of "PrintInfo locale". Maybe your X locale
charset is iso8859-15 (which can be != from your locale charset, e.g.,
iso8859-1, this is not a pb). Then loading some iso8859-1 fonts (fixed
and 5x7 are in general iso8859-1) can be really slow. This will be
partially fixed by 2.

Regards, Olivier

PS1: It seems that I've a few mail pb, my mails arrive with some
     delays.

PS2: Here a few tests (on my new 2GHz P-IV laptop):

THE TEST: loading/unloading 100 times a font with XCreateFontSet
          The locale X charset is iso8859-15

* With the old default FVWM font:
    "-*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-*,\
    -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*,-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*"
 
   - With XFREE-4.3.0: 0.17 sec
   - With XFREE-4.2.1: 2.05 sec

  Note the big difference (thanks to me :o)

* With the new default FVWM font:
  "-*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*," \
  "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*," \
  "-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

  - With XFREE-4.3.0: 0.17 sec
  - With XFREE-4.2.1: 0.34 sec

* With -*-fixed-*-iso8859-15:

  - With XFREE-4.3.0: 0.15 sec
  - With XFREE-4.2.1: 0.15 sec

* With -*-fixed-*-iso8859-1 (no matching font!! my locale X charset
  is iso8859-15):

  - With XFREE-4.3.0: 2.63 sec
  - With XFREE-4.2.1: 6.02 sec 

This is the really bad situation. 2) will fix it.

Several notes about web pages.

Autogenerated lines in cvs files is not a good idea.
For example autogenerated Last-Modified-Date or Author or History only
lead to unnecessary cvs conflicts (if 2 people work on different parts of
the same file). This belongs to ChangeLog and/or cvs web interface, not
to a file content. Similarly about cvs variables like $Id, $Log.

The last character of text files in cvs should better be EOLN, otherwise
a probability of cvs conflicts (unnecessarily) grows. Please force whole
lines.

This is not just theoretical issues, I actually got such cvs conflicts.

BTW, in some new pages I used a style that we use for our C/Perl code,
i.e. one TAB for indentation, always a space after a comma and so on.

Finally, I really like a progress in moving to a new design.
I just don't understand yet everything and it seems there are bugs.
I plan to convert manpages and perllib documentation.

Regards,
Mikhael.

What do you mean by "auto"? In the new version there is not
and it was not planed to autogenerate anything. 

In the new version some file for example author information
or latest news *may* be created from the corresponding
files (AUTHOR, NEWS) in the fvwm tree. I have provided
awk-scripts for this. 

> For example autogenerated Last-Modified-Date 

The new version of the layout file inserts the last
modified date of the actual file automatically. The time
is taken from the file's timestamp on the webserver.

Since those files are created from the corresponding files
of the fvwm tree, the conflicts should be not too big.

Agree $Id, $Log should not apear in the web files.

I don't see the point here, but I think emacs can do that
automatically. I will have a look how this can be done.

For indentation I use corresponding modes in emacs. It
indents text automatically. I will check the files
according to this style conventions.

Converting the old html-pages to a w3c-conform html takes
time. Some old pages are far away for standard html:

http://www.mirror.ac.uk/services/validator/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-user.tu-chemnitz.de%2F%7Euwp%2Ffvwm-web%2Fcvs.html

I don't like to put broken html on the new page.

I hope not ;-)

I did not have time to make a short documentation how the
new php concept works (except a mail addressed to parv and
fvwm-workers a couple of weeks ago) and how new sites are
added/modified on the new web tree. 
I will do that in a while.

Just some notes here:
- You need a php web server which you grants write access
  to the file navgen_write/navigation.inc
- After designing a new page you need to run navgen.php on
  your web server to update the navigation array which is
  stored in the file navgen_write/navigation.inc.
  navgen.php reports warnings and errors on the site
  structure.
  With no errors and warnings the output of navgen should
  look like
  http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/navgen.php
  The new version of php provides a command line interface
  which allows to process php-files without a web server.
  To use this CLI with navgen some adaptions are neccessary
  since the environment is different. Im going to change
  navgen so that it runs on a web server and on the CLI.
- After cleaning the problems reported by navgen please
  check your new site with the html and css checker. It
  will tell you what's not html/css-conform on your site.
  BTW: Both of your news sites passed this check :-)

If you just make a new page and commit it without running
navgen. Your site won't work as expected in most cases.

> I plan to convert manpages and perllib documentation.

Actually I am working on the creation of the manpage files
at the moment. At least yesterday night ;-)

The problem is that man2html produces non standard html. I
found a tool http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ which can clean
this html afterwards. 

I planed to write a new script or rewrite the actual script
which makes some further adaption to get a nice manpage
files for the fvwm web site.

Since I might not have time till weekend you could do the
manpage conversion script. 

Please let me know if you are going to do it so that I can
send you some dones, ideas and plannings.

Regards, Uwe

No, I didn't mean files that are fully generated, only files that are
mostly written by hand but contain lines (meta information) that should
be updated on every file change.

Ideally, all meta information should be outside of the file contents,
but of course there may be exceptions, for example some web pages may
contain text "This page was last updated on XXX" as part of the content.
But this text at least serves some purpose, not is just a comment.

For example, I don't yet understand why sometimes lines inside a
window-based decorations are wrapped as if there is a table that is 30%
or similar of the whole window decoration width.

Also there is a broken layout and uninformative error when there are
consistency problems in $parent and $this on different pages. But you
probably fixed this.

I think you refer to the old php. Let's just suppose everyone has
a new php and thus a command line php utility, so granting any write
access to the web server is not needed.

The problem with this is that you should first commit and only after some
time (it is updated once in several hours) check out fvwm.org or
fvwm.sf.net, because links like "file://..." or "http://localhost/"
can't be checked.

Is there a validator that accepts input (say, as a form field) instead of
url? This is not urgent and not very important at all.

I planned only to convert html to php, i.e. to continue with man2html.

If you think it is not good enough, you may try tidy. Just, as you
said the current script does dozens of small fixes of both .1 and
the resulting .html, so the output becomes correct and usable.

I also planned to have this structure:

  documentation/manpages - links to stable and unstable, and to perllib
  documentation/manpages/stable - contains man pages of 2.4.x
  documentation/manpages/unstable - contains man pages of 2.5.x

  documentation/perllib - links to stable and unstable, and to manpages
  documentation/perllib/stable - contains man pages of 2.4.x
  documentation/perllib/unstable - contains man pages of 2.5.x

(Should we shorten "documentation" to "doc"?)

Since everything is autogenerated, I see no problems to have both
stable and unstable versions of man pages on the web.

I will wait for your answer about whether you want to try tidy or not
before starting to do this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, this is the way that structure is defined on my Solaris 8 system:

/usr/dt/share/include/Xm/MwmUtil.h:

typedef struct
{
    /* These correspond to XmRInt resources. (VendorSE.c) */
    int          flags;
    int          functions;
    int          decorations;
    int          input_mode;
    int          status;
} MotifWmHints;

Its the same on HPUX.11.  On AIX 5.1 the one in
/usr/include/Motif2.1/Xm/MwmUtil.h
is the same, but they have the old Motif 1.2 where it was:

/usr/include/Motif1.2/Xm/MwmUtil.h:

typedef struct
{
#ifndef OSF_v1_2_4
    long        flags;
    long        functions;
    long        decorations;
#else /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
    /* These correspond to XmRInt resources. (VendorSE.c) */
    int          flags;
    int          functions;
    int          decorations;
#endif /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
    int         input_mode;
#ifndef OSF_v1_2_4
    long        status;
#else /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
    int          status;
#endif /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
} MotifWmHints;

So it looks like "int" is the way to go.  What is the "ulong"
solution based on?

Do you see some improvement since my last commit "Load a FontSet only when
this is reasonable"?

Hi Mikhael,

Do you mean the actual version numbers of fvwm for example?
This may be obtained automatically from fvwm-cvs/ftp or we
place a meta information file in the tree where some
php-variables are set like:
<?php
$stable_version = "2.4.16"
$unstable_version = "2.5.6" 
?>
This file could be included in the php files as needed.

In the actual version the last update time is placed on the
bottom of the page. This time is obtained from the
timestamp of the php file to be displayed. So no need to
place update information in the php itself.

I realized this yesterday when I started porting the module
information page. I fixed it this morning. The table inside
the window decoration did not have a width attribute. I
have set it to 100% which means the contents uses 100% of
the windows width.

Navgen fixed this problem silently before. Now a warning is
given if the definitions in parent and child does not
match. Also I removed an error message on the web site if
the actual paged does not belong to the navigation array.
In the actual version the value of $this_page is set to the
first element of the $top_array which is the home page. This
new behaviour avoids displaying unecessary error messages.

Okay. If you think this is not too much restriction I will
try to make navgen run in the CLI environment.

Yes, I got the same problems when I wrote sites at home.

The tidy program is even more restrictive than the web
validator and can be used with wget like:

wget -q -O - http://localhost/fvwm-web/download/index.php | tidy -errors -q

will show you errors on the file. You may want to hide the
links to the validiation pages for this request since they
produce warnings. The links are inserted from
layout_default.inc and may be not inserted when the request
comes from localhost or your host name. Please check this
files the links are hidden for the web checkers already.
You can check which php-variable can be used to hide the links
by viewing the file php_info on your webserver and find out
what is specific to your server.

For the first time we can use the current script and run
tidy afterwards. After this we need to replace the header
and footer of the html output and replace it with a php
header and php footer. I wrote templates for this. You
could add the tidy run and the header/footer-exchange to
the current script. 
I planed to extend the current so that certain keywords on
the files will be converted to links to other man pages.
For example all occurences of FvwmTaskBar will be replaced
by a link to the FvwmTaskBar manpage. This is done in all
manpages except the FvwmTaskBar manpage itself.
But this a fancy feature and can wait ;-)

Good idea. No worries. I would like to remove the perlib
documentation from the module information site and place it
separately. 
 
> (Should we shorten "documentation" to "doc"?)

You can do that if you like. I actually prefer long names
for variables and files. I use xemacs which provides a
expand function so that I don't have to write the name each
time. That's why I rather use long names which gives me a
rough idea what the variable/function/file does. But doc is
also expressive ;-)

Agree.

I convert the developers information tree currently. So
it would be nice if you could do the man pages. After this
we should have almost finished it ;-)

BTW: One thing I forgot to mention yesterday. I saw that you
used a identifier containing spaces in your php file like:

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// Site definitions
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
$title          = "FVWM - Logo Competition";
$heading        = "FVWM - Logo Competition";
$link_name      = "Logo Competition";
$link_picture   = "pictures/icons/logo_competition";
$parent_site    = "news";
$child_sites    = array();
$requested_file = basename(my_get_global("PHP_SELF","SERVER"));
$this_site      = "logo competition";  
                      ^^
The value of $this_site is used as name of a php array.
Navgen would produce php-code like
...
$logo competition["parent_site"] = ...
...
 
Currently navgen does not check if the identifier given in
$this_site are valid.
So the contents of this_site must be a valid identifier
according to programming languages.

I will add a check for this to navgen shortly.

Dan or someone else, can you please do this?

You may place birthday-announcement file into cvs if you decide so,
similarly to the current birthday-planing and logo-competition.

I think we should use the acronym spelling (FVWM) in the official
announcements.

Sigh, I can't leave this uncommented.  I am totally against
re-introducing the FVWM vs. fvwm vs. Fvwm vs. [fF][vV][wW][mM]
confusion again.  It cost me many hours of work to reach a
consistent state on the web pages and in all documentation I am
aware of and I would not give it away without very good reasons.
I don't think that "it looks better in capitals" qualifies as said
kind of reason.

I cannot reproduce this (can you send your .FvwmForm file?).
What about adding a 

	CheckAlloc(item,dt_ptr);

at line 1532 of FvwmForm.c (just after case I_CHOICE:)?
Just an idea which has not been thought!

I'm using FvwmForm-Talk and FvwmForm-Form both as packaged with Fvwm.

On the FvwmForm-Form I have "Color of text" "colorset" set to 0.
If I then go to FvwmForm-Talk and do:

Colorset 0 fg blue

(Providing the color is not already blue)
The default form dies.

There are only 3 variants of spelling, not 16.
And most of the official places use and always used "FVWM" spelling
(web, mailing lists, cvs commits, bug tracking).

I didn't oppose your usage of "fvwm in the middle of sentences and Fvwm
in the beggining of sentences" and I continue to use this convention in
the main man page and some other technical places. Although this suggests
"fvwm" is not a term, but a regular English word that is not the case.
I think it would be more informative to use the convention suggested by
Olivier that only uses "fvwm" and "FVWM" to distinguish between 2 things.

Anyway, I speak here about non-technical announcements that are written
in English and any human language requires acronyms to be written as
capitals (i.e. GNU, not Gnu or gnu).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think without active users and supporters no project is possible.
So if you count yourself as an active supported and want to be on the
list - welcome.

Please everyone who contributed to the project, send me a picture,
so we know whom to thank. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi there,

I have added an alternate stylesheet to my local version  of
the fvwm webpage. 

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/index.php

With mozilla it can be selected with 
 View -> Use Style -> Sunshine
For most other browser there won't be any difference.

Since I think it could be not liked by some people I have
not commited it yet.

Please let me know what you think about it. We could provide
css variants in addition to different layouts.

Regards, Uwe

Yes, its very ugly, but the concept is neat.

I notice that a page reload makes it go away.

I'm looking for the black stone to come back as the desktop
background.  Fvwm-themes has some variations on the black stone
is some other colors that might look nice.

I did not have time to choose some good looking colors and
styles. But I like the concept as well. Its a kind of a
hidden feature ;-) 
I think mozilla is the only one which can do this.?

	Hmm...it turns out that Netscape 7, Netscape 6 (at least 6.2), and
Opera 7 also support this, so there should be a lot of people who can

was released yesterday working on my machine....)


Cheers,
Bob

By meta information I mean the multiline header in all php files.
For example the line: //-  Last modified : <09.04.2003 08:14:03 uwp>
This belongs to the revision control system, it manages it automatically
without a need to store this meta information in the file body itself.

This fancy feature is already done, isn't it? All .B FvwmTaskBar or
.I FvwmTaskBar are replaced with a link to its man page.

Currently, it is 50/50 for me. Both are good...

Yes, but I didn't use a space here, I used "logo_competition_rules" and
"logo_competition" names, I meant to use the last one in both cases.

This means that if you have redefined WindowListFunc like:

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc   WindowListFunc
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 WindowShade off
  + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 10p

please replace it with:

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc   WindowListFunc
  + I Raise
  + I WindowShade off
  + I WarpToWindow 50 10p

I think we may support only the second version in the future.

I will backport this to 2.4.x, so I may start to suggest a new syntax.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You are right. I haven't think on the header in the files.
My emacs updates this header automatically each time I save
a buffer. I have removed this line in all files.

I thought I have found some examples where this link was
not made. For example in the FvwmButtons Manpage there is a
"FvwmPager" which is not a link.

No worries, was just a note. I have thought to remove this
restriction anyway by using a two-dimensional array.

Are you doing the man page conversion for the new web site?

Hi Mikhael,

That's good. 

To support passing of different layouts between fvwm-sites relative
links should be done like:

<a href="<?php echo conv_link_target('stable/fvwm_man.php');?>">fvwm</a>

This uses the php-function conv_link_target which must be defined in
the actual layout file. Please check if your pages propagate the
actual layout definition to other pages:

http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/manpages/index.php?layout=plain

I am going to write some developer information on the new website
about the layout interface, html-conventions, image names, .... 
Hopefully I find the time to do that today.

Before that I am going to finish the entry documentation page. This
might be done tonight.

When the man pages and the doc page are ready, we might put the first
version online ;-)

I think it will be much more simple for us and more convenient/consistent
for a user if we don't use/pass GET parameters to define all kinds of
layouts, themes, css-s. Yes, I really mean this. Only use session values
that are valid for the entire site per user. Users with write cookies
turned off only get the default layout or the last stored layout (some
users enable cookies temporarily only to store settings once).

This is a good practice. This way, external sites may link to:

  http://fvwm.org/documentation/manpages/stable/

and different users will see it differently depending on their previous
settings.

I am really concerned about how external and internal links look.
I don't like very much if the links include any GET parameters.

Of course you may optionally implement a logic that if GET parameters are
defined they are used (override) the user settings. But by default no url
should contain these parameters, i.e. normally the user layout should not
be passed in the link.

Probably on April 20 if everything goes well.

Someone should write announcements.

I don't see any bad issues by passing parameters via url.  This is not
mandatory - It is a feature. I have discussed with Bob about using
cookies about two weeks ago and we agreed to implement it when we have
fot the time. 
For now GET parameters are implemented and can be used. An automatic
selection using cookies should not be that difficult to set up. I
have planned to make a separate page which contains all available
layouts from which the user may decide if he wants do set a cookie. I
don't like to force the user to enable cookies.

A user which comes from a external site gets the default layout. If he
changes the default settings he may bookmark it or does it again at
next time he views the pages.

Changing the layout and keep it changed when viewing subpages is a
feature I haven't seen on any other web site. With the parameters in
the url the user can see how this is been done.

The layout defs are only passed in the link if the user has changed it.

Anyway, I think even if we don't use parameter passing via url it is
good to use the wrapper function "conv_link_target" since it makes it
possible to manipulate relative links inside the php-scripts. This
function can just return its argument or append layout definitions as
we wish. 
Further one could generate a html version of the php-tree by changing
the link target from *php to *html and rip the whole tree using wget.

It should be possible to get all pages ready be this time. But I won't
have any time between 18 and 21 April. 
Removing index.html in the root directory should be the only thing to
do. Maybe we can put a .htaccess file in the root directory which says
the server should serve index.php before index.html, so we can keep
the old version fully. I don't know if the server supports this.

Regards, Uwe

Suppose someone wants to post (or include in his site) a link to the
FvwmButtons man page. If he copies it and it has "?layout=something", all
users are forced to read it using this specific layout that some may find
unreadable. This is bad.

Now, suppose he is smart enough to post a link with everything after "?"
stripped. Now all users are forced to see the default layout. This is not
the best thing to do either.

The best possible way IMO is not to have any GET parameters in url and
use stored session values only (if any).

Sure, I have no objections to this.

Moving index.html to old-index.html would be enough.

One more thing. It would be nice to have 404.php (configured in apache)
that shows an error and suggests to go to the home page. It may also
include a match table that maps the old url to the new one to suggest it.
A possible auto redirection may be used, but this is arguable.

Mikhael.

How about somebody wants to put a link to the button page with exact
a specific layout?
I think we should support both. By default the user will be asked to
set a cookie to store a layout definition. But we may offer the
possibility to access different layout via GET parameters. Maybe the
user is asked to type this url by hand. If GET parameters are given we
can assume that the user wants a specific layout and use it instead of
default or cookie settings. In that case it may be useful to pass
this parameters to sub pages. (We may also hide the parameters from
the url and store it in a cookie automatically. But I don't like that 
that much.)

For example I often copy bookmark files from home to work or vise
versa.  I could want to have the layout stored in the bookmark or have
it stored in cookie what may be different on the browsers. The same is
if I use the same bookmarks with different browsers. I think it is a
matter of taste.
 
A third possibility is a session function in php. I think in a session
one can pass variables from page to page. It should be intended for
online shops. Since I haven't used it yet I don't know much more. I
will check the php docu and have some tries. It might be not bad.

Does the server return the file /404.php if the requested page is not
on the server? I have to read some apache docu to learn how this works.

I think that this is the best thing to do.

It returns the result of whatever is configured in ErrorDocument 404.
It may be configured to use a redirection or a local substitution (this
differs in which url of the missing page a user gets). I prefer a
substitution, i.e. /generated/FAQ.html shows the result of /error/404.php

You can put "ErrorDocument 404 /some/url" in a .htaccess file and
check that in; it should work.

This means that if you have FvwmEvent configuration like this:

  *FvwmEvent: PassId
  *FvwmEvent: raise_window  RestoreWindow
  *FvwmEvent: deiconify     RestoreWindow
  *FvwmEvent: dewindowshade RestoreWindow

  AddToFunc RestoreWindow
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 (XTerm) WindowShade off

you may freely replace it with:

  *FvwmEvent: raise_window  RestoreWindow
  *FvwmEvent: deiconify     RestoreWindow
  *FvwmEvent: dewindowshade RestoreWindow

  AddToFunc RestoreWindow
  + I Raise
  + I Iconify off
  + I ThisWindow (XTerm) WindowShade off

I will backport this to 2.4.x, so I may start to suggest a new syntax.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've make some test and I cannot reproduce problems (KDE 3.0.3).
You say "Often the icons are misplaced", can you be more precise
("operation" which cause misplacement, type of misplacement ...).

What happen if you restart fvwm (Restart does not work with my
KDE, but "Restart fvwm" should work as well as killing fvwm and
start fvwm).

I am troubled by the KAlarm problem. If you have some times you
can edit fvwm/ewmh.c and uncomment the line

/* #define DEBUG_KST */

and re-install fvwm. Then, you will have "KST" debug msg on
stderr as:

ADD_TO_KST: 0x1200017
ADD_TO_KST: 0x1200017 0x2000009
KST_UNMAP: 0x1200017
KST_UNMAP: 0x2000009
...

These msg may help me.

Regards, Olivier

Okay, I accept this (but I do not agree) given that someone else
takes care of the work it entails (sending a mail to the fvwm
list, collecting the names and packaging the releases).  I don't
promise anything about my participation in this project for the
future, though.

The failed build message was huge, so instead of approving the whole
thing I'll just quote the error:

rm -f FvwmScript.ar.gmo && /usr/bin/msgfmt -c --statistics -o FvwmScript.ar.gmo FvwmScript.ar.po
error while opening "FvwmScript.ar.po" for reading: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [FvwmScript.ar.gmo] Error 1

Perhaps my test environment is hosed somehow?

No it was my fault. I hope that this is fixed now.

Subject: xfs fonts in title bars and menus don't change size

Full_Name: Jeff Solomon
Version: 2.5.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: RH8.0 2.4.18-14smp
X_Server: XFree86 4.2.0-72
Submission from: (NULL) (204.176.21.196)


I just installed 2.5.6 specifically because of the xft font support.

First of all, it looks great! You guys rock!

Something that I have noticed is that the size of the font used in both the
title bars and menus doesn't seem to respect the value that I set in the
xft font (neither "size" nor "pixelsize"). Here is the font I use:

  xft:Bitstream Charter:Medium:Roman:size=8:minspace=True

While the font size of the icon manager changes as I vary "size", the fonts
on the title bar and menus do not.

I have a screenshot of it which I'd like to attach, but I'm not sure that's
possible. I'll make the shot available somewhere on the web if I can't
attach it.

All pages seem to be converted. The new design is pretty usable now
although it does not have yet all planned extra features.

Please test it at http://fvwm.org/index.php

I think we may make it the default today.

The old pages may still be here, but they should be removed in some
near future after error404 supports the old-to-new url mapping.

BTW, thanks to Uwe who did all the design scripting.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It seems that including DirectoryIndex line in .htaccess gives Internal
Error 500 on fvwm.org (only). This line also somehow makes all php (even
if explicitly specified) to throw error 500 too. It is hard to know what
happens without seeing error_log.

Jason, can you please make DirectoryIndex override-able?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ahem, before that happens, a couple of important things have to
happen:

 1) Any windows-like decorations have to vanish.  Especially the
    big X in title button 1.
 2) The number of icons on the page has to reduce dramatically.
 3) Is *must* be possible to get to the logo competition rules
    without loading a page that shows all the submitted logos.

And I think it would look better if the pager bar started below
the page title, not at the top of the page:

I don't see currently any windows-like decorations, just cde-like ones.
I think that a missing close button is a feature (misfeature) of CDE/MWM,
it has nothing to do with our window manager that is configurable.

Besides, this "X" has a purpose, it is used to switch to another (plain)
layout, try it. :)

I thought about other buttons, something like:

  menu button - may open a real menu using javascript that for example
    shows a list of layouts (themes) and navigation tools to choose from
  maximize button - may disable pager (WindowList-like navigation?)
  close button - closes windows and pager like now

I also thought about using the maximize button to switch to plain layout,
but it's probably less intuitive for a random user. I let Uwe to decide.

I am not sure how this "X" may be confused with Windows. It is everywhere
now for usability. Does Windows support vector drawing? It is drawn from:

  ButtonStyle 2 Vector 17 \
    25x25@1 35x25@1 50x40@1 65x25@1 75x25@1 75x35@0 \
    60x50@0 75x65@1 75x75@0 65x75@0 50x60@0 35x75@0 \
    25x75@0 25x65@0 40x50@1 25x35@0 25x25@1

I think the following close button may look nicer, but less official:

  ButtonStyle 2 Vector 16 \
    20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 \
    60x50@0 80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 \
    20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1

>  2) The number of icons on the page has to reduce dramatically.

I think that we need an alternative navigation to the pager
(WindowList like or other). But the default may be a pager.

The plain layout is very fast, when a user sets it (later), it is
used for the entire site forever.

Alternativelly an option may be used to disable all pager icons
(but then the pager will not be compact and nice).

The logo-competition/index page does not show any submitted logos, just
2 links, to the previous logos and to new ones (to be submitted yet).

I have no opinion here. I think the pager will not look nicer/more usable
if there is a void space. But maybe Uwe may suggest some nice layout. :)

I don't really see any of these as show stoppers. What others think?

Mikhael.

It looks like a great improvement to me.

Hello.

I have got a report that FVWM 2.4 does not work with GNOME2.
Can anyone comment on this?

The window decorations don't render properly in Netscape 6 under Windows.
There is a grey border around, as if to much space is "reserved" before
drawing.
It works in IE 6, though...
And using Mozilla 1.4beta (Linux) works nicely.

But it has something to do with M$ Windows which introduced the X.
And I consider it a misfeature of said GUI.  Why do you need two
such buttons, one on the left and one on the right?

Yes, I tried it before, and it's a very good place to hide
something so that nobody will ever discover it is there.  I don't
get the connection between a "close window" button and the "change
layout" function either.

Unless there is a big, fat, flashing arrow pointing to the buttons
saying "press here", people will discover the functions of the
window buttons only by chance.

The icons on the front page serve no purpose and are too small.
Even if they were bigger I would not be able to determine what
clicking on them does.  Currently the icons serve no purpose, slow
down loading of the page and make it more difficult to focus on
the important information.  In other words:  they are un-fvwm-ish.

I see.  Then it should be made clear that the images are links,
not logos.  Even after looking at the page again I did not
understand that this is not the gallery of submissions.

> I don't really see any of these as show stoppers. What others think?

I don't understand why we suddenly have to hurry.  There were a
number of things that were far more important to get done before
June that nobody cared about (like informing some magazines of
the birthday).

--

I've attached a screen shot that shows grey bars between the
window border and the title (same with the pager).  And there are
thick black bars between the desks of the pager.  Not sure if
they are there on purpose, but I think at most three or four
pixels are enough.  Currently it's a waste of space.

Some more bugs/typos on the pages:

 - The mailing list desk in the pager is labeled "Mailing Lis"
   Maybe the 't' is just out of the visible area.
 - The script that generated the page from the AUTHORS file ate
   up some of the whitespace , e.g. "emulation of" became
   "emulationof".  Probably the line breaks in the original
   entries.
 - The NEWS page always tries to be wider than the browser window.
   To access the pager at all, I have to use the scroll bar.
   Same on desktops.php and faq.php.
 - What exactly is the difference between the FVWM Screenshots
   page and desktops.php?  Looks like a duplicate page to me.
 - On the "Documentation" page there are some small pictures
   standing for the subsections.  The "man pages" picture 
 - There is no link to the mailing list archives in the pager,
   only in the "Quick jump" section.
 - I really dislike the nested pagers when descending too far down
   the pager hierarchy.  As far as i can see, it is used only on
   the "Developer Info" pages.  I'd rather have a whole new desk
   in the pager for it.
 - More superfluous icons on the Developer Info page.
 - The NEWS page is not up to date.
 - The birthday announcement is missing on the front page.

Bye

	Grrr!  Your [Mozilla 1.0] screen shot shows the same browser bug that
Marcus Lundblad reported in Netscape 6. Interestingly, this worked fine
in Netscape 4.7, and is fixed again in Netscape 7 (and as he reports, in
Mozilla 1.4beta).

	I suppose we'll have to find a way to hack around this bug, though.
There are still a lot of people using those versions of Netscape &
Mozilla.


Cheers,
Bob

It is not me, but I think it is stripped to 11 chars on purpose.

Fixed.

NEWS "fixed". Desktops improved, but it should be really reformatted
not to contain any <pre>.

Still, if someone sets a too narrow window or too large fonts this always
can happen with any page especially if it uses <pre> ot tables.

I think you speak about index.html and desktops.php, you should
instead see index.php and desktops.php. It is a temporary problem
that desktops.php links to ./ that currently defaults to index.html
on fvwm.org. Currently use Back button to return, not the pager.

I think this sentense is not complete. I don't see a problem with
the "Documentation" page and the "man pages" picture.

You probably mean it is a picture shot from 2.4.x, not 2.5.x.

It should be of course done later. There will be a page that links to all
mailing list archives and searches on the web, there are several with
some advantages and disadvatages. Maybe some search form too.

No opinion here, and I do not do the section coding anyway :).
It probably may be done like you suggest later.

>  - More superfluous icons on the Developer Info page.

I think it is good to have one "item" icon for the main page and this
page. It will be loaded only once and will be cached for other pages.
I will try to find a nice "item" icon.

Both done.

I made up my mind while writing it and forgot to delete it.  I
wanted to say that the first thing that I noticed was the
"[-blackout]" option on the picture which is the one option that
is only supplied for backward compatibility.  Not really
important, just odd.

Sorry. Original report was not clear and full transcript consists of
three messages available from provided URL. Here an excerpt from the
last message goes:

Sadly this is not true. If you use gnome-session from gnome2 it will
hang for a few minutes waiting a timeout (I think it does not realize
that a window manager has been started).
See http://fvwm-ewmh.sourceforge.net/ for details.
...
It would fix my problem (I *did* try building an unofficial package for
fvwm 2.5 but I haven't been able to make it compile...) but please
remember that fvwm 2.4 cannot be used by gnome2 users.

The shot looks alright to me. Could you send a larger shot
to make to problem clearer? I use mozilla 1.2 and cannot see
any problems.

I stripped the desktop name to the first 11 or 12 characters
to limit the width of the pager.
This can be removed if it is not liked.

The mailing list archive does not belong to the
php-tree. Currently only pages php within the php tree are
displayed in the pager. It makes not that much sense to have
"external" pages displayed in the pager since the pager will
disapear when you go to them.

This may lead to a new layout style. The php-pages descibe a
navigation structure which is displayed by the layout
files. We may add a new layout which displays the nav
structure as you like.

The icons I used were just suggestions. I expected a
discussion about it.

Before the last change, there was about three times as much space
above and below the page title.  That looked much better.

Okay, let's discuss it.  I think we do not need icons in the main
page area.  If people want icons to navigate they can click on the
pager.  In the text area they just mess up the layout without
providing easier access.


By the way, I suggest to reshuffle the links on the front page
like this:

Left side - project related information, sorted by importance

  Features
  FAQ
  Bug Reporting
  Mailing Lists
  Mailing List Archive
  Man pages
  Authors
  Developer Info

Right side - downloads and external links

  Download
  Decors
  Desktops
  Menus
  FVWM Themes
  Icons and Sounds
  Links
  Other Important Info ^_^

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

This a layout suggestion in the style of fvwm vector
buttons. It shows a possible fvwm window decoration. We may
add more or less buttons if or use graphical window
decoration like:
http://www.fvwm.org/index.php?decoration_path=pictures/decorations/window_deco_ice

I put it on the "x" to close the window decoration. To put
it there was thought to be a fancy hidden feature. 
When I had the window layout inside my browser I tried
intuitively to press one of the window buttons ;-)

More layouts may be accessable via a separate layout
page. Which allows one to specify how layout information are
passed to sub pages (cookie, get, session, maybe post).

You really want to have javascript on the fvwm web page?

This can be done, but may take a while.

Currently I convert the layout defintion to php classes so
that further layouts can be derived from a layout base
class. Once this is done - we can easily make further
layouts with windowlist or other navigation styles.

Yes, you right. I thought it as a fancy add-on. I have removed
them for now.

The remaining space is wanted to separate the different desktops.

This can be done. It is not that fast to make since you want
to mix internal and external links. I have got a solution in
mind but it is a bit work - maybe tonight.

The Title on the background seems redundant with a similar title
so close to it in the window titlebar.

How about eliminating the title on the background?
It doesn't fit into the desktop metaphor.

I read all the links and this mail, and I'm still not sure what the
problem is.

Is the problem the hang?

Is the problem that it won't compile?

That's right, but a page should a have a proper title. The
title on the window decoration maybe empty or there are more
than one windows on one page.

How about making a FvwmButtonBar to display the title? It
could look more like a fvwm desktop.

Agreed, but on the other pages we need some place for a prominent
page title.

I only see one page with 2 windows (Logo competition).
I think it would look better as one window.

(I think the 2 big logos on the lower window look like the
only logos we have.  I had to hesitate a bit before I knew
I was supposed to click on them.)

Maybe if it said "View Old Logos".

Sounds interesting.

Speaking of multiple windows on a page, I just noticed that
the pager makes it look like every page has 2 windows on it.
Not that it bothers me.

How come none of these links are underscored?

When I switch styles and then use the pager to go to a new
page or reload the page, it reverts to the original style.
Is that a problem on my end?

Why can't all the pages use the titlebar for the page title.

I run Mozilla with tabs.  I have the title in Mozilla's Titlebar,
in the tab, on the page above the window and on the page in the
simulated title bar.

I think its a little bit "over titled".

This can be changed. 
BTW: The pager on the web can only look like a pager on fvwm.
     The behaviour can be imitated only.

css definitions.

Changing the style using mozilla "View -> Use Style ..."? 

It is normal that this setting is discarded when you move to
subpages. To remain settings we must define a layout like
plain or default.

I will make a layout suggestion on this so we can decide if
this will be the default layout.

I didn't want to comment on this. But I think the decision to combine
2 opposite actions in one button (window operation menu and close) was
a tragic error. This makes this button both dangerous for a menu and
inconvenient for close (double click with a menu poping in the middle).
If you have a mouse with a trembling button 1 you know what it means. :)

It is just so much convenient to have a separate close button. I am for
one is (was) addict for this cde-ish behaviour and I still have the menu
that closes a window, because I have a good mouse now. :)
But I mostly close a window with a comfort using the "X" button.

  menu button - Menu pops immediatelly on press, Close on double click
  close button - Delete on "C", Destroy on "D" and Nop on "M" and "H"

The close button is very convenient and it does not duplicate things.
You may even cancel the closing if you changed your mind after a press.

Fancy hidden feature, and functional too. I like it. :)

Good idea, this page may in the same section with Links, and the section

Let's drop this idea for now.

I have a javascript code that popups a menu. It may be nice, but not
really an important thing.

The logic is, if javascript is disabled or unsupported, it does nothing,
otherwise it opens a popup (it is not a <select> popup, it is better).

Not urgent in the next months at all.

I don't disagree in principle.  It's just that a 12 point font in
a window title does not match my definition of 'prominent'.  We'd
have to blow up the window title to a ridiculous height, including
the buttons.

	I've been doing that all along. Imagine my surprise the first time I
absent-mindedly clicked one and it actually did something.  ;-)

	I agree with Mikhael that the "X" has been pretty much ubiquitous for a
long time, and is not a concern per se. However, Dominik's point is
valid that the connection with what it does isn't too intuitive. Perhaps
the alt tag should say something like "Close FVWM Desktop Emulation".

	Of course, to make the "desktop illusion" complete, the Close button
should really remove the "window" from the page, leaving nothing but the
Pager. I'm not sure we want to follow the implications of this too
rigorously, though.

	Yes, I think we definitely need a page for explaining/setting the
various layout options, and a prominent link to call their attention to
it. The feature is too good to let people miss.

uwp > You really want to have javascript on the fvwm web page?

	As long as one can navigate through all the basics without it, I think
it's a great idea. The titlebar buttons really cry out to be
clicked...and of course, once you click one you're disappointed if you
don't see something happen. A real menu popping up when you click a
button would definitely enhance the desktop illusion. I've been hesitant
about suggesting this myself, as I haven't had any time to work on the
Web pages lately.

	I believe that most people who disable JavaScript (or use really old
browsers) understand that they may not see everyhing a site has to offer
(and may not want to). They only get angry if they can't see *anything*
without xxx-Script or yyy-Plugin. We'd just want to consider carefully
these issues:

        1) You should be able to navigate through everything without the
JavaScript bells & whistles.
        2) Browsers without JavaScript support (e.g., Amaya) should
still display all the important stuff OK - not too difficult.
        3) We probably need the PHP code to analyze what browser is
being used and eliminate the fancy stuff for older browsers. Here I'm
not thinking so much of JavaScript support itseld, but the level of CSS
support - overlaying HTML elements and manipulating their visibility,
positioning,  and z-index attributes, etc. (Also to be considered is
whether we would want to insert special code for Netscape 4 layers or
just treat NS 4 as a disabled browser.)


migo > > >   maximize button - may disable pager (WindowList-like

	Actually, to follow the desktop illusion theme a bit, wouldn't it be
better just to drop the pager (and any other extras that may get added
to the page layout) and just have the "window" occupy the whole page
(desktop)?


Cheers,
Bob

Shrug.  As always, we sseem to have orthogonal opinions of window
buttons.  The only time I touch the mouse to trigger a window
operation is when I move or resize it, and if I need the window
menu to kill it when Close does not work.  For me the title
buttons are there only to give visual feedback about the window
state.

But this all has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  I don't
want decorations reminding me of M$ Windoze on the fvwm web page.

Good point.

Although I can't deny, it is a bit over-titled, I think every title may
have its function, if no, it may be empty.

Waiting for Uwe to show another layout, but I am ok with the current one.

I think pages with several windows are ok when appropriate.

Mikhael.

No problem here.  By the way, I think the pager should have a
normal window border, perhaps three pixels wide.

	Or "Site Viewing Options"? "Customize This Web Site"? ("My FVWM"...? 
Nahhh!)

	I would favor pointing to it with one of the top level links rather
than having it buried in the Links section.

	For now, I agree, though I can't stop thinking about the possibilities 
:-). Let's get the basics on a really solid footing first. It doesn't
need to be in the first release. But we should keep it in mind for
later.

(Note:  you can dramatically improve our responsiveness by pasting
bug reports into your mails).

What exactly does this bug report tell us other than "it does not
work"?  Without a description of the perceived problems there is
nothing what we can do.  Did the reporter read FAQ 2.7?

Actually, it may be "window_ice", because it is possible to have
a mere border, not a window, i.e. "border_seagreen". See the current:

  http://www.fvwm.org/index.php?decoration_path=pictures/decorations/border_seagreen

But with border-only the title text is lost. No idea what to do about it.
Probably not a big deal since the window title is more as a hint.

I think it is a meta page and then may be in the last section.
Of course we may link to it from the home page too (in the quick jumps).

But we will have a new logo only on August 1 accourding to your plan.
I prefer to be without a logo for now than with the old fvwm_smaller.gif.
I may use the following logo (probably smaller and not red) if you like:

  http://www.fvwm.org/logo-competition/logos/old/red_cursive_framed.png

If we launch (and announce) both the new site and the logo competition
now, we may have some other good logo submitted till Juny 1.

I do not know too. I cannot reproduce your core dump, but I can
reproduce others which leads to similar strange Flocale gdb output.
There is surely a memory bug in Flocale (maybe in the charset

Can you run purify on this if this make sense? If not I will try
to run others memory debugging tools.

	Just out of curiosity, am I the only one who doesn't dislike the old
logo intensely? Not that I don't think having a new one is a good idea
for the 10th anniversary, but I never disliked the old one. Any other
opinions?

First of September.

Come on, we lived with it for years.  At least the new design
should have a defined place for the new logo.

It's red.  Isn't that bad enough?  ;-)

Seriously, I personally don't care about how the logo looks since
I don't use logos.  But I guess that it is at least partially
responsible if people turn away from fvwm quickly after loading
the fvwm home page.

We lived with the old design for years too. :)

Ok, I added the logo that I like much more than the old one. It matches
our FvwmBanner, just nicer. If you want it in another color, tell me.
But I think this is a purpose of the logo competition. :)

I think it does not turn away quickly after loading the home page.

I like the color.  Almost any shade of blue does it for me.

About 4 times larger it makes a good FvwmBanner default.

Hi there,

I changed the color a little bit so that it matches the
actual window decoration. Maybe we move the logo selection
(color selection) to the layout files, so that one layout
has a red colorized logo and another one a blue colorized
one.

I like the actual link colors more than the one I choosen
since the actual colors are not that bright. But I think
they do not match to the actual steelblue window
decor that good. Maybe we use a steelblue color for the
links as well.

Regards, Uwe

Hi there,

On the web manual pages the link "Return to main index" on
top of the pages does not seem to use conv_link_target. When
this link is used the default layout will be used.

Mikhael could you please fix that? You might find it faster
than me.

I found also links to other man pages which do not belong to
fvwm. For example: FvwmConsole refers to xterm man page on
localhost. We might link to external man pages on a man page
server like
 
 http://www.cs.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/man2html?xterm:1

Maybe there is a more official one.

Regards, Uwe

Yes, this looks much better, I think.  Nicely integrated with the
page title too and also adds the missing spacing above and below
the title.

The bullet in the Quick Jumps list looks good.  May I suggest to
use a different colour for the bullets?  At the moment, we have
too many different colours:  blue (logo), greenish blue ("Quick
Jumnps"), yellow (links), pale pink (selected links), and the
colour in the bullets (blueish red).  I have attached a new
version that uses blue tones instead and is slightly dimmed (in
PNG format, gimp does not like GIFs) as a suggestion.

And finally, the list of links on the front page should be
centered in the window.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

The actual version uses your bullet and less colors on the
same tone. The link and section colors might be a bit too
dark.

I think the yellow links were fine.  The current blue is too
similar to the section title.  You can not distinguish between
links, visited links and normal titles anymore.

Looks very nice.  The site is almost ready now.  There are a few
quirks left, though:

 - The pager is now wider than before (mozilla 1.2.1).  The pages
   do not have 4:3 ratio anymore.  It looks more like 2:1 (see
   attached picture).
 - Despite the additional space, the "Mailing List" desk still has
   the 't' cut off.
 - Visited links are not marked with a different colour.
 - On the logo page, when you move the pointer over one of the
   pictures, a yellow bar is drawn below them as if there were a
   link to hilight.

How do I change the order of the Quick Jumps and their names?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Yes, I have noticed this as well, but I am not sure why it
is like this. I will have a look ...

I have given one more character to destop names ;-)

Visited links are a bit darker now.

Fixed.

> How do I change the order of the Quick Jumps and their names?

Have a look in /index.php and search for
insert_quick_jump_list. The names for external links are
given there. The names for internal links, means to sub
pages, are given by the php-file header in the target file. 

e.g. in screenshots/desktops.php:
...
$link_name      = "Desktops";
...

Says that other pages refering to this pages use Desktops as
link name.

Now it has become even wider, about 5:2.  Are you tuning it in the
right direction? ;-)

Currently, yes. 

If you want to distiguish between link_name and a 
quick_jump_name we may add this in the file headers. The
link_name may be used if quick_jump_name is not
given. navgen.cli must be changed to support this.

If you are happy with one link_name and like to change the
link name for some pages, don't forget to run navgen

Perfect.  I see no more reason to delay going online.  The
remaining things are only cosmetic and can be done later.

Ah, well, there is one more thing:  The logo competition schedule
has to be updated.  I'll do that.  It will start on 1st of May so
we have a week to figure out where to announce it.

Bye

Hi. I've noticed something concerning the fvwm ./configure and install
scripts - they seem to make an assumption that everyone uses/wishes to
use gtk+ and perl. And maybe Gnome, I don't know (no gnome-libs on my
system and not much difference between gtk+ and gnome)

Anyhow, me favorite bugs:

a. there is no way to turn off gtk+ support in fvwm. I think something
like --without-gtk would do nice. Currently I'm using a workaround
'--with-gtk-prefix=/dev/null', but it isn't very nice. I have gtk+, but
don't need it in fvwm. If gtk+ is optional, then there should be a way
to turn it off, even if gtk+ is available.

b. even if I manage to fool the ./configure script into not compiling
FvwmGtk, FvwmGtkDebug will be build (and installed). I think those two
(FvwmGtk and FvwmGtkDebug) should be bundled - without FvwmGtk the
FvwmGtkDebug is pretty much useless...

c. same goes for Perl. I don't wish to use FvwmPerl, but the
--disable-perllib switch works only partially - sure, the perl bindings
won't be included, but scripts depending on them _will_ be installed,
ignoring --disable-perllib. Hey, even the FvwmPerl module will be
installed.  I think the --disable-perllib should be "stronger" (disable
the installation of scripts/modules that need the fvwm perl bindings,
like FvwmDebug or FvwmWindowMenu).
Maybe renaming it to "--disable-perl" would also be more appropriate.

d. installation of man pages. Should be bundled with the installation of
appropriate modules, but this isn't the case, at least now. Even if my
fvwm was build without FvwmGtk, the FvwmGtk man page is ever-present.
I think including man pages for modules that weren't build is a mistake.

All these (and related) glitches have only one source - the
autoconf/automake scripts in fvwm don't care about dependencies between
man pages/scripts/modules/perl bindings - they simply install as much
stuff as possible. I know, this isn't really much of a bug for
end-users, but it sure can turn packaging fvwm for a distro into hell of
a fight. Unresolved perl dependencies during rpm-build, modules that
were installed but will never work etc. Really annoying stuff.

Nothing near "mission-critical", but still annoying.

Well, that's all.

What happend with the internal server error Mikhael reported
when he changed .htaccess? Was there a fix found?

If we don't want to use .htaccess settings we may remove all
index.html files. But I like changing .htaccess a bit more
since the old files are remaining.

Jason, you didn't answer this one, please answer.

Please uncomment the DirectoryIndex in .htaccess on the server for a
short time (because we don't want the site to be non accessible) and tell
us why apache throws Internal Error 500, it should not. Thanks.

Umm, it doesn't?  I really don't see what you're talking about.  I
removed the octothorpe from the second line of the .htaccess file and
the behavior of the web site didn't change at all.  I've put it back
now.

I am starting the new thread, because the thread depth of 25 is getting
ridiculous. Problems:

The ALT property of mini icons in the pager should be "", otherwise some
browsers (at least Opera) use this name initially before the icons are
loaded making the pager too wide initially.

Konqueror first loads the main css and then immediatelly switches to
the alternative css. This is most probably a bug/feature in Konqueror,
but probably there is a work around, like switching the order of the main
and alternative css.

In the alternative css the visited links are not different from the
non-visited one, they should be clearly distinguishable.
In the alternative css the active pager page is not marked.

I think the empty title is less interesting than the title with text.
At least with old logos, the title text (empty now) carries the meaning.
In the pages where the window decoration title should better be void we
may just define it empty. What do you think? 

Other than this I like the current design.

Regards,
Mikhael.

When I uncommented it in cvs 2.5 days ago it returned Internal Error 500
on all php files.

Anyway, please either make DirectoryIndex in the apache configuration
override-able, so that we may change the index.php vus index.html order
in .htaccess (preferable), or change this order explicetely in http.conf.

The goal is for http://fvwm.org/ to go to index.php, not index.html.

Mikhael.

Good that it works now.

I guess the error message for these Internal Error 500 that I got
may be found in error_log on the server.

Ok, now that we have the new design online, I will send a short
(non official if you like) notice about it to our users.

Sigh, really, I don't think it's a good idea to start the
competition without announcing it.

I guess it's too late now, so I understand you just volunteered to
write the announcement, figure out the places to send it to, and
announce it, all within the next 24 hours :-)=)

Bye

At work we just migrated to Red Hat 8.0.  The WM that comes with Gnome
is _sooo_ sad and pathetic that I couldn't stand it for more than a few
seconds, so I switched back to FVWM, although I want to keep the Gnome
setup (panel, etc.) because we have some company customizations,
etc. there.


Overall I'm not having too many problems (except with Nautilus, but I'll
deal with that).  But, one thing that's annoying is that the Gnome
splash screen never disappears by itself.  It goes along showing the
icons of all the stuff it's loading until it gets to (I suppose) the WM,
then it just sits there.

I can click on it and it goes away, so it's not show-stopping, but it is
annoying.

I suspect that the splash screen is waiting for some kind of
notification from the WM that it's up and running before it proceeds; I
don't remember having this problem with Gnome 1.4 on my Debian box so I
guess it's new in Gnome 2 (or, *shudder*, in Bluecurve specifically?)

Anyone know what's up here?  I'm using FVWM 2.5.6.

I don't see any problem to accept logos from our users who visited the
home page before the announcement. It is not that the rules will be
changed till the official message.

But what do you want to see in the announcement?
Can you prepare logo-announcement in cvs?

I would think a link to our home page is enough.
As for the places, fvwm-announce and as Nadim suggested
  http://gallery.deviantart.com/contest/
(not sure yet how to submit the context).

Regards,
Mikhael.

	The standard way to prevent this is to specify the exact width &
height of each icon image, so the browser knows how much space to layout
for it before loading it. I think most of the current browsers will pick
up the title attribute for the balloon help if alt is missing, but older
ones don't, and I've no idea what Lynx does; so I think we should keep
the alt attribute.

	I'll commit a change to do this in a few minutes. See if this looks
better.

Bob

	Of course, I didn't realize you'd already tweaked this line, so I got a
CVS confilict. I commented out your 2 lines and added mine for now.

	Let's see how this looks to you in the morning. If it looks OK, I'll
remove the commented lines. If not, we can restore them.

Bob

	I was going to send Matt Chapman a message about the WM comparison
chart on his "Window Managers for X" site and remove the dumb
"Developers' note" I left on our Links page, but a couple of questions
occurred to me.

	1) He has a link to an "FVWM2 THEMES" page
(http://www.geocities.com/bluesmani/). The page is still alive, but
doesn't seem to be active (it refers to 2.2.2 as the latest FVWM
release). Mikhael, was this a precursor to the Official FVWM Themes
page, and now obsolete? Or was it a completely independent effort that
never had any connection to the official one? In any case, I think Matt
should be told about the officlal one.

	2) My original intent was to tell him that in the comparison chart he
should check FVWM as having pinnable (or tear-off) menus (which, ahem,
would make FVWM the only WM with *all* the columns checked). But I can't
recall whether tear-off menus are in 2.4. Are they?


Cheers,
Bob

Opera renders good now - even if the pager pictures do not
exist ;-) 

Lynx uses the alt attribute to display the picture's name
since it does not display the picture itself. So at least
for this browser the alt attribute which describes the link
is really neccessary. Netscape uses the alt attribute to pop
up a little ballon which shows the image description.  
Other browsers as mozilla use the title attribute for the
ballon.

I think it is a good way to have both attributes meaningful
since the pager icons only says not that much.

Regards, Uwe

Hi there,

The existence of an alternate style will not  be  discovered
by  most  users.  It is really a fancy feature, but if there
are problems with some browsers I think it is reasonable  to
live without it.

You are right, the title looks that empty ;-) I think we may
choose  a  window  title  which  it quite different from the
header. On the start page it could be "Welcome to  the  fvwm
homepage" or on the screenshot page it may say "Click on the
image for the full sized version." ... 

Some thoughts:
It would be good if the pages stable and unstable belong  to
the navgation structure and would be displayed in the pager.
The link at bottom of the man pages return  to  index  would
not  be  needed  in  that  case.  The  same is with the perl
library page and the logo sub pages. These pages are  hidden
from the navigation structure. 

I think it is not good to hide that much from the navigation
structure.  Hiding should be done by the layout-file so that
further layouts may be designed as flexible as possible. 

For that case we may introduce a new header  variable  which
tells  the  layout  algorithm to do not step further down in
the navigation tree. Layout files may  descide  of  the  use
this variable of not. For example a layout could display all
available man pages on the left side of the  page.  If  they
are  not in the navigation structure is will be not possible
to set up such a layout.

I will take a look. It is maybe a session management issue. How do
you start fvwm with GNOME2?

Hi!

First two things:
 - Great work! The new page looks neat!
 - I didn't read all the webpage-related mails, so my input might
   be redundant

Here comes what I feel about the new page:

 - On the start page, there is "Desktops" as link to the screenshots.
   IMO, this should read "Screenshots", as most people (well, at least
   I do) look for this first.

 - The screenshots page: Could this be reorganized somehow? Maybe it
   would be an idea to move the existing ones to another page (archive?)
   and shoot some new screenshots, especially for the new website. Some
   of these screenshots are quite outdated (I count my year-2k
   screenshot to those). Maybe some things could be included for the
   new shots:
 =20
    o Date
    o Mail address of the author, if available, printed with permission
    o Website of the author, if available and permitted
    o Links to configuration file snippets or to whole configs
    o Special things, like what's on the screen
    o Comments
    o Rating (Yes, the shots could be rated by visitors!)

   As well, there could be a submission form for screenshots, which
   would make it easier for Dan to sort out the good from the bad.

What do you think?

BTW: Thanks again for fvwm2 :))

There is a new bindings context "D" which may help a bit with Nautilus
desktop.

I cannot reproduce this problem if I use the following procedure
for starting fvwm with GNOME 2:
Start "gnome-session" in my .xinitrc
(+ before: export FVWM_USERDIR=/home/olivier/.fvwm-fd
          fvwm-themes-start --session gnome --no-start
but this is for my fvwm config).
Then, I've metacity as window manager. I open a terminal and run
    fvwm -r [-f themes-rc] &
Then, fvwm replace metacity smoothly. When leaving the session
I save it. After that, when I start gnome-session fvwm is used
in the place of metacity (no need to save the session again for
further gnome-session start).

I get various problems if I use others procedures ...

I have GNOME version "2.0-Mandrake 9.0".

I don't like the current screenshot page that  much  either.
For  the  new web page we decided to convert all "old" pages
to the new layout first and make some changes afterwards. 

For the screenshot page it is planned to split  the  current
page  in  pages  containing  only  a few shots, say five, to
minimize download times. There will be some more information
about  the  shot  like  you say. I thought about providing a
php-template file which describes the shot like: 

$author = "Name";
$date   = "24.04.2003";
$email  = ...

This template needs to be filled out by the author of a shot
and send it together with the shot to fvwm-workers. 

Rating requires the ability to write data on the web server.
This  is  not  implemented  yet.  We  need  to  discuss this
regarding to space and security issues. We also need a  good
concept  which avoids that a shot is rated serveral times by
the same person. But I like the idea maybe  we  can  set  it
up. 

>    As well, there could be a submission form for screenshots, which

The submission requires the ability to upload files  to  the
web  server.  This  may  also  lead  to  space  and security
problems. 

Maybe we can set up a web form which generates the php  file
to be attached to the shot to make it easier to place a shot
on the page. 

Thanks hints.

They are not in 2.4.
There are problems with the way they work and they
will probably be disabled in 2.6.  There was some discussion of
the problems a few months ago.

	Bummer! It's a nice feature that I like to use occasionally, and
haven't seen a problem (but maybe I haven't triggered it, or it just
doesn't bother me). Guess I'll have to search the archives to see what
the problem(s) might be.


Cheers,
Bob

Hm.  This is what I did:

  * Gnome session started from GDM, so .xinitrc is not used
  * In the session manager, I changed the metacity value from "Restart"
    to "Normal", so the session manager wouldn't restart it when I
    killed it.
  * Ran "killall metacity; sleep 1; fvwm &"
  * Saved my session

That seems essentially the same thing as you've done?

Either there is a difference in our configuration, or the splashscreen
that comes with RH 8.0 is different somehow than the "normal" Gnome
splashscreen.

I've noted one thing: fvwm does not appear in the list of running
application in the gnome-session manager GUI (metacity appear). Maybe
gnome-session and fvwm are not agree on one point of the SM protocol
and your splash screen does not detect that fvwm is started (but
clearly "save session" works fine).  My version of gnome-session is
gnome-session-2.0.5-4mdk.  Mikhael any idea?

Also in the session manager I've a check box which allows to disable
the splash screen.

By the way, I am interested by any remarks concerning possible bad
interaction between GNOME 2 and FVWM.

Regards, Olivier

The W3C standards are:

* "alt" is used by text-mode browsers to display a description of "what
  you would see if your browser could display images"

* "alt" is also displayed by graphical browsers if image loading is
  turned off (just like text-mode browsers), or the image hasn't been
  downloaded yet

* "title" is _the_ property to use for popup-info

Actually using "alt" for pop-up info is a bug/bad implementation of
standards (according to W3C), but some (most) browsers allow it.

Anyway, both "title" and "alt" should be provided with every image you
wish to have descriptions/popups.

I have gnome-session-2.2.0.2, but I am pretty overloaded with other
things to try and debug it now. Maybe later.

Thanks, but I don't think that anyone involved here (Uwe, Bob, me) does
not know the theory. The W3C standards is pretty irrelevant to the
original problem.

Bob, I will remove my fix (limiting ALT length), since it is redundant
with your fix (specifying explicit image sizes).

Mikhael.

I think I already tried to contact Mutt in the past, but it seems that he
does not update his web pages (at least some of them) in the last 4 years.

bluesmani themes is not connected to fvwm-themes in any way (except that
there is a link to it together with dozen of others at the bottom of
fvwm-themes.sf.net).

	Here's the behavior I see:

Netscape 6 & 7 & Mozilla:  follow this standard, only use title for
popups (presumably other Mozilla derivatives behave likewise)

Opera 6 (Linux):  folllows the standard, uses only title

Opera 7 (Win):  uses title, falls back to displaying link url in popup

IE6:  gives precedence to title, then falls back to alt for popups

Netscape 4:  ignores title, only uses alt, period

	Agreed.

Bob

A couple of quick comments on the new PHP website (I like it btw).
I use emacs and w3m to surf the web (who needs those graphic things
anyways :-) and would like to suggest the following,

 1. Detect if a user is using emacs/w3m and divert him/her to the
    "layout=plain" pages.

 2. Remove all buttons from the "layout=plain" page (ie. the [item_dot]).
    - All current links within main page's "Quick Jumps" are
      proceeded by these blue'ish/pink'ish buttons
    - Having the logo and a couple of images is cool, but
      sprinkling things all over seems like it would be
      counter to the "plain" idea.

 3. All screenshots/decor/menu samples should only be included if and
    only if there are sample files one can download to see how that is
    accomplished.  Case in point, there are some cool screenshots, but
    no .fvwm2rc file to accompany them -- kinda seems useless to me to
    even include that screenshot in the first place.

Keep up the great work.

Regards,

 - Nadim

Once cookies are used (planned), you will just set plain layout and it
will be used for all pages in all your visits.

Seems like another browser ignoring alt="", I will use alt="*".

Just tried w3m in xterm. It is weird, I see graphics in xterm (from
XFree86-4.3.0). I mean it is very cool to see graphics in xterm.

After the small change above, the plain layout in w3m looks perfect,
so I am not sure what "sprinkling things all over" mean.

Some configs require several megabytes of images (maybe dozens of
images). Some configs rely on custom scripts. Some configs are platform
dependant. It is not plug and play (unless it is fvwm-themes :) ).

emacs/w3m doesn't use cookies (I'll have to check), but a redirect is
not an option based on a user's browser - ie. that's not doable ?

I meant those iterm_dot shouldn't really be there in the "plain" page
(thanks for removing them).  Try to run w3m under emacs (not xemacs) --
you'll need 'emacs-w3m-1.3.3'

It would still be nice to have this info somewhere - how about hosting
those setup files on sf.net or on the person submitting the screenshot's
host.  In short, a nice screenshot with no info will simply generate more
questions than it will answer (it would be best to relay questions and
inquires somewhere more relevant, no?)

Package: fvwm
Version: 2.4.6-2

When an fvwm menu is requested via a key combination, e.g. [Alt]-F1,
fvwm automatically places the selection on menu item 1.  I hate this.
I don't want something selected unless I select it.  Please note when
this same operation is performed with a mouse key press, e.g. Mouse-1,
on the root window no items are selected, this is the preferred
behavior.

If lynx and links support cookies, what not.

If we have many layouts (and not 2 like now) how may we know which one is
preferred by a user? The default layout should work on any browser. :)

So, Olivier, could you please list which fvwm versions should work with
gnome 1 and which with gnome 2? Are any fvwm build options related to
this coexistence?

  http://gallery.deviantart.com/contest/

I think the process (unless I'm whacked-out) is,

 1. Create a deviantart account (ie. "Join deviantART")
 2. Post a news-item on that page noting what's required
    and a link to fvwm's logo requirements page.  Mention
    the deadline and that there is a monetary reward
    (that ought to certainly heighten interest).

Hope that helps (and sorry for the vagueness).

Hi there,

I had a try with emacs this morning. The site was not
viewable at all with this browser. It may be a bug in this
browser but I don't like if this page is not viewable.

I have set the default layout to plain if the user agent
contains "Emacs" or "Lynx". Currently this settings can be
overridden with GET variables - cookies or others will
follow ;-).

Doing a request on fvwm.org should look good with lynx and
emacs now. 

Regards, Uwe

GNOME 1.x should work with FVWM 2.4.x and FVWM 2.5.x.  You can disable
this support at compile time with 2.4.x but not with 2.5.x.
See also the GnomeIgnoreHints style.

GNOME >= 2 and KDE >= 2 should work only with FVWM 2.5.x but a recent
snapshot is recommended (take a look at the "EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER
HINTS" section of the fvwm man page as well as all the EWMH* styles
and commands and the DesktopName command).

There are some patches for certain version of FVWM 2.4.x which allows
GNOME >= 2 and KDE >= 2 to work with FVWM 2.4.x. These patches are not
supported anymore.

Regards, Olivier

I do not found any memory bug in Flocale but there were bugs with
icon fonts and EWMH icon name (sometimes the icon font was unloaded
but used by ewmh_names ...).
  
Any way, I've tried to fix the FvwmForm core dump you report.
Can you try to reproduce it again?

Ok, I will post the announcement to these 2 places now, and will try to
find whether the GIMP users/artists mailing list exists later today.

Anyone is welcome to forward the announcement to other places.

What about posting this announcement to:

http://linuxtoday.com/
http://lwn.net/
http://slashdot.org/

and others such news sites? I will sent it to http://linuxfr.org/
(new site + logo competition), but can you cc to fvwm-workers your
announcement?

Hi there,

I have finished the layout description using php classes. The current
two layouts have been ported to php class descriptions.
Currently the new layout files are not used since I have not tested
them very carefully :-|

The new layouts are accessable via

  www.fvwm.org/?layout=plain_class
and
  www.fvwm.org/?layout=default_class

Don't be disappointed. They hardly look different to the current
layouts. (On the plain layout the navigation is different. On the
default layout the pager color is changed a bit to show that a
different layout descriptions is used.)

The difference is that classes are used for the layout description
which makes it quite easy to derive new layouts from a existing ones.

Currently the following files are used:

class_layout_base.inc: description of base layout class
interface_definitions.inc: mapping of object functions to global functions.

layout_default_class.inc: default layout using classes (might be splitted)
layout_plain_class.inc: plain layout using classes (might be splitted)

navgen.cli produces currently a array for the class _and_ the current
concept. 

Comments are welcome.

Regards, Uwe

A suggestion - there isn't much one can do with a screenshot
page (it gets boring rather quick - listings are never too
interesting or appealing) and so maybe having a more dynamic
looking page is an option.  Something akin to,

  http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/screenshots.html

As noted, just a suggestion :-)

and obfuscated (ie. user(at)host-dot-com or similar) -- its bad enough
that the mailing-lists don't hide/obfuscate already esp. with MHonArc
(which is what's being used, I think) being well capable of it ;-)

Don't really see a need for "ratings", but all else sounds "excellent" :-)
The more info noted, the better...

This is good. Can I suggest to move all layout classes to the separate
directory? I.e. layout/default.inc instead of layout_default.inc.

I think the navigation methods may be (if possible of course) moved to
separate elements. Like:

  layout/navigation/pager.inc
  layout/navigation/parent_list.inc
  layout/navigation/void.inc  # does not exist in the new version
  layout/navigation/menus.inc  # does not exist yet

How about to separate the decoration methods too:

  layout/decor/window.inc  # there is also the actual image/color theme
  layout/decor/border.inc  # there is also the actual image/color theme
  layout/decor/void.inc

This way, the current layout=default consists of navigation=pager and
decor=window, layout=plain consists of navigation=parent_list (or void)
and decor=void.

This is just a working suggestion without all details.

BTW, I think "layout" is not the best term for what it does. Maybe
"skin", "view" or "look" (other names: "theme", "design", "looknfeel").

On the other subjects.

Why do you set decoration windows to be 800 pixels tall - to always force
a side scrollbar? An empty window taller than the page looks very bad.

I think we are not going to return to the old pages, so I will remove all
.html files soon.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I notice that for the screenshots, the ability to move from full size
image to full size image has been removed.

Is there a plan to bring that back?

I may enhance the script to automatically add "Next/Prev" links, but I
think Uwe wants to redesign the whole thing later.

Hopefully this feature is not very urgent.

Go to http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/index.html,
click on a thumbnail to go to one full size image.

Notice the links that lte you can navigate
from image to image?

Its not urgent.

I was just wondering if there was some magic php
trick that would accomplish this some other way.

I cannot seem to remove default 'Mouse 2' binding to "Builtin Menu"
by using '-' function, in fvwm 2.5.6 ...

  Mouse 2 R N -

...if i only have that (or no other binding) for middle mouse
button, i always get the "Builtin Menu" on pressing it.  I have/had
to bind the middle button to some other menu or function to disable
it.

I would hate to create a otherwise noop function just to disable the
"Builtin Menu".

The built in binding is:

To remove it you need:

Ah!  Thanks much.


A question: if 'A' context means any context, then why does the 'A'
context not override 'R'?  I would expect the following to work just
like above (but doesn't)...

  Mouse 0 A N -

Maybe this should be changed to

Mouse 1 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot
Mouse 2 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot
Mouse 3 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot

because 0 will match all buttons, also the scrollwheel on such mice.
Perhaps this is a bit annoying.
On the other hand, there may be mice where button 4 is actually a
"real" button.
Is it possible to detect somehow? Does the X server report such things?
If this would be so, it would be possible to redefine 
Mouse 0 to only match normal buttons.
And perhaps Mouse U,Mouse D for scroll.

There is no wildcard matching.  You must use exactly the same
arguments that were used initially to remove it.  Both approaches
have strenghth and weaknesses.

Doh, I wasn't aware of this.  I always thought that guests could
add comments to bug reports.  Now that explains why we get so many
comments as new reports.  Jason, can you do something about it?

All mail you send to fvwm-bug becomes a new bug report.

I think I already said my opinion in the past. IMHO, it should be simply:

  Mouse 1 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot

The internal bindings should be as minimal as possible (although
functional).

I don't see any X utility (or maybe function) that would distinguish
wheel buttons from non-wheel. (say, "xmodmap -pp", "xev")

For the moment this might be a  workaround.  I  thought  this  feature
might  be  not  that important since I always go from thumbnail to the
full sized shot. But if this feature is requested we may put it back. 

To the screenshot site:

Actually I wanted to wait before discussing the screenshot pages until
the php concept has been finished. 

The  screenshot  pages  as  they  are  now  very  good.  Some  desktop
screenshots  are quite out of date. The information about some shots is
quite poor and there are no .fvwmrcs for the shots. 

For the desktop shot I think it would be good if a  short  description
were  given  what  is  seen  on  _each_  shot - like FvwmButtons (with
config), gkrellm (with theme), asmail, Taskbar (with config),  and  so
on. If somebody uses special icons we might also say where they can be
obtained from. The desktop  shot  page  should  not  contain  too  may
pictures  to  keep  the page clearer. We may separate the shot page to
pages contain 5 or 7 shots and provide prev and next buttons  on  each
page.  We  should  also  provide  "simple"  screenshots  like the fvwm
default look. 

For the window decoration and menu screenshot pages we might need some
more shots with configs to attract people. 

Maybe a separate FvwmButtons screenshot page would be nice.

Rating for the shots would be also a fancy feature ;-)

Regards, Uwe

If someone disagreed, it must have been me,
but I don't remember it.

I think I put in the mouse 0 binding.
I was trying to catch any mouse press for the user with no
config file.
I think that worked, we get a lot less emails about
starting up Fvwm and not being able to get anything to work.

I guess I don't understand the motivation of the few users
that complain that there are any built in bindings and want
to remove them.  Why don't they just override them?

Ie.:

Mouse 4 R N Nop

Anyway, if I was the one that objected,
I don't care that much. Either binding the buttons 1-3 or only
1 is OK with me.

I agree, it is pretty easy to do this if a user understands what happens.
However he may be surprized, say, to get a menu that he did not define
every time he moves to a new mouse supporting more buttons. I may easily
understant his willing to remove this unchancy built-in binding.

> Anyway, if I was the one that objected,

No, noone neither objected nor agreed then. :)

I will do the second option.

	This was a quick 'n dirty hack several weeks ago when the few test
pages we had hadn't much content yet and looked squashed and silly when
viewed on a very wide screen. I suspect that all the pages have enough
content now that this isn't needed anymore.

Hi there,

Yes, it is good to have the files more structured.

The idea is good - but the current class concept needs to be changed a
little  bit.  As  far  as I know php does not support deriving a class
from more than one base class. So the concept you suggest is more like
a  construction kid where one collects all items one needs in a layout
(theme) description. 
If I am thinking about it this make the class  concept  not  necessary
anymore.  We  could  place function descriptions in separate files and
include them in the  layout  files.  So  we  don't  need  to  descripe
function  more  than one time and changing a function would affect all
layouts. 

A layout file would look than just like this:

include(theme_desc("navigation/parent_path.inc"));
include(theme_desc("navigation/pager.inc"));
include(theme_desc("decor/window.inc"));
...
<html>
...
</html>

This seems to me much more flexible than the  class  concept.  Damn  I
should have discussed the class idea before implementing it ;-) 
BTW, having such function description files makes  it  quite  easy  to
reuse the themes for further web designs - e.g. fvwm-theme. 

> BTW, I think "layout" is not the best term for what it does. Maybe

Okay, I am not a native english speaker so some terms I  have  choosen
might  be not selected by other people. However, from your suggestions
I would like "theme" at most since relates to fvwm-theme. From  a  web
"design"  view  the  term  "design" might be most appropriate. I would
like to leave it up to you.

This was not on purpose - more by accident. I had some difficulties to
keep  the  class  description up to date, since the other layout files
were changed a lot last week.

Yes, good idea. I think we need to clean up the file tree a bit ;-)

Another thing  is  that  the  web  files  currently  have  no  license
statement in it. With the modular function file concept the frame work
becomes quite usable. 
I would like to put them under GPL like fvwm.  Any  disagrees?  To  do
this  is  it  necessary  to  put the GNU statement in each php and inc
file?

Here is the current status of the announcements I posted.

  DeviantArt     - I don't see it at the Context page, either didn't pass a
                   moderation or still in the queue
  fvwm-announce@ - I didn't get this message and I don't see it in
                   archives. Needs approving? Or is it only me? 
  gimp-user@     - probably still awaits for approving. I will repost if
                   it's not posted in several days
  gimpi@         - posted after a moderation

If anyone wants to post the announcement to other place, he may use the
updated template logo-announcement in cvs.

We got one submission although not in immediatelly usable form, I will
add it to the web when I have a time.

If you want to receive submissions, you may get subscribed/unsubscribed
to fvwm-logo mailing list at:

Hello.

Is it a feature, that if I configure 2.5.6 as, say,
./configure --without-imlib
FvwmGtk still will be built *with* imlib, if a proper version is
installed?

Kind of.  Some (all?) of the macros that control the
--with-foobar-prefix and --with-foobar-exec-prefix options to
configure simply do not support a --without-foobar option.  It
would be nice if they did, though.  A patch is welcome.

Bye

There is no such option --without-imlib, see "configure --help"
and INSTALL.fvwm for the list of all valid options.
There is also the section "Optional libraries used by FvwmGtk".

I've made a few patches that affect the handling of context
windows and the specific context bit s in menus.  Can someone
please help testing:

  - Menus invoked from various contexts
  - Running the dynamic... menu actions from/outside a context
  - Dynamic menu functions that destroy the context window
  - Same for tear off menus
  - Same for indirect root menus (PopupAsRootMenu menu style).

Watch out for core dumps and actions being applied to the wrong
windows or window contexts.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Heres one:

(gdb) where
#0  0x402941a7 in malloc () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x40293f98 in malloc () from /lib/libc.so.6

(gdb) 

I'm not quite sure what kicked it off, I was just starting to verify
that the menus were working.

I wasn't using the mouse.

Fixed?  If not, can you run it under Purify to catch the problem
earlier, please?

So, what about using an other bugs tracking system?

Just a thought.

We already have a fully featured modern bug system at:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100029&group_id=29&func=browse

But moving existing bugs may be a hard work.

Maybe Jason may suggest something else.

Fixed.

The problem was caused by a menu built from another menu with
piperead.

Do you mean I am a native English speaker? :)

Ok, if I should choose, I think the term "web theme" is good.
Or "theme" for short.

I didn't mean the class concept is bad. I just don't have a time to think
about the exact code design right now. I hope you have more time to think
about this, i.e. how to make creation of new web themes easy. It may be
good (or bad) to have subclassed themes or subclassed navigations/pagers.

I think placing the statement in one/two central .inc files that are
included by all .php is more than enough. Having .php files themselves
small (only html, no static text) would be nice.

Olivier, how did get Valgrind to produce any usable output?  When
I run it (after compiling with -O), it swaps me in "uninitialised
memory" messages all over the place when they are clearly wrong,
e.g. in the flag structures and the new exec_context_t structures,
even when both were initialised with memset or safecalloc.  For me
it is almost impossible to distinguish the real problems from the
junk reports.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Yes, I've noted problems with UM too. It seems that the latest valgrind
version (I get it from valgrind cvs) is better regarding this. Valgrind
is not perfect but it seems to me that it is the best free "mem debugger"
software.

An other pb is using valgrind with modules. Attached a 1min patch that
allows to "valgrind" all the modules you start. With recent version
of valgrind some options can be added so that the out files are named
FvwmButtons.pid, FvwmTaskBar.pid, ...etc.

Also, I think that FVWM has not so many memories bugs (vs the
situation at 2.3 feature freeze time). I think we was very careful
about this during 2.5.x development.

I did not forget it; something must have gone wrong with vi when I
cut the lines from my config file.  I noticed it myself after I
sent the mail.

As long as the pointer is over the correct window when the
FakeClick command is called, hiding the panel should work too.
Does the panel cover the panel button?  If so, try adding

  + I Next (FvwmButtons, CirculateHit) Raise

between the "Next ..." and the "WindowId ..." lines.  If that
still does not help, check where the pointer ends up by removing
the last line (WindowId ...) so that the pointer is not warped
back to the initial position.

Hi there,

I got that. But the class concept might be not necessary. On
my computer at home I had the impression that using
classes/objects produces more cpu load at the web servers
side. I don't like to overkill the web server at fvwm.org.

I have not made a decision yet. My current concept (in mind)
is partinioning the functions as the are now in
layout_default.inc in files and add some dependencies to
this functions files like:

/web-theme/navigation/window_decoration/default.inc:

------------------------------------------------------------
// don't load this files if functions described here do
// already exist 
if(function_exists("window_decoration_start")) return;

// declare functions which are needed by the function
// declations in this file
require("decoration_title_line");

// or maybe just
include(theme_description("navigation/window_decoration/window_decoration_title_line.inc"));

function window_decoration_start("") {...}
------------------------------------------------------------

This would allow to include the functions needed for a
theme in the theme file. I have to think about it more
detailed regarding to simplicity, extentability, safety and
cpu usage.

I am going to do that.

> Having .php files themselves small (only html, no static

The header in the php files is necessary to get urls like

www.fvwm.org/features.php. 

and use navgen to obtain the navigation structure.  If the
php-files would contain html (and php-function calls) only
the url would look like

www.fvwm.org/theme_default.php?file=features

This would allow to separate contents and layout as the
current concept. But I don't like such urls ;-)

Cheers, Uwe

Hi there,

All files together loaded when requesting
www.fvwm.org/index.php are 122880 Bytes in size. So on an
ISDN line it should take about

122880 Bytes / 64 Kbit/s * 8 = 15 sec

Regarding that the background picture which should be the
latest file to load is 50860 Bytes in size. The loading time
should be about

72020 Bytes / 64 Kbit/s * 8 = 8.8 sec

before the background picuture will be requested.

But the web page was described in a way that the information
should be displayed before loading all images. I have got an
analog modem at home which runs at about 40 Kbit/s and I
think it does not take that long. I will check that tonight.

What browser do you use? Does the plain layout load much
faster than the default layout? How about using ISDN in dual
channel mode at 128 Kbit/s? Does this half the loading time?

Regards, Uwe

Ah so that's the reason.  120kB seems to be huge.  What is using
so much space?  The background image plus the logo take up 57kB,
so there are still about 69kB left to explain.  Is it because of
the (uncompressed?) gifs?  Is there any alternative to gifs?  How
about reducing the size of the background image?  At 2/3 of the
original size at quality 0.65 it shrinks to 17274 bytes
(attached).

Mozilla 1.0.something.

Yes, at least ten times faster.

The contract with my provider does not allow it.

I was able to reduce the size of navgen.cli and navgen.php by 25%
by removing all comments (especially the comment markers waste a
lot of bandwidth) and by indenting with one tab instead of two
spaces.  Using shorter variable names should save another couple
of kBs...  Yes, down from 16518 to 9860 bytes in navgen.php with
one to four letter variable names.

Hi there,

The following list gives the files on index.php and its size:

  1336 alternate.css
   369 authors_pager.gif
   369 contact_mailing_list_pager.gif
  1400 default.css
   955 default_pager.gif

   439 download_icons_pager.gif
   955 download_pager.gif
   699 features_pager.gif
  7309 fvwm-logo-steelblue.gif
   369 fvwm_cats_pager.gif
 50860 gray.jpg
   955 home_pager.gif
 25642 index.php
  4543 index_plain.php
   227 item_dot_blue.gif
   955 links_pager.gif
   543 news_pager.gif
    67 pager_empty.gif
   439 screenshots_decor_pager.gif
   439 screenshots_desks_pager.gif
   162 screenshots_menu_pager.gif
   369 screenshots_pager.gif
    71 transparent.gif
    71 transparent_002.gif

You see the gifs are quite small. The default index.php is
about 25 kB which is caused by the table/cell definitions
for the window decoration.

You can also see that the file index_plain.php is 5 times
smaller than the default layout index.php.

I have changed the bg image to grey color and  quality  0.35
which reduced the image size to 18660 bytes.

Mozilla should use your internet connection quite efficiently.

That was one reason why I made the plain layout (or theme
from now :).  Browsing through the man pages or the faq is
much more efficient using the plain theme.

Maybe we need to adapt the default theme a bit and reduce
its size. But I think we need to exchange the pager
navigation with a simpler menu navigation. When I got the
new modular theme concept ready - hopefully tonight or
tommorow - I am going to make (a) new theme(s). Maybe we use a
simpler one for default.

Comments are not bad :-)

navgen.cli is only a helper script which is started by the
user only when something has changed on the navigation
structure. It generates a php array description which
contains the file relations on the web site.
navgen.php is obsolete. I have removed this from cvs by now.

All *.php and *.inc files are executed at the server
site. This means comments and long variable names will not
be transmitted to the user and does therefore not effect
loading times. Only the echo and print commands in these
files produce traffic to the user (but navgen.cli never).

If you want to reduce the traffic you need to look in the
php output not in the sources. But I don't think that there
is much which can be removed in there.

BTW: I prefer spaces instead of tabs since they have
the same size indepent from editor settings. What do you use
for the fvwm souce files?

	It's clearly the graphics that cause it. On my cable connection the
load time runs between 8 & 12 seconds. For comparison, loading time in
Lynx is sub-second; so there's no textual material that's slowing it
down (which you addressed elsewhere in this thread).

	I just tried several more test loads - it looks like your smaller image
change has propagated to the Web site - I'm now getting load times
consistently in the range of about 5 - 7 seconds.

Bob

Hi there,

It's is mix of the size of the graphics and the number of
files to load. The window decoration requires quite a lot of
small files. Each of them needs a own http request which has
a response time. These times needs also to take in account.

How fast is your cable connection?

BTW: The total size I have given was not correct. I have
  forgotten the window decoration pictures. They come to
  another 25 kByte.  Since they are loaded due style sheet
  definition they should be loaded at last after the
  background pic has been loaded.

Wow, 25kB?  Why are they so big?

At work (fastest possible connection, I work for an internet
provider), 75% of the time (2 to 2.5 seconds) is used to load and
display the icons in the pager.  Is there a big penalty for
loading 20 small files?

By the way, it might be good to load the outline of the pager
earlier so that the layout does not suddenly change later.

Using tcpdump, it doesn't look like it sends the pictures.
It looks like the client requests the image but supplies a timestamp
for the last image that it has, and the server responds that the image
hasn't changed.  The message from the client is 568 bytes
and the response is 96.

I see it getting about 23 images.

I think most of these are the images in the pager.

Hi --

	Using the almost current CVS (I last updated sometime yesterday
afternoon), I find that FvwmIdent consistently fails. The following
error is logged:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or 
  Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x616d093a
  Serial number of failed request:  39
  Current serial number in output stream:  45

	The resource id is always the same no matter which window I click on.
Also, the cursor remains in "select window" crosshair mode until after I
click 2 more times, then it reverts to normal. The result is the same
whether I invoke Ident from a regular menu or a menu bound to a window
decoration.


Cheers,
Bob

I've installed an X error handler to FvwmIdent. Now FvwmIdent should
core dump, the gdb output may help us to determine if this error is
acceptable or not. I guess that if you remove the #if 0 code of
FvwmIdent.c (ErrorHandler) FvwmIdent should work again.

I cannot reproduce your problem. What is your FvwmIdent config?

	Wow! I didn't even think about its config, since there's not that much
to config. It turns out that I did have some config lines left over from
antiquity, lurking in one of the files (my .fvwm2rc is nothing but a
series of Reads of subordinate files): they set the Back and Fore colors
in the old-fashioned way, e,g.,

*FvwmIdent: Back MidnightBlue
*FvwmIdent: Fore Yellow

If either of these lines is present, the problem occurs. With neither of
them, all is well.

	Needless to say, I switched to using a Colorset immediately (which
works fine, of course).


Cheers,
Bob

I run FvwmIdent with:

*FvwmIdent: Back Black
*FvwmIdent: Fore white
*FvwmIdent: Font 9x15bold

no problem here, but I missed the version
you had the problem with.

I don't get any errors running with current CVS.

	Aha! Do you by any chance also have a "*FvwmIdent: Colorset n"
command...following the Back/Fore commands? That works.

	UpdateBackgroundTransparency is getting called from ProcessXEvent with
a colorset of -1 if there is no colorset specified, or if Back/Fore are
specified after the colorset. It just goes downhill from there.

	Is the intent that order matters (i.e., that Back or Fore should
override a previously specified colorset), or that the colorset should
override Back/Fore regardless of the order? (My current working copy
implements the former precedence, but I'll change it to do the latter if
that's the consensus.)


Cheeers,
Bob

25k was what "du -sk" showed me. If there are many small
files in the directories "du -sk" reports quite more space
than the files are together needed.

Each of them is not that big:

What do you mean by penalty in this context?

The pager is implemented as a set of html-tables.  The many
pictures need some time to load and some time is needed to
render the table. I guess with your internet connection
download times can be neglected. Say you have got 10Mbit/s
connection (I guess you have much more) 200 kbyte take less
than 0.2 s to load (neglecting the times needed for request,
request delay, processing and response delay). Most time
will be needed for rendering the site. You may check this by
loading the site from a locally installed web server.

I don't get that. What does suddenly change on your layout?

Some of the "Developer Info" sub pages are too wide.  Looks like
their "windows" have a hard coded minimum width of about 700
pixels (e.g. "CVS Information").  When this is fixed, could you
please give me a hint where to change this so I may fix such
trivial things myself in the future?

This line placed inside <pre> (i.e. non breakable) causes it:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r version-2_1_10 -d fvwm-2.1.10 fvwm

Note that breaking lines by hand by limiting them to, say, 66 chars is
not good, somebody may have large font or small window that even 66 chars
will be too much for them. The proper solution is not to use <pre>, so
all lines are breakable. I will fix this.

Mikhael.

Performance penalty.  Slowing down the load time.

I can hardly believe that rendering 20 tiny images takes more than
1.5 seconds.  Okay, mozilla is slow, but not *this* slow(?)

The page is initially displayed with the "window" using all the
available page width.  When the pager frame is loaded, the window
shrinks to make room for the pager.  I don't see it with mozilla
1.2.1 here (fast connection), but with 1.0 on my ISDN line.

On the "FVWM - Screenshots" page, there is an image for the
"Window decoration screenshots" page.  You we please use a
different colour for the outer decoration.  I just came back from
lunch, load our web page, see that sick yellow and *blargh* ;-)

Oh, and nice work with this kind of links with images.  I really
like the style.

A line break inside a command descriptions may confuse the
user. That's why <pre> was used. I would leave it as it is
or add a statement that the following command must be without a
linebreak.

You don't like the yellow colored decoration? ;-) 

I have taken it from the picture Michael-desk-1152x900 from
the screenshot page. When the window decoration page has
been updated I will make a new picture with window
decorations which are really on the decoration
page. Currently this picture lets more expect than one can

Maybe I am a bit slow today but I don't see any coherence
between a couple of small image files and a performance
penalty (if there is such a thing).

Have you checked the render times by using a local version
of the web page? You may save the web page with mozilla and
load it again afterwards.

I think this can be hardly avoided with gecko. Netscape4.x
starts render the table if it got all image and text
information this avoids the layout change you described but
displays nothing until all contents have been loaded. Gecko
starts rendering even it has not all information.

I think css allows to define different margins/alighment for continuation
lines than the corresponding properties for the leading lines.
If you may find the css solution to reduce a confusion, it would be nice.

One big file = small overhead = little performance penatly
Many small files = big overhead = ??? performance penalty

I'd have to learn how to set up apache first. :-(

Yeah.  I would think choosing a clever order of the components
lessens that problem.  Maybe an invisible placeholder for the
pager first?

	I think we have to play the same trick we did with the pager icons, and
explicitly speciy the width of the pager border table at the top of
insert_pager_navigation(). Then the browser will know how much
horizontal space to reserve for the pager.

	This may take a little trial and error to get the width just right.
I'll commit a change in a little bit, and we can see how it looks.

	It can't be perfect, because we'll always be somewhat at the mercy of
the user's fonts. The width only specifies a minimum width. If the
browser needs more room to fit all the elements in, it'll expand it. So,
if one of the desk titles requires more space than we allowed, the table
will expand (but not as much).

	So, Dominik, after I commit the change, see if you notice any
improvement.


Cheers,
Bob

I think it's not the size of the images that slows down loading.
It seems that the images are requested sequentially.

	Dominik, did the change I committed earlier today alleviate the problem
of the pager frame resizing?
