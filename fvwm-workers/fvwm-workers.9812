	As Tomas reported also, I have HandleWidth and BorderWidth
set to the same value (usually 5, in my case), so that's not the
problem here.

	I've made some more observations, but little progress. It's
slow going when you can't reproduce the thing at will, but have to
wait for some unknown condition.  :-(

	I've finally observed what some others have reported: that,
once it starts, other apps are also affected. What I see seems to point
the accusatory finger at the border code.

	When the fit strikes, if I open a new rxvt window (I'm using an
old version of rxvtxpm, if it matters, but with a plain white background),
the window momentarily flashes a bit of black border along the bottom and
the right side, then quickly covers its immodesty. I haven't tried to
determine whether the window has grown, because the next one is much
more interesting.

	Xforms apps (I only use a couple, Xisp and Xfpovray) appear with
what looks like some extra border area (on the bottom and right side)
that never gets drawn - i.e., you see the desktop background through it.
These windows are difficult to gather information about, because Xforms
doesn't handle whatever's wrong here very well. If I switch to a different
page, and then back, the app dies (Xfpovray just goes away silently, Xisp
dies with a "Bad Drawable" message on an XGetGeometry request).

	This suggests to me two things: first, that the border code is
somehow involved; and second, that some static variable or a field in
the ScreenInfo structure is getting set with a bogus value, or not being
reset when it should be, since the effect spreads to other windows
unrelated to the original victim. And when I manually resize the problem
window, the problem is cleared up globally as well.

	I'm trying to trace the event sequences with normal and pathological
windows. I'll let you know what I find.

I wouldn't make a 2.1.4 either if possible, but this bug will
certainly be found and will break certain setups badly.
It effectively prevents anything that needs ClickTime
from working.

But since the announcement hasn't been posted it's not
critical at all. We can just make 2.1.4 and announce this
one as the beta. Jason, can we agree on that you post
the announcement(s) (you'll have to edit it a little) as
soon as you put the tarball(s) on the ftp server?

Hiya,
	just poking around in events.c and there is a bit of code I'm not sure
about.  Line 1370 has the following bit, it's handling a configure
window request. cre is a pointer to the configure request event, tmp_win
is the window being reconfigured.

  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->bw;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->title_height -
Tmp_win->bw;

What looks funny is Tmp_win->bw.  ->bw is always 0.  I'm not sure but
should the fudge factor be Tmp_win->old_bw which is the borderwidth of
the cre window?  I don't think this is the cause of the growing window
problems since it is not using or setting any globals but it might be
messing up in some other circumstances.

Cheers,
Tim.

Note that cre->window is the client window and Tmp_win is the
fvwm window. I could debug the xterm/active icon bug by putting
lots of fprintfs in this function. If the bug is caused here,
print x/y/w/h whenever they change and you'll probably find
what piece of the logic causes the wrong size. It may help
to print the window ids (plus the window ids of the FvwmWindow).
Perhaps the wrong subwindow of Tmp_win is resized (that was in
fact the case with xterm).

Well, aside from the ClickTime problem, I found that PixmapPath is not
being parsed correctly in 2.1.3, making that version completely useless
for me:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'PixmapPath' in ModulePath '/usr
/lar3ry/libexec/fvwm/2.1.3:/usr/lar3ry/bin'
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini.xterm.xpm

[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-x2.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini.fvwm.xpm

[ ... ]

I filed a Jitterbug report on this (#40).

I'm going to go back to using 2.1.2 until the next release comes out (I
cannot access the CVS tree, unfortunately).

Mea culpa!  I neglected to include the applicable part of my .fvwm2rc
file.  It appears that it's the parsing of the ModulePath that is
botched.

(On fvwm 2.1.2, the file works perfectly when I change the 2.1.3 to
2.1.2).

Side note:  is it required to put the location of the modules in my
.fvwm2rc file, or is the place where the modules were installed "known"
somehow by fvwm2.  It seems that I constantly have to update my
.fvwm2rc file to point to the new location every upgrade...

The applicable lines from my .fvwm2rc file:

ModulePath	/usr/lar3ry/libexec/fvwm/2.1.3:/usr/lar3ry/bin
PixmapPath	/usr/lar3ry/fvwm/icons
IconPath	/usr/lar3ry/fvwm/icons:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps

That's fine.  Unfortunately it seems we're in 'just one more important bug'
mode, which is good because there aren't fifty more important bugs, but
which is bad because it can go on forever...

If you just want the general module directory, you can leave ModulePath
unset and fvwm2 will know where to look for it.

Unfortunately, if you want to modify the path (as you are, adding
/usr/lar3ry/bin) there is no way to do so without explicitly writing the
default module path as you've done.

I brought this up as an issue back when we first started using
version-specific module directories (which I like, don't get me wrong :)
but so far we haven't done anything about it.

I'll try to find my original mail and report it to Jitterbug.

Well then maybe we should hold back on the beta for a few more days and
tighten this up little more. Freeze all additions except explicit and
*specific* bug fixes, and give workes a change to compile and run across
their platforms. What we currently have does not seem like a public beta.

The big problem is tkgoodstuff, which I have apparently inherited.  I
have no desire to synchronize version numbers with fvwm and/or tk, so
the best thing for me is to install in the standard GNU ${prefix}
directory.

But it IS a module, so I could either symlink it to the fvwm modules
directory (which will apparently change with each release of fvwm2), or
add the standard directory somewhere in the ModulePath.  Which is why I
had the setup that you see.

I remember seeing this on the workers list, but since I don't have CVS
access for a number of reasons, it wasn't until the dot releases came
out that I actually saw it.

Here are some unasked for suggestions:  [smile]

1.  Have fvwm2 "remember" its hardcoded directory and tack it onto the
    end of any ModulePath specified.

2.  ModulePath is documented to understand environment variables (at
    least, it says so in the man page).  Why not have $FVWM_MODULE_DIR
    or something similar set by fvwm2 so that the user need only
    specify it via a variable?

> I'll try to find my original mail and report it to Jitterbug.

Good idea!  Nice to be able to keep track of it.

Thanks for the reply.

OK, I found out why we were seeing those extremely odd ABR (Array Bounds
Read) errors in DoNextToken, where the memory was some global value.

As one example, here's a statement where we were getting ABRs;
Parse.c:DoGetNextToken(), line 170:

         while ( (*t != 0) &&
                 ( isspace(*t) ||
                   (snum &&
                    strchr(spaces, *t)) ) )

The ABR actually happens here on the isspace() call.  The problem is
that in the purify .fvwm2rc file Dominik tests with he inserted a bunch
of non-ASCII chars:

  GlobalOpts äöwwwkjfd 2wäeöqdpef

etc.  Now, my locale is, of course, set to the basic C locale.  And the
man page for isspace() says:

     These macros classify  character-coded  integer  values.   Each  is  a
     predicate  returning  non-zero for true, zero for false.  The behavior
     of these macros, except isascii(), is affected by the  current  locale
     (see  setlocale(3C)).   To  modify  the  behavior,  change the LC_TYPE
     category in setlocale(), that is, setlocale(LC_CTYPE, newlocale).   In
     the  C  locale, or in a locale where character type information is not
     defined, characters are classified according to the rules of  the  US-
     ASCII 7-bit coded character set.

So, this function (isspace()) is not defined for non-ASCII, non-7-bit
characters unless you've executed the proper setlocale() or whatever to
make them legal.

In my locale, this function is probably simply doing a table lookup and
since the umlaut "a" above is -28 as a signed char, it's accessing
_backwards_ before the beginning of the array.

So.

We appear to have these choices:

 a) Remove the non-ASCII chars from the Purify test.  This doesn't
    really solve the problem if people do what I was doing (have
    non-ASCII chars in their .fvwm2rc files without the right locale
    set).

 b) Require that people running the Purify test use some locale that is
    defined for these chars (what would that be?  I'm not thrilled by
    this option :).  Again, this doesn't solve the problem in general.

 c) Change all the code that uses these functions to something like:

        isascii(*t) && isspace(*t)

    since isascii() is defined for all chars.  I tested this and it does
    solve the problem.  The issue here, of course, is that it restricts
    the fvwm2rc file to ASCII (7-bit) chars--at least for parsing spaces
    (are there any languages where whitespace chars appear in the upper
    ranges?).

Other options?

Both of these were suggested, along with my original which is kind of a
combination of them; a special symbol like "+" could be inserted into
the module path where you wanted the default path to appear:

  ModulePath +:/my/module/dir

However, I suggested that something like #2 would be best because I
actually use this value in other places in the .fvwm2rc file (for
example, I have a little script that builds a menu of all the modules in
the module directory, and it needs to know the path).  It's too bad the
fvwm config file language doesn't have generic "variables" that could be
set like this; I guess you'd have to use FvwmCpp or FvwmM4.

Anyway, for lack of real concensus or drive to code it, it hasn't been
done yet :)

If I understand what you are describing, you say your "isspace" function
is taking the character in question and using it as an index into an
array?

I assume this array is 256 bytes long?

If it is, and the characters are signed, shouldn't it adjust the offset
into the table?  (Start in the middle?)

Would making the characters unsigned help?

It seems to me all three alternatives are compatible.  We can implement
all 3.  So I would suggest we have concensus.  I thought we somewhat
purposely decided this was better done after the first official release.

The arguments to the is*() functions are ints, and must have a value that 
corresponds to either an unsigned char or EOF.  -28 isn't a valid argument
unless EOF is -28, which is unlikely.

Well, this all kind of misses the point I think.  I don't know, for
sure, how the isspace() function/macro on my system (Solaris 2.5.1;
originally found on SunOS 4.1.4, but I'm compiling with GCC so it may be
an inline function or something) is implemented... I'm just making a
guess based on what Purify says.

The point is that the man page says isspace() is _only_ defined across
the valid character set for the locale you're running the program in.
In the absence of settings to the contrary, the default locale is "C",
which is the basic ASCII character set, so isspace() has undefined
behavior on any character which is not a valid ASCII (7-bit) character.

We certainly can't go changing the operating system implementation of
isspace() :)

  de> Would making the characters unsigned help?

Possibly, but if so only by an accident of implementation.  The
important thing to note here is that the behavior is undefined, so we
shouldn't be doing it.

The question is, do we let people use non-ASCII chars in fvwm2rc files
and just assume that if they do so, they'll set the locale correctly?
In this case I think we should remove the 8-bit chars from the purify
tests.

Or do we hardcode restrictions (like using isascii()) and either hope it
works (whitespace appears in the 7-bit char sets for all locales) or
acknowledge that it doesn't?

I still agree with Todd.  I looked at the implementation of isspace
in ctype.h and it looks to me like using unsigned chars will kill
the ABR.

OK.

I assume we're not going to go through the code and change every
occurance of a char* relating to reading or handling config files to be
a unsigned char*?

So, then, I guess the idea is we change:

  isspace(*p)

to something like:

  isspace((unsigned char)*p)

This does appear to resolve the ABR in my tests.

Not too long ago, we discussed patches to fvwm2 for >8bit character sets.
Part of the patch changed "isspace" like this:

isspace(*p & 0xFF)

Does the cast, above, fix the ABR and the >8bit issue?

Macros come to mind, but I don't want to bring up macros.

I  sort of like to know  the sign of characters,  so  I try to declare
chars as unsigned chars...

OK, I've spent most of the afternoon trying to track down the core I'm
getting running the tests.

First, note I compiled a non-Purify version of fvwm2 and I _also_ get a
core dump using that.  It seems to me that anyone using one of the
debugging mallocs (there are versions around for Linux, for example,
that use mmap() to allocate memory, so that when you free it (munmap) it
becomes completely invalid and any access yields an immediate core)
should be able to see this!

Second, note that the core dump appears to happen a long time after the
actual bug; at least according to Purify there's a lot of FMR (Free
Memory Reads) going on before the core dump.  I tried to track the first
one, assuming that's the culprit.  There _DOES_ appear to be a bug here.

The first FMR that Purify finds is during the run of the "function
test_func" complex function.  It's trying to access memory in the
FvwmWindow struct; that struct has been freed:

  FMR: Free memory read
    * This is occurring while in:
          ComplexFunction [complex.c:155]
          ExecuteFunction [functions.c:260]
          HandleButtonPress [events.c:1138]
          DispatchEvent  [events.c:155]
          HandleEvents   [events.c:176]
          main           [fvwm.c:479]
          _start         [crt1.o]
    * Reading 4 bytes from 0x153c78 in the heap.
    * Address 0x153c78 is 20 bytes past end of a freed block at 0x153c60

ComplexFunction():155 is just:

	  if(tmp_win)
==>	    w = tmp_win->frame;

I checked this value of Tmp_win when ExecuteFunction() is entered, and
again when ComplexFunction is entered, and it's perfectly valid.

Then it continues on, and during the processing of the test_func
function, it does a "Recapture":

  ##### REFRESH WINDOW, REFRESH, RECAPTURE

   + "I" RefreshWindow
   + "I" RefreshWindow 	 	 	
   + "I" RefreshWindow wäepik-ö .-,poci32
   + "I" Refresh
   + "I" Refresh 	 	 	 	
   + "I" Refresh .-3mölp 9 n a.d.ök3qj0
   + "I" Recapture
   + "I" Recapture	 	 	 
   + "I" Recapture .-QW,ÖKcäük,.-qköcli qopiuw

It's the first Recapture that seems to be causing the problem.

OK, so we call builtins.c:Recapture().  That calls
fvwm.c:CaptureAllWindows().  It's not an initial capture, so it goes to
the else-clause at line 593.

This appears to go through every window.  At some point (in my case it
was actually the first time through the loop) it's going to find the
current window as tmp.  Then, at line 621, it calls Destroy(tmp).

In misc.c:Destroy(), it frees all the memory the window points to, then
at line 211, it frees the FvwmWindow structure itself.

Boom.

Now the global Tmp_win pointer and all the values of tmp_win,
etc. passed as arguments to ComplexFunction, etc. are invalid; they're
pointing to freed memory.  The next attempt to dereference them will
fail.

Not sure what the story is _supposed_ to be here, but it seems like that
Destroy isn't such a good idea?  Or is the "current" window supposed to
be protected somehow?  Or something?

Anyway, I'll comment out those Recapture calls and see if it gets
further.

It looks like the Destroy command has the same problem; after I removed
the Recapture calls I get this FMR:

+.IP "SnapAttraction \fIproximity behavior\fP"
+If during an interactive move the window (or icon) comes within \fIproximity\fP
+pixels of another the window (or icon) will be moved to make the borders
+adjoin. The default of -1 means that no snapping will happen.  A setting of
+0 does indeed snap when the distance is zero pixels.  This is relevent when
+the \fISnapGrid\fP option is used.
+
+The \fIbehavior\fP argument is optional and may be set to one of the four
+following values:
+.in +.5i
+All
+.in +.3i
+Windows snap to both other windows and other icons.  Icons snap to both other
+windows and other icons.

+.IP "SnapGrid \fIx-grid-size y-grid-size\fP"
+During an interactive move a window (or icon) will be positioned such that 
+its location (top left corner) will be coincindent with the nearest grid point.
+The default \fIx-grid-size\fP and \fIy-grid-size\fP setting are both 1, which 
+is effectively no grid all.  An interactive move with both \fISnapGrid\fP
+and \fISnapAttraction\fP in effect will result in the window being moved to be
+adjacent to the nearest window border (if within snap proximity) or grid 
+position.  In other words, the window will move the shortest distance possible
+to satisfy both \fISnapGrid\fP and \fISnapAttraction\fP.  Note that the X and 
+Y coordinates are not coupled.  For example, a window may snap to another window
+on the X axis while snapping to a grid point on the Y axis.

	Ouch! This looks like an accident that's been waiting to happen
for a long time - both Recapture and Destroy invoked from a function
seem to be hazardous.

	Not that I can see. Of course, "current window" becomes a somewhat
nebulous notion when FVWM starts calling itself with fake events, as
happens in Recapture.

	I think that one reason we don't see it happening all the time
has to do with the memory allocation strategies used in different systems.
As soon as the window is destroyed, Recapture re-adds it; I suspect that
those of us who've not been able to duplicate this have had the exact
same memory area immediately re-allocated as the "new" FvwmWindow struct
for the recaptured window, and nobody is the wiser. If that ever fails
to happen, er, boom!

	Another likely reason we don't see it much is that most people
probably don't have Destroy in a function, but rather have the single
built-in command bound to a mouse action or a menu item; and Recapture
perhaps isn't used that often in very complex functions.

	I think there are some things we could do to prevent the situation,
but we may be a little late into the release cycle to do them now.

	My first thought is to add a Boolean Reuse calling arg to Destroy
to tell it not to free the struct, and an *FvwmWindow arg to AddWindow
and friends to tell them to reuse the already allocated structure.
Certain functions, like Recapture, could supply these args to protect
themselves...or, rather, their callers.

	The Destroy command probably needs some special handling if
invoked from a function, to prevent it from destroying the window with
which ExecuteFunction was invoked...something like

  if (tmp_win == NoDestroyWin) return;  /*  No-op destroy self  */

I'm cleaning up lots and lots of memory leaks I found after commenting
out the Recapture and Destroy sections of the Purify test, and I ran
across something odd in windows.c:do_windowlist().

See this code:

  char *tfunc=NULL;
    ...
        if (func)
	{
	  tfunc = safemalloc(strlen(func) + 32);
          sprintf(tlabel,"%s %ld",func,t->w);
	  free(func);
	  func = NULL;
	}
        else
	{
	  tfunc = safemalloc(40);
          sprintf(tlabel,"WindowListFunc %ld",t->w);
	}
	free(tfunc);

These are the _only_ references to tfunc anywhere in the function.  I
can't see any possible reason to be allocating that memory, or even to
have that variable exist at all.

Anyone else see anything?  Else I'll just remove it.

PS. This isn't a leak, I just noticed it and thought it was odd...

Can someone look at builtins.c:AddTitleStyle() and make sure it's doing
the right thing?

The loop seems odd to me; it loops through the action, parsing tokens
into "parm", but then that value is never used and instead the previous
token is passed to ReadTitleButton().  Is this right?  Obviously parm is
a memory leak, which I've fixed, but I wonder about the larger loop.

If that's the way it should work, it seems like a good enhancement to
GetNextToken() (really DoGetNextToken()) to allow the user to call it
with a NULL token pointer, if the caller doesn't want to bother
allocating memory for the returned token (which appears to be the case
here).  I can make that change if it seems like a good idea to others.

Hmm.  I'm not sure I think that's a good idea.

We're introducing this new feature (installing modules in a
version-specific directory) so people who have a ModulePath already
(which is probably almost everyone since it was in the system.fvwm2rc)
are going to have to change their .fvwm2rc files for this.

I'd hate to have only partial support for this in the first release,
then tell them to change it _again_ for the next release.

MHO.

Well, obviously we were wrong. We should do something for this release.
If we can get existing config files running even better, so I think the
default path is searched always when all else fails.

I'm still without my Linux box, so can someone else take action?

Yup. That's a bug (which may cause a coredump). Two or three
people have been active in this function (on of them me), so
I think we mixed things up a bit. The sprintf's shouldn't
print into tlabel but into tfunc. The free has to be moved
(I think that was my doing while trying to fix leaks).

Can you make the changes?

Another bug. Replace the prev in ReadTitleButton with parm.

No need at the moment. There are already functions that do this
(PeekToken). I don't want to touch Parse.c right now. After the
release I'll try to think of some universal parsing functions.

This seems to be a pretty generic bug in the way fvwm handles destroying
things in functions.  Is it possible to detect when fvwm is in the
middle of a function?  If so it might be possible to have the free()'s
diverted into a list when fvwm is processing a function and have the
list of free()' executed when fvwm becomes idle.  I know this sounds
like a bodge but it would let a function destroy itself.

Just wondering,
Tim.

Perhaps we can do this. But we shouldn't do so close to the release.
In the end most people won't do what I do in the purify script.
After the release we should think of some way to allow this
(there is a bug report for DestroyFunc and DestroyMenu in Jitterbug
already. Seems it has to be extended to window destruction).

It appears that FvwmTaskBar is not reading its configuration correctly.
(It is in the "extras" directory after all.)

Originally fvwm modules got passed the name of the  config file as arg
3,  and they opened, read,  and parsed all the  commands in the config
file.   If your  .fvwm2rc  contains any read  commands,  the file read
becomes the  new arg 3  passed to modules.   This leads to the problem
you detected.

What  FvwmTaskBar   should  be doing  is   asking  fvwm2  to  send  it
configuration information through  the fvwm2-to-module pipes.  If  you
want to know when  this is fixed,  you will have  to subscribe  to the
workers list or wait for an announced beta.

The other modules  should not have   this problem.  Please  report any
that do.

The module man pages may  say that they  read the .fvwm2rc config file
because thats what they used to  do, or because the actual explanation
is complicated.  I'll take a look.

I'm not following why you  would want to  change this kind of thing in
this release.  I thought we just wanted to fix bugs, not start in with
more enhancements.

It's like Paul said. We shouldn't force everyone to change his
config file to work again and then change is again shortly after.
I think the reason why this was forgotten is that we didn't
reach an agreement at first, then there were more pressing
things to do. There is one other thing I'm quite uncomfortable
with: We had no time to straighten up the MenuStyle syntax :(.

A small patch just to allow existing config files to work
(like appending the default dir at the end of the path)
would suffice and is not much work for now.

Could it be conisdered a bug that each new release of fvwm2 requires
people to edit their configuration files?

OK, I  guess I'm just blind  to this because  I've  been using a shell
that exports a  module path environment variable  for a long time now,
and installing each new release in an area unique to the release, so I
don't see this as a new problem at all.

OK... but in that case, what's prev for?  Now _IT_ doesn't ever seem to

If we're willing to say "it's still an alpha-quality hacking release" or
inform people that there will be config file changes between this release
and the next one, then no, that's not bugginess; it's progress.  If we're
trying to call it a beta test then we shouldn't be changing anything.

It's all about what the user is promised; a developer should not go making
promises that can't be kept ("this software is stable") and the user
shouldn't try to hold the developer to promises they didn't make ("your
alpha-quality software just isn't stable stable").

I don't know. Perhaps looking into the 47d or 46 code
will enlighten you. The function has obviously been
reworked (maybe by me, maybe not) but I can't find
it in the Changelog. My guess is that it is dead code.

I really recommend a cvs annotate or a look at
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fvwm/fvwm/builtins.c?annotate=1.30&cvsroot=FVWM
and a check of what changed in 1.11 and 1.13.  CVS can generally answer
these kinds of questions pretty well.

I think we should use some numbers; when I say release here I'm talking
about 2.2.  I think 2.2 is supposed to be a Stable Release.

As such, I believe this problem to be significant enough, and
user-visible enough, that _something_ needs to be done to resolve it
before 2.2 goes out.

My opinion.

PS. Note that the environment variable thing is _really_easy_ to
    implement, just stick it into the environment in main() and you're
    done.  1 line, unless you want to test if the user set it first.

Well it compiles but that isn't what I sent you as the diff.
You comitted 
if((Tmp_win)&&((Tmp_win->icon_w == cre->window)))
    {  
      .
      .
      .
      if((Tmp_win)&&((Tmp_win->icon_pixmap_w == cre->window)))
      .
      .
      .
     }
Think about it will that work.
what you wanted was 
    if((Tmp_win)&&((Tmp_win->icon_pixmap_w == cre->window)))
    {  
      Tmp_win->icon_p_height = cre->height+ cre->border_width +
cre->border_width;
    }  
    if((Tmp_win)&&((Tmp_win->icon_w == cre->window)))
    {


with the first 4 lines being the new code. Inserted before the existing
if ...->icon_w

Mine too. Even better if we'd do it with the beta. It is really only
a small patch. Appending the default path when ModulePath is called
isn't much of a deal either (just make sure the array is long enough).

As an 'outsider' it seems to me that you decided on doing a beta release
(Which I'd take to have bugs anyway ...) and then instead of releasing
it and immediately fixing the things you notice for 2.1.4 you're trying
to hold back the release of 2.1.3. This is (semi-)acceptable behaviour
with respect to a 'stable' release ie 2.2 but for beta releases I'd
think you're better off just releasing 2.1.3 let people use it for a
while. Meantime you're working on the bugs you know about and fixing
them for 2.1.4 and then you can work on the bugs people report from
2.1.3.

Just my 2p

Generally; and the annotate is cool.  However, it seems this particular
code (dealing with prev) predates the CVS archive so the annotate
doesn't help much.

It does point out that the change to this function that makes prev
useless (if parm is used in ReadTitleButton) is the while loop used to
loop on prev, but now loops on parm.

Anyway, I changed the function to this now that prev serves no purpose:

    action = GetNextToken(action,&parm);
    while(parm)
    {
      action = ReadTitleButton(parm, &fl->titlebar, True, -1);
      free(parm);
      if (!action)
        break;
      action = GetNextToken(action,&parm);
    }

This still looks pretty odd to me, in particular the multiple assignment
of the action variable.  We assign it to the results of _both_
ReadTitleButton _and_ GetNextToken, and we use the results of the first
assignment as an argument to the second?

I don't pretend to understand this so maybe it's right, but it looks
odd.  Maybe someone with a better knowledge can add a comment or two for
the enlightenment of future developers :)

I'd fully agree if the two problems we are talking about
were not this damn obvious. The ClickTime problem broke
about 25% of the setups and perhaps 75% or more of the
users will see the module path issue.

Anyway, 2.1.4 should go out today with either a fast fix
for ModulePath or a big entry in the BUGS file. Paul, will
you make the decision (and the change in the code/BUGS file)?
The top priority must be to have 2.1.4 today.

No, that can't be right. Get next token allocates new memory and
action will be invalid after ReadTitleButton. This won't work
Try removing the assignment.

If no one else objects,  I'll take a look   at the FvwmTaskBar  config
reading issue.  I might  even  change the  man  page which  says  this
module only works with fvwm-95.

This is rubbish. Style FvwmBorder windows have a ->bw of one.  I use
MWMBorder so I'd forgotten about the original border decorations.

To the people experiencing growing/wandering windows: are you using
FvwmBorders?
Cheers,
Tim.

No, this whole set of changes is quite wrong.  It definitively breaks
most TitleStyle commands dealing with buttons.

The ReadTitleButton function _expects_ to see the entire title line
(e.g., what was prev), _not_ just the next parameter in the action
(e.g., parm).

For example, given this command:

  TitleStyle Activeup -- raised

That entire thing is supposed to be parsed by ReadTitleButton(), but the
code as changed passes _only_ the Activeup command, so it doesn't see
the rest ("-- raised").  Then it loops around again in AddTitleStyle and
tries to invoke ReadTitleButton with the --, which fails.

I think the original code was correct, basically: you pass prev to the
ReadTitleButton and assign the return value to action; ReadTitleButton
will parse as much of the action as it likes and return a pointer to the
rest.

It appears, as I mentioned in my first mail, that all the GetNextToken
is doing here is seeing if there _is_ a next token, but the value
returned is never used or useful.  I guess, based on Dominik's
subsequent comments, that might be better replaced with a PeekToken()
call?  Hmm, no, looking at that it doesn't do what I was talking about:
that function still allocates memory and returns it.  I was talking
about modifying GetNextToken() et.al. so that if you passed a NULL ptr
as the second arg it _wouldn't_ allocate any memory, but just skip the
next token.  This can be used to see if you're at the end of the action
list without going through the hassle of allocating/freeing memory.
Maybe there's a better way (a new AtEOString() function or something?)
Anyway, that's for later.  For now I'm changing the code in
AddTitleStyle() back to more-or-less what it was (plus freeing the
memory leak :).

I have not tried this, but if it works now (and not just under fvwm-95),

I don't see any reason why not.  Do you want to do it?

The only outstanding bug is a problem with AutoHide, but I just ran it
for a few hours with AutoHide on, and it didn't seem that bad.

I have not yet touched the CVS tree, and probably do not have access, so
some other soul will have to do this.

I need to apply some OS patches, so I'm taking the machine down for a bit.
It shouldn't take too long to finish.

Log message:
After tracking down the coredump in the purify test, commented out
the parts causing the problem.

Then, continued to fix a few heap problems (UMR's, mostly) and many,
many memory leaks.  The test now completes losing only 400 bytes!

Fixed bug installing FvwmCommand in bindir (can't access Jitterbug
right now to find the number).

Forgot to send this earlier, sorry.

OK, after a couple of days fighting with (and, for the most part,
winning... yay! :) bugs, UMRs, and heap rot in fvwm2 I committed a bunch
of fixes this afternoon; with those fixes fvwm2 will run the purify test
suite with no errors, and only leaking a bit over 400 bytes!  Pretty
good, since it started out leaking over 32K... those fonts take up a
_lot_ of memory, and if you leak a few of them...

Anyway, here's the latest log.  Most of it is in menus.c but there're a
few others.  The one in SetEnv() is tricky, since the putenv() function
drops the old memory on the floor if you invoke it again with the same
variable.  Not sure if there's any reasonable way to fix this; since the
memory involved is small it may be more trouble than it's worth to fix.

Did the Path fix get commited? That with those memory leaks (fantastic job
by the way!) and the couple others of the last day should hopefully make a
good beta to put on the street.

Well, the document describing the hints that a window manager needs to
support to be Gnome compliant is out.  It's badly written in the usual
Rasterman style.  The support actually seems relatively simple; most of it
is geared towards supporting a pager and a taskbar.

The document is at http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/.  Obviously this
isn't appropriate now, but it would be nice to have it in the relatively
near future.  If nothing else, someone who knows what they are talking
about (i.e. not me) should look at the document to see if there are things
in there that are unworkable.

I've read the document and I had several concerns which I sent both to
raster and the gnome internal development list. I tried to be
unbiased, but maybe someone wants to read the document with more of an
fvwm slant. I am also willing to be the contact person for fvwm2 on
issues related to this if people don't feel this is an unacceptable
conflict of interest or whatever, and will gladly forward on any
fvwm-specific concerns and advocate them as strongly as the ones I've
already reported. To avoid duplication of reporting problems and
asking for clarification, here is the message I sent to raster.

Hi,

I just read the latest Gnome window manager compliace spec, and mostly
I like it very much. I have a few questions/suggested changes, however.


* Chapter 1 Section 1 calls for setting the value of
_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK to be set to the ID of a special window
created for this purpose. Is there a reason for doing this, instead of
just having the window manager set this property to nothing when it
starts up, and delete it when it exits? I can't see anywhere else in
the spec where that window is used.

* Chapter 2 Section 2 says a client should request state changes by
sending a client_message to its own window giving the new state
settings. Wouldn't it be simpler to have the client set the same
property on its own window that it set for the initial state setting
request? I believe that window managers must listen for PropertyNotify
on all managed clients anyway to comply with other standard window
manager protocols. Race conditions between the window manager and
client can be avoided by doing one of the following:

** always doing a grab, read, update, ungrab sequence

** forbidding the client to change its own state except when unmapped
(I believe some standard ICCCM or Motif protocols specify this).

** Using a different property for the last client request and the
current state, and having the format for the request property contain
the appropriate bitmask of what should be changed.

I dislike using client messages for window manager protocols because
it adds complexity, since most other protocols are handled solely with
properties.


The above two suggestions would personally make my life easier. The
following are questions on interpretation and semantics of the
document:


* what does WIN_STATE_HID_TRANSIENT mean? The comment says "/*owner of
transient is hidden*/" but I am not sure what it means - does this
indicate that the window is transient for a window that is hidden?
If so, shouldn't the window manager be able to tell that otherwise?
And if not, what is the window manager supposed to do when this bit is
set?


*The following bits may be hard for some window managers to implement
(not mine), should they just be ignored?

** WIN_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT 
** WIN_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ 
** WIN_STATE_SHADED


* What is the "taskbar" mentioned in the comment for WIN_STATE_HIDDEN:
is this meant to include only task bars per se, or also window
lists/windowlist menus, which are essentially vertically stacked
taskbars? Also, I have to say that I don't like this property - I
don't think a window should be able to say that it doesn't appear on a
window manager's takbar if the wm is managing it. Why wouold this be
useful?

* The following bits in _WIN_HINTS are described as settable only by
the app, but many window managers allow the user to set these
preferences in other ways. Should the window manager refuse to do such
operations for windows with this hint, or should they do them anyway
but not update the hint?

#define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_FOCUS      (1<<0) /*"alt-tab" skips this win*/
#define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_WINLIST    (1<<1) /*do not show in window list*/
#define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_TASKBAR    (1<<2) /*do not show on taskbar*/
#define WIN_HINTS_FOCUS_ON_CLICK  (1<<4) /*app only accepts focus if clicked*/

The last in particular, the difference between click-to-focus and
mouse-focus, is something that has traditionally been decided by
window managers.

* _WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE is described as an array of 4 CARDINALs but its
semantics are not described anywhere.

* _WIN_APP_STATE and _WIN_ICONS are mentioned in Chapter 1 Section 2
but their format and semantics are not explained anywhere.



Finally, a concern that does not apply to me directly at all (since I
don't plan to implement the hints in C): what is the license status of
the example code? I think X-style or public domain is best, since some
WMs are under X-like or BSD-like licenses.



Thanks for the excellent standard and I hope to hear back about these
issues.

Rats.  Up 'til now I was careful to only commit the files I really
changed, to avoid all those new Makefile.in files, but I forgot this
time :-/.

Hopefully that won't be a problem...

I can't figure out how to stop Makefile.in from using "TAR = gtar".
I've tried setting TAR=tar _everywhere_ I can think of (environment,
make command line), and rebuilding the Makefile.in files, but it still
always uses gtar.

It's really odd.

OK, that got committed.

I don't quite get this.  p is of type char*; isn't a char always 8 bits?
Don't you have to use wchar_t or whatever to get wide (>8 bit)
characters?

If I'm right, then isn't the "&0xFF" superfluous?

	Actually, there are several issues raised here. The general case
of window destruction within a function and the special case of function
self-destruction are definitely going to require a good deal of thought,
and probably some lively debate.

	However, for the special case of Recapture, I'd like to reiterate
my prior suggestion that Recapture should be able to tell Destroy to do
everything *except* actually free the FvwmWindow struct, and then be able
to pass the struct through to AddWindow to be reused. This is easy to do,
and has utility beyond the context of function processing. I'll eventually
need to do something like this anyway, to allow options to preserve certain
state information (that is in that struct) across a Recapture (as in my
old RecaptureRemembersIconPositions hack); and it will effectively close
this particular loophole.

It may help to set TAR=tar when configuring automake, and then
reinstall it (the automake script gets shis hardcoded in).

Just be sure to write something in Jitterbug so we know

I'm out of ideas regarding the AddToMenu leaks. I've tried at
least three times to find them but couldn't. Any help is
appreciated.

I'd still fix the (SetEnv) leak, just to make it clean.

Well, the next step should be to clean up the larger modules and
extras:

FvwmButtons
FvwmIconMan
FvwmTaskBar
FvwmWinList
FvwmWharf

So, if anyone is willing to write a purify script for one of them...
Buttons and IconMan are the biggest problems. Although I've worked
on them a bit there are definitely lots of leaks left.

I had the same problem with 2.1.3 (not the distribution but
CVS code shortly after the release). For some unknown reason
XPM was not defined in config.h (neither was rplay). After
rerunning configure Both defines were correct and it worked.

I almost never use this module,  but yesterday I  found that it creeps
up and to the left on resizes.  I seem to remember  more than one time
this module has been fixed for this problem.

Here's my config:

*FvwmWinListBack CadetBlue
*FvwmWinListFore White
*FvwmWinListFont 7x14bold
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1,WarpToWindow 50 50
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry -0-0

It does come up with the correct SouthEast Geometry.

I'm   not sure, perhaps   Makoto  MATSUSHITA  hasn't   given up on  us
completely and can explain this.

I would guess that somehow, the >8bit characters have to get into fvwm
as  window titles, etc.  and  they come in   as  ints with very  large
values.

Searches in the mail archive for I18N bring back most of what I remember
on this.  Looking thru the patch again, almost all of the "isspace"
changes are for casts to "unsigned char".  A few of them, go a little
farther:

- while(((isspace(*tmp))
+ while(((isspace((unsigned char)*tmp & 0xff))

The bulk  of the rest of  the  patch seems  to have  to do  with using
"fontsets" instead  of "fonts".  I'm  afraid I'm  a little ignorant in
this area, so I don't really understand why that part was needed.

I did some fixes for initial placement.  I use MWM style borders and it
doesn't wander.  I just tried FVWMBorder and it does wander.  I'll have a
go at narrowing this down.

I've attached some window grabs of the FVWMBorder frame around
FvwmWinList.  FVWMBorders style windows have a one pixel width border on
the frame.  Is this really how they are supposed to look? What I mean is
that the top and left frames have a 2 pixel relief of topshadow surrounded
by the one pixel border, the right and bottom frames have a one pixel
relief of bottomshadow that with the one pixel border looks like a two
pixel relief. There's an extra pixel of bottomshadow at the top and left
of the bottom and right frames and one at the bottom of the titlebar.

Cheers,
Tim.

Cheers,

Works fine with my -0-0 geometry with either Fvwm or MWM borders.
Nice work.

The taskbar   seems OK too, although  I  didn't find the old  one that
broken.

Is anyone here familiar with any of the following:

  LXR
  Bonsai
  Tinderbox
  MySQL
  Bugzilla

Jitterbug is in place and the web server's running.  I'm playing with
moving the mailing list archives over.  A test CVS server is just about set
up and the machine is into our normal backup rotation (which is what the OS
upgrade was about yesterday; dump doesn't work out of the box on Digital
Unix).

However, I want to continue to play with the available tools.  Jitterbug
works, but it's turning out to be somewhat limiting so I want to see if
BugZilla can handle things.  CVSweb is nice, but LXR is pretty neat as well
and there's no reason not to run both.  I don't know about Bonsai and
Tinderbox, but some of the larger projects seem to find good uses for them.

Is there anyone here with familiarity with these tools who might lend a
hand if I get stuck, or who might say a word as to their applicability for
our purposes?

Also, the question of a domain name has come up before.  'fvwm.org' is free
and it would be nice to grab it.  I don't believe I can host a domain here,
although I do have several DNS servers so perhaps I can.

If there is any cost to acquiring the name, I would be willing to chip
in.

I've put up a CVS server on fvwm.math.uh.edu; I'd like folks to try it out
and see if there is any noticeable performance difference.  This machine
should be a bit faster than the old clunker, but it only has 64MB of RAM
(and it's an Alpha, so binaries are huge; the old machine had a few hundred
meg).  We'll see how it goes.  If anyone has any additional 72-pin true
parity memory they feel like tossing, feel tree to toss it my way.  I'm
going to scrounge around and see what I can find around here.

You can access the server with -d :pserver:user@fvwm.math.uh.edu:/cvs/fvwm
and you will have to login again.  Don't overwrite your main source tree.

If this runs OK and I can find some more RAM, I'll have everyone switch.

I'm very familiar with MySQL; I wrote a change grouping package on top
of ClearCase that everyone over here is using.  It's in perl and uses
MySQL as the database repository for storing information about the
change groups, dependencies, etc.

I think MySQL is great, it's wicked fast, small, easy to use, has great
Perl (and C) database interface, has easy-to-use PHP and other
interfaces, etc.  And, while not strictly open source, it's very close
(basically it's OSS except you can't sell MySQL as part of another
product) and has a nice community.  The authors are very active on the
mailing list.

But, it's just a basic SQL database so I'm not quite seeing where it
fits in with the other tools you've specified here :)

An auto-build is OK, but it seems to me that having automated tests for
a window manager will be tricky: how are you going set it up?  Have an X
server just hanging out, and keep running fvwm2 tests against it?  I
guess you could do it.

The fvwm build is pretty fast, so I'm not sure it's really necessary
yet.

That would be really nice, if we could do it.  I'd chip in some $$ for
the registration, too.

It is used as the backend repository for at least Bugzilla and I think
another of those tools.

I guess you could only test if it compiled.  That's still useful, but not
stunningly so.

I just dug this message out of the depths of my inbox.  After browsing the
Bonsai source, the name seemed oddly familiar...

I may be interested in taking you up on this offer, or at least tapping you
for info.  With the TCL gone, Bugzilla seems almost simple and I may look
into it if Jitterbug turns out to not be 'meaty' enough.

However, I am somewhat interested in Bonsai.  However, after a browse
through the source, ...., wow.  Maybe not.  Do you think it's worth it at
all for a project of FVWM's size?  Right now I'm probably going to hack LXR
and CVSweb together and see how it turns out.

Bugzilla is completely simple, compared to Bonsai.  Bonsai developed 
sort of as a cancerous growth...

Personally, I wouldn't get much benefit from Bonsai for a project the 
size of fvwm.  I'd use it if it were there, but I could make do pretty 
well without it.

There's an old Irish saying: "When two people tell you you're drunk, go and lie

Are you sure that happens only with negative desktop numbers?
Looking at the code I'd say mouse button 3 does not work
properly with more than one desk. That's what I see at home.
The problem is that it does not switch desks and expects the
mouse in the first desktop.

Now that we have 2.1.4 and no complains (?) can we announce
the beta finally?

Jason, I'd say if nobody finds a showstopper (i.e. a really
critical bug) until 6 PM (GMT), you should post the announcement
(I've updated the file for 2.1.4, but the distribution list is
still in).

I've built fvwm-2.1.4 on Digital Unix and everything (at least my
configuration!) seems to be working fine.

DEC's C compiler emitted some warning messages that you may be
interested in looking into, just to avoid generating diagnostics.  To
my eyes, these look mostly harmless...

I've attached the messages below.  Since some file names are not
unique, I've put the directory where the files are found in column
one, and have indented and word-wrapped the messages.

And i did mail you my config w/ the 1st message.  I'll mail you another

I had something similar myself. I rerun configure and then it worked.
Don't know why. If that doesn't help, try defining the rplay library
too.

Yes, I know. But I need it with the correct whitespace. Please
resend it directly to me as a gzipped attachment, just to make
sure.

Straight from man FvwmPager esp. the last sentence.

 Clicking mouse button 3 on a  location  within  the  current
     desktop  will  cause  the  viewport  to move to the selected
     location, but will not align the viewport to  a  page  boun-
     dary.  Dragging  button 3 will cause the viewport to move as
     you drag. Button 3 operations are  limited  to  the  current
     desktop only.

One unfortunate effect of this as I just noticed in seeing if it worked
for my 2 desk setup is that it works fine on the 1st desk but if you do it
in the pager for the second desk all the windows on the first desk got
moved around, hosing all my geometries.

I think that's a local error; the same command line (changing dane to
tibbs, of course) works fine here.  I'm at CVS 1.10.3, as is the server.

Has anyone else tried?

Aha. Anyway, I don't see a reason why that should be limited
to the current page. If I find something working smoothly
I will change that.

I've managed to get my hands on an AlphaStation 250/266 with 256MB of RAM,
which is heaps better than the 200/233 with 64MB that's running the new
server now.  I'm pretty sure I can just transplant the disk and boot the
new machine.  This will only effect Jitterbug and the web pages for now;
CVS is still on the old Sun.

I'll have time to do this in a couple of hours.

Note it's FvwmCommand, not fvwmcommand (just in case :)

It installed OK for me.  You'll probably need to do a very clean build;
I had problems where some of the makefiles didn't get changed correctly
the first time.

Try checking out a vanilla copy and building in there.  If it still
fails, please give me some info on the Makefile.in and Makefile files in
the extras/FvwmCommand directory.

Thanks.

ok, this is going to be one of those days. This time I'll send this to the
list. 

It installed fine for me.  Since I have fvwm running out of a sub dir in my
home dir, I noticed that FvwmCommand was in the bin dir.  Than with out
bothering to check docs, I posted the question.

My Bad.  I'll try not to do that again.

at least that is what it looked like to me:

With "FvwmPager -1 1" the right mouse button doesn't work at all, when I
change it to "FvwmPager 0 2", everything works as described in the
documentation.

Well I tried again and it worked fine.

As you can  see I tried  to check out  into a directory other than the
default "fvwm".  On my first test, I made  the mistake of creating the
directory "servertest" before I  did the checkout.  The above messages
are  the apparent result of  doing that.  Without  the directory being
there, it works fine.

CVS continues to surprise.

Honestly I know Perforce to be the better system, but CVS really is the

Hopefully a disk transplant will be sufficient, and everything will be happy and
fast and powerful and stuff when it comes back.

I just built and installed fvwm-2.1.4 on Solaris 2.5.1, X11R6.1, gcc 2.8.1, make
3-77 with no problems.

The only thing I have noticed is that when my FvwmPagerBalloon pops up the
background color is always the same as the setting of the foreground color.

Here is what I have:
##########################FvwmPagerBalloon############################
*FvwmPagerBalloons            All
*FvwmPagerBalloonBack         yellow
*FvwmPagerBalloonFore         black
*FvwmPagerBalloonFont         lucidasanstypewriter-12
*FvwmPagerBalloonYOffset      +2
*FvwmPagerBalloonBorderWidth  1
*FvwmPagerBalloonBorderColor  black

This produces a solid black box.  If I change FvwmPagerBalloonFore to red and
restart fvwm2 then it produces a box with a black border filled with solid red.

I looked at FvwmPager.c and found this at line 1240:

      else if (StrEquals(resource, "BalloonBack"))
        {
          if (Scr.d_depth > 1)
            {
              if (BalloonBack)
                free(BalloonBack);
              CopyString(&BalloonBack, arg1);
            }
        }

      else if (StrEquals(resource, "BalloonFore"))
        {
          if (Scr.d_depth > 1)
            {
              if (BalloonBack)
                free(BalloonBack);
              CopyString(&BalloonFore, arg1);
            }
        }

I fixed this be changing the second "else if" look like this:

      else if (StrEquals(resource, "BalloonFore"))
        {
          if (Scr.d_depth > 1)
            {
              if (BalloonFore)
                free(BalloonFore);
              CopyString(&BalloonFore, arg1);
            }
        }

Updated version info for 2.1.5.

Added NEWS items for 2.1.4 (forgot for the release, drats!)

Since I fixed the silly tar/gtar problem, I'm committing new versions
of all the Makefile.in's, for hopefully the last time!!

I'd be willing to lend a hand with Bonsai/Tinderbox/Bugzilla if required.
I use Bonsai and Bugsplat (internal version of Bugzilla) on a daily basis for
my job.

We're back up.  If you've ever been inside an Alphastation you may
understand why I'm frazzled right now.

But we now have a faster machine with _much_ more memory.  Whee!

You can send mail to gnu@gnu.org for this, but note that betas are
almost never announced there.  I would not bother to notify them until
the real 2.2 release.

You might think about the comp.windows.x and/or comp.os.linux.x groups,
I guess.

Sorry for the subject line, this is not about plumbing.

A while ago we had a problem with FvwmForm sending a bunch of commands
to fvwm2  and then exiting.  fvwm2  saw the module  exit before it had
read all the  commands, so it  closed the pipes and  never got all the
commands it was supposed to.

I believe I have a simple working solution.

I simply  changed the  button from a  "quit"  button  to a  "continue"
button, and  sent a "KillMe" command to  fvwm2 as the  last command on
the  button.  I don't  believe  the   "KillMe" command is   documented
anywhere,  but it seems   to  have been  designed expressly   for this
purpose.

So far, I don't see any  negative consequences, except that the "quit"
button doesn't work as advertised.  Perhaps I can make the quit button
send a "KillMe" without the user actually coding it as a command...

The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the first official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.4). Available at

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/

it includes the following features:

*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug
   tracking system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).
*) Mini title windows for FvwmPager (aka Balloons).
*) FvwmEvent is the successor of FvwmAudio. FvwmAudio is still
   available.
*) FvwmTile and FvwmCascade modules were replaced by
   FvwmRearrange. Shells for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade provide
   backward compatibility.
*) Improved FvwmButtons button placement to give absolute control
   over where the buttons are placed.
*) Color limiting (previously available thru patches).
*) Multiple Icon Boxes, Icon box grids, and Icon box fill
   direction control (previously available thru patches).
*) Faster startup.
*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability.
*) Many small enhancements too numerous to list here.
*) Consistent copying policy.
*) GNU autoconf support.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be
found at:

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/NEWS.html

Although the maintainers feel this beta is quite stable there are
some known problems that shall be fixed before the final release
(and some that will have to wait). You can find a list of known
bugs in the BUGS file at the top level of the distribution.

Before you report a bug, please read the manpages, the NEWS file
and the FAQ too. If you can solve your problem this way but still
feel the information was too hard to find, please tell us.

To submit a bug, please follow the link to the FVWM bug tracking
system on our web page.


Beta testers needed:
====================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.

I think there is work to be done on the fvwm links page.

For example, it still has links to the autoconf (spelled wrong :) and
pager balloon sites, when those are both already installed in 2.1.4.

Also, the link to the CDE panel lookalike is non-existent.

Maybe other stuff.

Hmm.  Well, if it's to be supported it needs to be documented so it
isn't conveniently "forgotten" at some point.

Also, while this may solve the problem I still consider it a workaround.
The pipe should not be closed while data is still in it.  Fixing this
may take a little thought but it's not that hard and it's The Right
Thing To Do.

Most definitely.  There are some dead links, and we should probably add
several others, like the fvwm2gnome page and fvwm.themes.org.  I'm off to
bed now, but if nobody commits fixes by the morrow I'll work on it a bit.

This reminds me: can someone give me a final list of stuff that I can nuke
from the unofficial-patches directory?

And finally: I announced on Freshmeat.

I just created bug #48 which is this old thing.  I knew I'd seen a patch
go by so I searched the archives and found the relevant thread that
starts last Nov (see the bug for the URL).

The result was that Bob W. created the MouseFocusOnStartup unofficial
patch based on some code from Greg B. and scwm.

I think that should be applied, as that bug annoys the dickens out of
me too.  Are there any issues with it, or should I go ahead and merge it
in?

The new cvs server seems a good bit more responsive than the old one,
but if I try to commit a change I get this error:

  cvs server: cannot exec /cvs/fvwm/CVSROOT/commit_prep: No such file or directory
  cvs server: Pre-commit check failed
  cvs [server aborted]: correct above errors first!

checkout and release seem to work fine...

Ho hum.  Looking at the code I see that patch was already applied.

So, I'd like to inform folks that it ain't working :)

My setup is:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + "I" Module FvwmAuto 500

That's right, not a single mention of "focus" of any kind in my
~/.fvwm2rc file, so I'm getting the default behavior, whatever that is,
plus FvwmAuto.

And this patch isn't helping my problem.

Thoughts?

I need to fixup the location of Perl.  I've done that, so you should be
able to test out commits, but keep in mind that nothing you do will get
saved.

I'm glad to hear that the new machine is more responsive.  It should be,
but there is one annoying performance problem relating to CVS stupidity
that I'm hoping I can find a way around.  Essentially, when you checkout it
copies the entire directory structure of the repository to /tmp to make
locks in or something, then deletes it when the update is done.  One the
Sun, /tmp is in RAM so this doesn't take too long.  The Alpha doesn't have
tmpfs, though, so it has to actually write to disk, which takes a while.

I like Linux, I really do.  But DU is a really, really good Unix.  Linux on
the Alpha has a place, especially when DU costs $1000, but when you get DU
for free, there is really very little reason to run Linux.

Read the Linux/Alpha groups; there are nagging problems and bugs that you
just don't see with DU.  Plus, you can't install it over a serial console,
and these machines don't have graphics.

I agree.  I just wanted to mention the simple workaround.

I see the only other place KillMe is used is in FvwmCommandS.c.

Perhaps when the real fix is in place there will be no reason to
document the command.

As I understand it there's no difference... ?  The + does the same
thing as having it all on the same line.

Anyway, it works and has worked for me basically since FvwmAuto was
first created.

Except that when I start FVWM, it doesn't give focus to the window under
the mouse.

When an icon pixmap is changed (by changing the wmhints), fvwm kills the
existing icon window and creates a new one even if it has the same size.
This results in an annoying flash and the new icon is placed on top of any
obscuring windows. Some programs display some kind of state in their icons
which causes this at regular intervals (some clocks, mail programs,
system monitors such as qps).

The patch applies to fvwm 2.1.4.

	Sorry I've been out of touch lately. I had a family medical
emergency to attend to. My activity will likely remain irregular for
the next few days.

	I seem to recall that some changes went in recently affecting
window list reorganization and focus transfer that looked like they
might make mouse focus behave a little more like click focus under
certain circumstances. I don't remember who did them or when, or just
what was changed. If I have any time this weekend I'll see if I can
locate that message thread, but you might get there before me. I do
think this would be the place to start looking; something seems to
be defeating my (actually Greg's) patch to coerce mouse focus at
startup.

Hi, I think I've found another two bugs in FvwmButtons using panel in
fvwm-2.1.4 on my linux 2.0.36 PC.
 I have a buttonbar composed of a few panels, like the flollowing:

*FvwmButtons(Title Terminal,Icon xterm.linux_3d.xpm,Panel (right)
Terminal)
*FvwmButtons(Title PPP,Icon ppp.xpm,Panel (right) PPP)
*FvwmButtons(Title Softwares,Icon pick_3d.xpm,Panel (right) Softwares)
*FvwmButtons(Title Games,Icon games.xpm ,Panel (right) Games)
*FvwmButtons(Title WinOps,Icon bomb_defuse_3d.xpm,Panel (right) WinOps)
*FvwmButtons(Title Exit,Icon quit.xpm,Panel (right) Exit)
#*FvwmButtons(Title ,Icon ,Panel (right) )

and in the panel "Softwares" I have two more sub-panel defined:

*FvwmButtonsPanel Softwares
*FvwmButtonsGeometry +0+0
*FvwmButtonsRows 1		
*FvwmButtonsBack bisque2	
*FvwmButtonsFore #f020f0
*FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmButtons(Title Emacs,Icon gnu-animal.xpm, Action  `Exec
/usr/bin/emacs &`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title Plan,Icon cal_3d.xpm, Action  `Exec
/usr/local/bin/plan`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title ICQ,Icon icq.xpm, Action  `Exec /home/gxu/bin/ICQ`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title StarOffice ,Icon office.xpm, Action  `Exec
/home/gxu/opt/Office50/bin/soffice`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title Top,Icon xload.next.xpm, Action  `Exec
/home/gxu/bin/xtop`)
*FvwmButtons(Title Audio,Icon Music.xpm,Panel (up) Audio )
*FvwmButtons(Title Graphics,Icon paint2_3d.xpm,Panel (down) Graphics)



The first bug comes like this:
When I press the botton "Softwares" to bring out the panel "Softwares",
then press the botton "Audio" in the panel to bring out a second panel,
a child of the first one. I press the botton "Softwares" again, the first
panel "Softwares" disappeared, but the panel "Audio" is still there,
hanging in the air!!

The second bug: if I bring out more in one panels at a time such as
"Terminal", "Softwares", "PPP", etc., and press a button in any of these
panel bars, as the command gets executed, all the panels disappear! I
believe the right way is either the panel with the button I pressed should
disappear and the others should remain, or they should all remain until
being pulled back manually. 

Did anyone else on other systems experience the same thing? I'd like to
know if this is a bug of the program. Thanks.

Best wishes,
G.Xu

This is with a grab of the CVS tree today at 20:49:13 (UTC, I guess),
according to CVS/Entries, but I think it applies to 2.1.4 as well.

On my Linux box, I was unable to compile with --enable-extras turned on
because of a problem in FvwmConsole.  FvwmConsole.h includes sys/un.h
before sys/socket.h.  Unfortunately, sys/un.h on my libc5 setup simply
includes linux/un.h, which doesn't define sa_family_t.  This is defined in
sys/socket.h, which is included immediately after sys/un.h in
FvwmConsole.h.

Switching the order of the two lines fixed the problem, and everything
compiled fine afterwards.

I don't believe this is a problem for glibc2 (libc6) Linux systems.


My request is this.  Ever since the switch from fvwm 1 to fvwm 2, I have
kept the name fvwm, rather than switching to fvwm2.  This always struck me
as an ugly hack to make sure that people would be caught unawares and shoot
themselves in the foot.

Luckily, in the old Imakefile setup, there was an option to disable the
rename, and I always took that option.  It doesn't seem like that option
exists now in the new (and really smooth, I might add ... thanks!)
configure setup.

So if we're never going to return to a binary without a builtin version
number by default, could we at least have an option to do without it for
those of us who haven't had fvwm1 on their system since, um ... since ...
well, a really, really long time?

(If the answer is `We're willing to accept such a patch if you write it',
then I will, but I'd appreciate any pointers as to what I'd need to change
and how.)

Thanks, everyone, for a job well done.
Danek

Hi,

These are not really bugs. I expect them will behave like this. :)

My solution: Press the button "Softwares" to bring up the "Softwares" panel,
then press "Audio" to close up the hanging "Audio" panel. :)
In fact, if there are two bottons that invoke the same "Audio" panel and
are pressed, one will bring up the panel and the other will hide it. Otherwise
showing two identical panels is kind of waste of resource, which is against
the philosophy of Fvwm. So all the panels are of the same rank, the only
parent they have is the root/main panel. However, if two panels are designed
identically with different names, they can show up at the same time.

We can argue about this. Usaully I search for a certain button, when I find
it, I can invoke the application without going back to close all those panels,
since they take up space and you don't want them to stay there after you
find the button you want. The CDE's panels sure have the behavior you described.
But I think some of the CDE's features are not that good; for example, the
FvwmPager is a lot better than the CDE's only 4 windows, amoung which you
can not drag one application window to another. And what you found is the
CDE's convetion I don't want to stick to. Anyhow, just my opnion.

Thanks for the reply. I think you have a point there. However, the second
one I mentioned, maybe there could be an option to control the actions of
the panels (i.e., the user can specify if the panels will withdraw or not
after a button is pressed?)

There is one more thing I found out today. It looks like the buttonbars in
the panel do not have support for *FvwmButtonPixmap. This works for my
root panel, but no other panels could use a pixmap background. Was it
designed to be that way or just forgotten:-)?

all the best,

Hello,

# Desk arg1 [arg2] [min max]

Key Page_Up     A       M       Desk -1 1 0 3
Key Page_Down   A       M       Desk 1 1 0 3

I have 4 desks, numbered from 0 to 3 and DeskTopSize is set to 2x1. When
I want to go the the next or previous desk, using the PageUp and
PageDown, I get some strange behaviour. I can only move between desk 0
and desk 1. It seems that the max parameter always contains the value
"1". When I set min to an negative number, it works "well". at least,
fvwm seems to switch to the unexistent desks, according to my pager. But
changing max into any other value, doesn't influence the bindings.

Discarding the range, min and max parameters, works ok.

Greetings,

Wing Tung

Subject: unsolicited patch: user-specified top and bottom shadow colors

Hi,

This patch to the distributed 2.1.4 source adds support to FVWM2 for
user-specified top and bottom shadow colors (only i called them 'highlight'
and 'shadow' colors, because the man page did). I find this very useful.

Specifically:

  * Style command `Color' accepts max 4 slash-separated colors:
    fore/back/highlight/shadow
  * New style commands `HighlightColor', `ShadowColor' (analogous to
    ForeColor/BackColor)
  * MenuStyle change: the 2nd argument, `backcolor', may have the form
    `backcolor,highlightcolor,shadowcolor'
  * HighlightColor change: the 2nd argument, `backcolor', may have the form
    `backcolor,highlightcolor,shadowcolor'

Hope this makes it in.
love,
ed

	I see two problems in the beta code.

	First, I think the documentation needs a little revision. I
assumed the syntax you're using was valid, but after looking at the
code, I see that it's not. You can specify 1, 2, or 3 args, but not
all 4. 1 or 2 args are supposed to work the way the old Desk command
did (more on that later). To specify a range of allowable desks to
circulate among, you specify 3 args:

	1 - the relative desk no.
	2 - the minimum of the range
	3 - the maximum of the range

So the examples above are saying that the minimum desk no. is 1, and
the max is 0; and the fallback logic for an invalid range specification
ends up alternating between min and max, or 0 and 1.

	The other problem I see is that the case of just one argument
now works the opposite of what it used to, which I think was probably
not intentional, and should be changed. In other words, if there is only
one arg, it is interpreted as an absolute desk number rather than a
relative one.

	So, it looks like we need one documentation update and one small
code change - if I'm right about the intent of the change.

	I don't know who did the rewrite of changeDesks, but I'd rather
give the original author of the changes first shot at it - if he has
the time to fix it. Otherwise, I'll do something with it in the next
couple of days.

Problem solved. Button 3 didn't work properly not only with
negative desk numbers but in general when the first desk
number was != 0 (the fix didn't make it into 2.1.4 however).

Your syntax is wrong. If arg1 is non-zero, arg2 must be omitted.
The 1 and 0 are taken as min and max in your example. The correct
lines are:

  Key Page_Up     A       M       Desk -1 0 3
  Key Page_Down   A       M       Desk 1 0 3

(Compare with manpage)

'twas me. First of all, I didn't change the behaviour with only one
argument (well I'm 90% sure) and second I think the 'old' behaviour
you mention was a bug (probably atoi called with NULL or an empty
string for the second parameter). I'd still appreciate if you make
these changes as you think fit. I don't know what it should be like.
I wrote some parsing function for desk numbers, so a change will
effect all commands referring to desks at once.

The Shadow/Hilight logic was redone in 2.1.4.   This was partly due to
my  feeling that the calculations  weren't any good for certain colors
and partly in response  to a patch just like  yours.  I reasoned  that
the patch  was submitted  because the  submittor felt that  the colors
calculated weren't very good.

Would you please share  with us why  you  think fvwm needs  logic that
allows  the user  to pick the  shadow  and hilite colors,  rather than
using a calculation.

Even  if you convince one of  us that this patch   is a good idea, its
good form for a patch to include man page updates.  I am also a little
concerned that there are shadows calculated in a number of the modules
that this patch doesn't address.

Before extending your patch, please share with us what your patch does
for you that the built in code doesn't.

It was me. I was attempting to get the windowlist to behave logically and
usefully and inadvertently broke the Focus command slightly.  I've committed
the fix today so could you try it and see if mouse focus on start-up is fixed.

There used to be a command for installing fvwm2 as fvwm. (without 
the version identifier being required for the .fvmwrc file).

With the move to autoconfig, this seems to have disappeared.  Is it 
gone permanently or is there a magic configuration item that needs 
to be set?  If it is gone forever, then we should probably update the 
FAQ (#28) and reflect that.

Also, fvwm.tmpl seems to have disappeared, and I believe there are 
still a number of documentation references to it in the FAQ.

Well, it has a tmpfs.

I'm just spoofin' you, though, that wasn't a serious suggestion.  I'm
sure you have better things to do that mess with that; I know it's not
nearly as stable and robust as Intel/Linux.

Heck, I run Solaris on my SPARC and have not even the slightest thoughts
of installing SPARC/Linux.

First I should say, that I didn't work on fvwm yet, so excuse me, if
I'm not allowed to write here...

I don't think that fvwm needs such a logic, but I think, that the new
Shadow/Hilight isn't optimal. Maybe that depends on me using fvwm for
a long time now and the look simply changed, which confused me...

I configured very thin borders (only 5 points), which are reduced to
show only Shadow and Hilight, but not the original color. No problem
before, but the new code uses the factors 0.5 (darkness) and 1.4
(brightness), which leads to very light borders (light gray with only
a little bit color).

Maybe it would be a good idea to make these factors configurable?

Another problem: I use "Color black/#60c0a0" a light green for all
sticky windows. With this color the borders have a tinge of yellow.
Don't ask me whether this is correct, but it looks wrong for me...

Tschoeeee

        Roland

I was going to tell people that they can use Jitterbug to report bugs,
instead of/in addition to email, but

 1) I just wanted to clarify that we do indeed want the general public
    to report bugs via jitterbug: IMHO that's one of the goals of a
    public bug tracking system, but maybe you guys have different
    thoughts and only mean for the public to view bugs, but not add
    them?

    I think since we have the ability to trash bugs, etc. we should go
    ahead and let people report them to Jitterbug.  With the data fields
    provided we'll probably get more informative reports, plus it's one
    less step for us (entering them).

 2) I think we should subscribe fvwm-workers to the Notify field of the
    Jitterbug incoming queue, so that we all see all new bugs sent to
    "incoming".  Good idea?

I agree, that reduces traffic on the workers list too.

Um, I'd rather have a fvwm-bugs (read-only) list for this. Since you
can't reply to those automatic mails anyway I think it is better to
have them in a place separate from the development discussion.
Thoughts? Jason, is a new list possible?

Dan, does this have sth. to do with the reloading icons you
noticed a while ago?

I don't think so. But, I haven't looked into the Pixmap cache yet.

I have a  few programs that  have live icons.  I  think its normal for
fvwm2 to destroy the old icon window and create a new one when an icon
changes.   I don't see  any  annoying flash,  and  don't see why there
should be a  flash when a  new icon is  displayed.  I have seen  icons
rise to  the top when they change.   Since the icon is  usually active
for a reason,  I  wouldn't consider the icon  rising  to the top  as a
problem.

If there is a more efficient way to update an icon image when its size
is unchanged, I would think using it would be OK.

Are problems like this getting feed back to the list or are the RedHat and
Debian teams going to continue to blakchole their changes?

I hope that with the current changes to the fvwm support structure, that
these other folk will start providing feedback directly back to the
fvwm-workers list.

Thanks to Greg Herlein's quick feedback and bug report, I've fixed and
uploaded new fvwm2-2.1.4 rpms.  The new version of FvwmM4 no longer
defines FVWMDIR, which is required by AnotherLevel.  Rather than patch
AnotherLevel at this time, I patched FvwmM4 so it defines FVWMDIR.

    * Mon Dec 07 1998 Aron Griffis <agriffis@css.tayloru.edu> [2.1.4-2]

    - Added patch for FVWMDIR for AnotherLevel

The rpms available are

In no particular order,

1. Mwm "compatibility": mwm allows you to explicity set top and bottom
shadow colors with *topShadowColor and *bottomShadowColor

2. Existing shadow/hilight logic was bad; given my background colors,
shadow color was too dark, highlight color too bright, creating distracting
visual noise

3. Specialized top and bottom shadow colors can create some neat-looking
windows (random ex: dark gray background, dark red top shadow, dark
gray-blue bottom shadow looks cool if you pick the right colors)

The code in libs/Colors.c has hardcoded constants for shadow and highlight
calculation. Number 2 could be addressed by making those constants
user-configurable. (They should probably be user-configurable anyway;
you're never going to pick constants that everyone likes.) The other two,
however, need individually settable colors.

I'd love to extend the patch to manpage updates and modules if asked.

I do wish there were more consistency in color specifications -- there are
so many ways of saying "foreground and background". (Space-separated?
slash-separated? two options?) maybe options could sometimes take take
semicolon-separated colors instead of slash. (Unlike the slash in the
Style:Color option, the semicolon is not part of any valid X11 color.) Is
this interesting?

love,
ed

I take exception to that comment.  As the Debian maintainer for fvwm2,
I have consistently attempted to push Debian's patches back to this
list.  I have also posted about bugs found by Debian users once I was
able to verify them and give a good "how to reproduce this bug"
recipe.

That fact that (until recently) no-one was listening is not my fault.

Well, now that someone is listening, it would be a big help
if you could single out the bug reports you still have (and
that are not related to packaging) and hack them into Jitterbug.
This way they will no longer be easily forgotten.

I've found a way to consequently toggle between extra-size and not...

The amount of extra-size follows the snap-grid of the last resize!

ie:
When I resize an xterm, it snaps to every 13 pixels, and if xv launches
a new window, it gets 5x12 pixels too large.
If I resize my FvwmButtons, snap-size 207 pixels, xv gets 1x206
pixels too high!
If I resize a "snap-less" window (ie: can take every pixel-size), xv
windows gets 0x0 pixels too large.

Now... where could one find the cause??

Yes you are most correct. Until recently no-one was listening to many
peoples comments and many things were ignored, dropped, lost, misplaced, and
what have you. Well actually is seems like pieces of many patches, requests,
and ideas were kept in individual fvwm-workers mail archives. This was of
course most fortunate, as much was able to have been pieced together. The
Debian, and RedHat patches inclusive.

I apologize heavily for making the comment sound rude to you.

My comment came, obviously, from the Redhat posting, and knowing that a
large volumn of people will use these packages, I wanted to incourage a
change from the status quo. I included "Debian" in my comment from the stand
point of "another important packaged release". My intent was the opposite of
how it read. You of course have been monitoring this list much of recent.

I will try to be less terse, or more concise next time.


The point is for anyone out there adding their own fixes/ changes/ patches/;

We know there has been a long quite time on the fvwm-workers list, but it
would be much appreciated if all changes could be quickly sent back to the
list for possible inclusion into the upcomming release.

A couple of things,

 1. In the man pages for FvwmWinlist it states the following,

     *FvwmWinListLeftJustify
          By default, FvwmWinList will center the  icon  text  in
          the  icon.  This option causes it to be justified flush
          with the left edge of the icon.

    Note the "default" behavior.  Well, you've guessed it, that's not
    happening under 2.1.4 (actually I think it broke due to the mini-icon
    patches that were introduced in 2.0.46 -- that's one of the reasons I
    kept using 2.0.45).  To recap, the text is left justified by default and
    there was no way (that I could tell) of modifying it to be center'ed (I
    looked in the code hoping for a patch, but whoa ?)

    NOTE: the main reason I don't use FvwmIconMan is simply due to the fact
          that IconMan does NOT center justify (I've suggested that to Brady
          awhile back); yah I know that's rather shallow :-)

    BTW:  I've mentioned this problem before during 2.0.46 and I believe 
          Grant McDorman (grant@isgtec.com) posted some patches, I had
          problems applying them, so could somebody kind enough look into
          this.

 2. REQUEST (*please*, *please*)
    For some reason, unlike 2.0.45, the focused window also forces the WinList
    button to be pressed.  Could we have the ability to turn that option
    on/off (depending on what is deemed default).  Something like

    *FvwmWinListFocusPressed	/* for a pressed look - default --> OFF */

Here are the pertinent parts of my .fvwm2rc file
#
# FvwmWinList
#
#*FvwmWinListFocusPressed
*FvwmWinListBack Gray59
*FvwmWinListFore Yellow
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise, Focus, WarpToWindow 50 50
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, move
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0
*FvwmWinListFocusFore Aquamarine


Keep up the GREAT work guys...

I've thought again about forwarding incoming bugs to the fvwm-workers
list. I take my suggestion of a fvwm-bugs list back and agree with
Paul and Dan. With a special list most folks would not get a chance
to reply to a bug report.

I wouldn't like that too. You usually know where you have to look for
something so there it no need to close every open panel (I won't be
using panels much anyway since the menu geometry patch allows some
kind of panels too).

Key Return      A       CS      Exec exec xterm &

The C-S-Return thing works everywhere. The one with delete isn't catched
(and used) if above a window, only at the root-window... Instead, the
delete is sent like some weirdo-delete to the app... (the input-window in
motif totally freaks out)... Sorry, don't have xev near to try.. I'll go

Whatever happens, do people not think that "topShadowColor" and

may want a "leftShadowColor" and rightShadowColor" sometime...

I used to define ctrl(left,right,up,down) to move the destop between 
different panes in my virtual desktop.  It seems to have been 
broken in the latest release of 2.1.4 (from 2.048).

Now I must have the focus in the root window (not an xterm or 
netscape, or any other application).  Is this really the behavior that 
we want, or is this a side affect of something else?   IT seems that 
the key event is being passed to the application rather then being 
picked up by the window manager.

It is certainly of terrific importance that the version that what is in the
real FVWM tarball is the same as what gets into the various distributions.

While we're at it, it would be nice to get the RPM and Debian packaging
files into the distribution.  I can't think of a reason to keep them
separate, and it makes it possible for us to provide binaries should we
decide to do so.

It runs smoothly but slow for me. With the old server I got the
complete tree in 128 seconds while with the new server I had to
wait about 225 seconds.

Sorry, forget it, my checkout from the old server went astray
(i.e. to a local disk instead of the remote disk I used for the
new server). I'll try again.

So, here are the correct numbers for a complete checkout:

old server: 135 seconds
new server: 191 seconds

Ahem, could we have these notifications for incoming bugs only?
We'll generate a lot of traffic this way (and may insult people
seeing their bugs reports into the trash ;-) (it was really no
bug but a typo on the web page)).

Both bindings work for me with 2.1.4 on Sun Solaris  2.6 with a type 4
keyboard.

I think you  want to look at  this with xev.   Its  possible that your
Delete key with the  control-shift modifier generates something  other
than "Delete".

Note that "Exec exec" is overkill, and the trailing ampersand is
unnecessary.

Funny.  I haven't tried it since my previous message about the bad
commit, but when I did the new one was a bit faster; as I recall:

  old:  49 seconds
  new:  37 seconds

Here are the stacktrace and the last line of fvwm2's debug info. I'm not
sure what you're intending with "full core files", though. I also
discarded to load any modules at startup.

Feel free to ask more if you need it.

Notifications appear to be sent whenever a bug in the
queue-to-be-notified-on changes.  That includes moving it to another
queue.  Obviously we won't get notified on bugs that are moved from
"confirmed" to "fixed" or something, just bugs moved into or out of
"incoming".

There's no way you can change that, that I'm aware of, without hacking
Jitterbug.

I found point 2  convincing until I read  point 3.  Ie. you  found the
calculated colors not-pleasing, but then you create a dark gray window
and attempt to give it a 3D effect  with dark red  and dark grey blue?

On your side, you are not  the first person  to submit a patch of this
type.

I guess I might give in, this looks like unnecessary  bloat to me, but
I don't  like being an obstacle  to  other peoples  desires.  Lets see
what some other people on the workers list think.

I don't recommend this patch for the upcoming release, it seems to me
like a post 2.2 enhancement.

Eddie, I  don't recommend that you extend  this patch to FvwmForm, its
in the process of being re-written.  I also recommend waiting for some
of the other people on fvwm-workers to check in on this subject before
you put any more work into this.   Are you on the  workers list so you
will see any reaction?

Anything    that  is consistent   with    and  doesn't  break  current
configuration files  is good.  Slashes  aren't good, "Color fore/back"
is  already broken, since "rgb:FF/00/FF"   is a valid  color.  I don't
think we currently use semi-colons for lists of things.

topShadowColor and bottomShadowColor  are appealing since they've been
used in mwm.

Dominik,
I noticed that with my setup 2 desks, 0 and 1.  If I use mouse 3 on the
second desk all my geometries get hosssed on the first desk.  Not that I
care much, since I never tried mouse 3 untiul this thread about the
negatived desks started.

  de> Note that "Exec exec" is overkill, and the trailing ampersand is

Actually, while the trailing ampersand seems to be unnecessary, you need
the "Exec exec".

This changed back and forth a couple of times in the 2.0.41 era, but
ultimately it's back where it started: Exec runs a shell, so if you
don't want the shell hanging around, too, you need to use "exec".  There
was talk of creating a new option like "RExec" or something that
didn't require the initial exec, but nothing ever cam of that that I
know of.

Try it out; if you use:

  + "Test1" Exec xterm

you'll see this:

     UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY      TIME CMD
  psmith   364   362  0   Dec 03 console  0:19 fvwm2
  psmith 28217   364  0 14:51:26 console  0:00 /bin/sh -c xterm
    root 28218 28217  0 14:51:26 console  0:00 xterm

But if you use:

  + "Test2" Exec exec xterm

You'll see this:

     UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY      TIME CMD
  psmith   364   362  0   Dec 03 console  0:19 fvwm2
    root 28184   364  0 14:50:03 console  0:00 xterm

Also, all the examples in the manual use both execs _and_ the ampersand;
is the latter necessary for some reason?  I don't use it and don't miss
it... but am I missing something?  If not the man page should be updated.

OK, I just tried it and if you have the ampersand, regardless of whether
you use the exec or not, the xterm is reparented to init (because it's
put into the background, then its parent dies or is exec'd out) instead
of fvwm... which is probably not what you want but I don't know.  Also,
this is what happens with my shell (bash); it's possible other shells
don't behave well when trying to exit with background processes running
(csh in particular--does anyone set ExecUseSHELL to csh?).  All in all,
I think the ampersand should go.  Other thoughts?

Also, the "Exec" section of the man page doesn't explain this very well;
that should be changed, too.

I think we are going to need to see your rc file could you send it as an
attachment to preserve white space?

This is question and answer #12:

12) I really like the horizontal bars that appear on the title bars of
    sticky windows.  Can I get those on other windows as well?

A: Yes. Put the line "GlobalOpts StipledTitles" in your .fvwm2rc.


I don't see anything like this in the man page...

However, I did find it in the source.  The new content will be:

12) I really like the horizontal bars that appear on the title bars of
    sticky windows.  Can I get those on other windows as well?

A: Yes. Put the line "GlobalOpts StipledTitles" in your .fvwm2rc.
   Note that this is a purposely undocumented feature since it
   will eventually be made a Style option.  If you use this,
   it is guaranteed to stop working some day.

And it's not likely to be found by accident, since the proper spelling
would be "StippledTitles" :)

Full_Name: Phil Hollenback
Version: 2.1.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: SCO OpenServer 5.0.4c
X_Server: SCO Xserver
Submission from: (NULL) (132.147.178.182)


Just compiled FVWM 2.1.4, and it starts up fine.  However, it crashes as
follows:

1. A minimal .fvwm2rc (just one line):

Exec xclock

2. start fvwm in my .startxrc as follows:

/usr/local/bin/fvwm2 2>.fvwm2.errs

3. Open the default FVWM menu with the left mouse button, and close it by
clicking
off the menu.  Open it again and again close the menu the same way.  FVWM
crashes.

This happens with a full FVWM too.  It seems that the menu closing event
causes FVWM
to die.  I should note that FVWM 2.0.46 runs very well on the same system.

Same test with FVWM configured for debugging and called with the -debug
flag gives 
an error log that doesn't say what happened.  Here is the end of the debug
messages:

[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][HandleButtonPress]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][do_menu]: <<DEBUG>> called
[FVWM][FPopupMenu]: <<DEBUG>> called
[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][HandleExpose]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Leaving Routine

If I capture my X startup to a file, I see this message:

/home/philiph/.startxrc: 8848 Alarm call

(gdb) print keysym
$1 = 65364

I remember this problem from before. The fix was to protect the
isgraph() with an isascii():
    if (isascii(keysym) && isgraph(keysym))
(on lines 493 and 525).

Cant recall where i remember this from, possibly the scwm mailing list.

Here are the stacktrace and the last line of fvwm2's debug info. I'm not
sure what you're intending with "full core files", though. I also
discarded to load any modules at startup.

Feel free to ask more if you need it.

Hi all,

with the hint from Tomas (thanks Tomas!!) I was able to
track down and eliminate the bug that has given us so much
trouble. The stroy went like this:

In resize.c there were static variables constrainx and
constrainy that were used to give some obscure parameter
to the function ConstrainSize. I guess ConstrainSize was
static too once ago, but since it has been used from
various files (event.c, builtins.c and add_window.c).

So when you resize e.g. FvwmButtons, constrainx/y are
set to the appropriate windows. Now you add a window
and ConstrainSize is called from somewhere in add_window.c.
Now it uses the old values from FvwmButtons... boom.

constrainx/y come directly from the windows's size hints,
but in one situation both are set to zero. I introduced
a new parameter to ConstrainSize to handle this case that
occurs only once. I don't like this patch very much, since
it is a bit dirty and may lead to problems in the future,
but the matter seems to be too complicated to fix now.

In events.c I finally found the reason for all this
commotion (HandlePropertyNotify(), lines 563-571):

      /*
      ** ckh - not sure why this next stuff was here, but fvwm 1.xx
      ** didn't do this, and it seems to cause a bug when changing
      ** fonts in XTerm
      */
  #if 0
      new_width = Tmp_win->frame_width;
      new_height = Tmp_win->frame_height;
      ConstrainSize(Tmp_win, &new_width, &new_height, False);
      if((new_width != Tmp_win->frame_width)||
          (new_height != Tmp_win->frame_height))
          SetupFrame(Tmp_win,Tmp_win->frame_x, Tmp_win->frame_y,
                     new_width,new_height,False);
  #endif /* 0 */

So it seems Chuck has removed old code that fixed the
problem but created another bug with xterm :(

Anyway, although I believe the problem is fixed, please
keep your eyes open. There might be another problem that
still remains.

Bye

Dominik

Hello Dominik,

I get the crash with any .fvwm2rc.  Specifically, a .fvwm2rc with just
the line

Exec xclock

produces the crash.

I've compiled and run 2.1.4 on both Linux 2.1.122 and SCO OpenServer
5.0.4c.  The crash only occurs on OpenServer.  I believe that this
configuration may be exposing a bug in the new menu handling code.

Enabling debugging doesn't produce much better info - I included the
tail of my debug log in the problem report.

I have attached the full debug info to this mail.

Any hints on how to better isolate this would be very appreciated.

Later,
Phil.

	Whew! I finally figured out what was going on. Thanks to the
old parsing logic, etc., there was an inconsistency between the Desk
and WindowsDesk commands (changeDesk and changeWindowsDesk). Desk
took a single argument to be relative, and WindowsDesk took a single
argument to be absolute (probably because it originally took only one
argument in Version 1).

	This means we're going to break one or the other of these
commands (I don't see messing up the nice consistency of the new
parsing logic trying to preserve both, we just need to document the
change).

	I think that Desk is probably used much more often in people's
.fvwm2rc's than WindowsDesk, so I propose changing the single arg
behavior and the two spots in the Pager where the WindowsDesk command
is used (the function isn't invoked anywhere else in FVWM code).

	Does anyone on the list use the WindowsDesk command, or have
any strong feelings on the matter? If I don't hear any objections,
I'll make the change tomorrow evening. In the meantime, I'll see if
I can make the description in the man page a little less open to
misinterpretation.

  c> fixed memory leak in SetEnv

You need to undo this change.  You cannot free that memory that you pass
to putenv().  putenv() takes that memory and installs it _directly_ into
the environment, it doesn't make a copy.  See the man page:

     putenv() makes the value of the environment  variable  name  equal to
     value  by  altering  an  existing  variable or creating a new one. In
     either case, the string pointed to  by  string  becomes  part  of the
     environment,  so  altering  the  string  will  change the environment.

That's why I said in my original message that fixing this leak was hard
and, ultimately, will almost certainly cost more memory in code than the
typical user will waste using SetEnv.  The only way I can think of to do
it would be to store a list of pointers to previously putenv()'d things,
so you can free them later.  Some people try to play games with the
return value from getenv(), but I don't trust it myself.

When using the mouse button 2 to perform a resize during the initial
interactive
placement of a window, as long as the button is held down, the pointer
becomes the
northwest corner pointer, the rubberband disappears, and there's no visible
effect
(or even invisible, as far as I can tell).  Release the mouse button, and
the
pointer returns to the center of the default rubberband and everything
acts
normally.

The behavior in 2.0.46 (albeit with a small timing bug) was to keep the
button held
down as you performed the resize.

The new behavior is unexpected and ugly, although the functionality is
still
available.

If I initiate a window move with the mouse by clicking on the titlebar,
then trying
to cancel the move by hitting Escape does not result in the window
immediately
popping back into place.  Instead, the window remains frozen in place as
the mouse
pointer freely moves around.  When the mouse button is released, the window
pops
back to its original position as expected.

This does not happen on a keyboard initiated move.

The relevant (I think) portions of my .fvwmrc are

Mouse 1         TI      A       Move-or-Raise

If I initiate a resize with a keystroke, then when I cancel the resize, the
pointer
is moved back to where it was when the resize was started, rather than
leaving it
at the point of cancellation.

The relevant line from my .fvwmrc:

Key F8          A       N       Resize

... for the duplicate report (Netscape reposted the form when I hit Back)
and for the awful line wrapping.  The box on the web page is wider than 70
characters in the font I use, and I just haven't figured out where to press
return yet.  :)

I hope these little, presumably trivial, bug reports aren't simply an
annoyance.  I hate picking nits like this without patches to back myself
up, but I think there many better qualified than I to make the fixes.

Thanks,
Danek

This is the second or third time I've seen exact duplicates of the same
bug (with sequential bug numbers) appear in the incoming queue.

Do we have a bug in Jitterbug causing this, or are people hitting the
"submit" button twice, or something?  Danek?

If the latter, we need to add some text to the page so people know not
to do that anymore.

I hit netscape's back button at some point, taking me to a page which had
held the content of a POST-created page.  The page data was missing, so
netscape offered to recreate it by resubmitting the POST.  Not thinking
that it was going to resubmit the bug report, I just hit ok, as I usually
do.

Guess it doesn't pay not to think.  (And what a pity; I was so enjoying not
having to think ... <sigh>)  I'll be more careful in the future.

On the other hand, Jitterbug ought to have some logic to filter this stuff
out, especially if it happens so easily and frequently.

What is happening here is that I have ExecUseShell set and use bash. bash is a bit
more intelligent than /bin/sh when it gets invoked with -c args.  If the "-c
command" is a simple command bash just execs it, if there are ;|& type chars it
works like sh.

The extra shell process is not really Fvwm's problem. If it bugs you enough use a
better shell.  I agree that the documentation should be cleaned up.

Cheers,
Tim.

Looks like bloat to me too.  As a post 2.2 project I'd like to think about having
fvwm hand over window decoration to a module with a fall back to a single, very
simple style if the decoration module isn't used.  There is a huge amount of code
for all the different styles. All fvwm would need to provide would be the
WindowId's of the frame, the module could send back the sizes of the edges and
would create the buttons, handles and title bar. One day maybe.

Cheers,
Tim.

Me too as I said before. We can't possibly make each and every
colour configurable by the user. If we'd finally have a module
for the window decorations so what, but I do not see this
in the main executable.

Well, just put it in the 'doc bug' directory in Jitterbug ;-)

You mean it just uses the whole assignment string 'foo=bar'?
Perhaps I shouldn't 'fix' leaks after 2 AM ;-) Hmm, I didn't
find it in the manpage or else I wouldn't have done it.

BTW, did you have a chance to look at that menus.c memory
leak problem? I'm really stumped on this. I scanned the code
up and down and the only conclusion I came to is that some
menu item seems to be overwritten or isn't deleted when the
menu is killed. I can't find a place in the code that might
cause this.

Also I'm subscribed to the fvwm-workers list I am not a very active
maintainer (to say the least).  I am just a very satisfied user and
beta tester.  But since fvwm2 simply works well for me I keep my
mouth shut on the list most of the time.  May be someone else on 
the list could answer Mattias question?

Yes that's right. This was to prevent total mouse button
confusion. If someone has a better idea what to do that
to use WaitForButtonsUp handle this, feel free to change
that.

I have been using formail (part of the procmail package) to insert a
Reply-To header but I've had to turn this off because it splits up bug
reports.  Would it be possible to get Majordomo to insert this header?

Cheers,
Tim.

This bug is my fault. Hope I didn't make your head hurt too much Dominik.

I was trying to stop focus changing after a resize.  What used to happen
was that in an interactive resize of an xterm the pointer was always
outside the rubberband because ConstrainSize always made the width =
(width / increment) * increment. i.e. rounded down to the nearest resize
increment. When you finished the resize the pointer would be outside the
window and if there was a PointerFocus window below it the focus would
change.
This drove me nuts so I changed the interactive case to ((width + inc -
1)/inc) * inc.  I don't know why I used statics (just being a Wally
probably), your patch is the right way.

My intention was that constrainx/y should always be zero except for
interactive resizes.  I had a look at your patch and I think you have it
backwards but I don't think it will matter as programs shouldn't ask for a
size that isn't a multiple of the increment.
If they do their size will be rounded up.  If you want I can change it to
the old style (rounded down) but I don't think it matters.  It may be a
problem if fvwm ever tried to limit the size of windows in which case you
would want rounding down.

I don't think this is the reason for all this.  I don't know what this bit
of code is intended for but maybe xterm is asking for the wrong size or
it's not changing the size at the same time as changing the resize
increment.  The ICCCM says that apps shouldn't change their wmhints when
mapped so xterm should really do an unmap, change font, map sequence.  It
would look awful and would probably cause it to pop to the top so it's
best left.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS anyone would think that I'm getting paid by a certain software company
to discredit the open source movement.  It's not true, it's just a natural
talent I have ;-)

Hmm, a while ago I created an 'alias' to WindowsDesk called
'MoveToDesk' (like 'MoveToPage') to have consistent naming.
This might be the right time to remove WindowsDesk completely?
Or perhaps mark it as obsolete?

Okay this is getting silly I think we need to choose between
tar
gtar 
gnutar
then edit line 36 of our automake files, because I don't no if you guys
have a better way but I keep getting bad seperator errors when I make
because the merge fails.

Here it is. It is split up into different files, but I think it quite
readeable. Except for files in the styles dir. If you want it I can
always try to clear it up and test again.

If I initiate a window move with the mouse by clicking on the titlebar,
then trying
to cancel the move by hitting Escape does not result in the window
immediately
popping back into place.  Instead, the window remains frozen in place as
the mouse
pointer freely moves around.  When the mouse button is released, the window
pops
back to its original position as expected.

This does not happen on a keyboard initiated move.

The relevant (I think) portions of my .fvwmrc are

Mouse 1         TI      A       Move-or-Raise

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "C" Raise

If I initiate a resize with a keystroke, then when I cancel the resize, the
pointer
is moved back to where it was when the resize was started, rather than
leaving it
at the point of cancellation.

The relevant line from my .fvwmrc:

Key F8          A       N       Resize

If I initiate a resize with a keystroke, then when I cancel the resize, the
pointer
is moved back to where it was when the resize was started, rather than
leaving it
at the point of cancellation.

The relevant line from my .fvwmrc:

Key F8          A       N       Resize

If I initiate a window move with the mouse by clicking on the titlebar,
then trying
to cancel the move by hitting Escape does not result in the window
immediately
popping back into place.  Instead, the window remains frozen in place as
the mouse
pointer freely moves around.  When the mouse button is released, the window
pops
back to its original position as expected.

This does not happen on a keyboard initiated move.

The relevant (I think) portions of my .fvwmrc are

Mouse 1         TI      A       Move-or-Raise

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "C" Raise

Yes that's right. This was to prevent total mouse button
confusion. If someone has a better idea what to do that
to use WaitForButtonsUp handle this, feel free to change
that.

is better than the old.
I agree that it is unexpected, but I don't see why it's ugly.
You don't have to hold the button pressed while resizing which
is quite a relief for people suffering from tendovaginitis
(Wow, what a word. Do all diseases have names like this in English?)

	I like this idea. Pending any other suggestions, this
evening I'll change Pager to use MoveToDesk instead. 

	Any votes on whether we should drop WindowsDesk now,
or document that it is obsolete and will be removed in the
next production release?

Of course almost as soon as I wrote this I remembered that fvwm does limit
sizes when maximizing.  Version 1.9 of resize.c will make maximized xterms
larger than the screen size.  I'll fix this now.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS what's the difference between FALSE and False, TRUE and True? Which is
best?

False and True are defined by X for variables of type Bool.
In the end I don't think it matters, but I'd prefer using
False/True always (although I don't do it myself).

It is possible.  I don't intend to do it.  See
http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html.

Majordomo2 lets each user choose to get a Reply-To: if they want it.  I
suppose I would move this list to Majordomo2, but there's the issue of
stability.

Step by step I'm getting the impression that those
automatic mails from Jitterbug aren't so hot an idea.
Each time when I add a note or move a bug from incoming
the entire message history seems to be reposted. I
wonder if we can do something about that. Perhaps we
must not comments in the 'incoming' box?

I recompiled the fvwm2 binary (named it fvwm2.debug for convenience)
with debug messages on. Give you the new stacktrace and the full debug
output. And I also have cut down the rc file enormously.

How I produce the fault: I wait till fvwm2 has started up. Press
<Ctrl>+<Alt>+w to pop up the Window_Ops menu. Press cursor up and watch
the fvwm2 and the xserver die.

Three small remarks I want to make, but I don't know if they are
important.

1 - I start fvwm with "exec fvwm2" in my .xinitrc and not "fvwm &"
2 - Dunno what system libs fvwm2 uses, but I do know that
communicator(4.5, 4.06, 4.5b, 4.5) often crashes on my system and I find
that very strange. On the other hand, all other apps I run don't have
that striking amount of crashes.
3 - On my system, gcc is just a link to the egcs. Might this fool the
configure script? I haven't touched g++.

Wing Tung

Now there's a person that doesn't beat around the bush.  It's a shame that
Netscape puts the author in the TO: and the worker list in the Cc:. I could
really use a third type of reply: reply only to recipients.

Cheers,

The CVS tree is read-only to the general public; anyone (with a CVS
client) can download the latest version as of that second.

However, write access is not general: typically what happens is you
start inundating the list with lots of good patches and the people with
write access get tired and give you write permissions to save themselves
work :).

So, the short answer is you should do exactly what you did: send patches
to the fvwm-workers list.  Discussion will probably follow for any new
feature.

Alternatively, you can submit a bug to the Jitterbug database with your
patch included, and someone will move it to the enhancements queue.
Remember that fvwm-workers gets a notification of all bugs submitted, so
you don't need to do both.

I didn't really see that problem; odd.

Anyway, I changed my automake to use just "tar" and submitted a new
batch of Makefile.in's just after the 2.1.4 release... Oops, a quick
grep shows I missed one, the root Makefile.in.

Anyway, I think we should all standardize on "tar".  That's the most
portable, too.  Who's using gnutar?

(Hope this one isn't intended ;-)

When I invoke an application from a menu and get prompted to place it,
I'm unable to use the keyboard to place it.  The arrow keys (modified or
unmodified) don't work, nor do hjkl, nor does Enter (to place it).

It doesn't matter whether the menu is displayed as a result of a mouse
action or a keyboard action.  Both fail in the same way.

Strangely enough, if I invoke the application from the commandline, all of
this works just fine.

What do you mean?  If you mean it takes a single email message
containing a bug report and splits it up into multiple messages, then
formail is broken.  Are you using the latest version?  Maybe there's
some kind of flag you can give it?

Those messages are valid single email messages (note the second "From "
is escaped with a ">").

  tp> Would it be possible to get Majordomo to insert this header?

If I understand what you're saying, I'm against it.  Every mailing list
I join that does this, I lobby hard to have it changed.

PS. Of course, majordomo _can_ do it :)

Can someone outline how BugZilla handles this kind of thing?  Jitterbug is
convenient, but I'm getting more and more tired of it's lack of basic
functionality as time goes by.

Not yet.  I'm going to take a look through the Purify manual and see if
I can find some flags to give more info.

For example, for a while back when I worked on DG/UX I used Conor
Cahill's dbmalloc library, and that would print things like the number
of calls to malloc before the one that leaked, etc. so you could use
intelligent conditional breakpoints and see what was going on.

Maybe Purify has some way of getting more info, even if it makes the app
run dog-slow.

It seems like there must be a free of menus that's being done outside of
the DestroyMenu() or whatever function, and isn't cleaning up.  We need
to see if we can find that call.

It doesn't bug me at all, because I don't see the problem, because I use
"exec".  Note that "exec" will work with bash, too.

And in fact, I _DO_ use bash as my user shell.  But I use /bin/sh to
spawn fvwm (and other) scripts because bash is too big and slow for such
a simple task.

My only points are that (a) we shouldn't tell people to not use exec,
because they _should_ use exec--if they're clueful enough to know they
don't strictly need exec due to their shell, then they wouldn't be
asking us anyway, and (b) it _IS_ fvwm's problem insofar as the
documentation provides numerous examples of this, and it behooves us to
make sure it's correct (remove the ampersand) and at least give a nod to
it under the Exec section.

I'll take a stab at fixing the man page.

Full_Name: Nadim Saeed
Version: 2.1.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_105428-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (206.71.186.98)


A couple of things,
 
 1. In the man pages for FvwmWinlist it states the following,
 
     *FvwmWinListLeftJustify
          By default, FvwmWinList will center the  icon  text  in
          the  icon.  This option causes it to be justified flush
          with the left edge of the icon.
 
    Note the "default" behavior.  Well, you've guessed it, that's not
    happening under 2.1.4 (actually I think it broke due to the mini-icon
    patches that were introduced in 2.0.46 -- that's one of the reasons I
    kept using 2.0.45).  To recap, the text is left justified by default
and
    there was no way (that I could tell) of modifying it to be center'ed
(I
    looked in the code hoping for a patch, but whoa ?)
 
    NOTE: the main reason I don't use FvwmIconMan is simply due to the
fact
          that IconMan does NOT center justify (I've suggested that to
Brady
          awhile back); yah I know that's rather shallow :-)  The only
reason
          I bring it up is to maybe reduce the number of modules that have
          similar functionalities.
 
    BTW:  I've mentioned this problem during 2.0.46 and I believe
          Grant McDorman (grant@isgtec.com) posted some patches, I had
          problems applying them, so could somebody kind enough look into
          this.
 
 2. REQUEST (*please*, *please*)
    For some reason, unlike 2.0.45, the focused window also forces the
WinList
    button to be pressed.  Could we have the ability to turn that option
    on/off (depending on what is deemed default).  Something like

    *FvwmWinListFocusPressed    /* for a pressed look - default --> OFF */


Here are the pertinent parts of my .fvwm2rc file
#
# FvwmWinList
#
#*FvwmWinListFocusPressed
*FvwmWinListBack Gray59
*FvwmWinListFore Yellow
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise, Focus, WarpToWindow 50 50
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, move
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0
*FvwmWinListFocusFore Aquamarine

I just entered the bug I mailed out yesterday into JitterBug, so MANY
apologies about the extra traffic.

On a related topic, someone should update the FAQ and/or BUGS indicating
exactly what the list-maintainers want to see when it comes to reporting
bugs (ie. "enter 'em into Bug tracking tool on the web-site" or something
to that affect)

Currently the BUGS file states,

	"Herein lies the (partial?) list of Known Bugs.  Further bug reports
	 (or even better, solutions) can be sent to the FVWM mailing list (see
	 the FAQ for address and how to PROPERLY report bugs)."

BTW: it would be wise to break point #7 in the FAQ into 2 separate points.
Maybe
	7.1) How do I report bugs ?
 	A  : First, check your rc file and your .Xdefaults to make ....

	7.2) I have a window that is behaving unexpectedly under FVWM, but
             just fine under (whatever other window manager).  What do I do ?
	A  : do blah, blah and follow point #7.1 above

It was just a bit convoluted to find out what needs to be done.

Hi All,
    something changed between 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 that stopped my decors
working. I have the following bit in my fvwm2rc

AddToDecor my_decor WindowFont BOLD_MEDIUM

DestroyFunc decor_fvwm
AddToFunc decor_fvwm "I" Echo decor_fvwm
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor HilightColor FG BG
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor BorderStyle Simple -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 16
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle -- Flat
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle ActiveDown -- Raised
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle Inactive Solid HL -- Flat
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor ButtonStyle 1 /*MiniIcon*/ -- UseBorderStyle
Flat
+   "I" UpdateDecor

DestroyFunc decor_pixmap
AddToFunc decor_pixmap "I" Echo decor_pixmap
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor HilightColor Black HL
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap PT_004.xpm
-- HiddenHandles NoInset
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap PT_003.xpm --
HiddenHandles NoInset
+   "I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle Inactive TiledPixmap PT_004.xpm
-- Flat
+   "I" UpdateDecor

I can switch between plain and pixmap frames without a recapture by
using the two functions.  Since 2.1.4 if I don't have the MiniIcon bit
commented out I get a coredump.  Funny thing is that typing that line
into FvwmConsole followed by a UpdateDecor works.

Any ideas?
Tim.

Any change you make to a bug while in the queue will be sent to the
notification addresses.

It's up to you; if you don't want the comments sent to the list, add
them after you move the message.  If you want them sent to the list, add
them before you move the message.

I agree it would be nice if the mail, esp. the "moving to another
folder" mail, were more succinct.

I've set up the workers list to be handled by Emacs Gnus, so it looks
like a newsgroup to me and I don't really mind the traffic at all...
except for those of us who use mailers which don't transfer the
References: header on replies... and you know who you are! :) ;)

YMMV obviously.

"*FvwmPagerBalloons Icon" does not seem to work unless the Pager was
iconified
at least once.  According to the manpages,
 
     *FvwmPagerBalloons [type]
          [snip                                 snip]; if type is
          Icon balloons are just shown for an iconified pager. If
          type  is  anything  else  (or null) balloons are always
          shown.
 
To reproduce, insert "*FvwmPagerBalloons Icon" in your .fvwm2rc file, start
a
non-iconified pager and restart.  You'll see that the Balloons will
continue
to show-up until you iconify and then de-iconify the pager at which point
they
start behaving correctly.

I switched to fvwm 2.1.4 and found that edge scrolling only works when
moving the
cursor over the left or upper screen border, but when moving over the lower
or 
right border.  

I had not changed any .fvwmrc parameters that affect desktop scrolling as
far as I 
know.  I am using:  "EdgeScroll 100 100", "EdgeResistance 500 20" and 
"DeskTopSize 3 2".  If I have time, I'll try the OS/2 version of 2.1.4 to
see if 
it has the same problem.

Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I used to be on
the
mailing lists, but I am not any more, so contact me directly, but feel free
to
Cc: the mailing list if you want.

While I've got your attention... 2.1.4 seems to send excessive output to
console.
Is there a way to turn this off?

No, there's no such call. I've checked it again and again and
all the the places where menus are created have a valid counterpart
that takes care of deleting the menu. I see no possibility how
DestroyMenu could miss a particular menu item while deleting an no
other code deletes anything from a menu. One idea might be that this
has something to do with popping up menus before MakeMenus is called?
That's the case in the script. I think it might help if I could at least
see the data in the leaked memory. Can that be done?

Well, if you'd know the code you would not wonder about
anything :( It has so many side effects that you can't
touch any statement without breaking something somewhere
else. I'll take a look at this.

Yes. That sounds like a parsing problem and I bet it has
something to do with mine or Paul's memory leak fixes.
You might want to check the changes from 1st to 5th of
December.

Subject: EdgeScroll fails going right or down only

Full_Name: Mark Crocker
Version: 2.1.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: SUN4.1.3_UI
X_Server: xnews buld@build30 on Mar 14 1996
Submission from: (NULL) (204.134.212.40)


I switched to fvwm 2.1.4 and found that edge scrolling only works when
moving the
cursor over the left or upper screen border, but when moving over the lower
or 
right border.  

I had not changed any .fvwmrc parameters that affect desktop scrolling as
far as I 
know.  I am using:  "EdgeScroll 100 100", "EdgeResistance 500 20" and 
"DeskTopSize 3 2".  If I have time, I'll try the OS/2 version of 2.1.4 to
see if 
it has the same problem.

Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I used to be on
the
mailing lists, but I am not any more, so contact me directly, but feel free
to
Cc: the mailing list if you want.

While I've got your attention... 2.1.4 seems to send excessive output to
console.
Is there a way to turn this off?

				Thanks;

After following all these duplicate mails for quite a while
(and producing a good chunk of them myself) I've come to an
conclusion how to avoid this:

  *Never* hit the 'Back' button while in Jitterbug. This
  is the thing that leads to all the duplicate mails.

Argh.

This duplicate bug thing _HAS_ to be fixed.

Is there some html way to resolve it?  I'm no cgi/web guru, for sure.

If not, or in the meantime, we should put a big notice at the top of the
page you get to after you submit the bug, saying "Don't use ``Back'' here!"
Make it bold, red, font=+7, and use the horrid <blink> tag! :)

I'm solving it at the list level.  From now on, all initial notifications
should require my approval (unless I screwed up).  Replies will go through
fine.

Agreed.

Also, some hints for entering bugs would be good: the already-noted "no
need to send bugs to fvwm-workers if you add them to Jitterbug".
Another one is "please only put one bug in a bug report; if you have
multiple bugs, open multiple reports".

We have plenty of bug numbers left, and it's much simpler to track and
fix these things if they're separate reports.  My $0.02.

Comments on this new description of Exec?

  .IP "Exec \fIcommand\fP"
  Executes \fIcommand\fP.  You should not use an ampersand ``&'' at the
  end of the command.  You probably want to use an additional ``exec'' at
  the beginning of \fIcommand\fP.  Without that, the shell that fvwm
  invokes to run your command will stay until the command exits.  In
  effect, you'll have twice as many processes running as you need.
  Note that some shells are smart enough to avoid this, but it never hurts
  to include the ``exec'' anyway.

  The following example binds function key F1 in the root window, with
  no modifiers, to the exec function.  The program rxvt will be started
  with an assortment of options.
  .EX
  Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue \\
    -e /bin/tcsh
  .EE

I also modified all examples of "Exec foo ..." in the man page to "Exec
exec foo ...".

This makes bells go off in my head, I have had long standing problems with
Motif distributions and X11 distributions that contain duplicate but
incompatiible libraries, you should want the X11 libraries to go first,
then Motif.  So if you could do 
ldd <path>/netscape
and
ldd <path>/fvwm2
and inspect the output if you have libraries that MWM in the path then
your load path is putting Motif ahead of X11. So switch it around.

Just a thought,
Brad

Perhaps thats too big a word, but I'd like to make the point that:

Exec exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"
Read /tmp/file

won't work reliably.

Thanks for this one.

To be a particularly ungrateful bastard, I'm going to complain about this
one.  I think I agree that the new behavior (old-new? new-old?) was better
-- easier on the wrist and all, as you pointed out.

The thing that struck me as wrong was the gratuitous and non backwards
compatible change in behavior.  If it's possible to do both, that would be
wonderful (say, the old way if you click and drag, the new way if you click
and release within ClickTime).

If both is impossible, then I think this `fix' should be reverted and
documented as `not a bug -- we're saving you from a debilitating disease'.
How many other WMs can advertise that?  :)

Then again, perhaps someone other than myself has an opinion on this?

Thanks,
Danek

Submission from: (NULL) (193.133.58.12)


Upon first running the new fvwm 2.1.4 beta, I was horrified to discover
that my
yellow menus had gained a horrible cyan highlight! Fortunately, the bug
can
be fixed with this simple patch to the file libs/ColorUtils.c (apologies if
this
patch is reversed, I don't make diffs very often):

*** ColorUtils.c~       Tue Nov 17 01:19:17 1998

        max = g;
        if (b < r) {
          min = b;
!         min_max_state = G_MAX_R_MIN;
          a = r - b;
        } else {
          min = r;
!         min_max_state = G_MAX_B_MIN;
          a = b - r; 
        }
        } else {
--- 124,134 ----
        max = g;
        if (b < r) {
          min = b;
!         min_max_state = G_MAX_B_MIN;
          a = r - b;
        } else {
          min = r;
!         min_max_state = G_MAX_R_MIN;
          a = b - r; 
        }
        } else {

I am very pleased with the result... the poor highlight picking code has
always
been an annoying niggle with fvwm. Now it looks much better. Thankyou.

Well, I was just going to ask what people think about that.
Although I changed that back for now I'm not sure what we should have
in the end. Personally I prefer not having to move the mouse with a
button pressed, but since I don't use ActivePlacement that doesn't
bother me here. I wanted to see how difficult the 'fix' would be
(it is only one line).

That will certainly be difficult. The button is pressed in a different
module than it is released. Well, the idea is nice and if it can be done
without some diry hack I shall do it. Would you hack that into Jitterbug?

Maybe with a compile time option to change some kinds of behaviour?
  'configure --enable-debilitating-disease-saving' ;-)
I'll investigate if such an option would make sense.

Well, if you want to make that point, don't hide it behind
'asynchronously'. I'd just write it into the manpage.

new stuff:
 - snap attraction patch update (pending)
 - finish first beta sweep (2.1.4) (50%)

fixes:
 - Fix the remaining memory leaks (80%)
 - most things that come up during the beta test (40%)

stuff done since last update:
 - growing windows bug 8-)

next release:
 - 2.1.5 scheduled for 14-Dec-1998 (monday)
 - 2.2: Still hope we make it before Christmas
 

The beta test is proceeding well (although we have more
findings than I hoped for). There is one coredump in the
menu code and various small problems left. Unfortunately
there are several that can't be reproduced at the moment.

I worked on this but are not sure if I fixed it. Can you verify
that? (I still don't really know what you mean).

I don't know much about libs for X11 and Motif so, I just hope you can
see it for me. I thought that Motif was something commercial and is no
longer available on RedHat 5.1 (my base system). Or does Netscape
installs Motif libs itselves?

Well, although my fix should repair this (I didn't try it,
please verify that it works), I am a bit concerned about
a comment in x_pager.c (lines 455-457):

    /* we don't allow yoffset of 0 because it allows direct transit
       from pager window to balloon window, setting up a
       LeaveNotify/EnterNotify event loop */

I think this might happen again if the pager is partially
off screen. Can someone who knows how X events work have
a look at this? It seems to be a workaround and I'd prefer
a clean solution without side effects.

Any ideas?

Bye

Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I have had a "problem" in that my fvwm2 configuration works a bit
differently between my home systems and my office systems.  The
"feedback" window that displays during an interactive move displays on
the top-left corner at work, and is centered at home.  I checked out
the fvwm2 man page, checking "Resize" and "Move" and doing searches
for "feedback" etc to no avail...  what caused this difference in
behavior????

Well, instead of asking a question on the list, I decided that I had
the sources in front of me, and I could track down how that little
window is created and found out, surprise!  It was a MENU STYLE
setting!

Since it is not intuitive that a menu style should affect something
that isn't really associated with menus, I decided to make a fix so
that the location of the feedback window can be specifically set by
the user.

The attached patch adds a new builtin function "FeedbackWindow" to
fvwm, which takes a single option:  "center" (locate the window in the
center of the screen), "topleft" (locate the window in the top left
corner of the screen), and "menu" (let the MenuStyle determine the
location).  The "menu" value is default (in the absense of the
function) so that the current behavior is maintained.

As a good fvwm-worker, I made changes to the sources as well as the
fvwm2 man page.  The feedback entry is excerpted below.

If this patch doesn't get into the official fvwm distribution, then at
least somebody should modify the man page for Move, Resize, and
MenuStyle indicating the current behavior and how it affects the
feedback window.

  FeedbackWindow location
       Specifies the location of the feedback window that fvwm2 displays dur-
       ing an interactive Resize or Move operation.  This window displays the
       current size during an interactive Resize operation, and the current
       location during an interactive Move opeartion.

       location may be "center" to have the feedback window appear at the
       center of the display, "topleft" to have the feedback window appear at
       the top left corner of the display, or "menu" to have the feedback
       window's location be determined by the current MenuStyle style parame-
       ter (centered for "mwm" style, otherwise topleft).  The location
       defaults to "menu" to provide compatibility with fvwm 2.0.x.

            FvwmWindow center
            FvwmWindow topleft
            FvwmWindow menu

I'm out of ideas on this bug. I ran fvwm2 with your config
file and do not have any problem. Please check the following
and tell me the results:

 - Verify that the bug still occurs with the current CVS
   source or 2.1.4 (and tell me which you tested)

 - Does the pager
    a) die with a coredump
    b) die silently without a coredump
    c) run and come up normally but refuses to be swallowed
    d) comes up at first but disappears without a trace

   If a, please fetch me a stack trace:
    # gdb FvwmPager core
    (gdb) where

   If d, verify if you can see it with ps.

 - Check if either FvwmButtons or FvwmPager generate any messages
   (and post them if they do).

 - ... ?

My, you've done quite a bit of work on that. It's so easy!
If you use fvwm menus you get it in the top left corner
and if you use mwm menus it's in the center of the screen.
This is a relict of the 'good old days' whene everything
was so uncomplicated ;-) The menu style is still used in
several non-menu-related parts of the code to determine
such behaviour.

We've had questions about this already (but asking how to
switch it off). Perhaps something should really be changed,
but probably not as a new command. I'd rather see this as
a global option (and call it 'MoveFeedback'). And it would
be definitely a good idea to have an option to switch it
off. Hold on for a moment, I think that should be discussed
on the list.

We've had discussions before about  how  broken the MenuStyle  command
is.  I've  never liked the type (fvwm/mwm/win)  implying a whole bunch
of behaviors.   The     fact  that it controls   'MoveFeedBack'    and
'ResizeFeedBack' is even worse.

So I don't have a problem with some of the  behaviors being broken out
into separate commands.

Lets also discuss where this  patch goes.  I  don't see it in 2.2, its
just not necessary for stability.  I guess at some time soon we should
designate the main branch  for  further development and start  putting
2.2 stuff on a side branch?

Yup.  And it is definitely non-intuitive as it stands now.  A casual
comparison of .fvwm2rc files didn't show why the two systems were
getting differing behavior.

You have a very good point.  Thinking about it, having it as its own
builtin function is a bit of overkill.

Obviously, my simple patch can be re-applied easily for GlobalOpts, so
we would use:

	GlobalOpts	FeedbackCenter/FeedbackTopLeft/FeedbackMenu

And while we are at it, it would also be simple to add:

	GlobalOpts	FeedbackOff

(for people that don't want the feedback window at all).  The "off"
value should just set Scr.SizeWindow = None.  I believe that the Move
and Resize code already don't use the window if it isn't set; if not,
it's another trivial fix.


Thinking about this a bit further, maybe GlobalOpts isn't really the
right place for this.

The Feedback window should really be described as part of fvwm2's
decors, and with it, we could/shout add the font, foreground and
background colors, etc.  This is a bit more coding (although it is
really straightforward, since it is obvious where these values are being
set in fvwm.c).

I don't know if we really want to add a new Decor parameter, and I
haven't really investigated this yet.  And, truthfully, I really
***HATE*** the current decor syntax... it's non-intuitive, misleading,
and baroque (to say the least... did I mention that I hate it???).

<SARCASM MODE=ON>
Until then, maybe it should be:

	DecorOpts	FeedbackPositionCenter...

And we can await the Great Decor Code Rewrite.
</SARCASM>

I look forward to hearing comments from others on the non-sarcastic
parts of this message on this list.

OK... break it into two pieces...

1.  Move the code that explicitly describes the feedback window into
    the next development branch (2.3?).

2.  Modify the 2.1 / 2.2 man page so that the MenuStyle affecting things
    like the feedback window is at least DOCUMENTED.

Am I the only one getting a core file out of the latest 2.1.5
CVS at line 188 in Picture.c?

It  seems to me  the problem is arising at  line 2602 where it assumes
the union bf->u.p  points at a pixmap it  can destroy.  It could first
check that   the old  buttonstyle   was pixmap,   but   the logic   in
FreeButtonFace looks better.

OK, I just looked at the ChangeLog:

1998-12-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (add_item_to_decor): a little clean up
	(SetBorderStyle): fix for MiniIcon coredump
	(SetBorderStyle): fix for MiniIcon coredump

I'm creating the core file by adding a ButtonStyle 3 miniicon
to 2 different decors.

Note that one of the first things on the plate for 2.3 is the GSFR.
That may allow us to break up _all_ the current menustyle stuff implied

"aliases" for turning on bunches of behavior.

Yep, I wrote that comment. I grabbed the current 2.1.5 and it does happen
now ... try it and you'll see what i mean. The balloon pops up underneath
the cursor, generating a LeaveNotify for the pager window. This unmaps
the balloon, leaving the cursor back over the pager window and generating
an EnterNotify, which maps the balloon again, and ... hey presto you're
in a loop and the balloon repeatedly flashes on and off.

I wanted to avoid dealing with this possibility so I wrote the code
for the balloon to never overlap the pager window. I think we have
three options:

1. VERY LAZY: Remove this patch. People with the pager at the bottom
of the screen can set the yoffset negative so the ballon appears above
the pager window.

2. A BIT LAZY: Replace this patch with one that causes balloons threatening
to go off the screen to flip the sign of their yoffset.

3. NOT LAZY: figure out how to avoid the LeaveNotify/EnterNotify event
loop, thus allowing us to have balloons that overlap pager windows.

I think that is the only option. Any ideas?

To reply to myself on this one :-) ...

I've been looking at the code a bit more, and the elegant solution
would produce some very inelegant code.

At the moment, the second the pager window gets a LeaveNotify the
balloon is unmapped. We never get to the EnterNotify for the balloon
window. Thus, any logic to deal with this would involve delaying the
unmap of the balloon, and waiting for the next EnterNotify, checking
its window ID against the balloon, then finally doing the unmap or
not, as required.

This would make some currently simple code much more complex, and
involve storing state information between events. I'm against it.

Furthermore, I don't know of any program under any OS where
balloons/tooltips/whatever are popped up *inside* the target
window/button/whatever.

Therefore I propose the A BIT LAZY solution #2 below. Any opinions
on this? (Or does any X event wiz have a clever solution I'm too
dumb to see?)

I definitely  agree  that we  can drop   this  for now.  I  don't  yet
understand the code, but it looks like  when the ButtonFont storage is
acquired, its not cleared. If so, that could lead to the fix trying to
free a non-existant pixmap.  But I think that  u.p being a union is an
issue also.

Well, after looking some more into this I decided that although
this is not perfect, it is a clean solution and the user should
expect anyway. The balloon window should never overlap it's
application window. I'll check it in soon.

Oops, a UNION? I never bothered to look at the structure.
That explains a lot. That is evil, evil, evil.

Hi Dominik,

Here is the patch to adjust the behavior of subpanels and correct their
pixmap background problem
in FvwmButtons. Could you take a look at it? If it's ok, please merge it
into the CVS tree (It's built
against the current CVS tree 2.1.5). Thank you very much. The subpanels
still have problems to
swallow application windows. I am working on this.

Regards

Hi Dominik,

Forget about my last patch. I got the 'swallow' work in subpanels. This new patch

also contains the last patch I just sent you (correcting the pixmap problem, etc.).

What's new in this patch compared with the last one is that I add some lines

in the function 'process_message(...)' in the file 'FvwmButtons.c'. Hope it can

merge into the CVS tree. Thank you.

I really haven't had time to look at this yet but could the problem be due
to the fix Dominik made to through away events created before fv fully
starts?  Just a thought.

If thats true we probably need to put the code that gives window focus,
in between these lines in fvwm.c
  fFvwmInStartup = False;
  DBUG("main","Entering HandleEvents loop...");
  HandleEvents();

Hello Dominik,

I believe the problem is with SIGALRM and possibly itimers?

Somehow fvwm2.1.4 is receiving SIGALRM and doesn't have a signal
handler for it.  Thus, fvwm exits and doesn't leave a core file
(default behavior on SIGALRM).  So, no stack trace.

I see that fvwm.c uses the signal() call to register signal handlers.
Isn't it better to use sigaction() to avoid the problems associated
with signal() (window for signals to not be handled).

I am going to try registering a signal handler for SIGALRM and see
what that does.  That's a hack, though - I really need to figure out
what is going on with signal handling.

Also, do you have any idea what changed from fvwm2.0.46 to fvwm2.1.4
in regards to signals and alarms?  Something must have.

I don't think so. I don't throw away events, just set the
ClickTime to a value < 0 to speed up starting. But fell free
to check that anyway, I'm never quite sure what the implications
of all my patches are (when the count reaches three digits you
might start to forget some things ;-) ).

Subject: hotkeys in menus

Full_Name: Michael Han
Version: 2.1.5
CVS_Date: 8AM GMT, 10 Dec
OS: Linux 2.0.34 + RedHat 4.1
X_Server: AcceleratedX 2.1
Submission from: (NULL) (206.86.216.254)


Hi, just did a CVS update and build. Running an Xnest on :1 and hotkeys in
menus appear to be a bit odd... I click on the root window to access my
basic menu. Then I hotkey to a submenu and attempt to hotkey an item in
the submenu. It appears that fvwm fails to update the menu context
because rather than attempting to select the appropriate item in the
submenu, it tries the hotkey in the root menu. If the hotkey does not
exist in the parent (or root? -- don't have multiple-nested menus so I
can't test the submenu of a submenu case) nothing happens. If the key
exists in the parent, it attempts to execute on the incorrectly matched
item in the parent menu. If it's an Exec-type menu item, it Exec's. But
if it's a hotkey into a different submenu, it quickly paints the submenu,
but then restores the submenu I'm currently in.

If I navigate to the submenu by the mouse and attempt to hotkey, it's the
same behavior, except that for a match on the parent submenu, it goes 
ahead and sends me to the wrong submenu.

In what I suspect is a related bug, if I navigate into a submenu, then key
left-cursor, rather than putting me back in the root menu, the menu is
unmapped. I guess PopUp menus aren't correctly becoming the context for
keyboard actions, and the context remains in the parent.

So my menu definitions are included here.

That awfully sounds as if you were using old code. Are you absolutely sure
the compile didn't go wrong? I've fixed the second once, but never saw the
first one. I need all commands related to menus (i.e. at the very least I
need you MenuStyle command line).

That awfully sounds as if you were using old code. Are you absolutely sure
the compile didn't go wrong? I've fixed the second once, but never saw the
first one. I need all commands related to menus (i.e. at the very least I
need you MenuStyle command line).

Cool, that works. But you left out the reciprocal case of negative yoffset
and pager at the top of the screen. Here's a patch to deal with that,
and also adding some more comments. Oh, I'll throw in one for the man
page, too, so that people know why their yoffset is suddenly flipping
sign.

I think the mini-icon addition broke quite a bit.  Does FvwmWinListFocusFore work
for you?
I'm not sure what you want here. Do you have mini-icons displayed?  I think
centring with mini-icons would be tough to do and I don't think it would look good
either.  I may be able to patch it so if compiled without mini-icons the centring
would be the default and LeftJustify would work. Let me know if this is what you
want.

This was easy, but I left the current behaviour as the default, use
*FvwmWinListDontDepressFocus to turn it off.

Cheers,
Tim.

I looked at jitterbug, and I'm not sure whether people think this is fixed
or not. But I am still having problems with tkbiff using the latest CVS.

Occasionally tkbiff will start growing widthwise pretty fast, and keep
going until it reaches just under the width of the *desktop* (all pages).

Seems to occur when the tkbiff window changes size. May also be related to
the window being partially obscured and then getting a refresh while
changing size. But I've not identified the exact circumstances yet.

I also have an occasional problem with FvwmIconMan wandering down and
to the right when new windows are added to the list.

Both tkbiff and FvwmIconMan have HandleWidth 0.

Just to put my two cents in, I'm finally seeing this (for the first time!)
with xv.  It's slowly shifting down and to the right from its upper left
hand corner position as I move from one picture to another.  Looks like
it's only one pixel at a time, though.

Another odd thing with regard to sizing ... I've managed to get xbuffy to
start up with the wrong size.  I don't give it a full geometry
specification, just the position.  But it would come out about 20 pixels
too tall.  I couldn't figure out what caused this, and it doesn't happen
all the time.  If I see it again, I'll try tracking it down.

Thanks,
Danek

	You're right. [sigh]  The simple change makes no difference.
I'll have to trace through what's happening during the Coerce call.

	Maybe we should....  ;-)

	What was happening was that when the "coerced" EnterNotify
was handled, an old LeaveNotify was found on the event queue, and
StashEventTime was called, presumably for the first time, and
stored this old value in lastTimestamp. When the XSetInputFocus
was issued, the timestamp insured that the focus would never take
effect. I changed HandleEnterNotify to bypass the stash if we
are in startup.

	So, Tim and Dominik appear blameless. What I don't understand
is what could have changed to cause this to start happening. But,
then, quite a lot has changed in the last few weeks!

	Do I recall a suggestion a while back that maybe we should
flush all pending events at startup?

I just committed a patch that fixes the justification problem. Text is centred by
default and *LeftJustify works.  Note that if you have a mini-icon defined for a
window then that will turn on LeftJustify. I fixed *FocusFore, *FocusBack too.

Cheers,

	Hello.
	Feel free to tell me if I'm not welcome here.
	I'm trying to have Fvwm working on OpenVms. 2 reasons : I like it, using 
it for 4 years on my personnal Linux box, and it's a good way to learn, I think.
	But, I'm not an X gourou. So is there someone to help me in day-to-day 
problem solving ? Is the community interested in that work ?
	I'm on this list so you can answer here.
	Fab.

Nope FvwnWinListFocusFore doesn't work either (it used to); unfortunately, the
mini-icon addition did in fact brake quite a bit of FvwmWinList functionality.
I don't have mini-icons displayed (nor do I really use them in WinList), but
I see what you are saying.  Could FvwmWinList figure out on the fly whether
mini-icons are used on not and default to

   a. if mini-icons are     used, left-justify
   b. if mini-icons are NOT used, center-justify as default and have the option
      of LeftJustify

As an alternative to have both work in a similar manner, one could make the
left-justified look be the default and give the option to center justify.

BTW: no mention of mini-icons in the man pages for FvwmWinList (how do you
     invoke 'em ?)

Thanks Tim for your response and let me know if I can help in any manner.

BTW: I'm not subscribed to the list, but I read the archives daily, so I'm a

Yes, I made the suggestion (I believe), but I think that isn't a good idea.
There will definitely be *some* events that are needed. But
perhaps we could weed out certain types of events?

No problem at all (although I do not run Xnest). I tried with various
menu styles and the hotkeys always worked well. You don't believe
it could be a problem of the X server? I've never tried Xnest. Any
hints how to get this running?

I'll fill the move/resize/event code with DBUG lines soon. I want
to see these bugs dead! Even if I have to put in three DBUG calls
in for every code line ;-|

Did you verify if this is fixed? I've applied the suggested
patch but since it didn't crash on my system I can't tell.

I don't think we should spend too much time worrying about fvwm working
in Xnest.  On the other hand, I think it unlikely that this is really an
Xnest-only problem.  I seem to have missed some of the messages here,
but the next step seems obvious: try reproducing the problem in a "real"
X server, not Xnest.  Does it happen there?  If so, we can remove this
as a variable.

If you don't have Xnest, and you're not using XFree86, then getting it
is hard.  It comes with the X distribution from The Open Group or
ftp.x.org, but you'll have to build the entire thing, basically, to get
Xnest.

If you are using XFree86, then just go to your friendly neighborhood FTP
site and grab it: it'll be a separate file with the rest of the X server
files.

Sounds like work ;-)

Could you enlighten me what kind of OS this OpenVms is?
Sounds vaguely familiar, but I really don't know what it is
(some kind of UNIX?).

In general I think porting fvwm to another system is a good
idea. And I wouldn't mind if you ask your questions on this
list (well, if it's 50 mails a day I might reconsider ;-) ).

What do the other maintainers think?

We'll have to see. I will install Xnest at home and see if I have
the problem there.

Ah, I think that's a bit too complicated for me. I'll install
it from CD ;-)

Hmm.  Wait.  I see FvwmTaskBar uses it; are you running that in your
setup?  Not sure exactly why fvwm2 would see the signal, but I haven't
investigated that code yet.

  dv> I see that fvwm.c uses the signal() call to register signal

  dv> Isn't it better to use sigaction() to avoid the problems associated

The problem, obviously, is that sigaction() isn't ubiquitous.  However,
I can look into porting some signal handling code from, say, GNU make
into fvwm which will allow it to use better signal handling functions
if they're available.

Hi Jason,

would it be possible to have a list of maintainers (i.e. people
with CVS write access) somewhere? Sometimes I don't want to
mail to the entire list but don't know whom I should put on my
distribution list.

Bye

Dominik

That's what I'd planned. And I felt more or less the same about Xnest,
so I chatted w/ Dominik privately to try to get a sense of how to
proceed. So tonight I may have non-functional menus... boohoo. If it
turns out to be some bizarre Xnest-related thing, I'll penitently
inform the list.

I only forwarded this mail.

I don't really know what I am talking about, but the only line in
the .fvwm2rc was 'xclock', would it be possible that xlock sends the
SIGALRM? Perhaps the right thing to do is to disable this signal.

Hmm, the signal handling code needs definitely some work.
When should we do this, before or after 2.2? Or should we
branch now for the more disruptive kind of development?

All I have are the CVS usernames:

tibbs
bradym
dane
domivogt
steve
drbob
psmith
hippo

But those don't necessarily correspond to actual usernames.  Hippo is Tim
Phipps, BTW.  I don't have any kind of mapping to real addresses handy.

FYI, there are 109 members of fvwm-workers.

Like Dominik, I  have no real VMS exposure.   Since you are trying  to
use fvwm2, I assume it uses X?

You can ask all the questions you like, of course, answers might prove
to be another story.  I wouldn't mind being slightly enlightened about
VMS, so I think you should give it a try and see how far you can get.

I can't create this.  You should not expect to be able to edgesroll
outside your desktopsize.

Not unless you tell us what it is printing on the console.  Normal

Someone is pulling your leg.  We have "tendonitis" and "vaginitis".
Its hard to imagine a disease where the 2 diseases are related.

German is famous   for really long   words,  but the ones   I know are
combinations of simple  words.   We have  simple words  for all common
ailments, but the  "itis" words are there for  the doctors to use when
they present their huge bills.

I noticed some strange bahaviour with netscape (4.0.5):

If I click on a link within netscape (button 1), drag it across
the window and drop it, an animation sequence is displayed to
visualise the action. If I click a mouse button immediately -
before the animation is over - the mouse click is handled by
fvwm2 as if it happened in the root window (even if there is
another window beneath netscape).

I noticed that the mini-labels on the windows in FvwmPager
(or the balloons) always show the name of the window's
icon. This is not quite what you would expect if you have
an application that changes both icon and window names.

I have this scenario:

 - I've got an rxvt window (Title: "Darksun: ~", IconTitle:
   "rxvt", "rxvt" shown on the pager). I set the window
   title from my shell whenever I change directories.
 - Start midnight commander (Title, IconTitle and the label
   in the pager are "mc - Thank you for using GNU Midnight
   Commander").
 - Exit mc, (Title: "Darksun: ~", IconTitle: "mc - Thank
   you ...", pager Label: "mc - Thank you ..."

We can:

 1) Do nothing (not so hot).
 2) Always display the window title.
 3) Use icon title when iconified, window title when
    deiconified (the icon title will only be visible in
    balloons).
 4) Use the resource or class name (this will prevent
    mc from setting the title on the pager).
 5) ... any better idea? For me solution 1 works best,
    but if we can find something better...

At the very least this behaviour has to be documented.

Bye

Well, I thought as much (the part with the doctors). There is a commonly
known word for my desase in German ('Sehnenscheidenentzuendung' (well not
really ue but the umlaut)) but there seems to be none in English (I like
that in English, you often have such an elegant way to say things you're
likely to break your tongue in German). I consulted two dictionaries and
both say the right word is 'tendonvaginitis'. With my limited knowledge of
Latin I'd say that's exactly what it is called in German. Furthermore the
dictionary translates it as 'inflammation of a tendon and its sheath'.
BTW, 'sheat' and 'vagina' translate to the same word in German: 'Scheide'.
I think it was my fault that I wanted to translate 'Sehnenscheidenentzuendung'
at all sice ther is no such word in 'normal' English.

Oh am I embarrassed. Turns out this was an Xnest-only problem... I
haven't any idea why that should be the case, but it seems to be.
After restarting fvwm to run from the new binaries that were running
in the Xnest server,  I cannot reproduce the problem in my "real"
server... So I guess Xnest and fvwm2 don't play nicely together.

It seems perfectly reasonable to file my bug report under "Who cares?"

Just switch back if you still see the problem.  The modules, etc. are
installed in different places so all you need to do is make sure you
save a copy of the old fvwm2 executable.

We had a number of these complaints and I found out the reason
for this behaviour: When your application (like rxvt or xterm)
is in application keypad/cursor mode fvwm gets no key events
for certain keys and thus cannot process a key binding. This
happens when you start with a pressed num-lock. My naive
assumption (without any actual knowledge) would be that this is
absolutely correct. Isn't this what 'application cursor mode'
means?

The big question is: did this change between 2.0.46 and 2.1.5?
I can remember that I had this problem myself with rxvt (but not
xterm) and solved it by putting it out of app-mode by a control
sequence from the shell. I think this was some early 2.1.x or late
2.0.47x.

Apart from documenting this I wonder if we can do something about
that (apart from ignoring app-mode (if possible at all)). Could
we just disable application mode when fvwm starts up?

I think it's still a fvwm2 problem (that probably most other
wm's have too). Have a look what I wrote into the BUGS file.

I do.

I get this in all apps... Xterm, Eterm.. netscape.. gimp.. gtk-stuff..
everything.. I have ctrl-meta-del to popup an FvwmForm, but since
2.1.something the keypress is sent to the app instead of parsed by
fvwm....

> The big question is: did this change between 2.0.46 and 2.1.5?

"Everything" worked in 2.0.46, things stopped working when I jumped onto
the fvwm-cvs bandwagon...

I observed that every time I visited one of the following URL's my netscape

This problem doesn not occur with fvwm-2.0.46

I've hacked lots of debug stuff into various modules to
track the growing windows problem (there's even a new
module called fvwmdebug.c with functions to print
the contents of various parts of an FvwmWindow).

To activate it you must configure with --enable-debug-msgs
and then edit config.h and add the line

#define DEBUG

(or do it any other way you like). You should compile
only the main module with these settings.

You will get rather lengthy output. Before you start
reproducing the bug please run FvwmIdent on the window
you suspect to grow. Terminate the X server immediately
when the window has grown. Try to shorten the output as
much as possible before posting the (gzip'ed!) file.

Thanks

Dominik

One more thing: this happens only when the second click is
over the animation window. If I move the mouse somewhere else
in the netscape window, netscape gets the click.

Hi,
	I'm a regular user of fvwm2. Unfortunately, our sysadmin refuses to
install fvwm2 because its still "beta". Due to this reason, I have to update
and privately keep my own installed version of fvwm2. Would it be possible 
to remove the "beta" and start calling fvwm2 with the proper "fvwm" name.
I think fvwm2 has been around for about 3 years; so it no longer needs to be
called "beta". Having an "official" release of fvwm version 2 would convince my
sysadmin to install it for all people who want to use it. Thanks,



- Mohit

Looking at the code I'd guess you can get growing windows
this way (won't work with my last fixes installed):

 1)  Resize a window so that the upper left corner changes
     position (i.e. the window did actually move)

 2a) Create a window that has size hints for the aspect
     ratio (i.e. it has the PAspect hint). This window might
     get the wrong size.

 2b) If you can generate a ConfigureWindow event on a
     PAspect-window it may change size too (don't forget
     step one).

Bye

Dominik

I've found another possible reason why windows might
have been growing, again in resize.c (ConstarinSize):

There were static globals xmotion and ymotion used for
some internal calculation, but again these were not
set when ConstrainSize was called from outside resize.c.
I have removed all globals from the file to prvent these
side effects in the future, but I'm not sure if I did
the right thing with xmotion/ymotion: I made them
parameters to ConstrainSize and set them to zero in the
calls from other modules (add_window.c, events.c and
buitins.c).

Tim, since you seem to know what's going on in
ConstrainSize, could you please have a look at his
(everybody else is welcome too, of course)?

Bye

The answer is: yes. At this moment we are running a real beta test
and are very close to the first 'stable' release of fvwm2. It will
have the revision number 2.2. Provided that we do not run into very
difficult problems 2.2 will be available within a month or two.

I recently upgraded from 2.0.46, and noticed a couple of new problems:

  When using the Up/Down arrow keys to select an item in the Fvwm menus,
  the X server is immediately killed.  No error messages, just a clean
  kill.

  Color gradients in the Fvwm menus do not work.  The menus are just
  displayed in regular solid background color.  (Background pixmaps work
  fine though.)

  The background pixmap in the FvwmButtonbar isn't always displayed in
  buttons that contain swallowed applications.  (asclock and asmail in
  my case.)  However, if I issue a Refresh command after starting X/Fvwm,
  all the buttons are shown with the correct background pixmap.

These problems were encountered on a PC running Linux 2.1.130, glibc
2.0.7pre6 and XFree86 3.3.2.  (Haven't tried it on other systems yet.)

The last entry, regarding ICCCM? That seems separate from this
problem. I specifically setup my input events so that the two
instances of fvwm *wouldn't* compete for those events. I have
unmodified clicks on root open the main Programs menu, which, if
falling into the Xnest window, fvwm in the main, not-nested server
doesn't molest. But the nested fvwm catches those. Then I use menu
hotkeys to navigate my menu, which again the un-nested fvwm ignores.
But the nested fvwm has trouble figuring out the correct context for
those events in the menu (applies hotkeys to the parent/root menu,
rather than the current submenu). So this isn't that multiple
instances of identically-configured fvwm compete for keystrokes/mouse
events, but that fvwm in the Xnest server seems to handle menus
incorrectly... But that doesn't really bug me. I use Xnest to do
sanity checks on new fvwm builds, so it won't crap out my Xserver or
otherwise do bad things. I don't *expect* it to work on a day to day
basis, nor can I think of a reason to use Xnest that doesn't relate to
testing X software. I'll just make sure to try to reproduce bugs in an
un-nested X server before running off and whining at jitterbug...

Also, as for the ICCCM-thing, I kind of suspect that ICCCM (not that
I've read it) wasn't designed to take into account the Xnest case...
I'd say it's Xnest that's breaking ICCCM, not fvwm or mwm or what have
you. I mean, I can't really think of a way to "do the right thing"
given an Xnest case -- in fact, I'm having trouble thinking of what
"the right thing" would be with Xnest. What currently happens
(unnested wm eats the event before it passes into the nested X server)
seems reasonable. But then again, maybe I've come to expect strange
things ;)

How about something similar to the format in FvwmIconMan? So we
can say:

*FvwmPagerStringFormat formatstring

where formatstring is some printf-like string containing %i, %t, %c, %r, for
icon, title, class and resource. We could use this for both mini-labels
and balloons, or maybe also have:

*FvwmPagerBalloonStringFormat formatstring

and let people have different strings shown by each.

I have a button that does a recapture on my FvwmButtons
bar. When I click on this button twice, sometimes the
second click hits the root window below (at the moment
when FvwmButtons is unmapped) and a menu pops up.

I think the right thing to do would be to ignore all
keystrokes and mouse clicks during a recapture operation.
Any ideas how this can be done?

Please remember that 2.1.4 is a *beta* release. I know, that didn't

that will be followed by a stable release soon.

As I said before, they work for me. I'll commit the syntax change
(see previous posting) to the CVS tree today.

I can't verify this. How did you set your menu style? Not by any
chance like this:

  SetMenuStyle ... fvwm (menuface)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This does not work (see manpage). I understand that this is
rather unintuitive. I'll change that.

Do you mean the background pixmap of FvwmButtons or does
asclock have one of its own? Please post you FvwmButtons
config lines from .fvwm2rc.

Have you tried running Xnest with -sync and -full? When I did this
I had only the problem with multiple assigned hotkeys/mouse bindings.

The right thing would probably be that the wm limits itself to drawing
decorations around the windows.

If you ask me, these thing sound logical in ICCCM but effectively
prevent you from writing a user friendly window manager. Period.
Today I've read something in the X FAQ about ICCCM. Perhaps you
are aware of this 'Lenience' style thing that allows the wm to
give badly written clients the keyboard focus even if they don't
tell the wm that they want it (via keyboard input hint). This
seems to be an ICCCM rule. But the FAQ calls wm's that honour this
rule 'picky'. It seems that the people who have written this didn't
know what they want.

I'm not sure what of this is useful, but I've attached the output from the
debugging session.  The interesting window is the 600x201 one, which moves
from +0+0 (line 84) to +1+1 (line 471) to +2+2 (line 922).  The reason the
size changes is because a different image was loaded.  The first two images
are the same size.

I expected the Identify data to show up in the debug output, but here it
is, copied by hand (in a non-test fvwm):

Name:			xv 3.10a: misc/fb-021897.gf <unregistered>

Any of this useful?

Hey guys,

This is Cobalt over at fvwm.themes.org.  I don't know if I am sending
this to the correct place, but I have a question.  Is there going to be
a theme system in future versions of fvwm2?  The single file .fvwm2rc is
really bad as far config'ing is concerned.  I don't know what exactly to
suggest, maybe just dividing the .fvwm2rc into different peices for
different functions..  Maybe like WM does, with menus that
autogenerate.  I don't exactly know..

Please tell me what you think, and/or if you are doing this already, and
other information bout your plans.

Cobalt

I used

  SetMenuStyle ... next (menuface)

just as I was told to do in the manpage.

I mean the background pixmap of FvwmButtons.  Asclock/asmail have
transparent backgrounds.

The relevant config lines should be

  *FvwmButtonsPixmap <bg pixmap>
  *FvwmButtons(Swallow asclock 'Exec "asclock" asclock -24 -shape &')
  *FvwmButtons(Swallow asmail 'Exec "asmail" asmail &')

Lately, only the button containg asmail has had problems with displaying
the background pixmap.  Asmail also refuses to read it's rc-file
(~/.asmailrc) when started in the FvwmButtons and that could be a part
of the problem.  This is really strange, because it has no problems in
finding the rc-file when I execute asmail from an XTerm window.

Thanks. I don't know it it's useful, but we'll see. The Ident info
was just that I can find the relevant lines. I always had the
impression that this bug was a bit tricky to reproduce and in a
test session at home I got 3.5 MB debug output in 30 minutes.
I may have fixed this bug in the meantime (see some other posting).
Could you please try again with the current sources?

Bye

Dominik

Well, we're always hoping someone takes this work off our backs ;-)

Oh, but you *can* have multiple files. I have seen configs with a whole
tree of subconfiguration files. All you have to do is to use the
'Read' command (or 'FvwmCpp' or 'FvwmM4' if you want preprocessing.
This works like including files into .fvwm2rc. Or you can read in
shell command output with 'PipeRead'.

There was some dicussion about theme support in the last few weeks
(I think you triggered that last time). But I didn't follow that.
In general the outcome was that theme support is one of the
biggest open issues but since we are very busy with 2.2 there was
not much time to think about that. Others may have more information.

Hmm. What kind of gradients did you use? I tried the diagonal
gradient example from the manpage and it works. What is the
config line you use?

A while ago XFree86 changed the way num-lock was handled.  Previously,
num-lock was never shown to applications, and the Xserver looked after
doing the translation from numbers to cursor commands as appropriate.

Now, num-lock is just another modifier.  This means that if you say in
a config file:

Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 0

Then this only works when the control modifier only is set.  If you
have num-lock turned on, then both control and num-lock modifiers are
set and this binding is (correctly) ignored.

This is quite an old problem, however.  The change to the X server was
over a year ago now.

As Dominik points out, we are interested in themes.

On the other hand, we recently trimmed out a collection of pixmaps and
backgrounds from  the main  fvwm2  package.  We did this,  because  we
don't currently install  any of these things,  and we like fvwm2 to be
able to fit on a 1.4 meg diskette.

I think we  agree amongst ourselves that  themes are a separate entity
from fvwm2 itself.  We recently  updated the links  on our web page to
point to the  themes  pages  we are  aware  of.  If  you  can identify
changes needed to fvwm2   to more fully   support themes, we would  be
interested.

Well, I've had a look and now I'm horribly confused. I can get xv to
wander down and right if I have FvwmBorders on.  When xv changes picture a
configure request is received by Fvwm.  Fvwm looks at the xv request
co-ordinates and it's frame and thinks the window has moved.  You can fix
this by changing the #define BW 1 in fvwm.h to 0 but then FvwmBorder
windows look just like MWMBorder.  I've got completely confused by the way
the code treats win->frame_x.  I think I may have removed a win->bw from
some calculation in the past.

Sorry I can't come up with a fix, but I'm dazed and confused at the
moment.
Tim.

OK, I thought as much, but the problem is that I'm far less
of an X expert that you are. I tried to understand the logic
behind these commands and failed utterly. I really need some
Xlib documentation. More precisely my question should be:
What are the exact Xlib calls to do this (= I need either
someone who does this or someone capable to explain what
to do to a complete idiot ;-) )?

I think this is the key.  Most of us don't use themes, so we don't
really feel like we understand what issues there may or may not be with
supporting them.

What we'd really like is if you folks who are working with them
day-to-day can provide feedback about what makes that task especially
difficult in fvwm2 today and/or what you'd like to see done about it, we
can come up with some enhancements to ease the burden.

This would be post-2.2, of course :)

That's where I started from (simplifying & extending FvwmAudio & FvwmAuto,
FvwmAudio generalized into FvwmEvent in a simple manner.)
There were just some "don't make too big steps, right now that the
maintainer changed" comments, so that FvwmAudio was still included in
Brady's first release.

Don't know the state of the development tree, now.
I was just lurking until things had settled and there was a tested, easy to
adopt way to contribute.

hmm.

I thought of an internal table, which lists functions for each events.
These functions should be entered separately.
It's a royal PITA to have to fetch together all the funcctions to one
commandline.


I had in mind to keep the simple 
	FvwmEvent event function 
binding, where you could have several bindings for the same event, not
knowing of each other.

Each of these functions would be called separately, supplied with the
event-params. 

But then I thought: What if one function kills the window based on it's ID
and name "If Name='Error' destroy $1" while the the other is the simple
autoraise command: "raise $1"

So the second one would have to guard against non-existing windows:
"delay 300; next [windowId=$1] raise"

You see a delay function here, an "if" would be nice. ...
Here I took part in the language discussion, which hasn't led anywhere
AFAIK. :-)


I'd like to boil down FvwmEvent until it's just hooks (if you know elisp)
for functions.
This should be small enough to find it's way into fvwm core.

A general Event binding mechanism would surely help an event based
windowmanager :-)

Then, you can do anything you want with it.

FvwmAuto, FvwmAudio, ... many other things would be one-liners then,
as most emacs lisp hook-functions are.

But this requires the language issue to be finally decided.
If the current language is kept - i.e: we can't decide on any decent
existing language to use -, it's no use adding all that for's, while's
if's that we need.

FvwmEvent could still start an external language interpreter, but that's
pretty slow.

Anyway.

I'd say: let's first settle the language (hopefully multi threaded), 
then things like FvwmEvent come next, if, by then, it's still necessary to
extend it much more, though. 

 
> Are you already implementing these features?

nope.
No time right now.

I've some years of backlog in my life, right now. :-(

feel free to extend FvwmEvent.
A Parameter passing mechanism for each event would be nice, in any case.

For functions to do something with the parameters, I'd wait for the final
language, though.


My new FvwmAuto distribution would be sth like
	delay 300
	Next WindowID=$1 raise

bound to the focus-change event.
That's already (or was it almost ?) possible with FvwmEvent & the current
language.

But another function would be bound to the raise and focus-change event,
which should cancel all pending auto-raises.

But that's hard with the old language ;-). That's why FvwmAuto still is an
own process (with memory footprint ...) on my machine:

I really  like   the expression  "complete  idiot".    It sounds  like
something we should all try to attain, so here goes...

The XSync call at fvwm.c:643 with the last arg  set to 1 (True?) seems
like a good starting  point.   I have  absolutely no  experience  with
this, its a wild guess based on the man page.

I Think what we want to do is play around with the MyGrab/UngrabServer
calls in libs/Grab.c.  What happens is we grap the Xserver but that call
only queues events, until the ungrab.  But if we also call XGrabPointer
and XUnGrabPointer, we can through away all mouse events, and the buty of
it is on the UnGrab it creates leave and enter notify events. Which might
just solve out Focus on startup problem (so we can kill 2 stones with one
bird).  If anyone has Volume 1 of Xwindow you can take a look at Chapter
9.  Otherwise try a man on XGrabPointer.

Not sure if this is relevant here, but recall that recapture can cause
fvwm to dump core.

If we do an XGrab*() then die, won't we be locking the server?

Just a random thought...

Fortunettly Xlib isn't that stupid. It does the Grab based on requesting
Client, and each Client has a connection the server, if that connection
dies all grabs are then released.  However if you happen to be in a
debugger when it dies, good luck typing continue, so it can finish dieing.

Should we have a state saying that a bugfix has to be verified?
Seems to be useful if you fix something that you never could
reproduce yourself.

And I don't think that is the reason for the problem.
Fvwm does not even receive a key event and thus cannot
process a binding even if it wanted to. The input seems
to go directly to the application.

well.
config lines from fvwm via pipe always have the \n at the end.
Maybe FvwmTalk doesn't add these.

I, too don't like the idea of anyone making money with free donations.
be it via patents or licences or any other way.
There are FSF experts dealing with all those legal loopholes.

can we exclude Microsoft Corp. and its employees from the right to do
_anything_ with fvwm2 ? :-)

No, you were right.  This was fixed in 2.1.X:

You need something like this:

  if (buf[strlen(buf)-1] == '\n') {     /* if line ends with newline */
    buf[strlen(buf)-1] = '\0';	/* strip off \n */
  }

The old logic assumed it could always replace the last character.

Does this mean you've created a dist tarfile and put it on the incoming
ftp site and informed Jason about it?

Or that you need someone to do this?

Ulp!  What are all these Makefile.in's doing here... I have a bad

  <<cvs update ...>>

Yep!  The "TAR = gtar" problem is back again! :)

Dominik, you need to go edit your automake script and change the setting
of ``$TAR = "gtar";'' to be just ``$TAR = "tar";''.  We decided a few
weeks ago that the canonical value of this variable should be just
"tar".

If everyone has different values then we just keep checking in new
versions of these files over and over and over, simply switching this
silly value back and forth.  Tres annoying.

Thanks...

It was the same behaviour Tim noticed in some other posting.
I have fixed this one, but I am unsure if some other bug
now springs back into life.

Yup. That is exactly what happened. Between 2.0.46 and 2.1.x
some lines in events.c (HandleConfigureRequest) had been changed:

from

  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->bw;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->title_height - Tmp_win->bw;

to

  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x - Tmp_win->boundary_width;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->title_height;

I vaguely remember you noticed this before. Why was this changed?
Did it have something to do with the wandering winlist?

I backed that change out and xv does not wander anymore.

To be honest, I didn't read that discussion very carefully.
If we have something like this again we should not rely
on everybody reading those threads but write a new posting
with a short summary.

Subject: transients for ClickToFocus & StaysOnTop

Full_Name: Michael Han
Version: 2.1.5
CVS_Date: 1600 GMT 12/13/1998
OS: Linux 2.0.34 + RedHat 4.1
X_Server: AcceleratedX 2.1
Submission from: (NULL) (206.86.216.254)


This is an old bug that I remember from 2.0.4?. Transients for
StaysOnTop & ClickToFocus windows are obscured by their parents being
raised above them, if the event that maps the window is the first
event to map a window in the StaysOnTop window, which was entered
without focus.

That is, with ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick, a first click focusses the
StaysOnTop window. An event then maps a transient, which becomes
obscured by its parent. Subsequent transients correctly remain above
the parent until the focus exits the StaysOnTop window (or possibly
something else? RAISED flags get twiddled? stack order gets changed?).
And for ClickToFocusPassesClick, the first event in the window that
maps a transient will see the parent raised above its transient. Focus
need never pass to the StaysOnTop window, as in the case of a
StaysOnTop FvwmPager with Balloons.

This occurs irrespective of
ClickToFocusRaises/ClickToFocusDoesntRaise. It is not a problem with
other focus policies (MouseFocus, SloppyFocus). To reproduce this,
set:
GlobalOpts ClickToFocusPassesClick
Style "Foo" ClickToFocus, StaysOnTop

Then create some window with the title Foo, and that can create menus
or other transients with a single event, such as a click or an entry
into a child. Give focus to some other window. Then return to the
window and do something that maps a transient. The transient should
quickly map on top of the parent, and then have the parent raised
above it. Subsequent events mapping transients should do the right
thing. I'm fairly certain others confirmed this bug on other OSes and
installations when I first brought it up many moons ago.

MouseFocus and SloppyFocus apparently do something upon entry into a
window (aside from giving focus) that ClickToFocus entry doesn't do.
Or that's the way it looks to me, based on a limited understanding of
the code and of X. It's interesting the focus isn't really the
apparent cause (it works with FvwmPager Balloons, where you never have
to have a focus change to reproduce this behavior), though the
settings for focus policy control its presence.

I have a funny feeling that this happens because in ClickToFocus,
transients are given focus with a SetFocus(), when you have a
HandleMapNotify() and similar circumstances.

Under obscure circumstances FvwmButtons may die when
a swallowed application coredumps. I've seen this
with FvwmIconMan (before I fixed the coredump there).
I suspect the app. sends a signal to FvwmButtons that
isn't handled so FvwmButtons exits.

Could someone with better knowledge of signal handlers
take a look at this?

Running Rational Rose98 under Solaris 2.6 (and 2.5.1) the pulldown
function
Browes-Units results in a popup window. And this works under the CDE, olwm
and olvwm windows managers. But for fvwm 2.1.4 (and 2.0.46) there never
popup
a window. Instead rose "locks" for any input. But there are a lot of other
popup
windows that do works. Sorry for not being more precise.

The last paragraph in ANATOMY OF A WINDOW reads

       Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist.  Their use is  com-
       pletely  user  definable.  The default configuration has a
       title-bar button on each side of the title-bar.   The  one
       on  the left is used to bring up a list of window options,
       regardless of which mouse button is used.  The one on  the
       bound  to them.  See the section on the "Mouse" configura-
       tion parameter below.

The second last sentence reads "The one on the bound  to them."   Something
is missing.

I noticed that the mini-labels on the windows in FvwmPager
(or the balloons) always show the name of the window's   
icon. This is not quite what you would expect if you have
an application that changes both icon and window names.

I have this scenario:

 - I've got an rxvt window (Title: "Darksun: ~", IconTitle:
   "rxvt", "rxvt" shown on the pager). I set the window
   title from my shell whenever I change directories.
 - Start midnight commander (Title, IconTitle and the label
   in the pager are "mc - Thank you for using GNU Midnight
   Commander").
 - Exit mc, (Title: "Darksun: ~", IconTitle: "mc - Thank
   you ...", pager Label: "mc - Thank you ..."

We can:

 1) Do nothing (not so hot).
 2) Always display the window title.
 3) Use icon title when iconified, window title when
    deiconified (the icon title will only be visible in
    balloons).
 4) Use the resource or class name (this will prevent
    mc from setting the title on the pager).
 5) ... any better idea? For me solution 1 works best,
    but if we can find something better...

At the very least this behaviour has to be documented.

I noticed some strange bahaviour with netscape (4.0.5):

If I click on a link within netscape (button 1), drag it across
the window and drop it, an animation sequence is displayed to
visualise the action. If I click a mouse button immediately -
before the animation is over - the mouse click is handled by
fvwm2 as if it happened in the root window (even if there is
another window beneath netscape).

--

One more thing: this happens only when the second click is
over the animation window. If I move the mouse somewhere else
in the netscape window, netscape gets the click.

I have a button that does a recapture on my FvwmButtons
bar. When I click on this button twice, sometimes the
second click hits the root window below (at the moment
when FvwmButtons is unmapped) and a menu pops up.

I think the right thing to do would be to ignore all
keystrokes and mouse clicks during a recapture operation.

Subject: mouse click penetrates netscape 4.0.5

I noticed some strange bahaviour with netscape (4.0.5):

If I click on a link within netscape (button 1), drag it across
the window and drop it, an animation sequence is displayed to
visualise the action. If I click a mouse button immediately -
before the animation is over - the mouse click is handled by   
fvwm2 as if it happened in the root window (even if there is
another window beneath netscape).

This message is FYI only: patches have been submitted to Brady Montz

On my system I have FvwmButtons which has swallowed (amongst others)
FvwmIconMan and
xbiff. When I restarted fvwm2, FvwmIconMan wrote errors to the console log
and left
the xbiff process running.

This error came in 2 parts: firstly, the clean-up code had been commented
out of
FvwmButtons since it is indeed non-reentrant. This problem can be solved by
calling
sigsetjmp before calling the event-loop, putting siglongjmp in the signal
handler and
then performing clean-up once the event-loop "returns". The second part was
in
FvwmIconMan itself - it wasn't exiting when told to terminate and so caused
an X
error when FvwmButtons' clean-up code called XSync. This in turn made
FvwmButtons exit
before it could kill xbiff.

I put xbiff on my button-bar using Swallow(UseOld,Respawn,NoHints). Then I
killed
xbiff, which in turn killed FvwmButtons.

This was fixed by NOT calling the original XErrorHandler routine in
myErrorHandler,
and by just returning zero instead. It appears that the original handler's
default
behaviour is to kill the application. This is not what you want if you
intend to
respawn.

On a related note: the correct return-type for an XErrorHandler is "int",
not
"XErrorHandler". Doing this means you don't have to typecast myErrorHandler
when
you call XSetErrorHandler.

Submission from: (NULL) (130.102.176.3)


In libs/System.c:getostype(), the code calls uname() and then checks that
the
return value == 0.  It should instead check for >= 0, because uname() can 
legitimately return any nonnegative value for success, and on Solaris 2.6
it
really does return 1 rather than 0.

(I think the bug originally appeared in a patch to 2.0.46, and there the
effect
was more obvious:  the first part of the HOSTDISPLAY environment variable
ended
up containing random binary garbage).

I think this is the right thing to do.  I did the previous change to stop
FvwmWinList wandering.  I'll fix FvwmWinList properly this time.

Fvwm seems a bit schizo about its frame co-ordinates.  With FvwmBorders the
co-ordinates used in XLib calls are 1 greater than is drawn on the screen due to
the
frame window having a borderwidth of one.  Fvwm and FvwmWinList are not being
consistent when using the co-ordinates and frame width to calculate where to move
to when it grows.

Cheers,
Tim.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.202.174.20)
Submitted by: hippo


If I have a window with transients and I iconify it the window and its
transients shrink down into one icon.  If I do a "Next [Iconic] Focus"
the transients are included in the search.  It looks a bit odd if you
have three icons on the screen and it takes five "Next's" to go
around.   I think the Next/Prev command should skip an icon if it is
a transient of another iconified window.

A workaround is to use "Next [Iconic !Transient]" but that will
skip iconified transients of non-iconified windows which are shown
as separate icons.

I've changed FvwmWinList to grow properly.  It was using the module information
from fvwm to calculate it co-ordinates but the module information doesn't include
the borderwidth of the frame so it was wandering up and left by one when it had
an FvwmBorder style. It now queries the server to find its co-ordinates and does
it with an XGrab so it survives a recapture without wandering.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well, OK.  I'm not really clear on when a decision warrants a separate
posting or not, but seems like a good idea in general.

If you have CVS write access to check things into the tree, AND you've
installed automake so you can rebuild makefiles, PLEASE READ!

Please edit your automake script (it's in Perl) and check the line:

  $TAR = "tar";

If the variable $TAR is set to some other value, like "gtar" or
"gnutar", please modify the script to look like the above; just "tar".


Details:

It turns out that when you configure and install automake, it will stick
some values into the automake script which are then inserted verbatim
into all Makefile.in files automake generates.  Since we check in these
Makefile.in's, if people have different values then they'll rebuild the
Makefile.in files and "commit" will check them all in.  Then the next
person will come along, and "commit" a new set which changes the value
back.  Etc.

We want to all use the same value to avoid this flip-flopping.

Thanks!

Paul,

  I got the   message the first   time,  but it was a   little subtle.
Perhaps we want to store this away in the DEVELOPERS file?

With the latest changes to WinList, it no longer redraws after one creates or
deletes a window (to recreate: goto a clean page without any xterms, spawn a
new xterm and watch FvwmWinList - make sure NOT to enter the xterm (ie. don't
give it focus; I use autofocus) or easier yet, kill the window and watch
WinList).  The following patch fixes that bug.

BTW: Here are my relevant .fvwm2rc entries

	Hello.
	Excuse me for my silence, my provider got down for 4 days :-((((

>Sounds like work ;-)
	:-) Yes it does...

>Could you enlighten me what kind of OS this OpenVms is?
>Sounds vaguely familiar, but I really don't know what it is
>(some kind of UNIX?).
	No, definitely not :-) Open VMS is the other OS from Compaq-Digital 
(formely Digital Equipment Corporation). It's another family of OS where it 
stands alone :-) It was born with the PDP11 family of computers and since then 
is a fully multitasking, multiuser, now multithreading OS with a great (but old) 
cluster solution completely integrated in the kernel. Perhaps you will hear of 
it with the Galaxy technologie... It is a robust, reliable system dedicated now 
to 24/24-7/7 systems.

>Like Dominik, I  have no real VMS exposure.   Since you are trying  to
>use fvwm2, I assume it uses X?
	Yes and DecWindow under it wich is a Motif implementation. But it's kind 
of a black box, and because OpenVms is so different from Unix (file system, IPC, 
process scheduling, and so on...) it is not so easy :-)

>VMS, so I think you should give it a try and see how far you can get.
	For now, I have recompiled the code whithout modules (to start :-). No 
problems, except that I could'nt use the configure script. I hacked in the 
config.h wondering what I could answer to the "HAVE_something" questions. Now it 
goes.
	When I execute it, I have a probleme with the XConnectionNumber function 
returning a file descriptor (I think). What is it exactly ? In fact, I get a 
number, but when I feed the fcntl function with it, I get a "bad file number"... 
Can you explain what is under the two functions ? (fvwm.c)
	I bypassed the exit function to go ahead.
	NOw I'm just near the vision of fvwm under VMS, but I have to make a 
pause, 'cause I've crashed the X server many times, and the sysadmin here is a 
little bored of me :-))))))
	Fab.

Subject: fvwm2 man page doesn't give info on "feedback" window

Full_Name: Larry Gensch
Version: 2.1.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Digital Unix T5.0
X_Server: X11R6.3
Submission from: (NULL) (204.123.2.83)


The "feedback" window that appears during an interactive
Move or Resize operation may appear in one of two places:

* Top left hand corner of the screen
* Centered in the middle of the screen

The location of this window is specified, interestingly
enough, using the un-obvious "MenuStyle" command in the
.fvwm2rc file.

There is NO documentation describing this feature in any
of the MenuStyle, Move, or Resize entries in the man page.

I have submitted a set of patches to fvwm-2.1.4 to add a
"FeedbackWindow" keyword that takes "topleft," "center," or
"menu" as options to allow the user to specify the
desired location.  These patches were apparently rejected.

However, the current behavior still remains undocumented in
fvwm2's man page.  I'm submitting this bug report to request
that the current behavior at least be documented pending
some implementation of better handling of this in a future
(post 2.2) release of fvwm2.

With 2.1.5 the WinList buttons show their entries with 2 extra spaces that
weren't there in 2.0.45.  These 2 spaces were introduced, unnecessarily,
in
the MINI_ICON patch in 2.0.46
 
To clarify,
 
  was (2.0.45):         " TITLE "
  now (2.1.5) :         "  TITLE  "
 
It's taking up more room than is really necessary; a single space ought to
do.
 
NOTE: I do not use MINI_ICONS and so the titles are center-justified :-)

So, the wandering FvwmWinList/xv problem should be gone, but how
about xbuffy being too tall? Does it actually grow more than once?
And what about tkbiff growing rapidly. Could you both try to get
the debug output I prepared (you need to #define DEBUG in config.h
manually, configuring with --enable-debug-msgs is not enough).

Cough, did you ever look at the MatchesContitionMask 'function'?
Anyone brave enough to touch this?

Hmm, legitimated by what? My Linux manpage says that it returns 0
or -1, nothing else. Is this guaranteed to work with all systems?

It's nice that you provide patches, but you should definitely
send them to the list. Brady has quit the job as maintainer a
while ago and fvwm2 is now maintained by a few people on the
on the list (me being one of them). Most of the time I am the
one apllying patches. So please repost your patches to the list
so that I can incorporate them ti 2.1.6.

Great. We were living with these ugly workarounds for quite a while now.

Well, that's the extra space reserved for the mini icons ;-)
Take a look at line 700 in FvwmWinList.c:

	tw+=14; /* for title icon */ /* Magic Number ? */

I'll put this in '#ifdef MINI_ICONS/#endif' so you can at
least compile FvwmWinList without this extra space. I see
no easy way to avoid this. Mini icons might be added or
removed at any time, so even if you can find out if there
is no mini icon in use you might pop up one a second later
and then your WinList would have to resize.

According to POSIX 1003.1-1990, uname() returns 0 on success and -1 on
failure.  There is no other valid return code.

Unless there have been modifications in subsequent versions of the
standard, Solaris is non-conformant.

However, the Solaris (2.5.1, here) man page does document it differently
than POSIX:

  RETURN VALUES
       Upon successful completion, a non-negative value is returned.   Other-
       wise,  a  value  of  -1  is  returned and errno is set to indicate the
       error.

Although Solaris appears wrong here, the fix can't hurt anything on
conformant systems so you might as well make the change.  The error is
well-defined to be -1 everywhere, so using >=0 instead of ==0 won't be a
problem.

I don't think these patches were rejected, I agree completely that the
feedback window isn't a  menu, even if its  color is determined by the
default menu color.

I  simply feel that I would  rather get 2.2  out  rather than fix this
kind of thing.   I fully expect that  something will be done with  the
menu command syntax,  including  the feedback window  placement  after
2.2.

I meant to get to the documentation.  Thanks for the push.

Yep, thanks.

That's something that didn't happen too often.  I think it happened maybe
five times in the brief period where I was using one of the 2.1.5 versions
*and* happened to be restarting xbuffy a whole lot because I was mucking
around with FvwmButtons as well.

So it's something I would see very rarely, but I can spend some time this
evening throwing up xbuffies and seeing if I get this behavior any more.
I'll try it with one of the older versions as well.

> Does it actually grow more than once?

No, the only thing it did was to show up too large on its first mapping.
The odd thing was that I gave it a SouthEast geometry, but the *top* of the
window showed up where it was supposed to be, and the bottom extended below
where it was supposed to be.

Can that even *be* an fvwm problem?

In retrospect, there might have been an FvwmButtons floating around that I
hadn't killed, and the xbuffy got sucked in and forced to fit one of the
buttons.

Oops.  I saw the #define of DBUG and just read the E into that.  Sorry.  ;)

If I can reproduce the behavior again, I'll fire up the debug version.

Sun's not the only one, HPUX 11:

RETURN VALUE
      uname() and setuname() return the following values:

            n   Successful completion.  n is a nonnegative value.
           -1   Failure.  errno is set to indicate the error.

I don't  know much about it,  but managed to  find some info thru "man
XAddConnectionWatch".  It does appear to be a file descriptor.

You must be refering to this code:

  x_fd = XConnectionNumber(dpy);

  fd_width = GetFdWidth();
  if (fcntl(x_fd, F_SETFD, 1) == -1)
  {
    fvwm_msg(ERR,"main","close-on-exec failed");
    exit (1);
  }

I assume you saw the "bad file number" message when you added a perror
call?

Since the "1" would  make the file close  after an "exec", my guess is
that  this  will somehow  limit   the available  file descriptors  for
processes that fvwm starts.

Bypassing the exit sounds like a logical first step.

Thanks for the help, I could make that change and even learned quite
a bit 'bout X. And there's more good news: recapturing is now *much*
faster! I think this is finally the right solution to prevent the
superflous events during a recapture that were circumvented by this weird
'-blackout' option 8-) Is this theory correct? If it is I will update
the FAQ and mention that as of fvwm-2.1.6 using -blackout will be moot.

Yes, certainly. Some parts ignore gravity completely after the

        Yes. That's it.

        Ok, I  think I see it.  It becomes normal to not do that under
VMS where exec  (and  fork  and  all that kind of stuff) id not at all
implemented like in Unix.    With VMS, child processes can not inherit
the IO channels from their creator.  They have to reopen them in order
to mimic the father.
        Well, I'm not at the end.  For now the X server get crashed by
the fvwm process each time before drawing the first segment :-) I have
to analyze the  log  files  to guess (I'm not a privileged user on the
system :-( what happens.    I modified the fvwm_msg function in misc.c
to get a file in  addition  with  stderr  output.    But I think the X
server is to blame...
        Stay  tuned  and  thanks for the help, but again, feel free to
tell me if I bore you  all  with  this work.  I would be very proud to
achieve it but I'm not sure to  have  both  enough knowledges and good
conditions to get it.
        Fab.

Paul, I think you were involved with IconMan debug output.
How can it happen that this console stuff now goes to stdout?
Wasn't debug turned off by default?

Yup. The manpager example does not work if copied exavtly into
a file. You have to join the lines that are split with
backslashes (although I do not understand why). Depending
on the version you have you may have to add '(Up)' to the
*FvwmButtonsPanel lines

 *FvwmButtonsPanel foo -> *FvwmButtonsPanel(Up) foobar

This is a bug and should already be fixed. If you find
out that is your problem. Please post to the list.

BTW, the right place to mail such questions to is the
workers mailing list:

  fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

No, they were not. I think we had a general agreement that
we'd do it as a global option instead of a command on its
own and that an option to turn the feedback windows off
completely should be added. And, least but not least, I was
hoping you would write the update ;-) Unfortunately I'm much
to busy with the real bugs to write patches myself at the
moment :( Your help would be greatly welcome.

I'm running out of ideas. If you run 2.0.46 and start X, is the
num lock key on or off? What if you start 2.1.x? Is there a change?
I've done a thorough comparison of the changes between 2.0.46 and
2.1.5 and cannot find anything remotely related to keys (except
a patch by me in bindings.c, but I don't see a difference with or
without that). BTW, 2.1.5 and 2.0.46 behave the same for me.
Can you send me the output of 'xmodmap -pk' and 'xmodmap -pke'
from the buggy system? And could you please try to replace
bindings.c with the one from 2.0.46? You'll have to make a small
change: instead of including "../configure.h" in line one you have
to include "config.h".

Digital Unix 4.0 has the same wording as Solaris, though Digital's uname()
does appear to return 0.

More to the point, Unix 98 (or the Single Unix Specification, Version 2, 
or whatever) says

    RETURN VALUE

	Upon successful completion, a non-negative value is returned. 
	Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error. 

I don't understand why 0 wasn't enough, but it does look as though the
standard has changed and at least one platform uses the looser definition.

Agreed.

In fact, the other place that uname() is used in 2.1.14 is in gethostname(),
for platforms that don't have gethostname() themselves, and there the code
dodges the problem by checking for the error case (-1) and treating anything
else as success.

How to find:
1) Login on a slow machine (486/25 or equiv)
2) Fire up 2+ FvwmPagers
3) Fiddle with toolbars in gtk/gnome-programs (borderless windows that
"tries to follow the mouse"..)

Watch the lag (the window doesn't follow the mouse quite well).

4) Kill one pager

Watch lag become less

5) Kill the last pager

Watch lag go away totally


The display of the pagers lag when dragging stuff around... Is this a
problem with fvwm feeding data to the pager(s) over a pipe, and having a
hard time keeping up with user-feed at the same time...?

I have a small patch for IconMan that allows the IconMan next & prev
actions to wrap around the end of the windowlist... i.e., an IconMan
action for 'next' at the end of the list or 'prev' at the beginning of
the list won't just sit there, but will instead wrap around. It's a
really trivial patch. I can submit it to the list... I'd already
suggested it to Brady, since he's still IconMan's author, even if not
the fvwm maintainer. Thoughts?

I have examined the signal-handling code for fvwm and its modules
and it is horribly non-reentrant. Even the simplest signal-handlers
call exit() (exit() runs the chain of exit-procedures, which may in
turn execute non-reentrant functions. e.g. libc installs one which
calls fflush(stdout).) Only _exit() is reentrant, and ONLY because it
DOESN'T call the clean-up chain. And some handlers attempt to do a LOT
more than just exit anyway. Looks like some very nasty problems waiting
to happen.

Submission from: (NULL) (204.244.204.16)


Hi there.  I'm not quite sure where my problem lies, but what evidence i do
have points to FVWM.

I am trying to run a remote x session on my computer using XOnNet 6.0, an
MS windows X server emulator.  It connects to my computer via xdmcp, which
runs an xterm in the background and then execs fvwm2.  XOnNet is set up to
allow the remote window manager to manage any x programs.

This setup works perfectly when I'm running XOnNet from my second computer
at home, which is on a local network with the linux box.  It also seems to
work fine from a friend's computer, which is on the same (university
residence) network as my linux box.  However, when i try the same setup
from work, i experience problems.

First, the session takes an age to start.  Up to five minutes.  This is
presumably not due to a slow or bad connexion, as once the session is up
there's virtually no more lag than i experience at home, and no errors.

Second, the FvwmButtons module disappears after the session finally does
start.  I'm not sure how to define 'disappears' exactly; but XOnNet gives
all open X programs (like FvwmWinList, which has the same style settings as
FvwmButtons) icons on the MS windows taskbar, and FvwmButtons doesn't show
up there or onscreen.  Usually it does flash on for a second, and
occasionally it doesn't disappear at all.  My FvwmButtons configuration
consists of a few standard pixmap/text type buttons and three swallowed
programs: xbiff, xclock and xload, all of which do disappear with it.

Now, i realise that this sounds very much like a problem with something
*other* than the window manager; however, if i try the same configuration
(minus FvwmButtons of course) with twm or with blackbox, there is no
problem - no startup delay at all.  Unfortunately i have yet to find
another window manager i like nearly so much as fvwm2.

Further note: even without having FvwmButtons run, the startup delay
problem still happens, so I don't think it's FvwmButtons' fault directly.

I'm marking this message "private" because i confess i doubt there's much
you can tell me and i realise it's quite possibly not a FVWM bug at all;
however, i thought i'd go ahead and send it anyway just in case there *is*
some problem you know about or can speculate about that would cause this
effect.

Thanks for any help

"The" standard?  Of course Unix98 most definitely != POSIX, any vintage.
As the man said, "that's the great thing about standards, there are so
many to choose from!"

As I mentioned, here's a fairly trivial patch to FvwmIconMan to allow
actions defined for the Buttons next or prev to wrap around the end of
the windowlist. I don't believe a manpage patch is required, as the
page is ambiguous on the behavior on this point... I certainly was a
bit surprised that this *didn't* work until I patched it. Anyway, the
patch follows. I produced it with a simple 'cvs diff' in my current
tree:

We haven't heard anything from Brady for about two months now.
So unless he tells us otherwise I'd assume sending IconMan
patches to the list is the right thing to do. We've changed
a lot in IconMan anyway and things have already built up
movement of their own.

Please, no reformatting now. CVS is a bit picky about whitespace
changes and we don't want to have thousands of TAB diffs so close
to the release. When I apply the patche I will tabify it again.
BTW, we have an (unwritten) agreement that a TAB is 8 spaces.
After 2.2 I want to make a stab at reindenting the code anyway.

And one thing about your patches: Please compress them with
gzip, not bzip2. I don't know how many people even know that
compressing tool. I've tried it once, but since it saved no
more than 10% (compared to gzip) but took at least twice as
long, so I threw it away.

Please, nobody should reply to a Jitterbug message without
changing the recipient! Simple replies are treated as new
messages = new bugs. Be careful.

I'm slowly getting the impression that Jitterbug wasn't
so clever a choice too.

Hi folks,

in the last few days I received an increasing number of
mails addressed to me and only me. *Please* everyone
don't reply to threads on the list to me directly. I am
*NOT* 'the maintainer' of fvwm2 but merely one of them
and the others are interested in the information too.
Furthermore if you send me mails directly I don't get
them at home where I do the work. And since my allowed
mail volume there is very limited, please don't reply
to my private address. All I will do with such mail is
forwarding it to the list (= more work for me).
If you are unsure if you should post large patches, ask
on the list. In general for everything up to 50k you can
post to the list without thinking twice about it.

Jason, Dan, does anything on the web page suggest that
folks should send mail to me? If not, could we mention
that explicitly (at least for a while)?

Thanks

Dominik

Hi,
This patch contains the signal changes for FvwmPager and some compiler
warning fixes. There are also some const references, but these should be
mostly benign. One other thing: I noticed that FVWM modules malloc an
extra null-terminated string to hold the modules' name. This should be
unnecessary since the storage pointed to by argv[] doesn't disappear.

Cheers,
Chris.

Hi,
This is the first patch: it contains all the const stuff but it's also
small and shouldn't do any harm. The BIG changes are that it handles the
DestroyNotify event (by calling DeadPipe) and will terminate SAFELY when
it receives any of the following signals: TERM, QUIT, PIPE, HIP, INT. I
also simplified the select() code slightly since I couldn't see what (if
anything) the original logic was hoping to achieve.

BTW this patch is against 2.1.4 and my FvwmIconMan module has been very
well behaved since. However, if you should spot something please let me
know.

Cheers,
Chris.

Hi,
This patch is more difficult because I stripped the TABs out of
FvwmButtons.c (nasty things and no-one can ever agree how many spaces
they should represent). I shall list my significant changes instead:

FvwmButtons.c >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

#include <setjmp.h>

...

#ifdef __GNUC__
#  define _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_  __attribute__((noreturn))
#else
#  define _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_
#endif

...

void DeadPipe(int) _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_
static void DeadPipeCleanup(void);
static void DeadPipeHandler(int sig);
...
static void nocolor(const char *a, const char *b) _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_;
...

static sigjmp_buf  deadjump;

...

/*
** DeadPipe()
** Externally callable function to quit!
void DeadPipe(int nonsense)
{
  exit(1);
}

/*
** DeadPipeHandler()
** Signal handler that will make the event loop terminate
*/
static void DeadPipeHandler(int sig)
{
  siglongjmp(deadjump,1);
}

/*
** DeadPipeCleanup()
** Remove all the windows from the Button-Bar, and close them as
necessary.
** Note that this is an exit-procedure and so will be called
automatically
*/
static void DeadPipeCleanup(void)
{
 ... original cleanup code , except it doesn't call exit()
}


...

static XErrorHandler oldErrorHandler=NULL;
int myErrorHandler(Display *dpy, XErrorEvent *event)
{
  /* fprintf( ... etc */
  /* Don't call the default handler - it kills the button-bar.
   * We want to give the button-bar a chance to respawn its dead button
   */
  /* return (*oldErrorHandler)(dpy,event); */
  return 0;
}

int main( ...
{
  char *s;
...

  MyName = argv[0];
  s = strrchr(MyName,'/');
  if (s) MyName = s+1;

 - No need to allocate storage for the module name; just assign MyName
in a more cunning way.
...

  /*
  ** Now that we have finished initialising everything,
  ** it is safe(r) to install the clean-up handlers ...
  */
  atexit(DeadPipeCleanup);
  if ( !sigsetjmp(deadjump,1) )
  {
    struct sigaction  sigact;

    /* Do NOT install the signal handlers until the long-jump
     * has been safely initialised ...
     */
    sigemptyset(&sigact.sa_mask);
    sigact.sa_flags = 0;
    sigact.sa_handler = DeadPipeHandler;

    sigaction(SIGPIPE,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGINT,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGHUP,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGQUIT,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGTERM,&sigact,NULL);

    Loop();
  }
  /**/
  return 0;
}

The attachment contains the rest of the changes - mostly fixes for
compiler warnings.

Cheers,
Chris

Hi,
This is a big patch against the libs/ directory. I don't think that
there's anything crucial in here; just general maintenance. However, it
might avoid future bugs if the compiler complains when someone tries to
modify the unmodifiable.

The functions in Parse.c that suddenly have to return "const char *"
make the biggest mess (in fvwm itself)

Cheers,
Chris.

Subject: FvwmIconMan patch - 'cos it's small and easy
From: rankinc@bellsouth.net
To: dominik_vogt@hp.com

Hi,
This is the first patch: it contains all the const stuff but it's also
small and shouldn't do any harm. The BIG changes are that it handles the
DestroyNotify event (by calling DeadPipe) and will terminate SAFELY when
it receives any of the following signals: TERM, QUIT, PIPE, HIP, INT. I
also simplified the select() code slightly since I couldn't see what (if
anything) the original logic was hoping to achieve.

BTW this patch is against 2.1.4 and my FvwmIconMan module has been very
well behaved since. However, if you should spot something please let me
know.

Cheers,
Chris.

Subject: FvwmPager patch - even smaller!
From: rankinc@bellsouth.net
To: dominik_vogt@hp.com

Hi,
This patch contains the signal changes for FvwmPager and some compiler
warning fixes. There are also some const references, but these should be
mostly benign. One other thing: I noticed that FVWM modules malloc an
extra null-terminated string to hold the modules' name. This should be
unnecessary since the storage pointed to by argv[] doesn't disappear.

Cheers,
Chris.

Subject: FvwmButtons - somewhat harder...
From: rankinc@bellsouth.net
To: dominik_vogt@hp.com

Hi,
This patch is more difficult because I stripped the TABs out of
FvwmButtons.c (nasty things and no-one can ever agree how many spaces
they should represent). I shall list my significant changes instead:

FvwmButtons.c >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

#include <setjmp.h>

...

#ifdef __GNUC__
#  define _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_  __attribute__((noreturn))
#else
#  define _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_
#endif

...

void DeadPipe(int) _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_
static void DeadPipeCleanup(void);
static void DeadPipeHandler(int sig);
...
static void nocolor(const char *a, const char *b) _GNU_ATTR_NORETURN_;
...

static sigjmp_buf  deadjump;

...

/*
** DeadPipe()
** Externally callable function to quit!
void DeadPipe(int nonsense)
{
  exit(1);
}

/*
** DeadPipeHandler()
** Signal handler that will make the event loop terminate
*/
static void DeadPipeHandler(int sig)
{
  siglongjmp(deadjump,1);
}

/*
** DeadPipeCleanup()
** Remove all the windows from the Button-Bar, and close them as
necessary.
** Note that this is an exit-procedure and so will be called
automatically
*/
static void DeadPipeCleanup(void)
{
 ... original cleanup code , except it doesn't call exit()
}


...

static XErrorHandler oldErrorHandler=NULL;
int myErrorHandler(Display *dpy, XErrorEvent *event)
{
  /* fprintf( ... etc */
  /* Don't call the default handler - it kills the button-bar.
   * We want to give the button-bar a chance to respawn its dead button
   */
  /* return (*oldErrorHandler)(dpy,event); */
  return 0;
}

int main( ...
{
  char *s;
...

  MyName = argv[0];
  s = strrchr(MyName,'/');
  if (s) MyName = s+1;

 - No need to allocate storage for the module name; just assign MyName
in a more cunning way.
...

  /*
  ** Now that we have finished initialising everything,
  ** it is safe(r) to install the clean-up handlers ...
  */
  atexit(DeadPipeCleanup);
  if ( !sigsetjmp(deadjump,1) )
  {
    struct sigaction  sigact;

    /* Do NOT install the signal handlers until the long-jump
     * has been safely initialised ...
     */
    sigemptyset(&sigact.sa_mask);
    sigact.sa_flags = 0;
    sigact.sa_handler = DeadPipeHandler;

    sigaction(SIGPIPE,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGINT,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGHUP,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGQUIT,&sigact,NULL);
    sigaction(SIGTERM,&sigact,NULL);

    Loop();
  }
  /**/
  return 0;
}

The attachment contains the rest of the changes - mostly fixes for
compiler warnings.

Cheers,
Chris

From: rankinc@bellsouth.net

Hi,
This is a big patch against the libs/ directory. I don't think that
there's anything crucial in here; just general maintenance. However, it
might avoid future bugs if the compiler complains when someone tries to
modify the unmodifiable.

The functions in Parse.c that suddenly have to return "const char *"
make the biggest mess (in fvwm itself)

Cheers,
Chris.

	Because I think I'm one of the faulty guys, I can explain. The list put 
your adress in the reply-to field. So to reply there is the lazy way (reply and 
CC to the list) or the boring way (create new message, giving list address, 
subject preferably with RE: before, and importing the mail to repond to in the 
editor). Guess what I often choose ? :-)))
	Ok, I won't in the future, if I have to respond to you.

Ugh, I put a Reply-To address into my mails from home
so nobody tries to reply to my private address.

Jason, can you solve that? I think the Reply-To field
from the lists should always be empty, shouldn't it?

If that is the problem I may have to remove the Reply-To :(

Bye

Well, if it isn't too much work I could help out, but I'm
not sure what this is about. I've definitely not enough
knowledge to give detailed input to a standards discussion
but as a 'representative' I feel qualified enough.

I didn't think there was any consensus, and at least one reply
mentioned that such an "enhancement" should be part of the GSFR,
although I don't see the usefulness of having feedback windows be
modifiable on a per-window basis.

Turning off the feedback window is simple enough (the Move and Resize
code make sure that the window is created before writing to it and
mapping it), so that could be easily accomodated (all I'd need to do
is test it!).

If you don't mind this going into the 2.1.x/2.2 stream, could we at
least get a consensus as to what is desired?

Here are some possibilities:

1.  Using a global option:

    GlobalOpts	FeedbackWindowTopLeft
    GlobalOpts	FeedbackWindowCentered
    GlobalOpts	FeedbackWindowOff		# No feedback window
    GlobalOpts	FeedbackWindowDefault		# MenuStyle sets it

    Remarks:	This requires four different GlobalOpts commands to be
		programmed.  Further, the man page indicates that
		GlobalOpts is a TEMPORARY workaround, so it would
		eventually have to be rewritten.


2.  Using a global option with a parameter:

    GlobalOpts	FeedbackWindow {topleft,centered,off,default}

    Remarks:	Only requires one GlobalOpts command to be added.
		GlobalOpts is still supposed to be a TEMPORARY
		workaround, though.


3.  Using AddToDecor:

    AddToDecor	xxx
    + FeedbackStyle	{topleft,centered,off,default}

    Remarks:	The feedback window really is a "decor," but since
		decors are specified on a per-window basis, we'd have
		to rewrite the FeedbackWindow code to allow it to be
		repositioned as necessary.  (Yeeccch!)


4.  Create a new built-in function:

    FeedbackWindow	{topleft,centered,off,default}

    Remarks:	It's a "function" but it has a global effect.  There
		is precedent for this (eg, HighlightColor), but I
		think it is desired to move these sort of things into
		something different.

		This is what my original patch did, by the way.


I would like to see what others think on this before I do any more
work on it.  I personally prefer options (2), (4), and (1) above (in
more or less that order).  If people prefer option (3), I'd say that
it should be deferred until the 2.3.x release stream, since it will
require a much larger, an possibly more error-prone, rewrite.

I guess this would be option (5) -- at least document the current
behavior so we don't need to answer "how do I center that window" on
the FVWM list.

Note that my original code came out based on an attempt to answer that
very question:  it worked one way at home, and another way at work,
and I couldn't figure out why it was different until I examined the
code.  Although having the source is useful, not all users will be
comfortable about looking into source to find such answers.  [smile]

You need to set a "Reply-To:" field if you want replies to go to the
list rather than yourself.  This is documented in RFC 822 section
4.4.3.  I see that you have a "Mail-Followup-To:" but this is non-
standard.

Perhaps the majordomo could be configured to add a reply-to if none
has been set by the original poster.

I  don't see any  point in tying this  behavior to windows, so I don't
see a relationship to  GSFR, except that GSFR  is slated to be part of
2.3.x.

I can't  stop   this from going  into   2.1.x, but I  would   strongly
recommend that it not go in.  I know its a simple change, and unlikely
to cause  a bug ripple  effect, but long  years of experience  tell me
that unlikely things happen all the time.

It would seem to  me that only  actual bug fixes  should go in at this
point.  Don't despair, I  expect we will go  quickly from 2.2 into 2.3
development.

I don't see any problem with this last alternative.

See above, my opinion is any non-essential change (non-bug fix)
should be held out for the few weeks 2.2 takes to be released.

This  is  written  like you  missed  by  updating of the   man page to
document the currrent behavior.  Thats why I moved your second problem
report to the "fixed" category.

Come  to   think  of    it, I   neglected   to  document    where  the
foreground/background  colors come from on a  feedback window.  I don't
want to  encourage anyone to  come up with   pixmap backgrounds to the
feedback window, that really would be going too far.

FeedbackWindow Foreground color, Background color,
               Position topleft|centered|off|default

It wasn't that easy to see in the source.

Well, the consensus was reached by nobody complaining about
the last 'draft' ;-) I didn't understand the GSFR par the
same way as you did.

I perfer (1). (2) adds unnecessary complexity to a commands that
will be rewritten anyway some day. Since I find the logic around
Decors sick I wouldn't want it as a decor command (3). And (4)
was agreed upon that it's overkill, wasn't it?

But there's one thing I dont like about all four: the names.
I still can't imagine how someone could have the idea so search
for 'feedback' in the manpage. 'Move' or 'Resize' should
definitely be part of the name. Any suggestions?
Perhaps 'MoveResizeGeometry...'?

No, you need to use the "followup" command in your mailer to send to all
recipients, instead of the "reply" command to send only to the author.
"Followup" will send to fvwm-workers, since it's on the CC line.

Certainly if Dominik never wanted to receive private replies he could
set his reply-to, but people sending patches, etc. should reply to the
list regardless.

No.  Or rather, majordomo can be configured that way, of course, but  it
is The Wrong Thing To Do.

Note this isn't the right way to handle these GCC extensions.  They were
designed precisely so they could be removed without this type of thing.
The are dang handy, though; I esp. like the printf format attributes but
those require even more testing since they weren't introduced until
later versions of GCC.

I will check in some changes today that enable/disable this stuff
correctly, pulled from my work on other GNU packages.

No; see my previous URL reference to Reply-To handling and lists.

I don't understand the problem.

All Reply-To does is redirect mail sent to you to some other address.
If you didn't add a Reply-To, people would _still_ send to your
(original) email address, via the "From" field, if they used reply or
followup.  The former would send only to you, and the latter would send
to both you and the list.

There's no way for _you_ to do anything in your messages which would
remove _you_ as a recipient, except, I guess, for adding something like:

  Reply-To: fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

which would work.  But then, of course, no one can reply to you
directly; that's a decision you should make yourself.

Right. We are fully aware of the state of our signal handlers.
Anyone wanting to make a shot at these is welcome (although
such patches won't be included in 2.2, but soon after).

You mean me?

I added some simple debugging macros, but I didn't change much to use
them.  I certainly wouldn't ever turn on or off debugging using #if 1 :)

Actually, I think I complained about this "always on" setting to the
list a month or so ago.  I guess a more productive reaction would have
been to change the setting :).  Since I don't use FvwmIconMan, I was
kinda waiting for someone who did to tell me whether they wanted the
output or not.

Sigh, I feared that. You can probably imagine that I don't
want relies to my private mail be sent to the workers list.

Yes. Or should I rather say 'Mr. Paul D. Smith' ? ;-)

I'm completely at a loss. I thought you had already done this.
If you know what to do, could you make this change?

Not if you put one there yourself.  You can set it to the list if you
like.  Mutt can probably insert one conditionally based on where the mail
is going.

Even if this list did have a Reply-To: set, I would not have it override
one that you added yourself.

When building with autoconf, I think the x-includes and x-libraries should
be set relative to the path by default.

i.e I have the following X installations;
/usr/openwin
/usr/local/X116
/usr/local/X11R6.3
/usr/local/X11R6.4

The defaults for this system link /usr/local/X11R6.3/bin/* /usr/local/bin.
This means that /usr/local/bin/xmkmf is found first for most people.

However if I do the following in my shell before autoconf;
setenv PATH /usr/local/X11R6.4/bin:$PATH

Fvwm does the wrong thing with some of its paths and finds stuff in
someone's predefined order of how things should be searched. I consider this
a bug. Fvwm should use the location of xmkmf or imake in the PATH (if
found) as the default place to build x-includes and x-libraries.

I do not know if autoconf has a way to use imake/xmkmf to gain pertainant
information, but if if does this would be more consistant. (actually,
looking at how gtk+ builds, I see they have done this correctly in their
"configure".

I think it might be useful to be able to turn it on/off as a style option. I only
notice the resize numbers when I'm resizing xterms and other text-ty type things.
I only look at the move numbers when I'm debugging a wandering window 8-).

Cheers,

I like "feedback", it leaves the door open for providing other forms of feedback
that I can't think of at the moment.  Maybe the Move command should mention the
feedback window.

I have no overwhelming desire to get this into 2.1.x, since I have
already determined how this gets set using the current configuration
file syntax.

I'll take up the task of putting this into 2.3.x, but we may want to
start discussing how such things will be specified.

>                Position topleft|centered|off|default
>

Let's apply Dominik's suggestion (MoveResizeWindow instead of
Feedback) as well:

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	On | Off

	Enable (default) or disable the Move/Resize feedback window.

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	ForegroundColor {color}

	Set the color of the text in the window.

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	BackgroundColor {color}

	Set the color of the background.

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	Font {font-name}

	The font of the text in the window.

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	Geometry centered|{geometry}

	Specify the location of the window.  Use the word "centered"
	to have the window centered on the display.  Otherwise, use a
	standard X Geometry to specify the location and/or size.  Some
	common examples:

	    Geometry +0+0	# top left corner
	    Geometry -0-0	# bottom right corner

	Refer to X(1) for other geometry values.

    The various keywords may be specified on a single line, separated
    by commas:

    MoveResizeWindowStyle	ForegroundColor black, \
    				BackgroundColor grey, \
				Font fixed, \
				Geometry centered

This syntax gives us maximum configurability, and allows the window to
work as a function (enabling and disabling the feedback window at
will).


Some other notes:

* I prefer keyword parameters over positional parameters (quick... 
  what EXACTLY does parameter 4 in MenuStyle do???).  I think that
  fvwm should move to this for most places where it makes sense, but
  keep the old syntax (deprecated, possibly) for compatibility with
  older config files.

* I would like keywords that specify colors to use the word "color" in
  them (eg, ForegroundColor instead of Foreground).  This makes it
  easier to find color references in a .fvwm2rc file.

* I am only making suggestions right now, I am not going to start work
  on this until I have some idea where the fvwm2 development is heading
  in order to save myself the effort of doing something that will either
  not be included or that will need to be redone in the future.  (In
  other words, I want us all singing from the same score...)

This is, unfortunately, user agent dependent.  Welcome to the hell that
mailing list software authors live in.  You simply cannot control where
replies go, no matter how hard you try.  (For instance, Gnus has the
'broken-reply-to' setting; if a list is broken and sets Reply-To: on every

ls /usr/local/fvwm/bin
FvwmCommand  fvwm2        xpmroot

If we are going to keep the modules around, it would be good to install
binaries by version also, and link the current one to the the default name;

ls /usr/local/fvwm/bin
FvwmCommand@       fvwm2@             fvwm2.1.3          fvwm2.1.5
FvwmCommand-2.1.5  fvwm2.1.2          fvwm2.1.4          xpmroot


Or else maybe install the whole tree in a subdirectoy and link everything
in. But if so, then the libexec/fvwm/$version is not needed.

/usr/local/fvwm/
2.1.2    2.1.3    2.1.4    2.1.5    bin      libexec  man

It just seems somewhat inconsistant to only keep the modules around, without
a convienent way to mainatain the rest of the old installation.

Does this seem reasonable? Thoughts?

MoveResizeGeometryFeedbackWindowStyleIsDependsOnMenuStyle then?
Ok I'm pushing it a bit ;-)
Perhaps MoveResizeGeometryFeedback... (those global opts have
long names anyway).

Followup sends two copies to the originator, one directly and one via
the list.  Most of my list activity is in USENET, so I'm used to
sending followup to the newsgroup only.  The originator should get a
direct copy only if they explicitly request it.

I suppose that the solution is for the mailer to recognize mailing
lists and remove the author from the followup recipients, unless
followup & reply has been explicitly called for.

Now we're treading the path I wanted to avoid. Being able to specify
colours, font, geometry and so on leads to code bloat. I did understand
that you started lookig after this because you didn't understand the
behaviour because it was nowhere explained. But it didn't really bother
you, right? And the only other complaint I heard was that the feedback
window couldn't be switched off.

And Tim already suggested to do it as a Style option. I can only
try to pull the emergency brake here. I I have anything to say
about that, we will not do that (unnecessary work = wasted time,
resources in my eyes).

Bye

Dominik

Sure.  You'd obviously only want to do that if you posted to some
particular addresses, say fvwm-workers.

Using a _good_ mailer, like Emacs VM or Emacs Gnus, you could do this :).
Or, in Emacs, you could define a key to insert that Reply-To for you.
Of course, in that case you've have to remember to do it.

I agree, and I've submitted a request to the automake folks to do
exactly this a couple of months ago; perhaps a different kind of install
rule a la install-strip (install-versioned ?).

It _may_ be possible to do this without automake support, but I'm not
sure... the install rule automake generates is kind of a "black box"; I
think there's only a postop rule you can run.  In that case we could
change the installation to use numbered installations, but the initial
install may whack the old fvwm2.  I'd have to try it out.

a) I like mutt's keyboard-only interface, b) emacs is too big for my
machine, c) mutt *can* do it, but I don't like the idea of funblimg
around with its hooks. Same with emcas BTW. I'll probably still do
this if these mails keep coming in.

Right, but this isn't USENET :)

I agree it would be nice to have the ability to follow up only to the
non-From addresses... I wonder if Gnus has that?  I'll have to look!

I typically just remove any addresses from the header that I don't want,
by hand.  It just takes a second in Emacs.

Well, it would be nice if _majordomo_ was smart enough to canonicalize
the To and CC fields, including mailing list expansion, so everyone got
just one copy.  That would be the Right Thing, I think.

Being able to specify colors, font, geometry and so on also leads to
better configurability.

One of the daunting tasks facing a newcomer to fvwm2 is figuring out how
to get the look and feel that he or she wants.  That's where something
like fvwm.themes.org comes in handy.  Giving fvwm2 maximum
configurability makes more sophisticated themes possible.

One way to minimize code bloat would be to move the code into its own
module, creating, say, FvwmFeedback.  If the module isn't running,
there's no feedback window.  If it's running, it could get its
configuration options (colors, font, geometry) and track interactive
moves and resizes.  This may require some additions to the fvwm2 module
protocol, though.

Right now, the current behavior is for the feedback window to inherit
the MenuStyle.  Right now, fvwm2 puts up only a few "windows" of its
own (not counting windows that modules may put up):

	Feedback window
	Menus
	Icons
	WindowList
	Pager

Of these, the last two can be replaced by modules for maximum
configurability.  Icons can get their font from the IconFont function.
Menus have a whole range of style options.  The feedback window is the
only fvwm2-generated window that the user cannot currently control
directly.

I also think that adding it as a Style option is overkill.  Having the
ability to interactively turn it on and off (using FvwmTalk, for
instance) could give Tim the same effect without having the Move and
Resize commands have to check the current window style.

I'm not quite sure what this addition really buys you.  I have MINI_ICONS
defined (ie. they are #define'd to 1), yet I don't use them, which leads me to
the question above - what for ?

BTW: I'm just trying to understand the code better (the comments are rather
     scarce and the variable names not very descriptive in alot of the
     places (I was never a believer in "magic numbers" either ;-)

If its a matter of padding space around the mini-icons, well can't that be
done at the same point that the mini-icon itself is added to the button (BTW:
I don't see how that is done in the code either).  In other words, why not do
the padding/addition at the point when the mini-icons themselves are to be
added ?

I commented out that line altogether and it removed the unnecessary
spaces (ie. its back to normal -- finally :-)

I can't imagine anyon has ever thought about the geometry, font,
colour etc. of such a window. In fact in day to day life you
should see it only a few seconds a day. The next step we will have
are colour gradients, fancy animations and a mouse-avoiding
feedback window. Nobody will use it however. That's what I mean
with code bloat. This feature is so subtle that most people will
never realise it's there. I myself became aware of it when this
discussion started. All this doesn't warrant more than half
a day of work and mo more than 500 bytes of code. My opinion.

I didn't mean the Style option when I said overkill but the whole
idea of working on this feedback window (apart from the small
discussed changes).

There is no padding. There is extra space reserved for the mini
icons. The extra space is not removed if you have no mini icons.
Even if you compiled without them (until I patched it).

Since nobody bothers to answer I assume there are no

added that state.

send-hook .              "my_hdr Reply-To: dominik_vogt@hp.com"
send-hook "fvwm-workers" "my_hdr Reply-To: fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu"

(You need both to make sure you don't set the Reply-To to fvwm-workers on
all messages.  They also need to be in that order, since all matches are
executed in the order found.)

Anyway, at least you're using mutt.  That makes you one of the Righteous.  ;-)

We could always say that mutt is the official mailer of fvwm and tell
people about the list-reply function.  It's so *very* handy.

Paul, you mentioned that it would be the Right Thing for majordomo to
canonicalize the headers.  Yeah it would be great, since it's the only
thing out there that knows who is and who isn't on the list.  But by the
time the message *gets* to majordomo, it's already been sent to the
individual recipient.  :-(  Majordomo could then *not* send the message to
that one person, but if you filter on the From_ header, you're toast.

Suffice it to say, replying and following up on a mailing list is screwed
up.  :)

I fired up xbuffy a couple hundred times last night, both on the newest CVS
and one of the older ones which still had the wandering xv problem.

No dice.

I didn't try it with FvwmButtons again, but I'm sick of trying to get that
to work the way I want it to.

Oh, I can understand this wo well. I think if I read another mail
about growing or wandering windows I'll jump out of the window. Sigh.
I'm living in the basement. Maybe some other way.

What do you want to say with this? If you think that is a bug
you should definitely send the offending lines from the
config files too.

I see, but I would still argue that the extra space is NOT needed regardless
of whether one has MINI_ICONS defined or not.  The WinList is dynamically
sized and so if MINI_ICONS are all of a sudden included the size would
(should) increase on a need basis.  In other words,

--> spawn an xterm titled "XTERM"
--> note WinList size
--> spawn an xterm titled "LONGER.XTERM"
--> note again WinList size; its increased to accommodate the longer string.

I would assume MINI_ICONS could take the same approach with the extra spaces
coming in _only_ when they are needed and being excluded otherwise
irrespective of whether one compiled with MINI_ICONs or not.

Am I completely 'out to pasture' on this ?

Add automake/$TAR issue to DEVELOPERS file.

Add GCC __attribute__ support to fvwmlib.h.

Modify FvwmIconMan to not print debugging info by default, and to not
print it to /dev/console in any event.  Note that "messages" are still
printed, and go to stderr by default.

A few minor cleanups after compiling with __attribute__ and -Wall.  But,
quickly tired of this, and probably _real_ cleaning should wait until
after 2.2 since mucking with header includes, etc. could cause compilation
problems on some systems.  At this point, the "if it ain't broke..."
philosophy should probably take hold.

Perhaps if you'd explain exactly what you mean here, I (being the guy who
writes Majordomo these days) might be able to do something.

Problem 1: CC: and To: are originator headers; strictly compliant MLMs will
not alter them except by folding lines as permitted by rfc822 and altering
encoding as permitted by rfc204mumble.

Problem 2: Majordomo doesn't know who or what's on the other end of a CC.

Problem 3: Majordomo doesn't have any control over mail that is sent to the
addresses in the To: and CC: headers; by the time that it gets it, the mail
has already been delivered elsewhere.

Now, Majordomo2 allows a member to set a flag saying that if they're
already in the To: or CC: headers, they don't get an additional copy from
the list server.  Is this what you were thinking of, or is this sufficient?

My best guess at what you really want is to remove from the To: and CC:
headers any addresses that are already on the list.  I think this would
have limited impact because MUAs would still bloat the CC list on each
followup.  I'd be happy to be swayed by strong examples, though.

I think, though, that I will add a way to automatically add a header to
indicate that the person sending the message is a list member.  This is at
least somewhat useful in determining whether or not someone needs a CC.

FvwmTile

I suggest having the install;
ln -s FvwmRearrange.1 FvwmTile.1
ln -s FvwmRearrange.1 FvwmCascade.1
ln -s FvwmCommand.1 FvwmCommandS.1

and add a short FvwmPipe.1 from the notes in FvwmPipe.c

I'm about to cause this thread to wander... I'd alter the Subject with
a "was: " but it's already pretty long... Anyway, every once in a
while a message comes both to fvwm-workers and fvwm... Could we agree
to reply only in fvwm, if the discussion is still relevant there?
Receiving duplicates is a nuisance. To the most relevant question,
what about workers not on the regular fvwm list, are there any? If so,
I'll just be quiet. On this topic, at least.

Of course Emacs also has a keyboard-only interface.  And since I'm
already running Emacs for editing (etc.) anyway, it doesn't take up any
more room to use it for USENET and mail.

But, I don't want to make this an editor/mailer war :)

Ohh that is what Dominik was asking... and yes that is exactly what I was
trying to say.

Sorry, I have been walking around the 2.1.5 beta looking for
inconsistancies that might be good to fix before the release.

Randall is  referring   to the sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc-sample-1&2
files in the distribution.

When those files were introduced, I believe... Chuck?, added a note to
the effect that he  wanted to combine/merge them  into system.fvwm2rc.
I spent some time looking, but never got around to making sense of the
whole thing.

Starting in 2.3,  I will  be adding pre-defined   forms that will  get
installed in <prefix>/etc.   I think  thats  where some parts  of  the
sample.fvwmrc directory should go  also.  (At least the useful parts.)
The rest of it should probably  be in man pages,  rather than in these
files.

I don't see anything wrong with the output "rclock" not found, but
the other messages seem to point at bad samples.

Doesn't Mail-Followup-To: sort of do that?  From the manual:

    Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To header field is generated
    when sending mail.  When set, Mutt will generate this field when you
    are replying to a known mailing ``lists''.

    The purpose of this field is to prevent you from receiving duplicate
    copies of replies to messages which you send by specifying that you
    will receive a copy of the message if it is addressed to the mailing
    list (and thus there is no need to also include your address in a group
    reply).

Whatever header you add, though, the MUA on the other end still needs to be
intelligent enough to understand what to do with it.  It doesn't matter if
Majordomo inserts it or if the original MUA does.

This came up on the mutt mailing list late last year (November / December
time frame).  Some things to look at:

    http://pobox.com/~djb/proto/replyto.html

and the IETF drafts (which might be more than that now, I don't know)

    draft-ietf-drums-mail-followup-to-00.txt
        Jacob Palme's draft on the proposed Mail-Followup-To header.

    draft-ietf-drums-replyto-personal-00.txt
        Eric Raymond's draft on Personal-Reply-To

which can be found at ds.internic.net.

I have removed all refrences to MenuStyle from my rc file and have just
been using 
SetMenuStyle, but in light of recent discusions of the feedback window and
removal 
of the next tag I started paying a little more attention.
If you use a line like the following just up to mwm there is no problem. 
The problem
arises when you add *Gradient.  This calls ReadMenuFace which sets the
style element 
of the passed in MenuFace to [HVD]GradientMenu.  But style can also contain
 MWM FVWM or 
Win Menu.  So if you have a gradient in your menu style all conditionals
that are 
looking for FVWM MWM WIN just go with the default.  

The only place I see The Gradients getting used are in PaintMenu in menus.c
,  I would think the simple solution is to 
add a second style for graddients to the MenuFace struct.

SetMenuStyle default gray90 #515178 gray40 Black \
   -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* anim mwm \
   (HGradient 8 #515178 #424278)

The description of SetMenuStyle is not quit complete it needs to be 

SetMenuStyle forecolor backcolor shadecolor font anim style

as a note MenuStyle requires this format
MenuStyle forecolor backcolor shadecolor font style anim
which inverts the last 2 args.  Not sure if this is right but is should be
noted

No, but as long as you're going to generate some random header which tells
a recipient that the sender of the message belongs to the list, the Right
Thing To Do, as I understand it, is to use this header, since that's what
the original sender does when he wants to say he belongs to the list.

I don't know, however, if an MLM is allowed to generate this header for the
user.

Definitely.  If Mail-Followup-To: has the right semantics, then it'll work
automatically for people who have mailers that support it, and everyone
else will have to switch^H^H^H^H^H^Hlook for the header `by hand'.  Still,
there's nothing the MLM can do to enforce the rules.  It can help things
along, but ultimately it's an end-user issue.

Anyway, that's probably enough traffic on that issue.  I'll keep my mouth
for now and just let you deal with it.  ;-)

Howdy,

I was able to compile fvwm-2.1.5 under hpux; it wasn't quite as easy as
on my Linux box, but not too bad.  I got the following error trying to 
compile extras/FvwmConfig/winBase.C:

using gnu c++:

 WinBase.C: In function `int My_XNextEvent(struct _XDisplay *, union _XEvent *)':
 WinBase.C:986: passing `int *' as argument 2 of `select(int, fd_set *, fd_set *, fd_set *, timeval *)'
 *** Error exit code 1    

using HP's aCC:

 Error 212: "WinBase.C", line 986 # Argument type 'int *' does not match expected parameter type 'fd_set *'.
      retval=select(fd_width,(int *)&in_fdset, (int *)&out_fdset,0, NULL);
                                    ^
 Error 212: "WinBase.C", line 986 # Argument type 'int *' does not match expected parameter type 'fd_set *'.
      retval=select(fd_width,(int *)&in_fdset, (int *)&out_fdset,0, NULL);   

Just curious if anyone had some clues.  Everything compiled fine under
x86 linux.


Also, an extremely minor bug which existed in 2.0.46 is still around:

  1. WindowShade your favorite application.  XEmacs is a particularly
     nice one to try.

  2. Switch to a different desk or even a different page on the same
     desk. 

  3. Using the pager, drag the 'shaded' application into your current
     desk/page. 

The shaded window invariable displays more than just the title bar.

Yes at least partly. As I have a draconic mailbox size limit
with my internet provider I've only subscribed the workers
list at home :(

Ah, now I understand. The (fvwm/mwm/win) menu style is immediately
overridden because as soon as the MenuFace bit is parsed. But this
applies to all MenuFace styles, not just the gradients. This is no
problem where painting is concerned, but kills the special behaviour
of fvwm menus (prepop menus and the place where the submenu is drawn).
I suggest we split up the style bit into a behaviour specific part
(that is still called 'style') and a painting related part
'visual_style'. 'style' can only be fvwm/mwm/win. 'visual_style'
defaults to the value set for 'style' but is overridden when
a MenuFace is used.

Thanks for the hint, that works well (with a little enhancement to

You mean there are mailers *without* a list-reply????? Oh, how I

Well, you are right - in principle. But you said you took a look
at this and didn't understand it. Neither did I. It seems to
be non-trivial since a mini icon might be added or removed at any
time and no width recalculation is planned for this case. If you
find out where to begin patching just tell me (or create a patch).

Hi folks,

After a panel pops up, it is supposed to close up in the same manner. The
patch at the end of this mail will make FvwmButton remember which direction
to close up, if it's not told explicitly.

This sounds like a good idea.  I'm not sure the differences between mwm and win
styles are significant enough to warrant keeping them as a separate style (the
placement of submenus look almost the same).  mwm highlights using 3D, win
hilights using colour - I think these attributes should be in the visual style.
We could just have fvwm and mwm style with a section in the man pages telling how
to make mwm look like win95.  It would mean less things to test.

Tim.

Does this patch make the Up, Down, Left & Right actions wrap?  Before this
patch IconMan is at least consistent and it is possible to do wrapping by
using the conditionals.  From the examples section in the man page:

          bif Next 3, gotobutton 0, select, ret, gotobutton Next, select

     If a button is selected, and it's the  last  button,  go  to
     button  0.  If it's not the last button, go to the next but-
     ton. Otherwise, do nothing. Basically,  this  action  cycles
     through all buttons in the current manager.

If we do put this patch in we should change the man page too.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS There's also mention of a wandering bug at the bottom of the IconMan man
page. Is it safe to remove it?

This is not the only difference. Submenus are placed two pixels
farther to the left with WIN menus than with MWM menus. There
may be other differences too. The manpage is by no means
complete (and I don't think it should be). And the 'next'
style had a different idea of how things should look like too:
It didn't underline menu titles and places submenus four pixels
right of mwm submenus.

Unfortunately having a (menuface) option suppresses item
highlighting (other than text colour). We're a bit inconsistent
here. Another thing is the order of parameters. Brad noticed
that the anim/noanim bit and the style have changed places.
Since I removed the reason for that (menufaces can now be
specified for all styles), we might want to change this back
before 2.2.

Earlier we started a discussion about the SetMenuStyle syntax.
I want to propose the following now that we still have a choice:

  SetMenuStyle stlye-name <option> [, <option>] ...

where <option> can be:
                           Default
  Foreground <colour>      black
  Background <colour>      white
  Shade <colour>           ?

  Hilight <colour>         black
  Animation on|off         off
  Font <font>              ?
  Style fvwm|mwm|win       fvwm
  MenuFace (<menuface>)    none

The options in the second group could be easily set with
sensible defaults while the user has to set the first
three if he wants to get something sensible.

Any comments on this?

Bye

I don't think a few pixels matter.  If we had a Hilight3D setting that could take care of
some of the win/mwm style differences.

I agree that it should suppress background colour highlighting, but I'd like it to be able
to draw a 3D relief around the active item.  There is a bit of a bug in the current
TiledPixmap bit: the left and right relief is overwritten with the pixmap.

I think Hilight should be HilightFore and there should be HilightBack colour and Hilight3D
on|off.  I really think we should lose the win style.

Cheers,
Tim.

Good idea.

The like this:
                           default
----------------------------------
  Foreground <colour>        black
  Background <colour>        white
  Shade <colour>             ?
  HilightFore <colour>       none
  HilightBack <colour>       none
  Hilight3D on|off           on
  Animation on|off           off
  Font <font>                ?
  MenuFace (<menuface>)      none
  Look fvwm|mwm[|win]        fvwm
  Feel fvwm|mwm|win          fvwm
  PositionHints <poshints>   none

Hilight... can be (de)activated independently (Fore and Back are
turned off by leaving the colour blank? Or perhaps by specifying
'none' as colour?). The 'Look' bit just sets defaults for the
visual settinga (e.g. Hilight3D off, HilightBack black, Animation
off for WIN). The 'Feel' part controls the differences in handling
(popup offset, prepopping menus and so on). The only reason why
the WIN look is needed is for the popup offset. Probably nobody
will notice if we remove that.

The PosHints might be a logical extension to the position hints
for single menus. In fact I use this with all my menus, just like
a style:

  Popup foobar item +100 c

This gives me submenus always centered on the current menu item
vertically. This saves a lot of space. If you can override this
for individual menus it would be nice to have the general setting.
However this can wait until after 2.2 since it is a non-disruptive
enhancement.

Good work, I took a look at your changes, and your right you are starrting
to figure out those Xlib routines.  A tip for you and anyone else who
might care a great place to start learning Xlib is O'Reillies X books Vol
1 and 2 -- 2 is the refrence 1 is the manual with examples. I find them
both invaluable when writing Xlib code.  And if our goal is still to write
good bloat free code an understanding of the X routines is essential.

Assuming none of the pending patches brake it, yes it is safe to remove
it.  I could repeat this particualr bug at will, just start up an app that
opens several windows, then exit it, this would cause it to walk all over
the place.  Now it starys exactlly where I place it.

Hi,

I've put in some small changes to the FvwmWinList module, i felt were
useable...

The changes consists of:

A new parameter: 

*FvwmWinListButtonFrameWidth width

this specifies the width of the border around the buttons, ranging from 0
to 5. This allows one to have the more cool one-pixel wide borders around
the buttons like FvwmButtons allows you to have.

Also The TruncateLeft option did only work if you had LeftJustify on,
It now works always. 

Last, i have fiddled with the borders, and margins to align the buttons
better, and have more consistent margins etc..

I have glued in a patch below against the 2.1.5 beta version.

I have tried to test it with a lot of different setups, and the only flaw
i see by now, is that if some buttons don't have pixmaps the texts of
these do not align with the text of the buttons that have pixmaps. An easy
way to fix that though, is to use: 

Style "*" MiniIcon mini.xpm

To have a default (blank) miniicon for all windows...

comments/suggestions welcome...

Best Regards,
Jesper James

./configure --with-xpm-library=/somepath
properly finds libXpm and adds the appropriate -L/somepath to the
Makefiles
but it does not add the corresponding -R/somepath needed under Solaris
to create an executable that has the same library search path as was used
by the compiler.

As it stands the compiler finds the symbols but ldd shows that the
binaries
cannot be executed without manually setting the environment variable
LD_LIBARY_PATH to include /somepath. It is much cleaner to have the path
compiled into the executable with -R.

Full_Name: Mark Crocker

Submission from: (NULL) (204.134.212.40)


I switched to fvwm 2.1.4 and found that edge scrolling only works when
moving the
cursor over the left or upper screen border, but when moving over the lower
or 
right border.  

I had not changed any .fvwmrc parameters that affect desktop scrolling as
far as I 
know.  I am using:  "EdgeScroll 100 100", "EdgeResistance 500 20" and 
"DeskTopSize 3 2".  If I have time, I'll try the OS/2 version of 2.1.4 to
see if 
it has the same problem.

Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I used to be on
the
mailing lists, but I am not any more, so contact me directly, but feel free
to
Cc: the mailing list if you want.

While I've got your attention... 2.1.4 seems to send excessive output to
console.
Is there a way to turn this off?

				Thanks;

The description of SetMenuStyle is not quit complete it needs to be 

SetMenuStyle forecolor backcolor shadecolor font anim style

as a note MenuStyle requires this format
MenuStyle forecolor backcolor shadecolor font style anim
which inverts the last 2 args.  Not sure if this is right but is should be
noted

FvwmCpp assumes cpp in in /usr/lib.  The configure script is smart
enough to figure out where it is on my system.  Is it possible to
pass this information down to FvwmCpp (-D in a makefile)?

When RedHat announced the new XFree RPMS, they said the following:

 New RPMs for XFree86 3.3.3 (X11) are available for Red Hat Linux 4.2 and
 5.x on all platforms. This new release contains a large number of new
 features and bugfixes, including some related to system security.  New
 RPMs of the fvwm2 window manager for Red Hat Linux 5.x are also available,
 as the new X release exposed a serious bug.

They still ship 2.0.46+patches.  Anyone have any idea what the 'serious
bug' is?  It's probably already been fixed, but given past experience
there's a nonzero chance that it hasn't been reported here.

This is not always true suppose the library you compiled in is your home
directory somewhere and then you package up the binary for the rest of
your system to use.  Well now on else can run it because they can't get to
your library.

Alan, could you let us (Debian and the fvwm-workers team) know what
the Red Hat fvwm2 bug was?  Is it security-related (a la /tmp usage
from several years ago).

FYI:

The patch won't be included before the 2.2 release anymore,
but I'll remember it as soon as 2.2 is out.

This looks good, I'll put this in, but a few questions first:

I'd prefer to change the man page to match the code (and FvwmButtons terminology).  I can't see
why you'd want to limit the shadow width. Does anything break with borders > 5? If someone
wants a daft number let them have it. (It may not be so daft when I get my 50000x40000 pixel
inflatable LCD display.)

What does this last line do?

No, I didn't address Up, Down, Left & Right. 1) It's more complicated
to do, since it's probably appropriate to tune some behaviors
according to the button gravity; 2) I'm not sure what the preferred
behavior should be. An example case:

FvwmIconMan
1    4    7
2    5
3    6

Say that's an IconMan window showing xterms titled 1-7. From 3, should
"down" go to 1 or to 4? This gets slightly more controversial with,
from 6, should "right" go to 7 or to 3?

Erk. Didn't notice that in the manpage... Well, maybe we should leave
the behavior alone and ignore my patch... Or decide how to do the
above to make up,down,left,right consistent with my patched next,prev.
I'd be willing to take a crack at additional patching on
up,down,left,right, if we want to do that, else ignore my patch and
I'll reconfig and unpatch my IconMan.

>PS There's also mention of a wandering bug at the bottom of the IconMan man

No idea. I typically have my IconMan swallowed in Buttons, so
wandering's a special case for me, I imagine... mine stays quite
firmly fixed. Otherwise I run it transient, so it generally doesn't
budge within the lifetime of the window. And finally, mine grow down,
then right.

If I recall when bug #65 was reported Dominik said he couldn't recreate
it.  Maybe I can clean up the language to help.

Start up fvwm 
Assuming the rc never has you leave Desk 0 Page 0 0
Then move your mouse to the borders of the viewport 
you will see a resize cursor (or at least I do which is odd) but it won't
move the viewport to the next page
Now use whatever key you have bound to Scroll you around 
When you get to the new page the mouse works as normal.
I have noticed it on startups and restarts.  Which suggests that it is
somewhere in the start code, since recapture doesn't seem to display the
behavior

Since  I like to  use  "-R" I would argue   that if you are installing
fvwm2, you  have to install the  XPM  package also  or at  least build
against the XPM library fvwm2 will end up using.

I've had a message from Alan Cox saying he's forwarded my query on to
someone else who's looking after fvwm2 for Red Hat.  I'll get back to
the list about this one.

Subject: escape-handling in FvwmButtons

OS: HP-UX 10.20

Submission from: (NULL) (15.254.48.2)


Escape handling seems to have changed in handling Actions in FvwmButtons.
Previously, the following worked:

   *FvwmButtons(Icon mini-mail.xpm, Action 'Exec gnudoit \(vm\)')

Now, I have to escape the back-slashes as well, as below:

   *FvwmButtons(Icon mini-mail.xpm, Action "Exec gnudoit \\(vm\\)')

It's just a minor inconsistency, since the following commands all work
unchanged:

  Mouse 2 R       C       Exec gnudoit \(vm\)
  Mouse 2 R       S       Exec gnudoit \(vm-mail\)
  Mouse 2 R       M       Exec gnudoit \(vm-sent\)    

Perhaps those commands should never have worked without escaping!

Had to clean this code up - it was just too bizarre! (And it was in the

Hello,

Just wanted to say you guys are doing great work.  I was curious, will you
be adding .png support to the menus? I think that .xpm support is great,
however, if you are working on GNOME issues such as we are here, .png
support in menus becomes crucial.

Our fvwm2gnome code dynamically generates a gnome applications menu to be
accessed from the fvwm2 root menu, which works fine.  The relevant
installed GNOME apps, and others, have related .png icons associated with
them, as well as some having .xpm's for other applications.  

We can display the .xpms fine in the menu, but are at a loss for .png
support. It would be nice if this could be added in, as you'd be on your
way towards GNOME compliancy.

Any help, hack, or response you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
We will be working on hacking fvwm2gnome to work with 2.1.5, currently we
only support up to 2.0.46. 

If you're not aware of what our site is, please, please, read:

A usable workaround may be to do pngtopnm | ppmtoxpm and generate

Just to clarify, none of the gnome window manager spec requires being

This patch makes the signal handling reentrant. The shutdown-event
should occur when the module closes down "nicely".

	Well, just that after a month without computer I rediscover the 
outer world (that nice thing you can see though your window :) but now 
I'm back again (this time with a better box) and I hope your computers 
never failed during a BIOS update.
	After that little intro I would like to be informed of what has 
happen here for the last month, just a briefing, my email was just too 
large (when the admin discover a 12Mb mbox he just deleted it) and I do 
not have the time to read that large mailing list archive. So please if
you could made a little revision of past events (just the more importants 
of course, no point of talking about anybody getting married :D and send 
it to me directly by email, and of course I would like to get only one 
mail, so please Dominik if you have time send me it. (Thanks in advance)
	
	Hopping I could get soon into fvwm development soon. I have had 
time to think about many thing during this retirement, you will be 
informed of all theese happy-mad ideas :-)

Best idea is to (a) get a copy of the latest CVS sources and read the
ChangeLog and NEWS files, and (b) check out the Jitterbug WWW bug
database for bugs in the "fixed" category (and those not fixed yet :)

	To recap my explanation for those not folowing the general list:

	The problem is that when a window has the wmhints initial_state
property set to IconicState, *all* the fancy-schmantzy window placement
logic - Smart, Clever, StartsOnPage, or what have you - is bypassed.

	I don't know why this check was in there (placement.c: PlaceWindow) -
possibly the idea was to defer the overhead of position calculation till the
window was actually mapped for the first time? Does anyone have any ideas?

	There's an inconsistency here, because if the window is starting
iconic because of a StartIconic Style spec instead of a wmhint, this doesn't
happen, and the placement logic works as the user expects.

	I removed the two checks for IconicState in PlaceWindow, and it
doesn't seem to cause any ill effects - but that's based on about 5 minutes'
worth of superficial testing, consisting of starting up an xterm as
described in Philippe's bug report.

Hi Chris;

I think it's great that you're taking this project of making fvwm and
modules more signal-safe.  Sorry I haven't spoken up before; I've been
trying to find the time to see what you've been doing.

I do have some concerns about these changes: mainly that you're using
possibly non-portable functions.  All the items you're using are POSIX,
that's true, but even today more systems support the current signal(),
etc. feature set than do sigaction(), sigsetjmp(), etc.

I'm worried that we'll be sacrificing portability to some older
platforms by accepting these changes.  Mainly I wonder if these kinds of
changes are appropriate so close to the official release; while they
certainly improve the robustness on platforms that support these items I
wonder if we have enough time and testing left to ensure there won't be
problems.

What I'd like to see is someone go take a look at how signals are
handled in other very portable GNU apps; that's how I usually tell
what's portable and what isn't.  There may be configure-time switching
or something that can be done to get decent behavior both on POSIX and
non-POSIX systems.

Also, I think I see from your patches how you intend this to work, but
I'd really appreciate a writeup from you on the details so we can all
take a look; this may well get folded into the HTML docs for module
developers, if we come up with a standard, portable, robust way to deal
with these issues.

Or, it might be better to create some libfvwm functions to handle this.
Other thoughts?

I should mean that there is a check (and truncating) just below this line,
I thought that this would limit the number of checks that have to be done
later on, to make it stable agains overly huge numbers. But feel free to
remove it, or change it to 20 or something and see if it works...

It draws a one pixel line inside the right relief with the background
color, to cut off any text that extents over buttons limits, to make an
more even inside margin, and so it doesn't look as if the text is going of
the side og the button (even if it does).

I looked at menu.c i fvwm, and it also looks like the two-pixel margins on
this menu also are hardcoded in here, i wonder if something like this
could be useable in this general menu stuff? Maybe i'll take a shot at it.

This would be very useful.  There are umpteen places where buttons are drawn and a library function
would make the look consistent. Just off the top of my head:

typedef struct Button {
  unsigned int width;
  unsigned int height;
  unsigned int padding;
  int frame; (<0 means pressed in like FvwmButtons)
  char *text;
  int hot_key; (which one to underline, -1 means none)
  MyFont *font;
  ColorPair colors;
  something justification; (left, right, centre)
  Bool truncate_left;
#ifdef MINI_ICONS (copied from fvwm.h)
  int mini_icon_width (for lining up text, clip the mini_icon to this)
  char *mini_pixmap_file;
  Picture *mini_icon;
#endif
#ifdef XPM
  Pixmap background;
#endif
} Button;

void EstimateButtonSize(Display, Button *button); /* sets width and height */
void DrawButton(Display, Window, x, y, Button *button);

I stuck the mini_icon_width in so that the text in buttons could be lined up even if the mini_icons
have different widths.

Would this be useful?  There are lots of places that buttons get drawn (menus, titlebar, title
buttons, FvwmWinList, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmForm, FvwmWharf, FvwmButtons).  Is a structure
like the above too much bloat? I'm not intending on programs mallocing one of these per button, more
like just one and change the text pointer before each call to DrawButton.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think it's best to ignore the patch. We can leave it to the user to decide on
how to do wrapping.

Duh, I've to wave the white flag. I'm hopelessly overcommitted.
Best you do what Paul suggests. One thing you might want to know
that I started to rewrite the MenuStyle syntax yesterday (see recent
'SetMenuStyle' discussions).

This is the bug Red Hat found and fixed.

Can someone try and reproduce this?

It was not a security bug, it was a stupid bug where fvwm2 will completely
crash because move_window or resize_window functions can be called for an
unexisiting window. Somehow our setup triggered those before fvwm2 will
have any chance to give focus to an valid open window, causeing a
segfault.

When FvwmButtons quits, it does not kill xclipboard not xterm, but the

anymore.
Here's a part of config: (dclock and xload work without problems)

Using size in FvwmButtonsGeometry affects both actual button bar and all
panels.
Is size is respecified in panel configuration, the actual button bar is
also 
resized. For example:

*ApplButRows 1
*ApplButGeometry 170x20+600+110
*ApplButBoxSize smart
*ApplButBack SeaGreen
*ApplBut(Title 'Win Ops', Panel (down) WinOps)
*ApplButFrame 1

*ApplButPanel WinOps
*ApplButColumns 1
*ApplButBack SeaGreen
*ApplButGeometry 100x200+700+150
*ApplBut(Frame 1, Container(Frame 0, Columns 1))
*ApplBut(Title "Move", Action 'Move-or-Raise2')
*ApplBut(Title "Resize", Action 'Resize-or-Raise2')
*ApplBut(Title "Raise", Action 'Raise')
*ApplBut(Title "Lower", Action 'Lower')
*ApplBut(Title 	"Iconify", Action 'Iconify')
*ApplBut(Title "Stick", Action 'Stick')
*ApplBut(Title "Maximize", Action 'Maximize-Func')

FvwmButton panel is popped down at least when action is Exec, but not when
any(?) 
other function is called. Would be nice if it were configurable...

*ApplButRows 1
*ApplBut(Title 'Win Ops', Panel (down) WinOps)
*ApplButFrame 1

*ApplButPanel WinOps
*ApplButColumns 1
*ApplBut(Frame 1, Container(Frame 0, Columns 1))
*ApplBut(Title "Identify", Action 'Module FvwmIdent')
*ApplBut(Icon xterm.xpm, Title xterm, Action 'Exec "xterm" xterm &')
*ApplBut(End)

    Thanks for the quick follow-up. I think I see what went
wrong, and it's definitely my doing (or maybe undoing?).
I'll check in the fix this evening (I have to do it from
home). StartsOnPage has a set of tests that was blindly
copied from another section of the placement code (the
very old part!), and the test for IconicState shouldn't
have been replicated, but it was.

    Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say "it
works with the former release"? I presume you mean that
all the other placement logic worked, not StartsOnPage.
If you applied the StartsOnPage unofficial patch and
actually had it working with -iconic windows, then there
is another level to the problem that I haven't seen yet.

I'm not getting the connection between FvwmEvent and autohiding.
How would FvwmEvent hide FvwmTaskBar?

I'd like to keep autohiding working.  Would it make sense for
FvwmtaskBar to hide at a size of PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS+1 (3 pixels)?

If people don't like it 3 pixels high, maybe we might find a patch
to make it transparent.

Hi folks,

I have wished to implement this for a long time. Why don't we put those
Pan Frames between ONTOP windows and the rest. Hence, if users want to edge
scroll, just drag mouse to the edge as usual but not on the top of a
StaysOnTop window. Furthermore, FvwmTaskBar can work as long as set the
StaysOnTop attribute. Patch is at the end of this email. Thanks.

Someone has already suggested checking out the SAMBA source. But if
there is a way to move forwards with POSIX.1 I'd like to pursue that -
if the UNIXes in question are REALLY old (read: broken) then trying to
get everything robust and signal-safe is likely a dead horse.

Actually, a change-of-direction is in order, which will help make
everything more portable into the bargain (isn't that nice?). There's
a catch, of course.

Detailed study of my UNIX reference and the HP-UX man pages pointed
out that siglongjump() DOESN'T solve the reentrancy problem unless you
KNOW that nothing non-reentrant has been called between the
sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp() calls. Doh! So it's time for Plan B:

static void DeadPipeHandler(int sig)
{
  isTerminated = True;
}

and then rewrite the main event loop to:

while ( !isTerminated ) { ... }

rather than:

while (1) { ...}

This works and is portable, BUT means that you must check the return
code from EVERY system call such as "select", and anything which could
block, so that you can provide a fast-track exit the moment
isTerminated becomes True. There are several places in the code where
people have assumed that select() with an indefinite time-out will
never fail.

I have mapped out a (POSIX.1 unfortunately) wrapper strategy for
potentially-blocking such that you can ATOMICALLY perform the
following:

if ( !isTerminated ) select();

I tested it this afternoon by putting "raise(SIGUSR1)" lines
everywhere and it survived so I'm reasonably confident. Of course,
this bulletproof(?) wrapper stuff is way too late for 2.2, but I think
that the basic "isTerminated = True" signal handlers will prove
reliable enough for now.

Comments anyone,
Cheers,
Chris.

My fault. Since I won't be committing anything for the next

Since this is becoming a protability issue, Paul (PDS), would
you take care of applying new or backing out old patches?
I've applied four of the five signal handler patches from
Chris except the one to FvwmIconMan.

I can't help here much with details, but in general my opinio is:
I am willing to risk breaking some setups even so close to a release
(looking at Jitterbug and the to do list the release is probably
farther away than we hoped). But in the end I think aven old systems
should run. That's what autoconf is good for, isn't it.

P.S.: I'll be busy with the MenuStyle rewrite in the next few
days, so if someone else would take on apllying patches/bugfixed
I will be grateful.

Well, perhaps we can help each other. Can you identify what fvwm2
does not do but is required by gnome?

I've been playing about with FvwmWinList (in hopes of trying to understand
the code better :-) but I'm unable to get MINI_ICONS to work.

I have:

 1. checked that MINI_ICONS are defined
    - I added a printf in a "#ifdef MINI_ICONS" section that shows-up
 2. I've stripped down my .fvwm2rc file to the bare essentials
 3. I've included the necessary "style" MiniIcon statement
 4. I've checked that the mini-icon can be found and displayed (as a
    normal icon)
 5. yes, I do a restart after every change :^)

and yet there are no Mini-Icons in the WinList.  Am I not setting something ?
In other words, is there a global Mini-Icon on/off option that I am unaware
of (do I have to face South-East and wink twice :-) ??

BTW: I have been able to get mini-icons to work with Mike.Han's setup
     (thanks again mike), but with my own setup - no dice; mike's setup
     is a bit too complex to debug on a per-statement basis.

Here is the my stippled-down .fvwm2rc file (with which MINI_ICONS don't work)

Could someone else verify that MINI_ICONS don't work for them as well,
with the minimal setup below, so that I could enter a "true" bug report to
Jitterbug..

Thanks

 - Nadim (please cc me)

Jui-Hsuan Feng's approach seems like a likely candidate.
Rather than just change the pan frames back and break
autohide, I'll check it out.  Tim, you've been in this one
before, perhaps you want it?

Hi,
I removed the non-local jumps from the signal handling and returned to
setting an atomic "isTerminated" flag. Research has indicated that
siglongjmp is probably no more reentrant than the original code (Doh!).
This new approach is DEFINITELY reentrant and is probably universally
portable since it doesn't do much. Assignments to sig_atomic_t variables
are by definition atomic so synchronisation isn't an issue; the use of
"volatile" storage tells the compiler that the variable's value is
likely to change in mysterious and unpredicable ways and so it shouldn't
try to cache its value in a register. The only thing left is making sure
that a process doesn't "stick" while trying to terminate.

Cheers,
Chris.

PS I updated my copy of fvwm from cvs and the new version failed to
spawn any modules (BEFORE I started fiddling tonight, I might add ;-) )
Does anyone have any idea what's changed?

Subject: [PATCH] rebound after draging a window to edges

Hi folks,

When driging a window to the right edge or bottom edge, it will rebound by
16 pixels, but not on the left or top edges. Here is the patch to change
this behavior. Since I don't know the reason to keep them there, so I just
commented out those lines. Think about this situation: drag a window such
that the top part of the window is out of the display, then 'shade' it.
It's gone! Except for restarting fvwm2, there seems no way to call it back.
Hope some wizard can modify 'WindowList' feature to drag those out of
display windows back (I haven't figure out how :( ).

Regards

I just built a 2.1.6 version from CVS.  I'm still having a
problem with a particular mouse binding in my config and it has
been like that since 2.1.4 when I started beta testing the 2.1
series.

----- begin excerpt of fvwm2rc

AddToFunc MoveOrShade
+       "M" Move
+       "D" WindowShade

AddToFunc Anchor
+       "I" Move 0p 0p

Mouse 0  T N Function MoveOrShade
Mouse 0  T M Function Anchor

----- end excerpt of fvwm2rc

The second binding doesn't seem to work...  When I do try
Alt-clicking the title-bar I am put into Resize mode.

I don't know if this is related to bug #54 in the Bug-tracking
system but it might be.

Also, I just noticed that my root menu requires a relatively long
hold time (about a half second) on a menu item before it'll work.
Don't know what is going on with that; anyone else see this?
Title-bar buttons seem to work fine with a short click.

Thanks,
- Kent

	I don't think this is a good idea. At the very least, users
(particularly me) need a way to disable the new behavior.

	My objection is that Jui-Hsuan Feng's approach breaks core
functionality for the sake of an optional module from the extras
directory. I haven't experienced any problems with the 1-pixel pan
frames, but obviously some people do, so we have to fix that; but
but giving StaysOnTop windows precedence over edge scrolling is
worse than the original autohide problem, IMO. I think this one needs
a little more thought, once we're out from under the pressure of
an impending release.

	In my setup, I use edge scrolling constantly. I have my
mouse sensitivity set so that I can move at a pretty brisk clip,
and I can move from one end of my 4 x 4 virtual desktop to the other
with a quick flick of the wrist and not run off the edge of the
mouse pad. Having some intervening StaysOnTop window interfere with
this would be constantly infuriating.

	For this release, could we maybe hack in a config option so one
could set the pan fram width to either the new or the old value? Then
we can study the matter at greater leisure. Perhaps for the long term
solution we would want a new command to change the pan frame width on
the fly, or even a modification of Jui-Hsuan's patch that adds the
ability to enable/disable this behavior (with a run-time command, not
a config opt).

	Well, I have updated through the CVS, and oh surprise! it
doesn't work well for me... it is something strange, the default menu
"visual_style" width is not the correct one, I think it has something
to do with my own patch, but when I submitted it it works so it may
also be due to a conflict between my patch and another one. It is
totally reproducable, you just use a default style with SetMenuStyle
and thats all. is it and already known bug?

	Another thing is that it seems that we go no further in setting
a new syntax for the SetMenuStyle, I mean when my mainboard go to sleep
we were talking about "Stylefying" the SetMenuStyle, so we could use
something like

SetMenuStyle "*"	FgColor <fg_color>, BgColor <bg_color>, \
			Font <font>, MenuFace <menuface>, ....

	Any other suggestions?

	And finally I have a suggestion, what about adding something like
StyleByTitle (or StyleT or whatever you want to call it) which should
be identical to Style but it would select windows by their titles, I
mean for example you could have an xterm with name xterm but with title
"Pine", I know you could change its name to, but what about other apps
like that set the same name for a whole range of child windows that by
other hand have different titles?

Did anyone ever notice that none of the colours fvwm
allocates are ever freed again? E.g. when you experiment
with colour gradients you may run out of colours very
soon. I think it it necessary to call XFreeColor for
every every successful call to XAllocColor.

That might explain why xscreensaver:kaleidescope looks so DULL on the
root window but is very impressive in a normal window. It was even
worse under fvwm - none of the screensaver hacks looked good.

Bob, you are making a lot of good points.

Expect a patch along those lines shortly.

Your point about an optional module from the extras directory seems to
be especially well taken.  I'll have to check Jitterbug, but we should
have a load of bug reports on this module.  I managed  get a core file
from this module  quite quickly, it won't   pop down when a  window is
near it,  and it doesn't  seem to reflect  window state  until it gets
focus, and so  far I haven't figured  out why  some buttons have  tool
tips and others don't.

To be fair, I'm not done verifying these problems.

Any thoughts about how this new command:

PanFrameThickness [0-2]

is going to impact future development.   It does seem to interact with
things that want to autohide, or stay on top.  It looks like a working
autohide  module  would   need  to    query  fvwm2 for    the  current
panframethickness setting.

My first inclination is to limit it to 0, 1, or 2 so we have something
to work with.

I think Dominik came to the conclusion a few days ago, that we have
to do this for the 2.2 release.  At last report he is doing that
now.

Thats been proposed for the style command a while  back, we even had a
pretty good proposal for the syntax.  The  thread was "Style Matching"
as I  remember.   Of coure it   wouldn't  be just a   match on "Title"
("Name" in FvwmIdentify), but also IconName, Class and Resource.

I  believe once a color  is used in a  pixmap, it  stays allocated.  I
have the logic  to free the  colors in an  xpm, the xpm library  won't
free it itself.  I was planning to check this out after 2.2.

If you have 8 bit color,  I think gradients are  out.  I don't believe
fvwm2 gradients are ever dithered, which would help with color use.

For pixmaps, the ColorLimit feature gives me a good solution, but some
color freeing couldn't hurt.

The best solution for this is to allow Xscreensaver to install its own
colormap.  Fvwm2 doesn't currently allow  this.  There is a bug report
for this, and lots of discussion in the archives.

Where is the problem about this? The bug you describe has nothing
to do with the bouncing, does it? And I don't see a way how you
could drag a window completely off the screen.

I have a general question about the new MenuStyle syntax.
When I'm done reworking the code there will be some
substantial changes in the logic behind menus and some
other things (Move/Resize feedback window is one of them).
We won't get exactly the same behaviour as before. So there
are two possibilities:

1) Try to keep the old MenuStyle syntax (I mean the one
   before German's patches).

2) Throw away the old syntax and make the new one the
   standard.

Personally I vote for 2) since the new syntax is slightly
incompatible to the old one anyway (to the better, of course).

Comments?

If you don't tell me what's wrong with the menu I can't say if it is
a bug. What did happen is that there is no 'next' style anymore.

That's what I'm doing in the next days. You should really read
the threads about SetMenuStyle (last week) to get up to date.

Um, doesn't 'Style' already do this exactly?

I fully agree to Bob's opinion. Yes, autohiding is broken and needs
a better solution, but I see no need to break EdgeScrolling instead
just to have a quick but dirty fix. We need a clean solution finally,
but surely not before 2.2. If someone is willing to do the work we
might put in a temporary configure option '--enable-autohide-hack'
to have both.

Ah, Bob and I seem to think similarly ;-)

Two things to consider:

1) How about making all this FVWM/MWM/WIN-like behaviour
   global options to remove the dependencies with the menu
   code? (e.g. EmulateMWM, EmulateWin (blarg), EmulateFvwm).

2) I'd like to establish a new command 'GlobalStyle' for two
   reasons:
   a) The naming is more conststent with the other Style commands
   b) It can take all the stuff from GlobalOpts that will stay
      the way it is. GlobalOpts will be the testing area in the
      future and GlobalStyle gets the final commands.

If we agree on both I'll put the Emulate... styles in the
GlobalStyle command.

Bye

On line 719 of menus.c we have:

if(((x_root-x_init > 3)||(x_init-x_root > 3))&&
           ((y_root-y_init > 3)||(y_init-y_root > 3)))

While this is indeed what 2.0.46 has (roughly) it induces an annoying 
bug in 2.1.x due to the more complex menu code.  The && means that the mouse
has to move 3 in both axis to be considered 'moved'.  For those of us with
small screens a rather 'straight' pull down (little or no X motion) is common
and results in the menu item not working.

This line should probably changed to using an || as in:

if(((x_root-x_init > 3)||(x_init-x_root > 3))||
           ((y_root-y_init > 3)||(y_init-y_root > 3)))

This patch against fvwm/placement.c separates the two "smart placement"
functions into their own routines, and then turns SmartPlacement() into
a switching function between them. This strikes me as better than having
CleverPlacement() parasitically embedded within SmartPlacement().
Functionality is not affected.

BTW the defaults for Window Placement seem to be Random/Smart, which is
different than for fvwm (v1). Is this documented, 'cos it threw me for a
while.

Hi folks,

I found my last patch for EdgeScroll does not totally behave what I want,
probably because I use AutoRaise and SloppyFocus (it will be a little
different if other Focus style is used). I forgot to change those lines
where PanFrame will be raised after switching to a new desktop. This patch
will (hopefully) correct it.

Since I don't have the previledge to commit patches, if somebody there has and
check if it works ok, hope this patch can be applied. Thanks.

I have tried the FvwmTaskBar module with PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS 2, no problems.

	I also vote for 2), so people installing it by first time
don't start complaining about something wrong.
	And also I would like to know how you are implementing it, I
would like to help on it, because menu handling is the only thing of fvwm I 
understand (well, or so I think :-)

You must have missed some  mail on the workers  list.  There were some
objections  raised to EdgeScrolling  not  working when  a stays on top
window gets in the way.

You are welcome to find the mail in question (from Bob) and refute any
arguments you feel are incorrect.

For now, the "fix" is a new command "EdgeThickness 0|1|2".

My understanding is that the "MenuStyle" command configures the
default menu, and retains its original syntax compatibility.

A new command "SetMenuStyle" is being changed to a new syntax
and doesn't need to retain its old syntax.

I'm not  sure   we need a  "GlobalOpts"   command  or a  "GlobalStyle"
command.  We  have lots of "Global" commands  that stand on their own.
For example, we don't have "GlobalOpts EdgeThickness 1".

Its my understanding, all the "GlobalOpts" commands will go away
when they are made part of the "Style" command.

You are right. I'll fix it.

The reason why I'd want to throw away the old MenuStyle command
is because it has a totally different kind of syntax. My approach
is to make the fvwm/win/mwm style some kind of 'macro' that
enforces a bunch of options you can configure anyway. There
is only one chance to consolidate the MenuStyle syntax issue
and that is before 2.2. Although it wouldn't cost me much time
to rewrite the old MenuStyle command to work with the new one
I still think it might be better to get rid of it. Any other
comments?

Hmm, how would you implement these as a style:

SmartPlacementIsReallySmart
SmartPlacementIsNormal
CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage

There's stuff in GlobalOpts that can't be made a style.
We need a solution for these commands too. I just thought
GlobalStyle would be a good idea for assorted options
that can only be switched on or off (this saves a bit of code).
I can't put my finger on it, but I feel things like 'EmulateMWM'
should be handled more like a 'Style'. This is a different
quality than AddToMenu, ClickTime or DeskTopSize, isn't it?

Well, I see that this isn't very consistent with some
other commands. What do you (all) think?

       Do you mean 'dragging' or 'bringing'?

Where is the problem about this? The bug you describe has nothing
to do with the bouncing, does it? And I don't see a way how you
could drag a window completely off the screen.

---------------------------------------------

The bouncing is 'fixed' in that patch. I brought about another issue
in my previous email (sorry about the confusion). To see how it goes,
suppose there is a menu in .fvwm2rc

AddToMenu Window-Ops  "Window Ops"  Title
+  "Move"         Move
+  "Resize"       Resize
+  "Raise"        Raise
+  "Lower"        Lower
+  "(Un)Shade"    WindowShade
+  "(De)Iconify"  Iconify
+  "(Un)Stick"    Stick
+  "(Un)Maximize" Maximize
+  ""             Nop
+  "Delete"       Delete
+  "Close"        Close
+  "Destroy"      Destroy
+  ""             Nop
+  "Refresh Win"  RefreshWindow

Then I drag an application windom by its border so that the title bar is out
of screen. Then use 'WindowShade' of the above menu to shade that application
window (I know that probably only insane people would do this), then it's
gone. I think it might be a good idea using 'WindowsList' (or not-preferable
WinList module) to drag thoes stray windows back to screen.

Well, maybe not.  I just uploaded functions.c where I made a mistake
that would cause a run-time error.

(Someone take my keyboard away.)

Looks to me like a change I made in misc.h is affecting you.

I put in a #DEFINE F_CMD_ARGS for all the fuctions in the command
table.  Does that name conflict with something?

I just checked my typical users  config files, and for  me its a small
managable perl or awk problem.  I'll let someone else answer.

Not sure, but if they aren't style options, then
they would have more correctly been:

StartsOnPage Capture Ignore, Recapture Honor

or some other scheme without the word "Global" in there.
To me, "global" was meant to be the opposite of "Style per
window".

Parsing args and commands should take about the same time,
and code...I wonder?

Dan, it seems that you forgot to put 'EdgeThickness'
at the right place in the alphabetical list in
functions.c.

My other problem is resolved now. Something went
awry while merging misc.h with my version
(probably my fault).

You're a bit late if you want to help implementing (it's nearly
ready), but there is a good deal of debugging to be done. Sorry,
I can't say much right now.

I have the new MenuStyle syntax almost in place now.
One topic remains however: combining color gradients
with any hilighting style does not work because
drawing a menu item overwrites the gradient. Any
ideas how I could solve this? Redrawing the gradient
for every change of the hilighted item is no soultion.
Could I copy the menu item graphics into a memory area
and restore it when it is unhilighted? How colud this
be done?

Bye

Yes, I see that you 'fixed' that, but my question was why
you consider this a bug. I think that was done to prevent
exactly what you describe: losing a window off-screen.
So the window is bounced back a few pixels.

Would it be possible to add an option to either SnapGrid or SnapAttraction that
would close to a window with a specified amount of padding in pixels. Like:

SnapPadding 2

would put the window 2 pixels away from surrounding windows rather than right
next to the border.

Both the man page for fvwm2 and all documentation I know about
 refers all configuration issues to a file such as .fvwm2rc or
/usr/lib/X11/f2wm/system.fvwm2rc or something of the sort.  However,
none of the many files with similar (or the same) names will let you
add a new application to the Win95-looking version which Red Hat makes
it's default X configuration.  But it takes *hours* to find this out!
In order to add menu items, you have to insert a file in 
/etc/X11/wmconfig/--each file makes a single menu item.  Once you have
found
the directory, it is pretty clear how to make the new file by examples
already
there.  Perhaps the docuentation could point to this place directly?

	That was one of the reasons because I use only font highlighting
with gradients, but if anybody agrees in the extra use of memory I think
a fast solution should be to create a xpm dinamically and store it as it
is done with normal xpms, it should be create the first time you popup a
menu (not as initialization stuff) and we should add it should be updated
every time you add or remove something to the menu. In this way gradients
should be FAST, but mem usage should increase (though not too much if you
don't have a thousand menus :-)

	What about my last "bug report", it is normal than I get only the

It would be nice if there was a way to stop the panframes eating events,
the above functions don't work all that well with panframes.

I think the issue may be the number of pixel that the window is brought
back.
16 seems like a large number, 1 may be better.  I can't remember if
there is a similar limit on moving windows off the left or top.

It is possible to try to move windows completely off screen: either type
Move +0 +1023 in an FvwmConsole and forget to put the p on the end of
the number to specify pixels and the window has gone 10 screens away! 
Sloppy/Click Focus windows can be moved with the mouse outside the
window frame which lets you put the window off screen.

It's not difficult to get windows back. You can change the default
WindowList function to move the window to 0 0, or if you know the name
you can use FvwmConsole or FvwmCommand or something similar to do a Next
[<name>] Move 0 0.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hmm, semms to be a lot of overhead. In the end it is always only a
single menu item that has to be stored. No need to allocate memory
for every item in every menu then. We really could get away
with storing the repainted area, couldn't we? Although that
would make the logic in the code more complicated.

No, definitely not normal or else I would have seen it. Anyway,
it's not worth any effort for debugging since the visual_style
bit will be gone very soon.

Huh?, I'm confused.  What do you mean fvwm2 doesn't allow this?  If it
didn't allow it then I would even bother with xscreensaver, or anything
else that uses a private colormap either.  I only have an 8 bit display,
and quickly use my 256 colors, but I always get a private map when
xscreensaver starts.  I have heard this complaint before about
xscreensaver not installing a private map, but I either don't understand
the problem, or have a unique X server (using Xsun server with solaris
2.5.1 and 2.6).

Dominik you really need to get those X books I suggested. Without looking
at the code I'm assuming you knoe what the rectangle the relevent menu
item is in.  Given that you want 
XGetImage(...);
Do highlight stuff
XPutImage(...);

The first X call will grab a specified rectangle within a drawable and
store it in an XImage struct
The XPut will put the XImage back overwriting the highlight you just made.

Same server as me.

You would see the symptom as strange colors while xscreensaver runs.
Since most xscreensaver hacks are strange anyway, maybe you aren't
noticing?

I commonly see the hacks running with white, or unusual color backgrounds.
Most of the hacks are supposed to run on black backgrounds.

Using the supplied config file, I was able to reproduce the problem.

Thinking along the same lines as you, I put a  mini-icon in a menu and
WAS able to see it.

Other things came up, and so far, I  haven't closed the whole path, so
I don't know yet where the mini-icons and FvwmWinList part company.

Of course "adding menu items" is documented.

So are FvwmM4, FvwmCPP,  and other fvwm2  command line arguments  that
would cause fvwm2 to read configuration files from other sources.

Surely you don't expect  fvwm2 to document  the way Redhat  configures
fvwm2?

Please file this bug report with Red Hat.

I tried Nadim's .fvwm2rc file and couldn't see the problem.  I don't
have a mini-xterm.xpm so using that as the mini-icons gave me a WinList
with no mini-icon and the labels centred. I changed the mini-icon to
mini-icons.xpm and WinList found it and displayed it.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well, I think you put your finger on the problem.

There is no mini-xterm.xpm.
I believe Nadim wanted mini.xterm.xpm.

OK, now  I see a  connection, but I thought we  were on  the thread of
making FvwmTaskBar unhide  when it was covered   by the pan frame?   I
don't think  there  would be any   focus event in FvwmTaskBar  in this
case.

You're right, the FvwmEvent method of AutoHiding also has trouble with
the pan frames but I think fixing the FvwmEvent method would be more
useful than just fixing FvwmTaskBar.  It may be easier to fix too
because the focus change event is triggered from the focus change
module-message from fvwm and since fvwm knows when the mouse has entered
a pan frame and it knows the size, visibility and stacking order of all
the windows it may be able to send a fake focus change message.  Or it
may be possible to do a real focus change by calculation which would fix
the problem of mouse clicks in the pan frame going to the root.

Cheers,
Tim.

FvwmTaskBar sees the same events  that FvwmEvent does, assuming it has
set its message mask for the events it wants.

I have been thinking along the same lines  about panframe events being
passed around for other modules  to work with.   I believe modules can
see enter notify events in the pan frames,  they just don't know which
window the pan frame is.

I  suppose a module  could compare  its  own location  to each windows
location, and know that when  a window  is  entered that obscures  the
task bar,  it is time to raise  the task bar.  It  might make sense to
only do that for   windows that have  the  unique geometry of the  pan
frames.

I've got the same problem with some of the xscreensaver modes
(they just fail) and some demos like xtacy.

I ordered them but they won't be delivered until early January.
In the meantime I have to ask questions on the list.

Yup, that's what I was looking for. Thanks, Brad.

Just to let you know my comment was not intended harshly, more as a
reminder.  You will see when you start going through the commands laid out
in vol2 that much of the Xlib function are rather intuitive once you learn
how to look for them.  I have no problem with you asking questions, if I
did I wouldn't have given you answers.  The problem is, as you can
probably tell, knowing what you want to accomplish with Xlib and knowing
how to verbaly describe it are 2 very different animals. 

So ask away I'll always try to answer.  And congratulations on making a
good purchase towards your education.

Brad

My current version of FVWM is up to date with CVS as of this
morning.  I wondering if someone could verify a problem that I'm
having.

Add the following menu to your config

AddToMenu test "window list" WindowList

and bind it to a button

Mouse 3 R A Popup test

Then try clicking that mouse button in the root menu and release
the button before about a half second.  The WindowList will not
appear.  There seems to be a minimum amount of time that the menu
has to be mapped before any of the elements will do anything.  My
root menu is setup so that I can do things really quickly, but
version 2.1.x has this delay.  Is this something that was
intended or a bug?

Thanks,
- Kent

Now that I can reproduce this, it looks like  more of a feature than a
problem.

I assume  the reason you  have "WindowList" in  a menu, rather than on
Mouse 3 as a command,  is you have  other things in  the menu that you
can  get to  thru mouse  motion,  but a  simple  click/release is  for
WindowList.

If thats the case,  I would guess that  you wouldn't try this when the
pointer is near the bottom of the screen?

It doesn't look to  me like  "ClickTime"  or "SetMenuDelay"  help with
this.  Maybe someone that  knows the new menu  code better  has deeper
insight.

	Well, I think is more overhead allocating the mem every time you
highlight and item :-), I don't thing allocating pixmaps background for 
every menu is an overhead, unless you have lots of menus. I remember that
it was not to overhelming and it was really fast. What about a compile time
option like MEMORY_OPTIMIZE or SPEED_OPTIMIZE, I'm sure that gradients are
not the only thing should benify from such an option. What do you think?

PS: Of course I suppose you would not allocate the memory every time you 
highlight and item...

I was experimenting with an FvwmButtons line
when I got a coredump:

*FvwmButtons(3x2+12+3, Icon my_errors.xpm, \
Action (Mouse 1) 'Function RunXMessages', \
Action (Mouse 2) `Style \\"XMessages\\" Sticky`, \
Action (Mouse 2) `Style \\"XMessages\\" Slippery`)


(The backslashes are there for readability only.
In my .fvwm2rc it's one line).

I know that this line is badly broken. What
happens is: when I press button 3 over this
item, FvwmIconMan coredumps with this message:

-------------------------------------------------------

FvwmIconMan: X Error:

The new signal handling stuff doesn't prevent that

Sorry, I take everything back. I can see it too. At the beginning
of menus.c (MenuInteraction) there's a line:

      usleep(MICRO_S_FOR_10MS);

with MICRO_S_FOR_10MS defines as:

      #define MICRO_S_FOR_10MS 10000

This looks right to me but obviously it does not work
as expected. Ore are we doing so much unnecessary stuff
above that?

This is moot since there will be no more SetMenuDelay command when I've
checked in. It's a menu style now (PopupDelay).

No offense taken. I was looking for some good books on X for a while

Exactly.

The delay also causes problems when I'm selecting an item very
close to the top of the menu.  My first menu item is WindowList
and the second is rxvt.  Very often I have to slowly reselect
rxvt because I did it too fast the first time.

+----------

That works too because the mouse is warped to the top of the menu.

Thanks for verifying the behavior.  I was confused because this
"feature" showed up in the 2.1.x series.  It is not there in
2.0.46.  Now the question is... is this a "feature" or a bug?

Thanks,
- Kent

Sorry to take so long to reply.  I still have problems, specifically
with the search/find dialog box of dtpad.  Dtpad may be doing something
funny since it uses its top level windows as a cache. I'll look at it in
the new year.

Cheers,
Tim.

  I'm /really/ struggling to make configure acknowledge the presence of
libXpm.a!

  I'm doing:

configure  \
   --prefix=$HOME/opt/fvwm2  \
   --with-xpm-library=$HOME/usr/lib/libXpm.a  \
   --with-xpm-includes=$HOME/usr/include  \
   --with-rplay-library=$HOME/usr/lib/librplay.a  \
   --with-rplay-includes=$HOME/usr/include  \
   --enable-extras

    [I tried "usr/lib" /and/ "usr/lib/libXpm.a"]


  ... and at the relevant part, I get:

checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm... (cached) yes
checking for X11/xpm.h... (cached) no
configure: warning: Requested xpm library not found!
checking for rplay_create in -lrplay... (cached) no
configure: warning: Requested rplay library not found!


  ... and a non-finctional PixmapPath :-(  I *do* have files
$HOME/usr/include/X11/xpm.h & $HOME/usr/lib/libXpm.a

There was the message I was waiting for.  
Do a rm config.cache 

Configure caches information it finds so it can run faster next time so
what the (cached) string is telling you is that for that value configure
is using the one in its cache.

If someone has the time could they please make a short

that's not? I was just wondering if most important/noticable
stuff is working; E is way too slow and FVWM themes are cooler,
so i'd like to switch ;-)

I've looked at the Gnome pages a couple of times and gotten
nowhere.

Why don't you install fvwm2 and tell us what is missing?

The basic premise is that in order to perform certain functions, the set of
wm-hints that apps can pass on to the WM must be extended.  Both KDE and
Gnome work this way, although Gnome does not _require_ any special
functionality at all and so the correct answer is that FVWM is absolutely,
completely, 100% Gnome-compliant.  Lots of people use Gnome and FVWM.

The main Gnome extensions relate to icons and to virtual desktops; Gnome
has its own pager module.  I don't know anything about KDE, but finally a
window manager other than the one KDE ships has a but of support for the
extended hint set.  (That would be BlackBox.  It seems like writing WMs is
the new fad.)

The Gnome folks have published a spec defining their hints; it is unclear
and badly written.  Maciej (scwm guy) has posed some questions to the folks
who wrote the spec but I never saw any response.  I don't think it's really
worth working on (except superficially) until someone clarifies it.

I believe it is important for FVWM to support these things, as it's
necessary to have a portable, stable lightweight solution that people are
familiar with.  Of course, I'm not writing the code, so who am I to talk?
I'm pretty sure that without this support no Linux distro is going to ship
FVWM by default.

Well, I can't let this one go by without comment...

Who are you to talk?  Thats a good question.

If   I'm not  mistaken,  you've been  helping  the  fvwm  effort since
September 1995.   Perhaps longer, thats  just  the earliest  record  I
have.  Its not just the code writers that keep fvwm going.

I'm glad you came to the same conclusion about the Gnome/KDE stuff not
being  clear.  I wasn't  sure if I was missing  something.  I think it
could be important, but I am less sure, since I don't know what it is.

I just  took a look at  Blackbox.   I'm not  saying  this is all thats
needed, but this appears  to be part of  the picture.  This first part
can be compared to similar code in fvwm2:

  xa_wm_colormap_windows =
    XInternAtom(display, "WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS", False);
  xa_wm_protocols = XInternAtom(display, "WM_PROTOCOLS", False);
  xa_wm_state = XInternAtom(display, "WM_STATE", False);
  xa_wm_change_state = XInternAtom(display, "WM_CHANGE_STATE", False);
  xa_wm_delete_window = XInternAtom(display, "WM_DELETE_WINDOW", False);
  xa_wm_take_focus = XInternAtom(display, "WM_TAKE_FOCUS", False);
  motif_wm_hints = XInternAtom(display, "_MOTIF_WM_HINTS", False);

Then it goes on to KDE:

#ifdef    KDE
  kwm_current_desktop = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_CURRENT_DESKTOP", False);
  kwm_number_of_desktops =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS", False);
  kwm_active_window = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_ACTIVE_WINDOW", False);
  kwm_win_iconified = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_ICONIFIED", False);
  kwm_win_sticky = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_STICKY", False);
  kwm_win_maximized = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_MAXIMIZED", False);
  kwm_win_decoration = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_DECORATION", False);
  kwm_win_icon = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_ICON", False);
  kwm_win_desktop = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_DESKTOP", False);
  kwm_win_frame_geometry =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WIN_FRAME_GEOMETRY", False);
     
  kwm_command = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_COMMAND", False);
  kwm_do_not_manage = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_DO_NOT_MANAGE", False);
  kwm_activate_window =
     XInternAtom(display, "KWM_ACTIVATE_WINDOW", False);

  kwm_running = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_RUNNING", False);
  kwm_module = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE", False);
  kwm_module_init = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_INIT", False);
  kwm_module_initialized =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_INITIALIZED", False);
  kwm_module_desktop_change =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_DESKTOP_CHANGE", False);
  kwm_module_win_change = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_WIN_CHANGE", False);
  kwm_module_desktop_name_change =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_DESKTOP_NAME_CHANGE", False);
  kwm_module_desktop_number_change =
    XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_DESKTOP_NUMBER_CHANGE", False);
  kwm_module_win_add = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_WIN_ADD", False);
  kwm_module_win_remove = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE_WIN_REMOVE", False);

  kwm_window_region_1 = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_WINDOW_REGION_1", False);
#endif // KDE

Then it goes on to "Gnome", but its commented out:

  /* unsupported GNOME hints

     win_supporting_wm_check = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_PROTOCOLS", False);
     win_layer = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_LAYER", False);
     win_state = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_STATE", False);
     win_hints = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_HINTS", False);
     win_app_state = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_APP_STATE", False);
     win_expanded_size = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE", False);
     win_icons = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_ICONS", False);
     win_workspace = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_WORKSPACE", False);
     win_workspace_count = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT", False);
     win_workspace_names = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES", False);
     win_client_list = XInternAtom(display, "_WIN_CLIENT_LIST", False);
  */
  

At least, now I have some hint...

There's a new option to SetMenuStyle:

  DoubleClickTime

This sets the doubleclick time in menus independently
of the ClickTime setting. Defaults to 3*ClickTime as
is was before.

Sorry, I take everything back. I can see it too. At the beginning
of menus.c (MenuInteraction) there's a line:

      usleep(MICRO_S_FOR_10MS);

with MICRO_S_FOR_10MS defines as:

      #define MICRO_S_FOR_10MS 10000

This looks right to me but obviously it does not work
as expected. Ore are we doing so much unnecessary stuff
above that?

Bye

	Just that, I have downloaded the lastes changes from the CVS tree 
and I have to say that Dominik has made a great work with the new 
SetMenuStyle, if we keep fvwm development at this rate it will be the 
best windowmanager under the sun (IMHO of course :-).
	The problem I have has been resolved, so no more on it.
	I also have a suggestion (well maybe I do it myself tomorrow)
what about regular expresion matching on the ChangeMenuStyle ? 

	And finally... soon I will make available a complete distribution
of fvwm2-(last CVS) + icons + .fvwm2rc + some wmapps that should serve as
an intro to fvwm2 wondwerfull world :-)

	I repeat it...

	Great work Dominik, you deserve all the confidence we put on you!

Ah, that is not the same problem. What I was talking about
is that on my system sub-menus take about twice as long
to pop up as I told them.

ANy ideas?

Thanks for the confidence. I'm so embarrassed for all this praise.
But don't hide your light under a bushel. I did no more than
rewriting the syntax. You are the one who did the real work.

Isn't it already :) ? I have to confess that I'm nearly burnt
out. In the last months I've spent almost my whole leisure time
on fvwm development (and my cats don't like that a bit :( ).
And the to-do list is growing longer and longer. I may have to
take a few weeks off soon.

You mean the menu width problem?

Hmm, not a bad idea. As a shell freak (zsh forever :) ) I'd like
to see more consistent parsing (quoting!) anyway. Regular expressions
could be used in many places: Styles, SetMenuStyle, Next/Prev...,
Decors and so on.

I must correct myself: it wasn't FvwmIconMan that coredumped

Escape handling seems to have changed in handling Actions in FvwmButtons.

Previously, the following worked:

  *FvwmButtons(Icon mini-mail.xpm, Action 'Exec gnudoit \(vm\)')

Now, I have to escape the back-slashes as well, as below:

  *FvwmButtons(Icon mini-mail.xpm, Action "Exec gnudoit \\(vm\\)')

Blarg, I hate this quoting stuff in FvwmButtons. When I have a lot
of time I will rewrite that so you don't havt to quote anything
(well, perhaps the whole action). There are parsing functions that
allow to consistently handle quoting.

No, they should never have required quoting. The only reason I can see
for quoting are whitespace characters in a list of tokens. Quoting should
bever be needed for the last option/parameter on a line.

Hmm, I don't think we can do much here unless one of
my fellow maintainers has access to this tool you use.
The popup is probably handled internally by the application
and without knowing what it wants fvwm to do I can't say
anything. If you can narrow down this problem I am willing
to help.

First off Dominik, nice work on the new syntax.  But might I suggest an
example or 2 in that section of the man page.  I tried using this new
syntax from the user standpoint.  Pull up man fvwm2, and started up
FvwmConsole, then I started trying to take my menu syntax and match it up. 
Total time to get it right 10 minutes.  

I think that is probably a little to much time to spend, so a few examples
might help.

Thanks for the reminder. I hacked in the manpage pretty fast
(if you see typos, please tell me) to get the stuff checked
in as soon as possible, but now I can spend a bit more time
on examples.

Hm, line 139 can't be the reason:

    }

  if((Scr.Ungrabbed != NULL)&&              <--- 139
     (Scr.Ungrabbed->flags & ClickToFocus)

Can you give me a hint how to reproduce this?

Hi Dan,

I played a little with menu item hilighting and noticed that
the hilight colour is not very good when you have a bright
green background. Try

  SetMenuStyle * HilightBack green, Hilight3Dthin

and look at a menu. The Hilight colour if bright cyan. You
can barely distinguish it from green. Any parameter in the
colour logic that can be tuned for this case?

Bye

Dominik

There is no tuning available.  If you decide to add tuning,
make sure that the same tuning value is available to modules.

I think you will see that passing the tuning value to modules
starts to get to be too big a change for 2.2.

Highlighting green is hard.  Before we changed the algorithm,
green wouldn't highlight at all.  Since green is x'00FF00',
there is no brighter green, instead, the new algorithm starts
increasing the blue and red parts.  These aren't actual numbers,
but a highlight for green might be x'33FF33'.

This might be the "bright cyan" that you report, although
"cyan" is x'00FFFF'.

It might be instructive to add some debugging  so you can see what the
inputs and outputs to the highlight code are.

	I'm currently working on a reduced version (with no so much 
features as grep regular expresions, but with more of the features 
releated to searching) I'm implementing it as a new kind of strncmp so we 
could just change the function call and get it working. I'll keep you 
informed.

Not yet, and every attempt I make to close in on it
makes it core or hang somewhere else.

Must be something in my environment.

There must be complete regexp sourcecode available somewhere.
If we can find an open source implementation (preferrably not
GPL) that might save you the effort of writing everything from
scratch.

Burn out is a serious issue.  Please only work on fvwm2 when you
are enjoying it.

My cat loves when I work on fvwm.  It is a struggle to keep her off
the keyboard...

Hey, wait, I can blame my mistakes on my cat...

I love it but I need a break soon.

Yup. I could handle one cat, but three can give you
a hard time. In fact my 'mice' are 14 and a half weeks young
and one of them is fanatically chasing my mouse pointer
while jumping up and down on the keyboard :-) Not very
nice if you're in vi.

> Hey, wait, I can blame my mistakes on my cat...

Never thought of that ;-)

Not sure what you mean here you can already use ? * for Style, Current,
Next, and Prev.  I don't think anyone would want something like
Style [a-m]win;foo   ...
Style [n-z]win;bar   ...
do you?

I get by nicelly with a 
Style "xb?f*" -- to match all my mailbox watchers.

Well if you insist on using regex why not use
regcmp  regex
they are standard c library functions 
try man -s 3c regex

I don't think that is documented, isn't it? Anyway, if it does not
cost us much, why not use the regex library. Are you sure it is
standard?

I am watching the -- but they dont move. What do you mean?
The ? and * are documented in the manpage. But I noticed
one thing:

  (from the manpage)

  windowname can be a window's name, class, or resource string.  It
  can contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which are matched in the
  usual Unix filename manner.  They are searched in the reverse    <--
  order stated, so that Style commands based on the name override  <--
  or augment those based on the class, which override or augment   <--
  those based on the resource string.

This implies that when I have these Styles:

  Style "*" Title
  Style "mutt" NoTitle

and fire up vim from mutt (this changes the title to
'Thaks for flying VIM') and then recapture, I get a
title on my mutt window because "*" matches the name
and "mutt" only matches the resource. Not very nice
(in fact I don't even have to use 'Title' since this
seems to be the default when any "*" style is defined).

I don't think you described that right, and the documentation
is a little misleading.  The resource/class/name match is
done for each style.  Then it goes on to the next style.

In your example, it should match "mutt" on resource.

Well, perhaps in theory. In reality it does happen. I do get
a title on my mutt window after a refresh. Or could vim
set the resource/class of the window too?

I do something similar to what you do above,
the windows I don't want titles on don't have titles.

Do you have more "Style xx Titles" after the one for "mutt"?
If not, the NoTitle should override, providing it matches
on name, resource OR class.

I've seen applications that can change "name" (title), and "iconname".
I don't know about class and resource.

The setting  of flags takes place in  style.c, the matching/merging of
the flags is in "add_window.c".

Well I am unfortunatelly going to have to bow out of this conversation,
but I'll give it a thread name so I can find it when I get back on the
3rd.


Back to the discussion
Dominik, keep in mind that adding regular expressions won't help with
your Style ordering matches, what we probably need there is the syntax
(I think it was Dan) suggested to designate class, resource, ...  With
that you can specify wich you want, and with GSFR we could probably handle
marking something as the overider so if you had class and title that
matched a window, styles could be merged or not, and the overider would
win on conflicts.  Explicitlly picking one is better than the stack system
we have now.

Now for regular expressions, I'm not really sure how much extra code it
would take, but for your example you said 
[Nn]etscape*  wouldn't ?etscape* work too, do you have any betscape
windows around, and if you did just add the extra betscape line.

Well there are my thoughts, so have a good holiday all, and please no more
than 500 messages between now and the 3rd.  

Brad

I'd just like to chime in that a style syntax like:
Style -class netscape
would be, to me, more useful than
Style -class /netscape/i
Especially with tk-based programs where the class and resources, and
sometimes even the title and icon strings are left as default... I've
got scads of class:Toplevel windows that I like to try to Style, but
with limited success.

I'm not following this overrider stuff at all.

Bear in mind that lots of different attributes are merged into
a structure with the last one winning.  Each style command
can have one or more attributes.  If you wanted to enter a style
command and mark it as an overrider, you would need an overrider
flag for each attribute in the command.  Then as you attempted to
merge, a particular attribute, you would have to check to see
if you already accepted that attribute with an overrider.

What I'm not following is how that would relate to GSFR at all.
To be sure you would need overrider flags for most of the style
flags, but you would also need overrider flags for everything
else style related.

So far, I'm not fond of the idea.

There's a library called pcre, which is the perl extended regexp code
pulled out into a library.  I believe it was brought up recently on the zsh
mailing list as a possible implementation for zsh to use.  I'm not sure
what the license is on the library (the copy that comes with recent betas
of tin don't mention a license), but it's possible that it comes under the
same artistic license that Perl does.

I'd find the url, but I'm on a dog slow connection, and I'm hesitant to
touch the web at all.  (DSL has spoiled me even more than my connection at
school did! ;-)

Hppy holidays, everyone!

>I'm not following this overrider stuff at all.

I was more referring to your previous suggestion, which Brad
mentioned, regarding the utility of specifying which string to
match. Hence my snipped example:
Style -class "Toplevel"
Though I suppose the current matching is quite symmetrical to X
resource strings, which is good. Still, for X resources, there's less
to match, since they never try to match against the title/icon
strings, only resource and class...

So I guess I was agreeing with you, but following up Brad's message.
Sorry, bad form.

>[snip stuff about logistics of override]

Overrides, I'm really far less sure about and sounds a bit arcane to
me. *That* point, made by Brad, can be hashed out by him next year.
And I don't even want to go *near* a thread involving GSFR...

	Well, I think Brad is right, we need more control about what is
matched against, I think it should become a priority to add some kind of
option to the Style (as one suggested something like -class, -title, etc
would be nice). Just one more thing if we do it we need to do it right, as
it seems that classes and titles are the less standard thing, if not
aggree, try some qt or tk apps under window maker, which is supposed to
use the WMHINTS :-).

No. The only line with Title/NoTitle is the mutt line. All the
Style lines that should affect mutt are:

  Style * BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4
  Style * SloppyFocus
  Style * DecorateTransient
  Style * Icon small.Template.xpm, IconBox +580 +708 +1023 +767
  Style * SmartPlacement,RandomPlacement
  Style * NoPPosition
  Style * MWMBorder, MWMDecor, HintOverride, MWMFunctions, MWMButtons

  #define MAIL mutt
  Style MAIL StartsOnPage 0 1, NoTitle

1) I start mutt, all is ok (mutt has no title)
2) I write a mail (wit vim as my editor), icon and window names
   change to "VIM - <some path>" (I can see it in IconMan)
3) I leave vim with :q! and abort the mail
4) I refresh the screen and mutt gets a title bar this time
   with the title set by VIM :(

I wonder why the position displayed in the feedback window
for move is relative to the upper left edge of the current
*desk*, not the current page as I would expect (i.e. on
page 1 1 the upper left corner might be displayed as
(+1024 +768)). Is there a special reason? Or should this
be changed (rather easy, even saves some bytes).

Hey all,

I dont know if this is the place to post ideas (please let me know otherwise if
not), but I have a couple. Normally snap attraction snaps a window (or button)
right on the border of another window. How about a padding for the snapped
window instead of right on the border of surrounding windows. Also, what about
command aliasing? Like I have a button in FvwmButtons that has the same command
as an entry in one of my menus. It'd be nice to alias commands rather typing
out long drawn-out ones. Just a thought.

Do you by any chance invoke the menu with a mouse button
and as a Popup menu?

If this is the case you won't get the first entry working unless
you wait about half a second before releasing the button.
I made this change to prevent activation of menu items by accident.
Whenever you land on an item when bringing up the menu you'll have
to wait for a moment. To get a similar behaviour you can bind
a default action to your popup menu just like with Menu and
WindowList. The only difference is that you don't need to
double click (which is impossible) but only have to release the
button fast:

  AddToMenu       "Main"
  +       "XTerm" Exec exec xterm &
  +       "XTerm (no titlebar)" Exec exec xterm -title "SBorder" &

and then

  Mouse 1 R A Popup Main Exec exec xterm &

Bye

Dominik

P.S.: Please tell me if it was your problem so that I know
      what to do with the bug report.

Hmm, first I noticed.

Whatever the reason, I agree that it should be relative
to the current page.  If it saves some bytes thats even better.

The current matching is against "name", "class", and "resource".
(I am using FvwmIdentify terminology.)

FvwmIdentify also shows "IconName".  I think style matching
should be against all 4 fields, possibly more.

No, Brad asked that we not send more than 500  messages before he gets
back.  I  had this crazy idea  that  I would count down  the remaining
number of mails allowed by Brad to each of my mails until he got back,
but too late, I've already lost track.

Or is that 489 and counting?

Nice cat,  the way the  picture is shot, it  looks a little like a cat
puppet.  (The arm behind the cat.)

I have  3 digital pictures  of mine, but no  web site to  put them on.
Maybe I should spend the time to get one of those free sites...

Furthermore, when you build vim, there's an option (in some releases
not enabled by default --I think it was all the pre autoconf releases)
to have vim restore your xterm's title after resetting it. I know it
doesn't address the fvwm problem, but just thought I'd mention it...

Ah, sorry to be dense. What besides title, icon, class, resource did
you have in mind? I do think explicitly specifying *what* string
you're trying to hit with a Style line would be handy too.

It is the right place. Your enhancement request concerning
padding for SnapAttraction has come up before. We'll see
after the release (2.2). Some kind of 'aliasing' can already
be done with the preprocessor modules. In my .fvwm2rc I have:

  #define CMDPPPUP exec su - root -c "/usr/local/sbin/ppp up pi debug"
  #define CMDPPPDOWN exec su - root -c "/usr/local/sbin/ppp down"

  AddToMenu WorkMenu "Work menu"   Title
   + "PPP up" Exec CMDPPPUP
   + "PPP down" Exec CMDPPPDOWN

  *FvwmButtons(3x2+15+3, Icon my_ppp.xpm, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec CMDPPPUP`, Action (Mouse 3) `Exec CMDPPPDOWN`)

Have a look at the FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp manpages.

Well, when you reported is wasn't. In the meantime I have
updated the manpage for the Popup default-action.

Sigh, who knows how menus really work. The code is such a hack that
nobody understands what is going on there (and I have even written
a good chunk of it). Surely I can document that, but that will leave
twenty other undocumented 'features'. I'm not sure that we can possibly
ever describe all of this stuff and neither I do believe we should.
I thought what I implemented was the intuitive behaviour.

Any ideas what we should do about that? (FAQ?)

That gives me:

  Just after starting mutt (without title bar):
  ---------------------------------------------
  Name: mutt
  Icon name: mutt
  Class: XTerm
  Resource: rxvt.tty
  NoTitle: Yes

  After writing a mail with vim (still no title bar):
  ---------------------------------------------------
  Name: Thanks for flying Vim
  Icon name: mutt
  Class: XTerm
  Resource: rxvt.tty
  NoTitle: Yes

  After a Refresh (it now has a title bar):
  -----------------------------------------
  Name: Thanks for flying Vim
  Icon name: mutt
  Class: XTerm
  Resource: rxvt.tty
  NoTitle: No

So it seems the icon name is not used for matching.

Thanks for the hint. I was reading the vim documentation up and
down to find out how to disable this 'feature'.

Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

When trying to get a couple of buttons to pop up whe pressing another button I
find that I don't understand the logic for where it is supposed to pop up.
I cannot figure out what this up/down/left/right does for the panel.
Whatever I set it to the panel pops up at the same place.
I cannot even see a good correlation to the geometry I set.

Has anybody else had this trouble with XEmacs 20.4
(Linux with XFree86)? Sometimes when I duoble click
on button 1 of the XEmacs title bar (with mouse button
1 which is bound to the window menu with 'Delete' as
default) XEmacs does not go away immediately. Only
after I click into the client portion of the XEmacs
window it shuts down.

I think it is probably a problem of XEmacs, or could it
be fvwm2?

Bye

Well, you told the panels where they should pop up explicitly.
You have to remove the geometry lines for the panels. The
geometry setting overrides the up/down/left/right bit (or
perhaps it is added to this).

Questions about what could be are hard.  It sounds like XEmacs to
me, the click inside the XEmacs window would only be seen by XEmacs.

It sounds like the destroy message is getting to XEmacs, but it 
is only acting on it after it gets the click.

Also, we know other applications only need the click on the title
bar.

I have in my .fvwm2rc the following line:

SetMenuStyle default LightGoldenrod3 SlateGray4 sienna sienna fixed anim
fvwm (DGradient 32 SlateGray4 gray3)

which works OK when I start fvwm2.

However, I also have lines of the form:

Key e A SCM Exec xemacs
Key a A SCM Exec /opt/applix/applix

scattered throughout my .fvwm2rc. Whenever I use one of those shortcut
keys, the menu
background immediately gets changed to SlateGray4 throughout.

I use MiniIcons in Button 1 on all windows. Whenever I pop up a menu, I see
a "ghosted"
mini-icon in the upper-left hand corner of the menu. The mini-icon is the
same as the
mini-icon of the currently focused window. The mini-icon is drawn in a
solid color that
is slightly darker than the background of the menu.

In the last two weeks we got a large number of bug
reports that seem to be really strange:

1) SetMenuStyle setting is lost when a certain key
   combination is pressed (MenuFace)

2) SnapAttraction does not work during Restart.

3) A mouse binding on window titles seems to be
   ignored.

4) Key bindings are lost over time.

5) Multiple FvwmPagers seem to slow down X a lot on
   a slow machine

6) XGetImage is very slow sometimes

7) Restart failed to read my config file once
   (an hour ago).

And all these bugs (except 5 and 6 perhaps) can not
be reproduced by anyone. This stinks! Something must
be terribly awry in the code. Any ideas how to start
on this?

Perhaps 5/6 and 2/7 are separate from 1/3/4. There
must be something very wrong with bindings at least.

I can't reproduce this. Could you try again with the current source?
And be sure to 'make clean; make'. There were some changes in the
dependencies.

When I try to combine a diagonal colour gradient with
3d hilighting (SetMenuStyle) most of the time menus
are *very* **very** slow (it takes 0.5 to 1 seconds
to hilight a single menu item, the pinter 'moves'
similarly jerky - if you can call that 'movement' at all).

I debugged this and what happens is that the XGetImage
function consumes up all this time. I have no idea why
since the grabbed rectangle is 178x23 pixels (16 planes).
Sometimes it works in the blink on an eye, but most of the
time it is **slow**. Top gives me this when moving the pointer
up and down over the menu:

  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
  273 root      17   5  7108 7108  1496 R N     0 97.2 23.0   4:26 X
                                                  ^^^^
If I don't open menus it is ok:

  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
  273 root      17   5  7108 7108  1496 S N     0  1.7 23.0   4:34 X
                                                   ^^^

I got it working smooth once. I started and killed netscape
and netscape went wild (as it sometimes does, consuming 97%
cpu). I killed netscape with -KILL and everything worked fine
from then. The strange thing is that I didn't run netscape
before menus went slow.

What is happening there?

Do you have any key binding in your config that could cause this?
Perhaps a SetMenuStyle bound to some key/mouse button? Are you
sure you properly built 2.1.5 (try make clean first if not).

Are you sure you have properly rebuilt everything since you fetched
the new sources? Try 'makeclean; make'.

Does this fix your problem?

If not, what do you have in your config file? Where is the
SnapAttraction command invoked? Please post all relevant
lines (SnapAttraction and Restart related functions too).
Try to run it without a restart ('FvwmCommand SnapAttraction ...').

I have just checked the new FvwmIconMan.c and it's still using the wrong
signal handling - I revised the signal handling just over a week ago
when I became dissatisfied with the reentrancy of siglongjmp(). As a
result, I posted a collection of patches which applied the following
signal scheme:

int TerminateHandler(int nonsense)
{
  isTerminated = True;
}


int event_loop(void)
{
  while ( !isTerminated )
  {
    ... get event ...
    ... process event ...
  }
}

Do you have those patches? I'm afraid that I can't repost them until at
least next week because they're on a different hard disc.

Cheers,
Chris.

I see that 2.1.6 showed up in incoming and Dominik tagged everything for
2.1.7.  Is 2.1.6 safe to announce?  Note that I won't generally do it
unless someone asks me to.

FYI:  I'm currently using fvwm2 x2.0.46, and canceling a window move
works exactly as the user _expects_ in this bug report, #59 under
"enhancements" on the bug tracking page.  This is contrary to the reply
posted by domivogt.

Hitting escape while the mouse button is still held down DOES cause the
window to snap back and cancels the move function.

Here is the relevant part of my .fvwmrc

AddToFunc Move-or-RaiseLower-or-shade	"C" RaiseLower
+					"D" WindowShade
+					"M" Move

Mouse 1		TS       A       Move-or-RaiseLower-or-Shade

Therefore, this apparently broke sometime after v. 2.0.46

Starting with my 2.1.7 download of just a few minutes ago,
my root window keybindings for warping to windows started selecting
the wrong window:

AddToFunc Warp "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
+	       "I" Next [$0] WarpToWindow 24p 24p
+              "I" None [$0] Beep

Key r R N Warp rlogin

(Key "r" on the root should select the "rlogin" window.  Instead
it selects each window I have in turn.)  When I have no "rlogin" window
it should beep.  It never beeps.

Looks like we don't want to announce this beta.

So far, I can't reproduce this.  Is it possible that you are starting
the 2.1.x version of fvwm2 using a full path, but you have an old
version of fvwm2 in your path?

Restarts currently find the first "fvwm2" in your path and run it,
regardless of how you started fvwm2 initially.

Looking thru the ChangeLog, I found this:

1998-12-24  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask): rewrote the contition so that
	a mere mortal can read it (costs a few bytes though).

	* fvwm/builtins.c (MatchesContitionMask):
	* fvwm/icons.c (DeIconify):
	(Iconify): bugfix for transient iconification bug

So I reverted  "MatchesContitionMask"   to its original  state,  which
"fixed" the problem.

Which leaves a quandry.  The original logic is unparsable.  (I must be
an  ordinary mortal.)   Was it necessary  to  rewrite this to fix  the
"transient iconification  bug" or was this  just re-written because it
was unparsable?

If I am really going to have to understand that code, my head is going
to hurt.

Would it be better  to  create 2.2  with the "transient  iconification
bug" rather than make such drastic change at this time?

Hey, why don't we have a cats page on the fvwm homepage :-)=)
That gives a personal touch.

Both. Basically I did no more than breaking this condition
into several statements. Seems I did something wrong there :(

I don't think so. Once you have understood what's going on
it isn't *this* complicated. I'll look at the code. Probably
something very obvious I've done wrong.

No, another problem has to be fixed first (see the 'obscure bugs')
thread. I'll make a new package soon.

Since I'm the one who wrote the code I know exactly what
happened and is happening (it is exactly what I wanted).
Whatever the exact symptoms are, the problem is:
If we snap the window back immediately (by leaving the move
function), all mouse events accumulated will go to the
application window. Especially the button release may be
harmful. I see no easy way to fix this with the current code.

Dan, could you make the next package then? I'm a bit
tired of working on fvwm and will not do much more than
fixing this bug today. I'll let you know when the fix is ready
(or when I've given up).

No problem.

Are we doing this the right way?

Shouldn't we put  stuff  in the  tree, let a   few days pass  for  CVS
downloads and tests, then tag and create a package?

Since we have no real 2.1.7 yet, after you commit your changes, can't
I re-tag this as 2.1.7 and try again?  (I'll try if no one points out
my error before I try.)

Probably we should, but what will we do in the meantime?
The change that caused the problem was a small bugfix. We can't 
possibly hold back a new release because of ten changed lines
every time (?) At the moment we still have the delay between
building the tarball and announcing it. Perhaps if we always
let pass a day or two before announcing it we are safe enough.
What do you think? Up to now we didn't announce a release with
a real show stopper in thanks to this delay.

Sure you can. There is no 2.1.7 tag right now. I don't
understand your question. I built the 2.1.6 tarball. 2.1.7
is just the version number in configure.in.

In principle we could even retag the source with version-2_1_6
without too much trouble (-F option to rtag). Perhaps that is
better than having a stale version that will definitely be
downloaded as soon as it shows up somewhere. On the other
hand it might not be worth the trouble (configure.in has
to bechanges and perhaps other stuff?).

I'm  not understanding  this question.  At   this time, I  don't think
anything should be committed unless its essential to 2.2.

Only essential fixes should go in.  Rewriting routines shouldn't
go in unless necessary.  Thats why I questioned it.
(I'm not saying it wasn't necessary, just asking the question.)

I think we can save ourselves some work by getting a stable CVS
before going on to packaging.

Sorry, I meant 2.1.6.

Since you've already updated configure.in, its simpler
to go ahead and make the next release 2.1.7.

I suggest we go this way:

Get your changes committed.  (Take your time.)

Let 2 working days pass for CVS downloads and testing.  If nothing
develops, tag, create package, test package and announce.  This may
take another day or 2.  Due to the nature of this week, 2 days this
week may not be enough.  Perhaps Jason has a way of letting us know
how many CVS downloads there are in a given time interval.  I'd like
to think we have at least 5 CVS downloads before packaging...

If anything gets committed  in the interval, before the
package is created, start over.

Looking thru Jitterbug, I don't see anything that would get in the way
of 2.2.  I think we want to go to great lengths to hold back on any
changes right now.  It would be ideal if 2.2 is identical to 2.1.7.

Same with me. If you can send them to my private address again
(see signature) I can apply them. Otherwise it will probably have
to wait until January.

Were the portability issues of these changes ever addressed?

I  seem  to recall   the very good  suggestion  of   using emacs  as a
reference implementation  for signal handling.   I don't recall anyone
coming up with a better idea, or reporting what emacs does.

Is there a reason to include any of this in 2.2?

I would go a bit further as you can see in what bugs I've been
fixing in the last weeks.

That is what I meant with 'what will we do in the meantime?'. I
don't think fvwm is stable enough to switch into this mode of
operation.

What I want to see fixed/done first is:

 - the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)
 - the XPM problems (probably in 'configure', bugs #31, #40
   and perhaps others)
 - this XGetImage problem I encountered (because of its
   high visibility)
 - apply latest signal handling patches
 - verify the 'growing windows' bugfix (I don't think it
   is completely fixed. The tkbiff growing rapidly problem
   is not verified, bug #28)
 - verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)

Not this important, but I think they should still be fixed
before 2.2.

 - install-strip problem (bug #33)
 - closing a panel closes FvwmButtons (perhaps too difficult)
 - FvwmCpp does not know where cpp is (bug #95)
 - crash with xclock (bug #56)

They are already in. We're talking about updates at the
moment. Personally I am willing to take the risk of breaking
a *few* exotic systems in 2.2. As far as I understand Chris
has worked a bit on this portability issue so I'm not too
worried about that. The alternative is to back out this
signal handling stuff again and get some fvwm crashes in
return.

To be precise, I posted a request on comp.unix.programmer for anyone
without POSIX.1 signal-handling to "come forth" and say what they DID
have available. I had one reply saying that maybe SVR3 systems met this
dubious requirement, and that the lowest common denominator of all UNIX
signal handling was the obselete "signal" function and not much else.
Trying to make ANYTHING signal-safe on such a system would (IMHO) be
like trying to give a dodo flying lessons.

Dan Espen wrote:

Actually, it was samba. I have been studying the samba code and they use
signal() rather than sigaction(), trying to account for all of
signal()'s broken and different semantics. However, they do try to use
POSIX.1 and BSD4.3 features if they are available. They also use some
blatantly non-reentrant functions in their clean-up handlers, but then
maybe they know their code intimately and so KNOW that this will never
cause a problem...?

I have worked out a POSIX.1 scheme for fortifying the FVWM signal
handling. I believe that I can port this scheme to BSD4.3 providing BSD
provides a longjmp() function (I won't need siglongjmp() because I will
be restoring the process's signal mask manually). Hopefully both POSIX
and BSD provide sigaction() because signal() is a complete mess.

Ultimately, I think we should aim for POSIX.1 but cater for BSD. Any
system which supports neither would get my vote for being "exotic".

The term "pending mouse movements" confused me for some reason.  
Anyhow, a little more explanation highlighted the reasoning behind the
change.

I can't say I agree with all these items being necessary for 2.2.

I'll try to help however.

I was unable  to  reproduce bug number  56 with  2.1.6.  If  you don't
object, I'll move it to fixed.   (There was unsubstantiated conjecture
that  it was a  signal handling problem.  As I  understand  it you and
Chris did some signal handling changes.)

Perhaps more correct would be to move it to unreproducible, would that
get it off the 2.2 hit list?

It would quite useful to be able inherit decors & menustyles like UseStyle.

For example, I like to use courier font for some menus and now I have to
respecify
all attributes for those menus instead of just changing some items.

Default decoration is named Default, but default menustyle or style is *.

Maybe ButtonStyle e.a. should only be available with AddToDecor command.

The syntax of Style, AddToDecor and SetMenuStyle is similar to each other,
but not
the same. It would be easier, if they would all use just one syntax - maybe
menu
syntax. The commands could also be named named similarly, say AddToStyle,
AddToDecor
and AddToMenuStyle. (Are decors supposed to be added to Style in GSFR?)

I find this module path _extremely_ suspicious.

Have you done something special with your fvwm installation to allow
this to work?  If not, then this is wrong and you're invoking the wrong
modules for this version of fvwm.

I suggest you examine the NEWS file for the new env var (FVWM_MODULEPATH
or somethin?) and try modifying the modulepath setting in your .fvwm2rc
file.

This may or may not fix the problem, but it's a start.

There is a longjmp() in 2.11BSD :-)
And 4.3Net/2, and 4.3 RENO, and 4.3 Lite2.  (I had to search them
for "setjmp").  Ah, wait there it's in V7.  That ought to leave it
*everywhere*

I think I clipped some part of the message that asked about sigaction,
which 4.3Net/2 has.  See http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sigaction&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=4.3BSD+NET%2F2&format=html
(you can get the man pages for many systems there)

Hi!

Well I guess not. It was a long shot, I know.

But I have just discovered that the popup windows gets listed in the
FvwmWinLinst and when selected from there it appearse on the screen. I 
can't find any "style" that should cause this so the problem still exists,
but in a way I can live with. But any help or tips to find the real
problem are welcome.

regards,
stefan

So, where don't you agree? We can talk about everything.

Let me explain my motivation behind these:

1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)

Really strange. I don't believe all these people were
fantasizing. I don't want 2.2 before it is clear what
caused these problems.

One of the top priorities for me.

2) the XPM problems (probably in 'configure', bugs #31,
   #40 and perhaps others)

Probably the worst problem we have at the moment. There
have been at least four or five complaints about pixmap
problems.

3) this XGetImage problem I encountered

Well, we can of course document this problem in the 
manpage/BUGS/FAQ, but unfortunately this will happen
as soon as you use a gradient menu face and forget to
turn off all other item hilighting (i.e. it's the
default with gradients). Anyway, some work has to be
done here, whatever the solution will be.

4) apply latest signal handling patches

Either we use the latest signal handling patches or back
them out completely. Leaving them in an 'alpha' state is
the worst thing we can do here.

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix

We have no confirmation if tkbiff still may grow until it
is as wide as the whole desk. I don't think it is fixed
because I didn't do anything there. It is probably not
related to the 'growing windows' bug. My guess is that
tkbiff or fvwm2 has a bug with configure requests that
cause this. I have created this kind of behaviour myself
when experimenting with HandleConfigureRequest and thus
think it it probably a fvwm2 issue.

If it is a general problem it has to be addressed, if
it's tkbiff only it may wait (although I think it should
still be fixed before 2.2).

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)

I never understood where the problem came/comes from.
I backed out some changes I did in ParseBindEntry but
since I don't see this bug I can't verify it. I've
written mails until my fingers were sore, but the
reporters (several independent reports) don't seem to
care if it is fixed or not (i.e. nobody replies to my
questions if it works now).

Since it breaks core functionality and has a high
visiblility this one is a must.

7) install-strip problem (bug #33)

I think this was an automake bug. I remember some comment
by Paul (PDS) about this (is that tight, Paul?) and the
error message from the report seems to confirm this too.

I wonder how other autoconf'ed programs do this if they
have multiple directories where executables are built.
Perhaps we could create symbolic links tho the correct
install-sh in the distribution?

If we can't fix it we have to document it.

8) closing a panel closes FvwmButtons

We have had at least three independent reports about this.
I think this justifies spending some time on that before
2.2. If it is not too difficult we should fix it.

9) FvwmCpp does not know where cpp is (bug #95)

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)

> I was unable  to  reproduce bug number  56 with  2.1.6.

Does this imply that you could reproduce it with some
earlier version?

> If  you don't object, I'll move it to fixed.

If you could reproduce it before and it's gone with 2.1.6,
go ahead. If not we should address it. I didn't do anything
apart from trying to reproduce it (which I could not).

> (There was unsubstantiated conjecture
> that  it was a  signal handling problem.  As I  understand  it you and
> Chris did some signal handling changes.)

No, I didn't touch the signal handling code. I only applied the
fixes. I agree that the patches may have fixed it, but we didn't
verify that.

> Perhaps more correct would be to move it to unreproducible, would that
> get it off the 2.2 hit list?

I feel quite uncomfortable to do it this way (provided that
is really is unreproducible) bacause we did not address this
bug. I have not the slightest idea how likely this will happen.
At least we should try to contact Philip (J. Hollenback
<philiph@sco.COM>) before doing this.

--

There are some mails about problems with 2.1.x that
should be investigated too:

11) hanging up asmodem kills FvwmButtons (perhaps related to 8)
12) this 'serious bug' RedHat found (I'd like to see the patch).
13) the FvwmCommandS problem discussed recently

Oh well, that is a known problem. Sometimes transient windows
are mapped below the parent window so you can't see them. I
think there is a bug report already. I'll move your report
to duplicates.

Thanks for the help.

There's a bit of talk on the Gnome list about a bug in fvwm 2.0.46; I asked
if they could duplicate it with a recent version like 2.1.5 but there were
snide remarks about using development versions.  Of course, 2.0.46 is a
development version and has more bugs than 2.1.5, so I corrected them.

I just tested this on the latest CVS on Dec 29 and the problem
still exists.  But I've got more info on it too.  Here are the
mouse bindings that I tested.  I bound to builtins instead of
complex functions to make the environment simpler.

Mouse 0  T N Move
Mouse 0  T M WindowShade
Mouse 0 FS A Resize

The WindowShade binding doesn't work... it turns out to be a
Resize.  If I change the third mouse binding to

Mouse 0 FS N Resize

then things work as advertized.  Is this just unintuitive yet
correct behavior?  Maybe the 'A' modifier is a little broken.
Does 'A' cover when ONE OR MORE modifier key is pressed or just
any single modifier key?

Thanks again,

I still can't reproduce it. I need some more information:

1) Are you 100% sure there are no other bindings in your .fvwm2rc
   that interfere with this?

2) Does it fail with a .fvwm2rc that has nothing more than these
   three lines?

3) What X server do you use? Which version number?

4) Is your num-lock key active? Does it work if you press it once?

To all: has anybody else tried this?

Bye

Dominik

This is getting us nowhere. We can start exchanging insults or
cooperate to get things running. There is a tool to report bugs
on our homepage ( http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/ ). It would help
immensely if you would use it or at least post to the
fvwm-workers list ( fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu ). Contrary to any
experience you might have had with fvwm in the past all bug
reports are taken serious and will be worked on.

Some of us had a look at some GNOME-compliance draft and found
it quite unclear, so we didn't start making fvwm2 GNOME- (or
KDE-compliant) and I think other window managers have the same
problem. As you have noticed there hasn't been an official
fvwm2 release for ages and we're all working very hard to complete
2.2 as soon as possible (hopefully in January). We have about 40
open bug reports and enhancement requests and perhaps you can
understand that making 2.2 GNOME-compliant is no issue for us
since it would only make 2.2 even later.

In the meantime it would help your team and mine if you'd
forward bug reports to the fvwm developers. And perhaps you
can imagine that I've not much time left for installing
and configuring GNOME after 40 hours working plus 50 hours
hacking fvwm2 a week. Downloading, building and installing a
recent fvwm2 version on a current Linux system should take
about 20 minutes (2.1.5 is the right choice) thanks to autoconf.
You can use the same config file as for 2.0.46 and have it
running very fast. OK, for a clean installation you will need
some more work, but that's probably not what you need.

Thanks and Bye

Dominik
(speaking for the fvwm2 development team)

P.S.: Please be so kind and forward this mail to your list.

Can you send me your .fvwm2rc? I can't reproduce it with mine.

Hi Paul (PDS),

I've found a few places where references/defines for
certain UNIX flavours are made. Could you have a look
at them and see what has to be done to 'autoconf' them?

1) events.c:

    #ifdef __hpux
      if (select(fd_width,(int *)&in_fdset, (int *)&out_fdset,0, NULL) > 0)
    #else
      if (select(fd_width,&in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, NULL) > 0)
    #endif

2) builtins.c:

    win = (unsigned long)strtol(num,NULL,0); /* SunOS doesn't have strtoul */

3) module.c:

    /* the write returns EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN if the pipe is full.
     * (This is non-blocking I/O). SunOS returns EWOULDBLOCK, OSF/1
     * returns EAGAIN under these conditions. Hopefully other OSes
     * return one of these values too. Solaris 2 doesn't seem to have
     * a man page for write(2) (!) */
    else if ((errno == EWOULDBLOCK)||(errno == EAGAIN)||(errno==EINTR))

4) bindings.c:

    /* in some BSD implementations, tolower(c) is not defined
     * unless isupper(c) is true */
    tmp1=string[i];
    if(isupper(tmp1))
      tmp1=tolower(tmp1);

Bye

Dominik

I've run insure++ (a tool like purify, but better since
it is source based and can even tell you where memory was
leaked) over the purify config file and could fix a few
of the harder memory leaks. The remaining logs are attached
(one log for every child process too). Note that an
'outstanding memory reference' is not necessarily a memory
leak.

We know of the SetEnv and ReadButtonFace leaks (and decided
not to fix them for 2.2) and after another debugging session
I tend to say the AddToMenu thing is no leak.

Bye

Dominik

Because 2.1.6 has not been officially released I assume.

Hey folks,

I dont know if this was changed on purpose from 2.0.46 or a bug. In FvwmForm
all the widgets are flat rather than "3d" like in 2.0.46. Like buttons are just
text with a box around them. Not raised or anything. I am using 2.1.6. I also
noticed it in 2.1.5. Here's what FvwmForm looks at when I call it with 
'Module FvwmForm Run...':

*Run...WarpPointer
*Run...Font			-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-14-*
*Run...ButtonFont		-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*
*Run...Fore			LightSkyBlue
*Run...Back			rgb:46/59/63
*Run...ItemFore			White
*Run...ItemBack			SlateGrey
*Run...Line			center
*Run...Input			command		50
*Run...Line			left
*Run...Selection		runas		single
*Run...Choice			normal		Exec	on	"Normal"
*Run...Line			left
*Run...Choice			module		Module	off	"Fvwm Module"
*Run...Line			left
*Run...Choice			term		Exec	off	"In Terminal  \
   "
*Run...Button			quit		" Execute "	^M
*Run...Command			$(normal? Exec $(command)) \
				$(module? Module $(command)) \
				$(term? Exec rxvt -e $(command))
*Run...Button			restart		" Clear "
*Run...Button			quit		" Abort "	^[
