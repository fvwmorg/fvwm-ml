Your observation is correct. LastActive is called after a window under
the pointer gets a focus, which makes destroy_window event useless in your
case. This is clearly seen if you uncomment the WindowList line.

I can see that, like in 2.2.4, M_DESTROY_WINDOW is broadcasted, i.e. added
to a queue, *before* the focus games on a window under a pointer.

Ok, I have fixed this problem by making SetSyncMask on all messages in
FvwmEvent.

For some reason SetSyncMask(fd, M_DESTROY_WINDOW), i.e. 1<<7, has no
effect for me, but SetSyncMask(fd, 1<<31) does the fix! I am confused.
Don't forget to SendUnlockNotification(fd) if you want to try this.

Related issue. FvwmEvent does not SetMessageMask, so it always gets all
events, which is by itself is not optimal; making all of them synchronized
can be a little slow. Any thoughts?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I guess I'll find out when this reply comes thru.

Subject: fvwm doing xsync reading almost every command

I've previously complained about fvwm taking forever to start up
when run remotely over a cable modem.  Fifteen minutes or more.

I've added debug logic that times every command executed by fvwm.
I find that commands that shouldn't take any time at all,
like "AddToFunction", take an average of 1/4 elapsed seconds.

A big chunk of that time is in WaitForButtonsUp where there are
a few X calls including calls to XSync, XAllowEvents, XQueryPointer,
XPending, etc.

I traced that 1/4 second down to functions.c ExecuteFunction() around
line 1035 where it has this:

  /* Only wait for an all-buttons-up condition after calls from
   * regular built-ins, not from complex-functions, menus or modules. */
  if(Module == -1)
    WaitForButtonsUp(True);

The condition "Module == -1" is true for just about every command.
Only blank lines and comments get away with zero measurable elapsed time.

For startup, the Module switch seems to originate in fvwm.c around line
639:

  if (num_config_commands > 0)
  {
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<num_config_commands;i++)
    {
      DoingCommandLine = True;
      ExecuteFunction(
	config_commands[i], NULL, &Event, C_ROOT, -1, EXPAND_COMMAND, NULL);
      free(config_commands[i]);
    }
    DoingCommandLine = False;
  } else {
    /* Run startup command file in 5 places: FVWM_USERDIR, FVWM_DATADIR,
       and for compatibility: ~/.fvwm2rc, $sysconfdir/system.fvwm2rc */
    if (
      !run_command_file( CatString3(fvwm_userdir, "/",       FVWMRC),
        &Event, NULL, C_ROOT, -1 ) &&
      !run_command_file( CatString3(home_dir,     "/",       FVWMRC),
        &Event, NULL, C_ROOT, -1 ) &&
      !run_command_file( CatString3(FVWM_DATADIR, "/",       FVWMRC),
        &Event, NULL, C_ROOT, -1 ) &&
      !run_command_file( CatString3(FVWM_DATADIR, "/system", FVWMRC),
        &Event, NULL, C_ROOT, -1 ) &&
      !run_command_file( CatString3(FVWM_CONFDIR, "/system", FVWMRC),
        &Event, NULL, C_ROOT, -1 ) )


All  those  "run_command_file"   and "ExecuteFunction"  commands   are
passing "-1" for the "Module" value causing all the XSync calls.  This
appears  to be the way fvwm  has worked since  at  least 2.2.  (2.2 is
also slow run this way.)

I changed all the above "-1" to another value with no obvious negative
consequences.  I don't know for sure what that does to startup time,
the first test seemed to show improvement.

I don't think thats the right fix for this.
It would seem to me, the decision about which commands need to be
XSync'd should be made based on the command, or possibly the command
and its arguments.

Any comments?

I only remove addresses that bounce for a really long time.  The software
will never automatically unsubscribe anyone.

I think the list has just been quiet.

I think it is good to apply it. This small feature/fix affects only ones
who have libstroke installed and use stroke.

There is a related bug, which is shown when stroke is drawn over window
titles. The visual effect is instead of the absolute title_w coordinates,
relative ones are used, i.e. stroke jumps when goes through any title.
The code is in 'case MotionNotify:' of strokeFunc, but I don't know what
the fix should be.

Mikhael.

This subject was disscused a year+ ago, but no real solution to this
problem was implemented since then:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9903/msg00230.html

In two words the problem is that if you have a module MyAlias2, all its
configuration will be passed to MyAlias module as well, which may result
in fatal errors for some modules.

If the syntax enables conflicts they will come (remember FormFvwmTalkHelp;
we at fvwm-themes have many such cases), Of course it is possible to solve
every individual conflict, but, instead, the conflicting syntax should be
resolved, i.e. introduced an alternative one.

I have a small patch, solving this problem. So both syntaxes are valid:

  *FvwmMyPagerLabel 0 Desk
  *FvwmMyPager:Label 0 Desk

Everything is fully backward compatible, but if you use the second (new)
variant, it is guaranteed that the configuration will only be passed
to FvwmMyPager and not, for example, to FvwmMyPage module.
The current implementation converts the new syntax to the old one (while
keeping the exact matching), because many modules rely on the old syntax,
but in the future, I hope, we could make a conflicting syntax obsolete.

Why I used colon? Originally Steve and Dan suggested colon, and I don't
care, as long as there is no conflict. Asterisk can't be used because of
DestroyModuleConfig, period can't be used because of the current FvwmForm.

The sooner a non conflicting syntax is introduced the better. We already
have in fvwm-themes about 50 module aliases for at least 6 FvwmModule's.
As a side note, we use a FvwmModule-SubName naming scheme for them,
which is just fine with a non conflicting syntax.

I want to apply this or similar patch before 2.4. Please comment.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't understand.  All modules should be able to use the period.

Using a delimiter in module names is not a good idea, this is a hack,
which makes file names ugly and does not disallow conflicts in general.
Say you have MyAlias2. with a period at the end, still MyAlias module will
get its configuration. You can't force a delimeter in module alias names,
the solution is to make a delimiter a part of the syntax (your idea).

I really don't care if FvwmForm aliases remain the same as now, we only
need to be able to use a non conflicting syntax, so, say, configuration of
FvwmEvent-Sound will never be passed to a FvwmEvent module with no alias.
And as I wrote, it is easily solvable.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I was beginning to like those trailing dots.
If its used for all modules, it works.

Rereading what you plan to do, it does seem cleaner, the new delimiter
doesn't appear in the command sent to the module.  But still affects
the command matching done by InitGetConfigInfo.

I think the changes to the FvwmForm to get rid of the period would
be easy.  Just change the filenames, makefile rules and man page.

I have noted this too but I don't know how to fix this. This maybe need 
an X expert.

I'm having alot of strange problems with my key mappings which don't appear 
on any of my other systems.  Both the Ctrl-Lock and the Num-Lock are off 
(disabled) and I tried toggling them just in case too (so it ain't them :-)

I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file

Key KP_Decimal  A       C       Prev [ CurrentPage !iconic] FlipFocus
Key KP_0        A       C       Prev [!CurrentPage !iconic] FlipFocus

Key KP_4        A       C       GotoPage 0 1
Key KP_5        A       C       GotoPage 1 1
Key KP_6        A       C       GotoPage 2 1
Key KP_7        A       C       GotoPage 0 0
Key KP_8        A       C       GotoPage 1 0
Key KP_9        A       C       GotoPage 2 0

Key KP_7        A       M       WarpToWindow 50p 50p

Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100

This is what's happening.
Ctrl-7, Ctrl-4, Ctrl-5, Ctrl-6, and Ctrl-1 all work properly.
Ctrl-8, Ctrl-9, Ctrl-2 and Ctrl-3 do NOT for some reason (why ?????).

As for the arrow keys, the up and down don't seem to do anything at all.  
The left and right function as though they are 'GotoPage 0 1' and 'GotoPage 
2 1' respectively.  Again, Why ??????

Besides that my Meta (or Alt -- Diamond key on Sun's keyboard) doesn't work 
unless I'm using Emacs or Netscape.  In Fvwm it doesn't seem to have any 
affect.

Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong.  As noted, this all works 
on my linux box and on the previous Ultra-5 that I had (different OS 
though).

uname -a:       SunOS klepto 5.7 Generic_106541-10 sun4u
fvwm version:   fvwm-snap-20000809 (with xpm support)

Thanks for the help in advance.

+ Tim

I would like to close some details.

1) Which delimeter to use. I think about colon/period (50%/50%), but any
other (not isalnum or asterisk or isspace) can be used too.

What others prefer?

2) It is possible to trivially patch FvwmForm to support old aliases with
a period at the end, so it could convert anything matching FormFvwm<name>.
to FvwmForm-<name> or whatever scheme we choose, for compatibility.

Should I do this?

3) Some time ago we with Olivier had a discussion about a naming scheme
convention for module alises, and decided that FvwmModule-IdName is a
clean and consistent scheme.

Any objections if I use this scheme if we rename files/aliases anyway?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Move-or-Raise in sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc is wrong.
It raises even if the window is moved.

Compare the current implementation (my comments):


AddToFunc Move-or-Raise		"I" Raise       # raise immediately (in any case)

+				"M" Move        # move if dragged
+  				"D" Lower       # lower if double-clicked


with the version from 2.0.46:

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "C" Raise       # raise if simply clicked
+                               "M" Move        # move if dragged
+                               "D" Lower       # lower if double-clicked

This fix (SetSyncMask on all messages) was actually not a relable one.

On some level, 0x80000000 is converted to 0x7fffffff, which is buggy
regardless of signed/unsigned arithmetics. But this is not directly
related to the mentioned problem.

The problem is in this line of PositiveWrite in module_interface.c:

  if ((SyncMask[module] & ptr[1]) && !myxgrabcount)

So, even if a message is set to be synchronized, still it's not guaranteed
that this will be the case. For example, M_DESTROY_WINDOW is always sent
inside of MyXGrab/MyXUnGrab. I removed the myxgrabcount condition bit,
this together with synching on destroy_window fixes the original problem.
I understand this may cause problems, but I see no other solution. I have
tested several cases, like 2 FvwmAnimate, 2 FvwmEvent and see no problems.
I will restore the original condition if there are ones.

I am not familar much with sun keyboards, so probably there is a sun
specific solution here, but generally this is probably a X Server related
problem, not fvwm's. Try to run xev(1) and see whether KP_9 is really
generated when you press 9 (with or without Ctrl). You can use xmodmap(1)
to alter mappings.

Again, xev can answer what this key generates.

Mikhael et all.  A couple of things to follow-up on..  I tried a Talk form 
so as to attempt to debug (I'll attach a simplified configuration file 
below):

When I press Ctrl-arrow-up, I get,
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1'

When I press KP_8, I get,
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1'

Pressing SC arrows works fine.  Pressing Ctrl-arrows doesn't work properly; 
as noted above Ctrl-left and Ctrl-right function as though they are GotoPage 
0 1 and GotoPage 2 1.  Ctrl-up and Ctrl-down don't modify the view at all.

KP_0 doesn't function properly.

I also took your advice Mikhael about xev.

If num_lock is NOT active

pressing KP_5 gives me,

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x6800001,
    root 0x2a, subw 0x0, time 623342502, (43,114), root:(87,383),
    state 0x0, keycode 99 (keysym 0xffdc, F31), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

pressing KP_4 gives me,

KeyPress event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x6800001,
    root 0x2a, subw 0x0, time 623343471, (43,114), root:(87,383),
    state 0x0, keycode 98 (keysym 0xff51, Left), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

If num_lock is active

pressing KP_5 gives me,

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x6800001,
    root 0x2a, subw 0x6800002, time 623433508, (39,42), root:(83,311),
    state 0x20, keycode 99 (keysym 0xffb5, KP_5), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 1 characters:  "5"

pressing KP_4 gives me,

KeyPress event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x6800001,
    root 0x2a, subw 0x6800002, time 623434196, (39,42), root:(83,311),
    state 0x20, keycode 98 (keysym 0xffb4, KP_4), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 1 characters:  "4"

My 'xmodmap' shows,

xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x6a),  Shift_R (0x75)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x7e)
control     Control_L (0x53)
mod1        Alt_L (0x1a)
mod2        Mode_switch (0x14)
mod3        Num_Lock (0x69)
mod4        Meta_L (0x7f),  Meta_R (0x81)
mod5

I attempted, per FAQ, to 'xmodmap -e "clear Mod3"' but nothing improved.

What should I do to get the KP_* and arrow key mappings working ????

What do you think?

There is still a bug #5 open about this against FVWM.

Since this logging is quite useful, can you please add #ifdef's and commit
your additions? I planned to create a 2/3 column table (start/end time in
milliseconds, command) myself, but seems that you already have this.

I think, your fix (disallow WaitForButtonsUp for startup commands) is ok.
We grab a busy cursor during start-up commands anyway. Maybe to call
WaitForButtonsUp after that block.

Your suggestion of calling WaitForButtonsUp based on the command name
(I don't think parsing arguments is needed/possible) also can be used
to speed up the run time commands. Probably Dominik, who worked with
this function, can comment better on this suggestion after his vacation.

Mikhael.

I originally added time, and I found it really  hard to spot big gaps.
Right now, its  printing elapsed milliseconds  from the previous debug
line.  A shortcoming of  my  implementation is  that the  elapsed time
applies  to  the previous line.   I'll  add it anyway,   I did find it
helpful.

I'm seeing 2-3 minutes where I used to see 10 minutes.

When I get a chance, I'll clean it up and commit.

I tested this just now.  I first allocated all my colors, then modified
my XScreensaver setup to install colormaps.

I tried  about 10 times and each   time, the hack  ran with  the right
colormap.

A long  time ago I reported  that fvwm DID  have  this problem.  While
trying  to solve  it, I  realized  that  I was  using  xli  and xv  as
substitutes for the  hacks that come with  xscreensaver.  For this  to
work correctly,  the hack has to use  the root colormap and both those
programs use the default colormap.

I don't think fvwm has a problem with xscreensaver.

I reported this once before, took it to the configure people too.  It's
been
about a year and when I downloaded again this year - same problem.

When running the ./configure program it looks for the C compiler.  It
correctly finds the compiler to be CC.  But it then tries to do a test
compile and ./configure generates:

checking whether the C compiler (/usr/bin/CC -o32 -g -fullwarn -DIRIX -o32
-shared -demangle) works... no

which then generates:

configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot
create executables.

and aborts.

Has nothing been done to correct the problem in either FVWM or automake? 
Let me know!
Thanks!  :-)

Uff, you should remove the first +, I guess.
Is this a warning or error? I am not near my computer, I get a fatal error
(different from what you specified) with perl 5.005.

I got this freeze with other than modules@migo components too IIRC.

Yes, I think you are right. But there will be even more duplication...
Maybe to have one FvwmPager file with all pager configs or several files
are better? I have an idea (not new) how to fix a duplication for a future
fvwm versions. FvwmPager-Desker simply should read FvwmPager config first.

I'm answering my own question in hopes of having this info added to the FAQ. 
  This took me awhile to figure this out since its not mentioned anywhere 
even though it might be understood by the masses.

After an "xmodmap -e blah blah" or "xmodmap filename" one _must_ either 
restart fvwm to see the affects or add those commands to one's startx or 
xinitrc file and reboot.  Bare in mind that the changes show-up immediately 
when queried command-line in an xterm or xev or xkeycaps (kinda confusing to 
a newbie like myself).

Do please add this note to the FAQ, it might help another poor soul.

Now if I can only figure why my diamond key (SUN keyboard) does not function 
as a Meta key in fvwm (it does fine in emacs).  In Fvwm I have to use the 
Alt key --- Does fvwm map Mod1 as Meta by any chance ???

Thanks again.

Tim

I added this note to the answer for 5.5:

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.

This might take a while to appear at the web site, I think I have some
other things in my mail folders I want to add.

This was not really supposed to go to fvwm-workers (my 2 aliases are very
similar). The quoted problem is fixed by correcting a function definition.

Still it is possible to reproduce the described freeze (XGrab) by
executing the following commands in FvwmConsole (note an absence of "I"):

  AddToFunc TestFunc anyword1 anyword2
  TestFunc

Mikhael.
