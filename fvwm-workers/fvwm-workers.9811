Yes, it's done via email.  Typically before the fact, not after: "On
Wed. morning we'll freeze."  Some groups then "lock" the branch (either
physically if the software allows it, or by convention) so only the
maintainer can checkin and everyone else sends patches to him/her.
Others continue to allow everyone to add changes, just with a different
flavor.

Obviously, usually changes aren't added while a beta or release package
is being created, to keep things stable.

The key everyone has to remember is that we don't need to make it really
strict.  First, we _want_ it to be dynamic, and second, we can rely on
the professionalism of everyone involved--if we couldn't, we wouldn't
give them write-access to the tree.  This isn't like a big company where
you never know how some people managed to get their job (probably they
can sling crap well for a 45 minute interview), and you can't rid of
them afterwards.  Here, we all get to see exactly how
good/productive/responsible people are before giving them the
keys... and if they continually screw up we can revoke priviliges with a
keypress.  Not that I'm saying we should threaten people, but we can
expect, and receive, a higher level of ability and avoid lots of
"safety-net" overhead in the process.

Typically in other organizations I've seen, it's the release
maintainer's responsibility to handle random patches and apply them.
The other alternative is to get a bug database working somewhere and
have patches stored there, so people can add them as they have time.

I recently looked into this a bit and I must say I like Jitterbug, by
the Samba group, although I think it requires web access unlike things
like GNATS and debbug which use email.  Of course, it needs to be hosted
somewhere :)

A most excellent point.  

I had failed to consider this because my solution is to NOT set ModulePath
in system.fvwm2rc.  The compiled-in default is fine for me, as I never add
extra directories to the path.

Something like this should be done, I agree.

Rather than throwing in a quick, ill-thought-out hack to do this, I dodged
the issue by removing the lines in the sample system.fvwm2rc that set the
ModulePath, PixmapPath, and IconPath.

All of these can be set at compile time, and these defaults are built in
if nothing is set in the .fvwm2rc file.  Since
sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc is supposed to be a "bare bones" example, I
think it is reasonable to not even mention the existence of these paths. 

In the "sample 2" file, which is somewhat more verbose, I commented out
the path settings and preceeded them with the following warning:

##########################################################################
# PATH Setup 
#
# Not normally needed; use configure to set defaults at compile time.  
#
# IMPORTANT: if you decide to set a ModulePath, please note that modules
#            are normally installed into a version-dependent
#            directory.  Be sure to update this file after installing
#            a new version.

This should be good enough until we work out a better solution.

Since you can configure these paths (Module, Icon, and Pixmap) at build
time, it seems better to just omit any lines setting them explicitly in
the sample files.  This covers the common case, and people don't need to
modify .fvwm2rc files when a new version is installed.

OK, autoconf is in.  I'm very interested to hear reports of success or
failure with the new configure system! 

I hacked extras/FvwmTaskBar until it compiled, but I don't guarantee it
works. I had to retrieve an old version of Goodies.c, and restore
GetPicture() to libs/Picture.c.  See the ChangeLog and "cvs diff -r
pre_beta_2_1" for details. 

Other than that, the changes to actual source files are minor.

Everything now builds, so I took the liberty of tagging it as a "beta" 
version using "cvs tag version-2_1_0".  This follows the convention that
fvwm x.y.z is not stable if "y" is odd. 

The tag convention is that fvwm version x.y.z is tagged as "version-x_y_z" 
in the repository, for all beta & stable versions.  The corresponding tar
file is named "fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz".

I have uploaded fvwm-2.1.0.tar.gz into the incoming/fvwm directory of the
ftp server.  I assume it will be moved appropriately in a day or two.

Note that there is one important difference between the beta version as it
exists in the CVS repository, and the tar file.  The tar file can be used
by anyone, whereas the makefiles in the repository use some GNUisms.  I
believe you'll need GNU make and GCC to build the repository version. 
However, you do NOT need any of the auto* tools to build either version. 

If you want to retrieve and build the beta from the CVS tree, do:

	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm login
[password is 'guest']
	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm \
		checkout -P -r version-2_1_0 fvwm
	cd fvwm
	more INSTALL*
	./configure 
	make


If you find a bug and fix it, you can very easily generate diffs using
"cvs diff" from the top of the source tree.  

If you are going to commit changes to the repository, you have to
understand sticky tags.  By doing a "checkout -r some-tag", you make
"some-tag" (e.g. "version-2_1_0" in the above example) sticky in your copy
of the repository. This means that all subsequent operations are based on
the version corresponding to "some-tag".  This is exactly what we want for
diffs, but it won't work for commits.

[The reason I gave explicitly the tag in the above is because it retrieves
precisely the version 2.1.0.  The head of the tree will become an unstable
alpha version very soon.]

If you are going to do commits they must be done at the head of the
repository tree.  So, either 

	* don't use the "-r" flag in the checkout or update,
or
	* issue the "cvs update -A" command before committing.

The latter option will update you to the current head of the trunk,
forgetting all sticky tags.  Pay careful attention to messages about
merges and conflicts! 

If you make changes to the sources, please change the version string in
configure.in to 2.1.1 before committing. 


The autoconf support included is only the basic stuff.  We need to go
through the sources and weed out obnoxious preprocessor stuff like:

	#if defined ___AIX || defined _AIX || defined __QNX__ || 
	    defined ___AIXV3 || defined AIXV3 || defined _SEQUENT_
	#include <sys/select.h>
	#endif

It can be replaced with:

	#if HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
	#include <sys/select.h>
	#endif

If it is not apparent why this is a win, see the "ifdefs considered
harmful" paper I mentioned previously.  No, scratch that; *EVERYONE*
should read the paper!

There are many of these kinds of changes to be done.  As time permits,
I'll be going through the code making these changes.  In a similar vein, I
would also like to clean up dud, crap, and duplicated code.  I'd like "gcc
-Wall" to compile with no diagnostics, for example. 

The changes I have in mind shouldn't interfere too badly with further
development work of Dominik & Dan.  So if there are no objections, I'll
feel free to do these commits in parallel with their work on the trunk.

Yes, good point.  

Normally, these are not built.  They are, however, all autoconfigured, and
you can do:

	./configure
	make; make install
	cd extras/foo
	make; make install

to install the extra module "foo".  

On the other hand, if you want to build & install everything, you can
treat the "extra" modules on the same footing as the regular modules.  If
you do:
	./configure --enable-extras
	make; make install

then all the "extra" modules are built and installed alongside the regular
ones.  

***** important NOTE for distribution builders: you need to use
'--enable-extras' before creating a tar file for distribution ("make
distcheck") otherwise the distribution won't properly handle the extra
modules.

Yeah, for some of it I did just give up.  If you are going to use any of
these, you have to check the comments in their Makefile.am files.

The C and C++ based modules do build & install, but not fvwmperl &
fvwmpython. 

I have never tested any of these.

Correct.  The C++ compiler is probed for, and the C++ code is skipped if
the compiler is not there.

I'd like a "--with-xyz-prefix" to go with the
"--with-xyz-{includes,library}" ...

checking iconpath... /usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps
Shouldn't be dup IMO..

Also... It doesn't install any system.fvwm2rc with 'make install'

This is on a solaris2.6 box...

This is so   trivial, I'm almost  embarrased to  mention it, but   you
missed the references to fvwm.tmpl in the fvwm.1 man page.

Whats going on in the ChangeLog file?  Is that some byproduct of using
emacs and  cvs?  I have no problem  adopting that style, and I've seen
changelogs that look   like that before, I  just  want to know how  to
accomplish it.

The only   drawback I see  is our  web site  contains the  text of the
changelog and offers that as end user documentation.  The format isn't
particularly readable for a non-developer.

I too was attacked by ghouls.  Co-incidence?

It would seem logical to work from version 2.1.0.  From  what I see of
CVS so  far,  it doesn't matter   too much if a  2.2.0  and 2.3.0  are
created before you are  done.  You can pretty  much merge  your branch
into any release.

> 	2) Do we have a consensus on Dan's request that I merge in my

I think you do.  There have been no objections so  far.  Since we have
StartsOnDesk, how could there be an objection to StartsOnPage?

> 	3) If yes to #2, and I get commit permission, what then? Do I branch,
> 	   or what? 

I think a   good rule is, always  create  a branch.   The merges  come
later.  Use a branch name  that is just words.   I think its too early
to target a release.

As I remember, one  of the reasons Starts on  page was held out  is it
co-opted one of the style flags and we were waiting for GSFR.

I never saw GSFR as much work.  Nor did I see it as a necessity.

Unless you are  feeling extra ambitious, I would  just add another int
to hold the flags you need, if that is still a consideration.  I think
you will  find  that pretty easy in   the current code.  (And I  don't
think it will complicate any GSFR in the future.)

Oh, I hope people don't feel embarassed to mention bugs!  As far as I'm
concerned, no bug is too trivial to get fixed. 

As for man pages: other than renaming all the files, (xxx.man --> xxx.1) I
have not touched them. In fact, I didn't even realise that the man page
mentions the configuration process!

That's emacs' "changelog" mode; nothing to do with CVS.  I vastly prefer
it because the entries are date- & person-stamped.  With >1 developer,
both of these features are vital, IMHO.

As far as accomplishing it, after editing some source file (anywhere in
the tree), do "CTRL-X 4 a".  Very cool.

Right.  The ChangeLog is for developers.  User-visible changes are written
up in a different file, called "NEWS" in the GNU conventions (I think).

No, I'd suggest basing any development on the main trunk.  Do an update to
pick up the stuff I did today.  (Use "cvs update -A" if you have any
sticky tags)

I don't even know what it is, but if Dan's in favour, I suspect that it's
a good idea.

Basically, Dominik's in charge of the tree, so it's up to him.  If the
changes are likely to be large and disruptive, then you'd likely want to
work on a branch.

Roughly speaking, there are only two parts of the tree worth worrying
about: the trunk, and the last beta version.  If you're going to start
work on some large change, I'd check out the last beta, create a branch,
and work from there.  If it's a small change, then I think the thing to do
is to submit a patch against the trunk to the maintainer.  Or just commit
it yourself, depending on the maintainer.

I think for the very, very near future just keep the changes in your
workspace.  The nice thing about CVS is that it's very easy to keep your
local changes up-to-date with the latest stuff in the tree, even if you
don't check it in.

We have been spending a lot of time talking about various ways this can
be done but I think there are two facts everyone agrees to at this
point:

 1) Dominik is in charge of the 2.2 release, and

 2) Whomever is in charge of the release gets to decide how it's
    handled.

As I see it, Dominik has 3 choices:

 a) Have everyone check in potential changes to an "alpha" branch, from
    which he'll merge changes he wants to keep into the mainline branch
    for beta dists and the release.

 b) Have everyone send him patches, which he'll apply (or not) to the
    mainline branch.

 c) Have everyone just check in their code, perhaps first mentioning the
    change being made to him for approval.

Of course, some combination depending on the size, etc. of the change is
also possible.  In short, you should ask Dominik how he wants to handle
it; perhaps after you've got it working in your workspace and can give
him an idea of the extent of the changes.

PS. I agree with Dan E. about the GSFR--'way overdue and I don't think
    it's that big a deal.  Several quite workable solutions have already
    been provided in detail on this list--I'm quite partial to the
    bitfields solution since I really like being able to see the flags
    set via a symbolic debugger, but YMMV.

    The reason I think people shy away from just making another int is
    they want to get the real solution done, and when you introduce a
    short-term solution like that it lets the pressure off :)

PPS. I don't think the GSFR is appropriate for 2.2--let's get a stable
     release out, dammit!  But it seems like a fine goal for 2.3/2.4.

As Steve points out, that's Emacs' changelog mode.  Quite handy.  C-x 4
a while point is in the function you changed, and voila.  Will group
changes for a single day, etc. etc.

Again, Steve has already mentioned that ChangeLog's _are_ developer
documentation.  The NEWS file is supposed to contain user-level change
documentation: new features, changes to old features, backward
compatibility warnings, etc. that users need to know.

I would like to encourage everyone to create changelogs.  On many GNU
projects the way it works is people submitting patches don't submit a
patch for the changelog, since that often breaks when the changelog is
so dynamic; instead they include the changelog entry first, as plain
text, then the patch below it.  For GNU make I try to never accept any
patch without a suitable ChangeLog entry.

OK... but we should add a notation to the NEWS file telling everyone who
has existing paths in their .fvwm2rc that (a) things install in
different places now, and (b) it's recommended that they don't put these
paths into their .fvwm2rc unless absolutely necessary.

I really think we need a better solution soon, though; (b) isn't really
a viable alternative many times.  For example, if people want to use 3rd
party modules like TkGoodStuff they either have to install it into the
fvwm version-specific modules directory (yuck!) or remember to change
their ~/.fvwm2rc file with each release--very error-prone.

And the PixmapPath and IconPath are even more problematic: I know very
few people who don't override one or both of those settings.

First, Steve, can you write a quicky-README for developers on how to
build the distribution, etc. using autoconf/automake (describe that you
(currently) need to run "make all" or similar before attempting "make
dist; give a pointer to make distcheck; etc.) 

Also, I understand why you are checking in derived files (like
configure), but I wonder if that's a bit dangerous?  What if someone
starts using a newer or older version of autoconf?  I can see the other
side, too: you may not want to require every beta tester to have a full
autoconf/automake set to get started.  Just curious as to your thoughts
on this.

Strange. I checked out the main branch after merging into a
new directory and got eveything.

There seems to be a lot of confusion how to go on.

What I planned is:

- No development is done on 2.0.47 or any of it's branches
  anymore.
- The main trunk gets new fixes and the few things we think
  are necessary (like StartsOnPage).
- All other development is branched off the main trunk
  (= pre_beta_2_1).
- No merges are done for the moment
- pre_beta_2_1 becomes the official new beta 2.1 this
  week.

How is the status about the main trunk? Something seems
to have gone wrong with my merge. Is it verified now that
everything is ok?

Bye

Don't you need to run "./configure" before making anyway, so then it's
just a case of running "./configure --enable-extras" instead?

Or do I have to re-generate the configure script using
autoconf/automake ?

Realistically, I don't  see  how I can  fight  GNU conventions, but  I
thought I just finished the WEB documentation update and  now I have a
new problem.

As you  are all probably aware,  fvwm has both  a ChangeLog and a NEWS
file.  Both were  being used as end  user documentation.   I guess I'm
going to  have to move  the old  ChangeLog stuff  into the  NEWS file?
Perhaps I'll remove the ChangeLog from the WEB interface.

One more comment/objection, I've always felt change history was better
placed  in individual  source files and  a number  of my changes  have
extensive change history in the source  files.  I believe Emacs/XEmacs
has a   number of  functions  that  support  this approach.    Too bad
'add-change-log-entry-other-window' doesn't have an  option to put the
changelog in both places.

Yes, in fact you need to run both "configure" and "make".  Just
configuring is not enough.  The point I was trying to get across is that
just configuring without enabling "extras" is *also* not enough.

So that there is no confusion, here is the recipe to generate a tar file
for distribution:

	./configure --enable-extras
	make
	make distcheck

If all goes well, at the end of the process, you will see the message:

	========================
	fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz is ready for distribution
	========================

Not the configure script, but you do need automake (and perhaps autoconf,
though I'm not certain) to regenerate the Makefile.in's.  This is the step
where the automatically-generated dependency information is put into the
makefiles.  Fortunately, this is all done magically by makefile rules when
you type "make distcheck"!

Hi,

The main trunk is OK.  I checked it out in a fresh directory and tested it
before announcing my changes.

Also, being in favour of fast development and marking every milestone, I
took the liberty of making it the official beta 2.1.0.

Sure.  Some of that info is in the README.autoconf file I distributed, but
I'll try to spell it out again here. 

As you observed, all the derived files (the configure script, config.h.in,
and all the Makefile.in's) are checked into the repository. Hence, you
need to know NOTHING about autoconf/automake to check out the sources and
build it.  NOR do you need to install these tools.  You can even hack on
the sources without these tools.

The ONLY time you need the tools is if you have to change a makefile or
the configure script.  Or if you want to build a tar file for
distribution.


Changing a Makefile
-------------------

First of all, NEVER edit anything named Makefile, or Makefile.in.  These
are both derived from the corresponding Makefile.am.  The most common
reason for editing is to change the list of sources. 

Steps: 1. edit foo/blah/Makefile.am
       2. re-run "make" from the top of the build directory

Step 2 will take care of rebuilding the Makefile.in and Makefile from your
changed Makefile.am.

Makefile.am has a simple format, basically:

	bin_PROGRAMS = fvwm2

	fvmw2_SOURCES = blah.c blah.h foo.c foo.h ...

Notice that you have to add all files, C-code *and* headers, to the
_SOURCES line.  This is vital, because this is the list of files that are
packed into the distribution.  If you leave one out, nobody will be able
to build the distributed tar file!


Changing configure.in
---------------------

The most common reason to do this is to change the version string.  If
you're editing it for any other reason, I will assume you know what you're
doing.

Steps: 1. edit configure.in, and find the line containing
          AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(fvwm, x.y.z) at the top of the file
       2. change x.y.z to the new version string
       3. re-run "make" from the top of the build directory

Step 3 will take care of rebuilding the configure script, and usually all
the other Makefiles.


Building a distribution
-----------------------

By this, I mean the file "fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz".

Steps: 1. make sure you have XPM and a C++ compiler
       2. configure with the flag --enable-extras
       3. make
       4. make distcheck
       5. ensure that you see the message 
	  "fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz ready for distribution"
          before uploading the tar file somewhere

One thing I've learned the hard way: 

	You have to configure with ALL THE OPTIONAL SUBDIRECTORIES
	in order to build a distribution!

In short: this means you need Xpm, and a C++ compiler, AND you have to
configure using the flag --enable-extras.  The reason for this is that a
couple of subdirectories are only built when using Xpm (xpmroot, for
example) or C++ (extras/FvwmConfig).  It is fine for end users to not
build these.  However, the distribution-maker has to have all the
directories enabled, else the files don't make it into the distribution
tar file. 

Similarly, you need to have actually built everything before packing the
distribution, hence step #3.  Among other things, this puts into the
Makefile.in's the proper dependency information. 

Step 4 will create the tar file, then unpack it and attempt a build &
install (to a scratch directory, not /usr/local).  This makes sure that
you really DID include all the files necessary to build the package into
the tar file. It may be hard to appreciate how useful this is, until it
has reminded you that you forgot file "foo.h" in some _SOURCES line.  But
trust me, it will save your bacon in this way some day!

Hmm.  I suspect that if anyone is using a different version of
autoconf/automake that generates INCORRECT Makefile.in's, it will be
discovered and rectified rather quickly.  Certainly before any
distribution is made. 

I suppose one problem is if developers A and B use different versions of
automake, say, and both generate CORRECT but different Makefile.in's from
the same Makefile.am. Then the Makefile.in would keep getting checked in
unnecessarily.  That would be a waste of space in the repository and
generate unnecessarily large diffs.  This is annoying, certainly, but
perhaps not a fatal flaw.

Maybe we could just agree on using a common version of autoconf and
automake?  Since the latter hasn't been updated in years, it would be
surprising to find someone with an older version.  But I hear it is being
maintained again, so newer versions are a possibility.  Automake is also
actively maintained, though, and it is more likely to be the culprit in
generating the Makefile.in's.  I'm using 1.3b.

As everything is, it's a tradeoff against not requiring everyone to have
auto*.  I think that benefit is worth the risk, but I have no real
experience with this in the real world.  Do other groups find this a huge
problem?  Are there other problems with checking in derived files that
I've overlooked?

It seems config.h wasn't put into this module so somewhere at the top
of FvwmIconMan.h add 
#include "config.h"

and in FvwmIconMan.c
change VERSION on line 16 and 195 to MYVERSION

and you are all set.

Um, doesn't that embed in the tarfile the system-specific properties
discovered by the ./configure above?  IE, a user building from the
tarfile should re-run ./configure themselves, no?

Nope.

Yes, certainly.  The Makefiles are not distributed, only Makefile.in's.
Installers must ALWAYS run configure before building.

Good point.  

During conversion, configure.h got replaced with config.h, and version.h
was removed entirely.  I did the following to each source file

	sed -e 's/".*configure.h"/"config.h"/' \
	    -e '/".*version.h"/d'

so if the file never included configure.h before, it will not include
config.h now. 

But this is just a quick hack, as I did not arrange the order of the
includes. To properly do this, the #include "config.h"  (yes, quotes not
braces) should come BEFORE everything else in the file.  This allows you
to pick up the HAVE_FEATURE-type macros to use later on, as in

	#include "config.h"

	#if HAVE_SYS_TIME_H
	#include <sys/time.h>
	#endif

I haven't done any of these kinds of changes yet, so all module
maintainers feel free to start checking for this.

However, there is so much duplication, that I think that a lot of this
could be factored out into lib/fvwmlib.h or something.  I started on
libs/System.h to catch the very common system stuff, but again it's only a
work-in-progress.

I think that's a good idea.  The itemized lists that were used as
ChangeLog previously are better suited to end users.  They are nearly
useless to me as a developer.

Or maybe just label it as "developer stuff"?

One argument in favour of collecting the changes into a common ChangeLog,
rather than scattered through individual source files is that adding
feature X may involve changing several files in different places of the
source tree.  A single ChangeLog allows you to collect all the changed
files together in one entry, and gives a better overall picture of what
happened.  If the changes are only noted inside individual files, you'd
have to cross-reference each change, and run the risk of forgetting to
note that the change to a/foo.c also involves b/blah.h.

Having said that, there is the possibility to have multiple ChangeLogs.
One in the modules directory, for example to catch changes to all modules,
(one in extras for extras/*) and one in the top to catch changes in fvwm/
and libs/, etc.  The algorithm for emacs' "ctrl-x 4 a" is: search upwards
in the directory structure for a file named ChangeLog, and use the first
one found.

My build of 2.1.0 went OK at home on a Sparc  1+, Solaris 2.5.1, using
gcc.  I didn't check why yet, but I have  a working g++, but configure
said it didn't work, so I just compiled with --without-cxx.
(I will find out why.)

I built from a parallel directory, not within  the source tree.  Sun's
make didn't cut it, but gnumake 3.75 did fine.

I'm now  trying the same  thing at work, Ultra  5,  Solaris 2.6, Sun's
compiler.  Same attempt  to build outside the  source tree.  This time
configure says both   C and C++  work.   Sun's make isn't   happy, and
gnumake won't work either.  At work I seem  to be on an older gnumake,
(3.63).

The error I get is:

fork> gnumake   
gnumake  all-recursive
gnumake[1]: Entering directory `/u/tools/dane/fvwm/build_version-2_1_0'

Here is the stuff around line 219 in the libs directory:

mostlyclean-depend:

Line 219 is the -include.


I have a copy of 3.75 here, so I'll try that.

No it doesn't.  At least, I checked out the 2.1.0 version and there's no
NEWS file there...

Another file that's part of the "GNU standards" that we might like to
add is the AUTHORS file; it can be painful to come up with the first
version but it's a nice thing to have afterwards.

As Steve points out, I like ChangeLogs as-is since you can go to one
file and look through it for all changes, rather than having them spread
out.

Plus, having a separate file I think makes it more likely people will
document more changes: since you can always rename the ChangeLog to
something else and start a new one if it gets too big people don't worry
about being verbose.  I think after a file's log gets too large people
start being very terse :)

I actually think it's appropriate for _each_ module to have its _own_
changelog.  After all, they're entirely separate entities and it doesn't
really seem useful to put all their changes into one place.  In the
Emacs dist. for example, there's a changelog for Emacs source, a
different one for the Lisp directory, different one for the widget
libraries, etc. etc.

But, that's up to the individual module maintainer, I guess.  Definitely
one for the modules and one for the extras directory is a bare-minimum.

Sorry guys,

I have lost my orientation a bit, how is the current version
on the main trunk labeled (2.1.0)?

BTW, I wanted to create a new directory 'archive' in the
tree where all development-internal files can be placed.
This is not distributed, so the e.g. Changelog can be
moved there.

Bye

Well, "current version" is too ambiguous a term.  

The repository has a version tagged "version-2_1_0", which is what I used
to build fvwm-2.1.0.tar.gz.

After that, the convention is that the trunk is considered an alpha
version, leading up to the next beta.  Hence it will not be tagged again
until considered stable enough to be a "beta" (i.e. 2.1.1).  At a bare
minimum, I'd suggest that "stable enough for beta" mean that "make
distcheck" properly complete. 

By the way, the version string in configure.in should be changed to 2.1.1. 
I did a commit this morning but forgot to change this string!

Hiding ChangeLog from distribution is not a good idea.  As an installer, I
find it invaluable when tracking down bugs in the package, if I'm not a
developer.  Moreover, GNU standards dictate it be distributed, and you
have to fight with the auto* tools if you go against GNU standards.  It's
not usually worth the trouble. 

I see little reason for hiding stuff from installers anyway.  If it is
important enough to put into the source tree, then distribute it!  If it
doesn't belong in the source tree, then put it on your web page and tell
fvwm-workers about it.

Sorry, I didn't notice that file.  I meant something in the dist itself,
just as you have it, not necessarily to the mailing list (although
that's handy too :).

Can I suggest: (a) it be renamed to DEVELOPERS or README.devel or
something, and (b) you rework it to put the "how to" stuff at the top
and merge in some of the details you provide below, and put the history
of changes, etc. at the bottom for historical purposes--in a release or
two, after it becomes second nature, no one will probably be too
interested in how the conversion was done initially :)

You might even consider not distributing it with fvwm proper; I guess it
depends on whether we expect people doing active development on fvwm to
have CVS access or not.  Obviously anyone creating distributions will
have it :)

Newer versions are absolutely on the near horizon.  Definite plans have
been announced on the autoconf lists for the 2.13 release.  I think
there's an anon-CVS repository for autoconf hosted at Cygnus (where
automake is), too.

Note that both automake and autoconf allow you to specify a minimal
version of tool and will fail if you try to use older versions of
autoconf or automake with those files: you should add this line to your
configure.in:

  AC_PREREQ(2.12)

and this line to Makefile.am (at least the top-level one):

  AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = 1.3

(not sure if you can put 1.3b in there?)  This will provide some minimal
sanity-checking.  See the relevant docs for more details.

I don't know; there was just a long discussion of this on the
autoconf/automake lists.  I just thought I'd raise the issue.

I, personally, don't check in derived files into the GNU make
repository.  But I don't expect anyone to be building that except
someone familiar enough with things to get it working.  GNU make is not
really a "bazaar" development effort at the moment, I'm the only one
changing files :).

GNU make 3.63 is too old; that version didn't support -include.

Sorry, you're right.  There is  a news.html at  the Fvwm Official Home
Page site.  Its the ChangeLog, FAQ, and TO-DO files  that are run thru
a script to create HTML.

It looks  like  in the  past,   they were run  thru  something  called
txt2html that I think  came from Chuck.  I've  written my own, but I'm
starting to think I won't need it.

My plan right now is to take everything I've re-worked  and dump it in
the doc directory.  Then Jason can just copy it out of the source tree
into the filesystem the web page uses.

Since the source tree will have a FAQ.html, I think that makes the FAQ
text  file  redundant.    Probably the  same  applies   for all  these
text/HTML files.

extras/FvwmCommand/FvwmCommand.c won't compile on SunOS because it uses
strerror().

I think the Right Thing is to move the definition of strerror() that's
currently in fvwm/builtins.c into some file in libs so it appears in the
fvwm library, then all modules get it "for free".

Even better, longer term, would be to provide some kind of error
messaging function in the library that could generically display errors,
etc. either graphically or to stderr or a log file or whatever.

This module has some issues:

 1) It uses the ANSI C runtime library div(), but SunOS doesn't provide
    one, nor its associated type div_t.  In about 90 seconds of looking
    around I didn't see anything that looked like an appropriate
    substitute.

    I suggest configure looks for the div() function and
    extras/FvwmScript/Instructions.c be modified to test HAVE_DIV and if
    it's not set, the RemainderOfDiv() function should just print an
    error message whenever invoked.

 2) Various functions in this module also use memmove(), which isn't
    available on SunOS either.

    I think this is another useful thing to add to libfvwm so that all
    modules can make use of standard C features without special code;
    a test for memmove() should be added to configure and maybe add
    something like this to libs/fvwmlib.h:

    #ifndef HAVE_MEMMOVE
    # define memmove(_t,_f,_n)  bcopy(_f,_t,_n)
    #endif

After this, I was able to get 2.1.0 (updated as of about two hours ago)
to build and install on SunOS with --enable-extras.

I don't have the actual file, but I can approximate.

Looks like the growth is mainly the textures directory and
sample.fvwmrc/BradyMontz/roots.

I have mixed feelings about that stuff being in the package.
At this time we are not really using it, and there are other ways of
acquiring it.

Yup. We should put that in a separarate 'distribution'.
The gzipped package is nearly too big to fit on a
floppy already.

OK, I mentioned this beacause the was some discussion about the
Changelog. The real reason is the experimental stuff I wanted to
put in there. I have created an .indent.pro for indent to run
over the code someday, a file about copyright issues, a list
of option for lclint etc. That stuff doesn't belong into the
distribution but should be conserved somewhere with the version
it refers to.

Not everybody has a web page (i.e. I do not). Anyway, some stuff
should be placed in the same structure as the revision it belongs
to.

I will introduce this directory and we will if/how we remove
it from the distribution.

I have now created an 'archive' directory for stuff that is
obsolete, experimental or just doen not belong in the
distribution but should be kept with the revisions.

  jlt> I've moved the file.  Ummm, wow, it's 50% bigger than 2.0.26.

Yeah, I noticed that too: the dist is getting to be of decidedly
un-fvwm-like size.

A lot of that is the modules in extras; they're almost as big as the
normal modules.  The other biggy is the textures directory.  Here's the
top sized items from the top-level directory (using du; numbers are in
K):

 1960    modules
 1776    extras
 1056    textures
 864     fvwm
 804     icons
 772     sample.fvwmrc
 140     libs
 136     configure
 112     docs
 68      utils
 48      FAQ
 40      ChangeLog
 36      xpmroot
 12      aclocal.m4
 12      TO-DO
 12      Makefile.in
 12      INSTALL.fvwm

Everything else is under 10K.

I think we should give serious consideration to moving the icons and the
textures, and more advanced stuff in sampe.fvwmrc, into a separate
distribution.  Not only are they large, but they're not installed
anywhere and they don't have much to do with Fvwm itself.  I don't
really see the need for them to be under CVS control, or marked with a
certain version of Fvwm.  Perhaps some of the basic icons could be kept
if there are modules, etc. that depend on them.

Hopefully the themes stuff will take off, then people can go get
complete themes separately from fvwm itself and all that will be
obsolete.

We can also consider moving the extras modules into a separate dist, but
that might be harder to do.  We might take a harder look at the stuff in
extras and decide what of it is _really_ up to the level of being
included in the dist, even in the extras directory.

I think, also, that the existing modules might be re-examined, and with
respect to the extras versions.  For example, it seems like there are
about 5 modules for dynamically interacting with fvwm; yes, it's cool
that we can do it but do we really need all these ways?  I'd prefer to
see one module, or at most two (an interactive one and a script one).

We also have FvwmSave and FvwmSaveDesk, and a large number of
button-bar/icon manager/window list things, etc.

I think it would be nice to combine FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 into a generic
"preprocessor module".  Or does this even need to be a module; maybe
it'd be simpler and smaller to create some kind of parameterized
"include" feature in the fvwm config language that allows you to specify
an (optional) preprocessor command and reads its output.  Dunno.

FvwmAudio seems to be obsolescent; we should either remove it or
relegate it to the extras area, I think.

Probably more stuff.

I have skimmed through the code to find out what the individual
copyrights are. I believe nearly all files are clean enough
to be put under GNU public license. You can find the results
in archive/Copyrights. Please have a look at that file and tell
me your opinion about the assumption in there.

The file archive/COPYING contains a slightly limited GPL that
puts all code except the stuff I am not sure about under GPL.
I think this should be put into the distribution, just to
avoid future conflicts with copyrights.

Any comments on the files and the ideas within are welcome.
I don't know that legal stuff well enough.

I attempted to check fvwm with lclint. The results were -
overwhelming ;-) After spending a hard hour looking through
all the warnings I came to the conclusion that the largest
part comes from X11 functions that return values through
pointers (lclint whines because the variables are usually
undefined when the pointer is used).

Does anybody have any experience with this? I do not want
to disable this warning completely. Perhaps there is a way 
to tell lclint which functions are OK. Any hints?

I have prepared the file archive/cvs-howto.txt. For now it is
mostly empty, but if some CVS crack could fill the templates
therein we will soon have a nice documentation on how to use
CVS for fvwm. Feel free to add new sections for the things I
forgot.

I have done some code/copyright cleanup in various modules
and the fvwm dir. All changes are allpied to the main trunk.

(I built in a very small featur to FvwmButtons too 8-)
The option Left/Right/Center aligns the contents of the
button to the left/right or center of the button).

	Well, dang, Dan, when you rewrote the name_list handling code you
chopped out half the stuff that StartsOnPage had to patch! What're you
trying to do, make life easy for me?  ;-)  Nice work!

	Finally got it working, still using Saturday night's CVS snapshot.
It's late. I'm tired. I'll sync up with CVS tomorrow evening and rebuild.

	For anyone who's interested in the scope of the change, it hits
the following:

	misc.h
	screen.h
	add_window.c
	builtins.c
	fvwm.c
	placement.c
	style.c
	fvwm2.1

	Dan: StartsOnPage doesn't interfere with any of the style flags.
It uses the StartsOnDesk flag, and acts like a StartsOnDesk-Plus. It was
Robert Joop's earlier stab at StartsOnPage that expropriated one of the
other style flags.

Not quite right: bcopy() doesn't make any statements about what
happens if the memory areas overlap.  memmove() makes sure the right
thing happens.

Thanks.  It really need it didn't it?  I have  a plan to get back into
the style  matching code someday.  Has anyone  else ever  noticed that
the style matching is a little illogical?

As it is, a style   is matched to the   "Name", or the "Class" or  the
"Resource", but never the "Icon Name".  But you can't say, I want this
one to only match "Class", or only "Name" or "Resource".

I have yet to think up a syntax but I know something should be done.

Once again my memory fails me.

HI All,
	Nice to see lots of progress. Feels like the constipation is over.

The configure stuff is nice but I have a problem with building in the
extras directory.  I ran configure --enable-extras but I still had to
fix the following:

FvwmCommand:
	failed to compile due to trying to include <X11/xpm.h>.  Fixed by
adding $(xpm_CFLAGS) to INCLUDES = line in Makefile.am
	failed to compile due to including sun_headers.h. Fixed by removing
include.

FvwmConfig:
	failed to link due to missing symbols cout and cerr in WinBase.C. Don't
know how to fix this.

FvwmConsole:
	same as FwmCommand, same fixes

FvwmDebug:
	failed to compile due to trying to include <X11/xpm.h>. Same fix as
FvwmCommand

FvwmPipe:
	same as FvwmDebug

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi All,	
	I like to define my menus thus: 

DestroyMenu CDEMenu
AddToMenu CDEMenu
+ "&File Mangler	%Dthome.t.xpm%"	        Exec dtfile
+ "&Rubbish Bin		%Dttrsh.t.xpm%"	        Exec dtaction Dttrash
+ "&Style Mangler	%Dtstyle.t.xpm%"	Exec dtstyle
+ "&Toolbox		%Dtapps.t.xpm%"	        Exec dtaction Dtappmgr

The AddToMenu with no label and no action causes a separator to be put
at the top of the menu.  If I add a title as the first + line the
separator is replaced with the title.  If I add a title later on the
separator appears after the title. I know this isn't the documented way
to use AddToMenu but it means my menu defs are nicely lined up and don't
have to start half way across the page.

Is a fix easy?

Cheers,
Tim.

That is a fix I made for some strange behaviour when adding empty
entries to a menu. Obviously I didn't consider the case when the
'AddToMenu' line is empty. My idea was that the title should be added
always to the top of the menu. I will check this.

OK, a new version of gnumake restarted my adventure.

I found that  for what I am  trying to do,  (build outside the  source
tree), Sun's compiler is definitly out.  At least SunPro3.0:

/opt/SUNWspro3.0/bin/cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../version-2_1_0/libs\
  -I.. -I../../version-2_1_0  -I/opt/public/include \
  -g -c ../../version-2_1_0/libs/GetFont.c
command line: fatal: invalid arg for option M  D: No such file or directory
cc: acomp failed for ../../version-2_1_0/libs/GetFont.c

I think  this might have  something to do  with the compiler trying to
come up with dependency information.

I finally got a working version with gcc/g++.

I would have liked to get the modules  and fvwm2 in the same directory
but  I couldn't figure out the  right options for config to accomplish
it.     The are  both    platform/release  specific binaries,  I'm not
understanding why they can't installed in the same place.

I used:

../version-2_1_0/configure \
  --bindir=/opt/public/src/fvwm.version-2_1_0 \
  --libexec=/opt/public/src/fvwm.version-2_1_0 \
  --prefix=/opt/public \
  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib\
  --with-xpm-includes=/opt/public/include --with-xpm-library=/opt/public/lib

The other   problem  I had  is  with   "-R".   Like lots  of   Solaris
installations, we don't have XPM installed in the Solaris directories,
so I    used "--with-xpm-library"  and  "--with-xpm-includes".   I was
hoping that config would take the xpm library and apply the "-R" to it
automatically, but as I found out,  it didn't.  I probably didn't need
to  include /usr/openwin/lib  in  "--x-libraries", but  I wanted to be
sure fvwm2 would look in /usr/openwin/lib first.

I can live with these 2 issues, just thought I'd mention them.

All and all, I'd say the "autoconf" change is a definite improvement.

Is there a list of planned patches?

I'd like to see Germans patch and the SnapAttraction patch go in.

I've got the following if anyone is interested:
1) keypad_resize.patch to allow the keypad numbers to be used in
resizing, also changes the default movement to be one resize increment
if the window has it set.

2) animnull.patch to speed up animated moves that don't actually go
anywhere. Honest, I have them (as part of a taskbar hiding thing that
slides the taskbar out of the way on every focus change).

3) animovpat.patch to make a new command AnimatedMoveNoWarp which does
an animated move without the cursor following.

4) menumove.patch which fixes a bug in moves invoked from a menu

These are all patched to 2.0.47d (RIP) but I can rework them if
necessary.  I don't have a CVS that can do ftp so I'll have to get betas
from the ftp site and email the patches to the mailing list or the
pumpking.

Cheers,
Tim.

Tim,

  Perhaps someone will volunteer  to apply these patches.  I  actually
had them saved and was hoping to  get to them.  Is  there some way you
could get a CVS  that does ftp working?  Everyone  that has CVS update
access is on their own mission, (I know I am).

Now that I'm able to build, and I've caught up on my job again,
I'd like to publish the web page updates.

Any objection to:

1)  Adding  the changes   to the main   branch?  I  don't  see how new
documentation can de-stabilize 2.1.0....

2) Removing ChangeLog from the web documentation.

3) Removing the FAQ and TO-DO text files, to be replaced with
docs/FAQ.html and docs/TO-DO.html.

4) Removing docs/modules.css and docs/modules.tex.

5) Having the web documentation in the docs directory.  I know it will
add size, but I think it belongs there.  Here is the current size:

I don't plan to hold back any patches. The only problem is
that we can not do everything at once.

I may have put some of these in the menu_postition code already.
I can do that again (this was easy).

He? You cannot do ftp so you will have to use ftp?? What is

Don't get any ideas ;-). I think Dan said he would look through
the mail archive and compile a list of patches (Is that right,
Dan?).

As our crossing  mails showed, that's right.   But I haven't committed
to a time frame...yet.

I still have a bunch of other things queued up.

I'm  not sure I   made it  clear, I  only  had  SOME  of  the  patches
mentioned.

I really don't want to mess with the CVS we have here, we use it for
real work(TM) and I don't want to risk breaking the stuff I get paid to
do.

I'm not desperate to get my stuff in the "Official Stable Spangly
FVWM2.2" but if anyone wants the patches just ask.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS I'm thinking of changing Focus to move the windowlist around so that
the WindowList menu always starts with the current window.  I think by
doing this we can at last provide a parallel to the windows Alt-TAB
behaviour by using 
WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry prev_[cond]_flipfocus

At the moment the above works when changing focus with the mouse but
when Using Prev or Next the windowlist stays the same.  I'm not talking
about rearranging the order just altering the origin that WindowList
starts from.

There is no reason to hurry. It is more important that
no patches are lost. How about putting them in the
archive directory (with sensible names)?

What patches do you mean? I am collecting patches from both
lists too.

Can you rephrase that my limited intellect can understand what
you want to do (max. 5 words per sentence, colorful examples,
lots of pictures etc.)? 8-)

Jason mentioned that he was going to install Jitterbug.
I think that might be a better place for them.

Just some of the ones Tim mentioned.

Since I somehow got unsubscribed from the fvwm list for a while,
I'm sure I missed a lot of patches.

Nope, this isn't correct.  The BSD versions (bcopy, bzero, bcmp) all
handle overlapping memory correctly (well, bzero doesn't care of course
:).

It's the ANSI functions that make a distinction between functions that
can be used with overlapping memory and ones that don't, thus you need
memmove() vs. memcpy().

To quote from the SunOS man pages ...

     bcopy() copies length bytes from string b1 to the string b2.  Overlap-
     ping strings are handled correctly.

I would rather see this all in a format that could be converted to HTML,
MAN, TEX, or TXT type formats. Perl's "pod" (perlpod) is one of these. I
personally do not want to grock an html file while installing new releases
of anything. I do like to put them up for users however. I also like to
print them out once in a while and read them while helping the kids with
their homework.

Not quite sure about the extent of the changes you're considering: I
don't have strong opinions on converting, say, the FAQ and TODO lists to
html.

However, I think the NEWS file needs to be kept text and available at
the top level of the distribution.  It's so useful to have that file
immediately available right where expected: people are very used to it
and look there for new features, gotchas, etc. with every upgrade.
These days whenever I open a new package tarball I always expect/hope to
see these files at the top level:

  COPYING
  ChangeLog
  INSTALL
  NEWS
  README
  configure

Seeing that makes me happy :)

OK but no pictures.

Windows A B C D.

Prev [A] FlipFocus.
Windowlist gives A at top.

Move mouse to C.
Windowlist has C at top.
A is 2 on list.

Prev [D] FlipFocus.
WindowList has D at top.
C is 2 on list.
A is 3 on list.

Prev [A] Focus.               <----- I'd change this to give:
WindowList has D at top.             WindowList has A at top.
C is 2 on list.                      D is 2 on list.
A is 3 on list.                      C is 3 on list.

End of short sentence bit.

I think this will involve getting the focus command to move the
windowlist start pointer to the focused window as well as moving the
screen->focus pointer.  I think it is only the Focus command that can
leave the WindowList with the currently focussed window not at position
1.  Mouse focus and clicktofocus just move the window to the top of the
list as does FlipFocus.  I need to be careful that Next and Prev will
still cycle around the windows and maybe the code that adds new windows
to the list may have to be changed to put them at the end of the list if
they don't get the focus when they are mapped.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hm.  Yes, if you want to build from CVS source you likely need GCC (and
GNU make).  If you examine the makefile you'll see that the actual rule
run is different than the one printed: it adds GCC specific options that
allow for dependency tracking (as you surmised).

The Automake manual sez:

  Automatic dependency tracking
   ...
     Currently this support requires the use of GNU `make' and `gcc'.

I don't think it has anything to do with building in or out of the
source tree, per se.  Definitely if you want to build out of the source
tree you need GNU make, both for the CVS source and the distribution
tarball.

You can, though, turn dependency tracking off.  One problem is you won't
get dependency tracking, and the other problem is you have to modify the
Makefile.am file to do it :(.  The manual sez:

     Automatic dependency tracking can be suppressed by putting
  `no-dependencies' in the variable `AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS'.

That sucks because you might forget to change Makefile.am back before
committing your changes :-/.

The idea is that fvwm2 goes into a bin directory everyone has on their
PATH (like /usr/local/bin), and the modules don't go there because
they're not directly executable but instead invoked as subprocesses.
These kinds of "helper programs" go in libexec so they're out of the
way.  Anyway, that's the GNU guidelines; they do it this way rather than
the "package" method Sun, etc. use where each package goes into its own
subdirectory under /opt (or whatever).

With Emacs, for example, the "emacs" executable goes in /usr/local/bin
but all the helper apps like movemail, etc. go in libexec/emacs.

I'd say this is a bug; any -L paths specified to configure should be
turned into -R options on those systems which require that.  One day
maybe we'll have readline shared libs, etc., too.

Not trying to convince you to do this, really, but just a note to say
you can always get CVS 1.10 and install it somewhere else, or install it
using the --program-prefix or --program-suffix options so it's "gcvs" or
whatever, and you can have both available: one for "normal" work and one
for accessing remote CVS archives.  Within the last 6-8 months I've
noticed a _huge_ increase in the number of packages allowing anon-CVS
access.

Ok, I was looking at the HPUX manpages.   They make no mention about
what happens to overlapping strings.  Neither do the GNU manpages.

I'd rather leave TODO as a straight text file.  I think of it as a
developer-kind of file -- like a ChangeLog -- used for jotting down short
notes.  Having to write stuff in HTML makes it cumbersome to use in this
way.

As for FAQ; is there no way we could keep it in text?  I find it helpful
if what I need to know to install a package is available in text.  This
would be the files INSTALL*, README*, but the FAQ file is also often
useful.  If you prefer to write the FAQ in HTML, you can always use "lynx
-dump" to derive a reasonable text file from it. 

> 4) Removing [...] docs/modules.tex.

I assume the content of modules.tex is somewhere in the html files?  If
so, then I have no problem removing it.

Yes, very likely the problem is with the dependency-tracking, NOT with
building in a separate dir.  

I guess it bears repeating:

	*** If you pull sources from CVS, you will need GNU gcc ***
 
The ability to build outside the source tree is a completely separate
issue, and has to do with how your make handles VPATH, I think.  Gnu make,
of course, works, and I think some vendor makes also work.  I know that
IRIX make loses, but I thought sunos' make worked. 

> I finally got a working version with gcc/g++.

So now you can do "make distcheck" with gcc.  All the dependency-tracking
stuff is gone from the tarball's Makefile.in's, so you can use it to check
if your vendor compiler & make will build it.

Here's one way to get them both in the same place:

    configure --bindir=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.1.0 \
	      --libexecdir=/opt/public/src

Note that the option is 'libexecdir', not 'libexec', and that at present
"fvwm/${VERSION}" is added to it to form the module directory.

[The other way is to specify FVWM_MODULEDIR=/bla during the "make" and
"make install" commands.]

Would people prefer a "--moduledir" option for configure that defaults to 
the current ${libexecdir}/fvwm/${VERSION} ?

How about a "--configdir" option for the default location of
"system.fvwm2rc"?

The old technology was a script called "txt2html" which I guess Jason
ran that wrapped some html around the FAQ, TO-DO and ChangeLog.

I made a version of that shell and we could go that way.  However,
this is what the front of the new FAQ looks like:

======================================================================
                   FVWM Frequently Asked Questions
======================================================================

INDEX

        1) What does FVWM stand for?
        2) Where do I find the current versions of fvwm?
        3) Any WWW Sites about FVWM?
        4) Where do I ask questions about FVWM?
        5) What are the differences between FVWM 1.xx and 2.xx?


I didn't think that was any  harder to edit, and  it eliminates a step
in the release process.

Whether we like black stone backgrounds  pink titles and white text is
another issue, which I imagine we will be addressing soon.

Of  course, no information has  been lost, and its  even a little more
complete and correct than it was before.

I will install Jitterbug.  It's yet another of the things waiting on me

Tell me one more time that you want the NEWS in the main directory and
I will go back to the txt2html approach.  I thought the main issue was
the extra work Jason had to go thru at each release.

I too,  would look for NEWS  in the main directory,  but I  might also
wander into the "docs" directory.

I don't see this as  an autoconf issue, the  txt2html step should only
have to take place at our web site.

Actually that was all Chuck's doing.  The web pages are originally his;
I've just done minor editing by hand.

So, I started up the FvwmAnimate module (based on the latest stuff in
CVS as of this morning or so) and it's pretty neat.

If I select options from the menu lists, they all (seem to) work.

But, if I select the "Custom Settings" option and get the FvwmForm
dialogue (way cool feature reuse there! :), nothing ever seems to take
effect regardless of what button I push.

I tried modifying the Effect, then using either or both of Apply or
Apply&Save, but nothing changes.  If I reopen the dialogue, it's all
back as it was.

PS. I wonder if anyone's considered the ability to have "checkbox
    menus", where one or more items on the menu can be "selected"?  You
    could probably fake it with mini-pixmaps or something, but you'd
    have to Destroy/recreate the whole popup each time.

Obviously it worked/works for me.

As you may see, on apply, FvwmForm is supposed to generate a series of
"*FvwmAnimate" commands.   Try recompiling FvwmAnimate with  debug on.
You should see the commands coming into FvwmAnimate.

More features in FvwmForm would be nice.

If you've ever tried to use it for help, you will see it falls short.
All the text lines look like they are double spaced.

I'd also like to be able to change fonts and colors as I go.

I once   started  this, switched  to   FvwmHtml, and then   decided to
re-think what I really wanted.

I take back what I said about the FAQ.  I'm okay with it as HTML.
Whatever the FAQ-maintainer feels is easiest for him/her to maintain is
the way to go.

However, I do think the NEWS and TODO (not "TO-DO") should be straight
text files in the toplevel, as per GNU standards.  ;-)

OK, I'm back to the txt2html approach.  If I use txt2html for NEWS and
TODO, I might as well do the FAQ the same way.  Yes,  I got it, rename
the TO-DO file.

Hi Steve,

Distributors like debian keep asking us about this. The copyright
situation is quite unclear in the code. There are lots of different
styles of copyrights. Most of them allow anyone to do anything they
like with the code as long as the copyright is not touched. I.e.
anyon can take fvwm and sell it as a proprietary product and enhance
it without giving anything back to the communnity. This is probably
no more fair than re-licensing existing code. I think most of the
copyrights aloow us to put it under GPL, but that is one of the
reasons I contacted the FSF for. Personally I *do* mind if someone
puts my code in a proprietary product. I do not want to be paid for
my work, but I do not want anyone to make money with it without
contributing to the community.

Bye

Does anyone know the portable autoconf-way to do this?  Would libtool

I have this in .fvwm2rc:

  Mouse 1		R   	A       Menu Utilities

In the "old days" (2.0.4x?) if I clicked mouse-1 on the root, the menu
popped up and stuck, then I would move the mouse over an item and click
to select it.

If I pressed mouse-1 without releasing, the menu popped up and I could
drag to the item I wanted then release the mouse to select it.

Now, with the latest CVS stuff, it always behaves the first way (sticks
and I have to click again to select) even if I press-and-drag.

Thoughts?

Actually, I meant fvwm's builtin menus, not FvwmForm stuff: I was
thinking of the menus FvwmAnimate creates to select different speeds,
modes, etc. and how you can't tell what the _current_ setting is from
those menus.

Indeed.

A year or so ago I posted a whole laundry list of things I wish FvwmForm
did.  Tops on my list are cutting and pasting in the text fields (!!!),
a few extra command language operators, and maybe some simple keybindings.

No one seems to be working on FvwmForm.  Someone encouraged me to try
FvwmScript which seems a _lot_ more advanced, with almost a whole
language there.  I never tried it because it didn't compile on SunOS
(see my reports on this over the last two days), and obviously you can't
use it for configuring FvwmAnimate unless it moved out of the extras/
directory into the mainstream.

Ultimately, I guess, I'd prefer to see a forms module that was based on
a more standard scripting language, rather than a whole new one.  Maybe
Guile/Tk or something.  Obviously the problem here is that it kind of
sucks that standard modules need other packages like Guile/Tk to work.

What's FvwmHtml?

I believe the reason why this has changed is that you might
accidentally select an entry if the pointer was near the bottom
when you clicked. Might be that this was one of the bugfixes I
applied, but I am not sure. Did it still work in 47d?

Doesn't  seem ideal  but  thanks for reminding  me, whatever configure
sets up, make is going to let me have my way with.

Yes, please.  That seems much more straight forward.

Yep.

I currently do icons by hand.  My fvwm2 shell exports FVWMICONS and my
users .fvwm2rc's have  "PixmapPath $FVWMICONS".  The point  being, the
icons need installation too.

I have got some feedback on this by some holders of the
copyrights of some of the files in the distribution.
Overall most people would be more happy if we put fvwm
under some kind of 'open source' license and I have
no objections against that. In the end we will have a
COPYING file with a few exceptions, but all would have
one in common: the right to distribute is granted if
the copyrights are left intact. The one exception are
the twm copyrights which furter demand that no advertising
is done with the name of the copyright holders.

Can we live with that?

archive/COPYING2 is another (much shorter) draft of a
COPYING file (without GPL) that just grants the right
to distribute (with some limitations for the twm-
copyrighted files). Modifying the code is still handled
in the individual files, but this may be a good start.

Any comments?

Oh sorry, no wonder I couldn't  completely parse what you were saying.
I certainly could  tear down and  re-create the menus after a  setting
change.  It did occur to  me that after I  did the "Custom" thing, the
menus were somewhat redundant...

Sorry,  I'm not being  very clear.  I started  to write  a module that
would accept commands like:

*FvwmHtml<H1><font color="pink">Cool Idea of the Week</font></H1>
*FvwmHtml<P>
*FvwmHtml<A href="Module XXX">Click Here<a>

Anyone else is welcome to the idea.

Don't know, I didn't use 47d.

Why would the pointer be near the bottom?  Doesn't the pointer warp to
the top of the menu when you open it... oops, I see that it doesn't.
Didn't it used to?  I prefer that, even though in general I think
warping is evil... it's better than selecting bogus stuff.

Another option is to create the menu set to the left or right enough
that the pointer isn't selecting anything, if there's not enough room to
place the pointer on the title without warping it.

Well, I prefer the old behavior much more but if we've decided to keep
this new behavior then the documentation in the man page should be
changed, because it's now very incorrect.

Hmm.  Very weird behavior now.

First, FvwmAnimate seems to be exiting with "Dead Pipe" quite often when
I start up the configure menu.  But not every time :-/.  I didn't notice
this happening before I enabled debugging (to enable, I did this:

  cd modules/FvwmAnimate
  rm *.o
  make CFLAGS='-g -DDEBUG'

).  Here's a sample output:

    ...
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateTwist $(Twists)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 22, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateWidth $(Linewidth)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 22, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateDelay $(Delays)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 45, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateEffect $(RANDOM?Random)$(FLIP?Flip)$(FRAME?Frame)$(FRAME3D?Frame3d)$(LINES?Lines)$(TURN?Turn)$(TWIST?Twist)
  Sending unlock
  Dead Pipe

But of course fvwm2 is still running; I can even start another instance
of FvwmAnimate and it works fine for a while.  It doesn't always happen
in the same place in the menu definition, either; here's another one:

  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateWidth $(Linewidth)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 22, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateDelay $(Delays)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 45, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateEffect $(RANDOM?Random)$(FLIP?Flip)$(FRAME?Frame)$(FRAME3D?Frame3d)$(LINES?Lines)$(TURN?Turn)$(TWIST?Twist)
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 19, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand      *FvwmAnimateSave
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 21, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateButton       restart   "F3 - Reset" F3
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 20, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateButton       quit "F4 - Cancel" F4
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 14, read 16
  Got command: *FormFvwmAnimateCommand Nop
  Sending unlock
  Dead Pipe

Very odd.

Second, continuing on the track of the original bug :), when it doesn't
exit I see that FvwmAnimate only receives the first couple of commands
that it should.  After I press the Apply button, I see these lines:

  Header[2] is 14, read 16
  Got command: *FvwmAnimateIterations 12
  Found line for me: *FvwmAnimateIterations 12
  Sending unlock
  Header[2] is 14, read 16
  Got command: *FvwmAnimateTwist 0.500000
  Found line for me: *FvwmAnimateTwist 0.500000
  Sending unlock

... and that's it!  Sure enough, if I change the Iterations or Twist
values, they _do_ get applied, but all other values don't.

I'm thinking there's some kind of memory thing or _something_ going on
here.

(Developers, take note: this was posted to the general list,

bug reports on this beta, too.)

	I just tried it out. Actually, DumbPlacement seems to
be working all too well. It's the ActivePlacement that doesn't
take, so FVWM falls back to DumbPlacement, which you hardly ever
see, normally.

	I'm looking at the placement code right now, so I'll
see if I can figure out what got broken. Does anyone else have
any idea what's been done to the placement code? It was still
working fine in the 2.0.47d alpha.

	Ok, I looked into this a little bit. The problem's not in
placement.c, per se: it's in the rewritten moveLoop (in move.c). The
x, y args are always 0 on return from the call to moveLoop. The
ActivePlacement code depends on their being set at this point, so 
an ActivePlacement window is always getting stuck in the upper left
hand corner of the screen, no matter where the rubber band was moved
to. DumbPlacement isn't really getting invoked, it just looks like it.

	Any ideas, anyone?

I saw this a while ago, then it went away, now its back.

I have a menu like this:

AddToMenu "Misc-Utilities" "Misc-Utilities" Title
+  "&A. audiotool - Sound Editor" Exec cd $HOME/audio;nice audiotool
...
+  "Monitoring" Title
+  "%mini.chart.xpm%&S. sysinfo - prompt" Sysstatsprompt

Only the part from "Monitoring" down displays.


Here's another one.

mwm style menus without animation when trying to pop up a submenu near
the right edge  of the screen, pop up  the submenu all  the way to the
left of the screen.

	Well, actually, it does, if you give it a little encouragement. If
you move the pointer slightly, it then warps to the top. 2.0.46 behaved this
way also.

	I vote for fixing it - it's a misfeature, because the handling is
inconsistent: for the root menu, the behavior is as you describe, but if
you continue holding the mouse button down and slide onto a submenu, then
releasing the mouse button behaves the old way - whatever the pointer is
over is selected.

This command bothers me a  little, all my commands are  built in a 200
byte work area.  It's  not 200 bytes long, but  its a little closer to
200 bytes than I wanted to get.  I don't think this has anything to do
with the problem.

>   Sending unlock
>   Dead Pipe

Here it is  seeing commands that  it knows are not  for  itself, so it
just skips  them.   The Dead  Pipe is  normally  a reaction  to  fvwm2
closing the pipe.

The next thing it should be  getting is a *FvwmAnimateWidth command, I
don't see anything special about that command.  It seems like fvwm2 is
eating the rest of the command.  Or, could there be some limit to what
can be on the pipe at one time?

You're right, there is something going on, but I'm  afraid we are both
clueless. I'm at a special  disadvantage, because  I can't create  the
problem.

Well, wait a minute, I got an idea about the Dead  Pipe, tried to test
it,  and  now   I  think  I'm  a little   more  confused.    I changed
modules/Module.c so that  when  it calls DeadPipe, it  passes  "errno"
instead of just a  "1".  I changed  FvwmAnimate so that when it prints
its dead pipe message, it prints the passed arg.  It then proceeded to
spontaneously die in  different places with a  DeadPipe, and errno 13,
(EACCES  -  Permission  denied).  I've   had  it  die during the  form
definition, during an apply, and I also saw it  just stop like you did
above.

I also  saw it dump out huge  quantities of FvwmForm  definitions over
and over  even  though    each form  definition  is preceeded    by  a
"destroymoduleconfig".

I think there is something wrong with the module pipes, but don't know
much about them.  Guess I have to start reading.

Really?  I never noticed.  Of course, my menus aren't very long and the
little root window space I generally keep clear is near the top, so I
rarely hit this situation :).

Ugh; yes, this is horrible.  I strongly second your vote for fixing it.

OK, this is an obvious syntax error: let's not make a liar out of me
mere days after we started up, here! :)

Someone needs to apply this patch.

Please, folks, the minimum regression necessary before any commit to CVS
should be a top-down compile: it's one thing if your code doesn't work
just right, it's quite another when it doesn't even compile... we should
strive to always have the leaf CVS code compile.

I'm using a newer Linux (RH5) and all the headers that are in
/usr/include/linux are completely unnecessary and off-limits now; they
just cause code to not compile.

I'm following the GNU standard patch format of including a changelog
entry, followed by the patches.

I'm trying to compile the whole tree with -DDEBUG; I get an error in
extras/FvwmScript/FvwmScript.c because when DEBUG is defined it assumes
you have some kind of heap debugging library which I don't have.

Hmm.  I compiled a debugging version on Linux and I can't reproduce the
FvwmAnimate problem there; it all seems to work OK.  I don't get the
Dead Pipe messages, either, although I didn't try your change of passing
errno to DeadPipe().

This is looking stranger and stranger... I think I'll whip out my trusty
Purify tomorrow and see if anything pops out at me using that on fvwm2
and FvwmAnimate.  I think I have an Xnest server around, too, so it
shouldn't be too painful to debug :)

BTW, another thing I noticed was that with DEBUG on, many modules print
various information.  However, most of the time it's impossible to be
sure who's printing what.

IMO this is another _prime_ candidate for a generic set of routines in
libfvwm: debugging functions.  I suggest something like:

  * A global variable char *ModuleName that every module must define; it
    should use the optional name if one was given.

  * A function dbprintf() or similar that takes a printf()-style format
    string and arguments.

  * A #define that hides the dbprintf() and maps it to empty if DEBUG is
    not set.

Here's a sample--Note!  I wrote this from scratch right here, it's not
even been compiled!  Also, if someone really wants to do this there's
some hackery in autoconf that needs to be done to deal with the
stddarg.h vs. varargs.h issue.  I can provide sample code since I did
this for GNU make already:

 $ cat debug.c

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <stddarg.h>

 #include "debug.h"

 extern char *ModuleName;

 struct __db_info _db_info;

 void
 dbprintf(const char *fmt, ...)
 {
   va_list ap;

   fprintf(stderr, "[%s] %s:%d: ", ModuleName, _db_info.file, _db_info.line);

   va_start(ap, fmt);
   vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
   va_end(ap);

   fputc('\n', stderr); /* So callers don't have to do it. */
   fflush(stderr):      /* This should be unnecessary. */
 }

 $ cat debug.h

 #ifdef DEBUG
 # define DB(_x)    do{_db_info.file=__FILE__;_db_info.line=__LINE__; \
                       dbprintf _x;}while(0)
 #else
 # define DB(_x)
 #endif

 struct __db_info { const char *file; unsigned long line; };

 extern struct __db_info _db_info;

Then you invoke it like:

  DB(("Found a foobar: %d", foobar_count));

This provides a common look-and-feel to all debugging output, and it
automatically includes the module name and filename & linenumber from
which the debugging statement was printed.  It also (as written)
automatically adds a newline so developers don't need to.

Just a thought.

Here is a list of problems I had with autoconf. If any
of these have already been posted/resolved, please
ignore them. (On SuSE Linux 5.3)

- FvwmAudio does not build.
  I have HAVE_RPLAY set, but RPLAY itself is nowhere
  defined. Thus building FvwmAudio fails.

- FvwmEvents does not build.
  Same reason as for Audio.

- Duplicate include path's
  The gcc line has always '-I. -I.' and most of the time
  '-I.. -I..'. Also there are some extra spaces before
  '-g'.

- Is is slow!
  I estimate it compiled 50% faster with Imake.
  Probably related to next one.

- Is is HUGE!
  All the debug info makes it factor 5-10 larger.
  Should not compile with debug in the distribution if
  you do not explicitly request so. Installing does not
  strip the executables either (again if you do not use
  a special target).

- Make whines once that it'd rather use automake (as a
  warning). Can't reproduce this anymore, but if that
  can be removed this should be done.

Overall the output is a bit wild. Not what I am used to
when using autoconf. This should be cleaned up.

It is very neat. But does anyone feel a bit uncomfortable that this
module is making up its own menus and forms?  Maybe uncomfortable is too
strong a word and I don't mean to criticize Dan for his efforts.  It's
just that there are lots of modules that could benefit from this kind of
interaction and I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to have all the
simple modules configurable from a form or menu.  (besides I don't like
the colours of the FormFvwmAnimate 8-).

Would it be easy to take the menu and form building out of FvwmAnimate? 
Would it make FvwmAnimate any simpler? Would it be easy to duplicate
this stuff for the other modules?

Here's a quick first guess at what could be simply configured:
fvwm2 (OK not the key, buttons, styles, decors, menus or functions)
FvwmAnimate      FvwmAudio        FvwmAuto         FvwmBanner       
FvwmCascade      FvwmCommand      FvwmConsole      FvwmCpp          
FvwmDebug        FvwmEvent        FvwmIdent        FvwmM4           
FvwmPager        FvwmPipe         FvwmSave         FvwmSaveDesk     
FvwmTile         FvwmWinList      FvwmScroll       FvwmTalk 

Things that don't have a static limit for config options
fvwm2
FvwmBacker       FvwmButtons      FvwmForm         FvwmGoodStuff    
FvwmIconBox      FvwmIconMan      FvwmScript       FvwmTaskBar
FvwmWharf

Any thoughts?
Cheers,
Tim.

PS what happened to FvwmConfig?

Theere is still no documentation about the animated

the manpage for that (I don't even know how it works).

A trick I picked up from FvwmEvent? is to include a leading "*" at the
front of  the internal module name.  This   becomes useful for parsing
config  strings,    and  generating commands.    Debugging  and  error
messaging would then be done with ModuleName+1.

Well, I didn't.  Actually, I'm trying to set conventions for the names
used also, so I won't get conflicts with user created menus and forms.

 "FormFvwmAnimate", "MenuFvwmAnimate", "MenuDelayFvwmAnimate".

It is my expressed intention  to make that happen.   Are you trying to
say that there  should be one  configuration  dialog for the  whole of
fvwm?

If thats where you are going I disagree.  However,  in my master plan,
the whole configuration dialog would "appear" to be one thing.

One of the reasons that configuration dialog  has to be in FvwmAnimate
is that   the  dialogs are   dynamic based on   the  current  state of
FvwmAnimate.   For example,  if  you stop  FvwmAnimate, the only thing
left in MenuFvwmAnimate is "Start FvwmAnimate".

> (besides I don't like the colours of the FormFvwmAnimate 8-).

There is no current way  to globally configure  FvwmForm.  But I guess
that  wouldn't be too  hard.  We could make  that the default FvwmForm
dialog.  I    would entertain suggestions   on  different defaults for
FvwmAnimate in the time being.

> Would it be easy to take the menu and form building out of FvwmAnimate? 

No.  The form and  menu building is  based on the  current FvwmAnimate
configuration and state.

Have you looked at the code?
I think its pretty simple as is.

As you point out, some of the modules are very adaptable to this.
For others, maybe not.

In the case of FvwmForm, there is  a case for a builtin configuration.
We just discussed default   colors and fonts.   How about  a  tutorial
also.  I think the tutorial idea applies to all the "hard" modules.

There  are  also  parts  of fvwm2   that   would be well   adapted  to
configuration dialogs.  For example, "theme choosing", "menu style".

All good issues, glad you brought them up.

> 
> PS what happened to FvwmConfig?

Still in the extras directory with this note:

Use of this module is discouraged, since the options it allows are far
less in variety than fvwm itself can allow.

Note,  that that is not  true  for FvwmAnimate.  Every  aspect of  its
behavior is configurable.

There is another tool, I think its  the "DotFile Configurator?"  which
does a    pretty  sophisticated job  of configuration.    However, its
monolithic.  I am trying  to show that each  module should provide its
own configuration tool when possible.

You sure this is automake-related?  I checked fvwm-2.0.46 and RPLAY is
nowhere defined there either!  I don't have the library, but from this
code in FvwmAudio.c, I assumed it was a type defined in the header: 

	#ifdef HAVE_RPLAY
	/* define the rplay table */
	RPLAY   *rplay_table[MAX_MESSAGES+MAX_BUILTIN];
	#endif

This is the *only* place RPLAY is used in any file of 2.0.46.

Are you talking about the configure step or the compile step?  

I'm a little surprised that compilation should be so much slower with
autoconf-generated Makefiles compared to imake-generated ones. Are the
Makefiles themselves so much bigger?

What is huge?  The executables or the makefiles?

If huge executables is the problem, then you have to change CFLAGS when
you build, since they default to debugging.  This is a GNU convention, and
one I'd rather not change.  Just do "make CFLAGS='-O4'" instead of make.

Same with install/install-strip: it's a convention for GNU packages. 
People expect them to work this way.

If Automake.in is out-of-date with respect to Automake.am, the makefile
rules try to rebuild it.  (Same with config.h.in, and the like).  This, of
course, requires automake to rebuild.  If you do NOT have automake, you
get this warning, and the offending file is "touch"ed (so you only get the
warning once).  

If you have not changed any of the Makefile.am's, just ignore this.  If
you have, you need automake and autoconf to rebuild things properly.

I need some examples.

I could compile 2.0.46 and 2.0.47x without that problem.
It occurs since autoconf is in, but I'm not sure that is
the reason.

This should still be cleaned up someday. Looks not very

Compiling.

The reason might be all the degug info.

The executables.

Ahem, I never had to edit the CFLAGS in the Makefiles in any autoconf'ed
software to turn debug off. That can't be the standard.

No, I don't and have never seen software that is 5 to 10 times
larger after building than the stripped executables. It is usually
only a few k that can be stripped. At the moment, the fvwm2
executable is >1meg after building and 169000 bytes when
stripped. That *can't* be the default.

Forgot them at home. Tomorrow I should have them with me.

The configure step is a real challenge for my home Sparc 1+, but
I'm not complaining.  For me the advantages outweigh the slowdown.

I didn't  see  any difference for compiles,  except  that it used  the
flags "-g -O2", which I started to override on my home machine.

I haven't figured out how to exclude  man pages from the install step,
so installs  are  a lot slower  for  the whole directory.  (I  haven't
looked in the makefiles, so I probably shouldn't be mentioning it.)

Perhaps a note about  this in INSTALL.fvwm is in  order.  It does sort
of look like somethings wrong if you don't  understand much about this
stuff.

I think it is.  Don't forget these GNU folks have  a compiler that can
optimize and  debug at the same time  and it is  my understanding that
all  that symbol information that makes   the executables huge doesn't
really affect the working set (memory use) of the programs.

On the other hand, the fvwm2 project doesn't really get that many core
dump reports.  (I know, 10 seconds out of my mouth, and I'll be proved
wrong.)

I suggest we highlight this change when we put together the NEWS for
this release.

Yup, I have the same compiler. What do you want to say with this?
And perhaps it might be a standard, but I have never seen a software
that is this bloated with debug info. Never. GNU standards may be
good usually, but there are exceptions.

So what is your opinion? Taking -g out or not?

How about:

	./configure --with-debug
		(compile with -g)
	./configure --with-full-debug
		(compile with "-DDEBUG -g")

This will allow people to determine how they want to build it, with
about 6-8 additional lines needed in configure.in.

Or, you can do what most GNU tools do (nothing) and have the user use
one of the following for the same effects as the above:

	CFLAGS=-g ./configure
	CFLAGS="-DDEBUG -g" ./configure

It's just a simple matter of getting people used to the new way of
building.  Autoconf is actually quite versatile.

Of course, I'm used to this... on Digital Unix, DEC C is usually
superior to gcc, so I'm constantly passing at least:

	CC=cc CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure

I'm trying to justify the GNU "default" behavior?
On the other hand, I just did a quick look thru some of the things
I've installed with "configure" and I see either default.

If this  "automake" tool will only  create a configure file  with '-g'
then I vote for no manual overrides and going with '-g'.  If we get to
have a choice, I'll vote for staying with our old default of '-O'.

The rational for "no change" is, I haven't seen the problem that '-g'
will cure.

I should have pointed out that it is only because you build in the source
tree that you see duplicated -I flags.  If you build in another directory,
you'd see two different include flags. 

For instance, one of the "-I."  is added by automake (in case there are
built headers in that dir, I guess) an the other comes from "-I$(srcdir)",
to pick up headers in the sources.

To expand on this last point, suppose foo.c includes foo.h.  You would
normally do

	#include "foo.h"

in foo.c.  Fine and dandy if you are compiling in the directory that holds
foo.c and foo.h.  

But automake builds makefiles that can compile from *any* directory.  This
is a great win for people with heterogenous networks: you can do parallel
builds from the same source tree into different directory hierarchies.  It
does, however, mess with the #include statements.  

So what happens is that after a configure, the Makefiles built have a
$(srcdir) variable that points to the original source directory, and the
compile line has "-I$(srcdir)" to take care of the #include "foo.h"
situation described above.

However, there is also the possibility that foo.h is a *derived* file from
foo.h.in (as config.h is).  This derived file must be written into the
build hierarchy rather than the source hierarchy, of course.  I think the
reason that automake-generated makefiles also include a "-I." on the
compile line is because some compilers will fail to find foo.h if it is in
not in the directory with foo.c. 

If the build is in the source tree, then srcdir=. and you have the
phenomenon observed with the repeated -I. -I.  The -I.. has a similar
explanation. 

So, whether you believe it or not, this is a standard feature of
automake-generated Makefiles!

Look again.  It *is* the standard.  

It may not be the case that all GNU software comes with
standards-conforming Makefile.in's.  However, automake-generated
Makefile.in's ARE standards-conforming. 

And no, you don't need to edit the Makefile.  You simply override it on
the command line:

	make CFLAGS=....

The size of the symbol table in the executable is irrelevant.  That's a
function of your compiler. 

Whether you believe me or not, the fact is that using "-g" by default is a
GNU standard.  Here are two relevant quotes from their standards.info: 

------------------------ standards.info #1 -----------------------------

   Do include the `-g' option in `CFLAGS', because that is not
*required* for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default that
is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is compiled
with GCC by default, then you might as well include `-O' in the default
value of `CFLAGS' as well.

   Put `CFLAGS' last in the compilation command, after other variables
containing compiler options, so the user can use `CFLAGS' to override
the others.

------------------------ standards.info #2 -----------------------------

   All GNU programs should have the following targets in their
Makefiles:

`all'
     Compile the entire program.  This should be the default target.
     This target need not rebuild any documentation files; Info files
     should normally be included in the distribution, and DVI files
     should be made only when explicitly asked for.

     By default, the Make rules should compile and link with `-g', so
     that executable programs have debugging symbols.  Users who don't
     mind being helpless can strip the executables later if they wish.

`install'
     Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on
     to the file names where they should reside for actual use.  If
     there is a simple test to verify that a program is properly
     installed, this target should run that test.

     Do not strip executables when installing them.  Devil-may-care
     users can use the `install-strip' target to do that.

The duplicate paths can't be cleaned up.  They're an artifact of the
ability to compile in remote directories: if you configure in a remote
directory one of those will stay "-I." and one will change to be
"-I../fvwm" or some pointer to the source directory.

There's no way (in portable make) to condense these into one.

As for the extra spaces, they're caused by empty variables:

  $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(myCFLAGS)

etc.; whenever one of those variables is empty you get two spaces
together (before and after the empty variable value).

I think it's not worth worrying about this.  I can't imagine anyone
really cares, as long as it compiles :).

You never edit the makefile; you override it on the command line.  There
are (at least) three ways to do this:

 a) Set CFLAGS during the configure run, like this:

      $ CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure ...

    This sets the default CFLAGS value to "-O2" in the makefile.

 b) Set CFLAGS on the make command line, like this:

      $ ./configure ...
      $ make CFLAGS=-O2

    You have to remember to do this every time you run make, of course.

 c) Create a config.site file containing site-specific overrides you
    always want for all autoconf packages, and set CFLAGS as you like
    it there.  See the INSTALL file for details on this one.

    This is what I do.

All GNU autoconf'd packages _always_ use a default of debugging on.
Always.  Configure checks to see of -g works with -O, and if so it uses
both but if not it prefers -g.

This argument comes up every couple of months on the Linux newsgroups,
for example, and every time it's decided to keep this as the default.
You can go check the archives for more reasoning.  If you've used an
autoconf package that doesn't set -g by default, it's not GNU-compliant
(what package was it?)

Debugging isn't really that big a deal.  It shouldn't make the build
much slower, since the symbol table is always available during the
compile anyway, although note that -O, esp. higher levels, definitely
slows down the build.  Although the binaries are a lot bigger, that
extra space is symbol table info only and not loaded into memory when
the app runs.  The only thing you really lose is disk space.

You might compare the compilation options (-fno-strength-reduce or
whatever) that you used to get with Imake to the ones you get with
autoconf, and use CFLAGS settings as above to make them similar or
identical.  Also, actual timed build differences would be interesting:
it may well be a makefile issue rather than a compile issue.  For
example, remember that autoconf makefiles from CVS keep dependency info
up-to-date automatically all the time, rather than requiring a "make
depend", so that might make a difference during the build.

I agree that the install-strip option should be documented prominently.

Yes, it is, and yes, it's normal.  If other apps you've used don't have
that much difference between stripped and non-stripped versions, that
merely means they don't have that much symbol table info.  GCC
especially adds lots more symbolic debugging info than some other
compilers (this is a _good_ thing :).

I think the single best thing about autoconf is that it's a _standard_.
It's important that we stay as close as possible.  This doesn't mean
we all have to like every aspect of it, and one of the great things
about this standard is that there are so many ways to customize it.  But
I feel it's very important to leave the "as-shipped" version just as
everyone will expect it.  Making changes to do what we like may well
mess up _others'_ expectations and their customizations.

Oops, meant "automake'd" here :)

Automake-generated Makefile.in files follow the GNU coding standards.
If you roll your own Makefile.in to use with autoconf those might not,
of course.

I really don't think this is necessary.  As you point out, there are
well-known and standard ways of making these changes already (we should
probably document using -DDEBUG though).

One of the strong recommendations on the autoconf groups is to use
_fewer_ configure options, not more.  As few as you can get away with :).
The more there are the more confusing it gets.

I already wish we didn't have the individual --with-*-includes and
--with-*-library and instead just had one "--with-dir-prefix" or
something :).

Hmm, I see there's already an --enable-debug-msgs option, that appears
to set this:

  #define FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS 1

What's the relationship of this to the normal DEBUG option used by
modules, etc.?  Shouldn't there be only one #define, or do they denote
different "levels" of debugging (and if so, shouldn't this be
controllable at runtime somehow?)

*Sigh*

OK it is the standard and so on.

I don't care if the additional info is a few % (perhaps 50)
of the original executable which it usually is. But in our
case we are talking about a ratio of of 15% code vs 85%
debug info (=800k) and in some modules it is even worse.

Whoever compiles for himself will be delighted to get megs
of dead data dumped on his disk. Yes, we can write it in
the README, but everybody will be wanting to strip it
anyway (except a few freaks perhaps). So why don't we
put that additional step in the setup so people do not
have to do it themselves.

And in the end I see not the slightest gain in clinging
to that GNU standard. The people that know these
standards or have noticed them will be able to compile
with debug info anyway. We ignore other standards too,
so where is the problem (or are we indenting out code
by the GNU conventions? And we wouldn't want it as it
would cause lots of unnecessary work).

Hi,

I have checked in some new files to CVS:

	modules/ChangeLog
	extras/ChangeLog

As Paul suggests, these are to be considered a bare minimum.  Better if
the module authors create their own ChangeLogs.

Also, as per a recommendation by Paul, I have renamed README.autoconf to
DEVELOPERS, and have augmented it with some of the recipes I posted on the
list earlier.

Finally, I added the NEWS and AUTHORS files.  In the former, I put the
changes I know about (autoconf-related).  I anticipate others will add
their own notes.  The latter is empty for now.  As soon as we get the file
COPYING in the top directory, we can use "automake --gnu" rather than
"automake --foreign".  Whoo Hoo!

I'm sorry to be dense, but I figure I better ask before I get into a deeper
hole.

I'm trying to add a NEWS file.

I get this:

fork> cvs add -m"New news file" NEWS
cvs server: cannot add file on non-branch tag version-2_1_0

What should I be doing to add files to version-2_1_0?

You can't.  Note that version-2_1_0 is a label that applies to a
specific set of files and specific versions of those files.  That's the
point of labeling them, to be able to get a reproducable set :)

You should remove the sticky tag; it's keeping you from seeing any new
code that's checked into the tree.

Do this:

  $ cvs -q -z3 update -dPA

The -q and -z3 are optional (quiet and compress, respectively).  The -d
and -P options handle new/obsolete directories.  And the -A removes any
sticky items (tags, dates, etc.) and lets you get the latest and
greatest stuff.

You can see if you're using sticky things with cvs status:

  $ cvs status configure

or whatever.

Hey Paul,

as you seem to know quite a bit about CVS, why don't you
take archives/cvs-howto.txt and fill in a few of the sections
that would really ease the pains for us CVS-newcomers.

Was RPLAY used in some file in 2.0.46? The new thing seems to be
that configure finds my rplay lib and sets HAVE_RPLAY. The old
Imake didn't do that so I had no problem.

So, what can we do to fix this?

I would prefer, that we create docs/cvs.html!

I have just put the following changes on the main branch:

TO-DO is renamed TODO.

NEWS has additional information from our old "news.html" file
in text format at the end of the file.

The docs directory has what I am proposing as our new WEB documenation
in it.

You should be able to check it out thru your browser by pointing it
at "file:/fvwm_location/docs/".

The "NEWS", "TODO", and "FAQ" files won't be there unless you run
the txt2html.ksh file to create them.

I went thru all of the web stuff.  The module documentation got the most
re-work.

I  don't think this   has   anything to do  with  last   nights "pipe"
problems, but the  Lines  effect was drawing 5  line  segments when it
should have only been drawing 4.

I just checked in  the fix, and added  a ChangeLog to  the FvwmAnimate
directory.

I can't create the "pipes" problem at work, it will have to wait.

Whew.  There are _SO_ many bugs in fvwm2.  What a mess.

Below are a bunch of UMR (Uninitialized Memory Read) and other bug
fixes.  In all honesty they _probably_ don't cause real problems (except
the big memory leak!), but they're broken nonetheless.

Next I'll send some info on other memory leaks which I just didn't have
time to look at/fix.  These must be fixed!  At least the major ones.

Please look carefully at the change to menus.c:MenuInteraction(); the
old behavior is definitely broken but I'm not familiar enough with the
code to know for sure that the new code is right.

1998-11-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* Fix problems discovered by Purify:

	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): Don't try to call
	GetPopupOptions() until we know we're looking at a popup menu.

	* libs/Picture.c (LoadPicture): Free pixmaps after we create and
	translate them and they're no longer needed.

	* fvwm/misc.c (GetOneMenuPositionArgument): If the returned token
	is an empty string, don't try to parse it.

	* fvwm/module.c (SendName): Zero out the end of the array to avoid
	uninitialized mem access.

	* libs/Picture.c (CachePicture): Don't look past the end of
	allocated memory.  If someone proves that this function is slowing
	down fvwm using some hard profiling, then we can revisit, but in
	the absence of this information it's not worth the risk.

	* fvwm/decorations.c (GetOlHints): Don't free(NULL).  This is
	OK under ANSI, but not portable.

	* fvwm/fvwm.c (InitFvwmDecor): Initialize the TitleHeight field to
	0; otherwise we may use it before it's set (in LoadWindowFont).

doing some simple root menu manipulations for maybe 2 minutes.  This has
all my previous patches applied, that's why you don't see too many
UMR's, etc. :)

But as you can see, fvwm2 leaks memory like a sieve.  After that simple
bit of work it's already leaked 46K!!!  And this is after I fixed the
pixmap leak, which was by far the biggest offender (at least at startup
time).

I think this really needs to be addressed before any stable release can
be made.

Have fun!

	I just did a fresh update and got a totally clean build, so I'd like to
go ahead and commit StartsOnPage.

	If anyone's in the middle of doing anything tricky with the repository,
please let me know, and I'll hold off. Otherwise, I'll wait for about 20
minutes, then sync up again and commit.

	Sorry to seem paranoid, but this is my first try at updating the repository,
and it's a big change (the diff runs to 935 lines).

I think you just need to send email to tibbs with a username and encoded
password.

I don't know that you need a formal sponsor.  But I'd certainly support
you checking in the bugfixes!

	Has anyone noticed that the Pager feature that allows you to
drag a window "out of the Pager" and onto the current desktop page is
broken? Instead, the window goes to some oddball location on another
page (but the correct desk).

	I think the problem is probably in the rewritten move code, and
therefore related to the breakage of ActivePlacement.

	While we're on the subject, OpaqueMove acts a bit strangely these
days. When I do an opaque move by dragging the titlebar, sometimes --
and I haven't toyed with enough to figure out the boundary condition --
the mouse cursor will suddenly jump some distance above the window and
change to the resizing cursor; it stays that way for the rest of the
move. Decidedly inelegant.

	Is anybody currently working on this stuff?

Is that what you really think? Ignore build problems and
just tell people to not use the features?

I found out what the problems were:

a) FvwmEvents.c and FvwmAudio.c evaluated HAVE_RPLAY
   before config.h was included (i.e. before it was
   set), so the rplay header was not included.

b) The Makefile.in for FvemEvents did define the rplay
   library but did not link with it.

I'll commit the patches today.

Whatever you want, but I would like to be able to actually
read the cvs file even if I have no web browser. Anyway,
the discussion is moot as long as nobody writes anything
into the file.

Does this mean not all menu entries are shown? Or are you just
missing the title? Can you send me the complete Menu definition?

I changed the behaviour when 'Title' was used within a menu.
This sould mess up the menu under certain circumstances, so
I rewrote that so that the title *always* goes to the top.
I recommend using separators for a fake Title withing the menu.

That was a stupid bug in my menu position code. I'll fix it today.

Sorry Dominik, I misunderstood.  When you said:

I thought you meant that you hadn't defined HAVE_RPLAY in your Imakefiles. 
I interpreted this to mean that you don't have a working rplay library.

Ah, right.  So I was mistaken also in saying that the problem was not
caused by autoconf.  My apologies. 

The include for config.h should be the first thing in all files.  This
currently isn't the case; I am moving the include line as I come across it
during cleanup.  

I should systematically check for this problem.  But in the meantime:

	anyone editing stuff -- particularly modules and extras -- please
	ensure that #include "config.h" is the first include in the file. 
	Thank you.

OK.  Don't forget that it is Makefile.am that you should edit, and you'll
need automake & autoconf to rebuild the Makefile.in.

Actually I have (re)written most of the central menu code, so
please let me *always* have a look at that stuff before
fixing anything.

Be careful if you change something:

> 	* fvwm/menus.c (MenuInteraction): Don't try to call
> 	GetPopupOptions() until we know we're looking at a popup menu.

Correct, but I suggest to fix it in GetPopupOptions, not by moving
code around (this is all a bit touchy):

Add this in GetPopupOptions just after the declarations:

  if (!IS_POPUP_MENU_ITEM(mi))
    return;
 
> 	* fvwm/misc.c (GetOneMenuPositionArgument): If the returned token
> 	is an empty string, don't try to parse it.

Your fix suggests replacing unnecessary work with a memory leak!!

Yes it was in part caused by autoconf, but don't blame yourself
for things others sis wrong. This was already in 2.0.46.

Uh, before I mess things up, could you do this? I just copied
the lines containing rplay from the FvwmAudio Makefile.in to
the one in FvwmEvents.

I have a statistic for this now (133MHz Pentium):

  complete make in 2.0.47d:  245s
  complete make in 2.1.0:    391s  (plus 7s for FvwmAnimate)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
                           + 146s

  That is 60% longer (191s and 70% if "./configure" and
  "xmkmf && make Makefiles" are taken into account). Since
  FvwmAnimate is not in 2.0.47d I didn't count that.

I got a reply from the FSF on the copyrights issue.
They think there is no problem with the twm copyright at
all. We can put that under GPL or another open source
license if we want.

All that is left to do is to get permission to add some
permissions into the copyright statements of:

FvwmWharf
FvwmTile
FvwmCascade

Any ideas how to contact the copyright owners of these?

Sorry, the Changelog is not as complete as it should be.
In addition to the patches I did in November I applied
Tim's three patches for:

  keypad resize
  menu animation with 0 distance
  menu move

Ooh err! I patched move.c to fix a problem with move invoked from a
menu.  In the past the move assumed that the pointer was on the menu
item that started the move.  This caused the window to jump at the start
of the move if the pointer was not on the menu item.  I can't find
anything wrong with moving from window decorations but I can reproduce
problems with moving from the pager.  I'll look into this but could you
try to to give an example of opaque moves going funny?

Has anyone else had the problem with moves from the pager causing extra
pagers to be started?  Every time I move a window in the pager with
button 2 another one starts up.  My pager is swallowed in FvwmButtons so
it could be a problem with either.  It doesn't happen with a standalone
Pager

Is there any particular reason why the module path defaults
to /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.1.0? I liked it much more when
the default (with Imake) was the same directory as the fvwm2
executable was found in.

The problem is that the module path im my .fvwm2rc has not
been parsed when I start FvwmCpp. This way I have to link
said directory to my fvwm2 path (i.e. I have to change my
setup).

	Ok, a little further investigation shows a timing problem. If I
slowly and deliberately press the mouse button, then wait for the cursor
to change to the move/resize cursor, then the behavior is normal. However,
if I'm moving quickly, the cursor stays wherever it was when the cursor
change caught up to it. It's not necessarily *above* the window, as I said
before, that's just the direction I was moving when I noticed the problem.
It might be to the side, or on a diagonal, or inside the client area of
the window.

	I was also mistaken about the opaque move aspect. The same thing
occurs with rubber band moves, it was just much more obvious with the
small opaque move windows I was shuffling around last night.

	I just brought up 2.0.46 for a quick comparison, and what it
appears to do in this case is to warp the cursor back to the position
from which you started moving, once the cursor change catches up with
your mouse movement.

This may sound silly but did you check to make sure you don't have a mouse
action setup in your Buttons config that is respawning the app. Otherwise
I don't see it happening to me and my Pager is also swallowed.  Just a
thought.

I can also confirm both of Bob's problems with the pager and with the move
window cursor problem.

Why?

GNU make is very portable (runs on everything fvwm2 runs on, that's for
sure :) and quite simple to compile.  And it's only a single 147k app
(on my SunOS box).  It doesn't require any special permissions or
anything, so you can just stick it in your home directory somewhere if
you want.

Anyway, this is a bummer, I know.  But the only solutions are to either
(a) use GNU make, or (b) build a dist with "make dist" on a system with
GNU make, and move that to the other systems.  The dist, of course, can
be used with any make and any compiler.  That's even more of a pain.

The problem is that many of the special features of the developer's
environment, like dependency checking, etc. simply can't be done without
some of the advanced features of GNU make.

Did you run the "make depend" step for Imake?

If not you should probably be comparing the build times for the
distribution (after a make dist) vs. the Imake build times.  As I
mentioned yesterday, the "developer's builds" do automatic dependency
updates.  I'd be interested to see how quickly a dist compiles (try
grabbing the 2.1.0 tarball and compiling that).

Still, that seems long.  What are the flags for the compiler in the two
builds?  Does compiling with the same CFLAGS in autoconf as in Imake
cause the build times to converge?

I'm still betting the increased build time is due to the process
(makefiles, etc.) rather than the compiler options.

Was it?  That's not how any of my installations are set up, and I don't
recall changing this when installing fvwm.  In my setup fvwm2 is
installed into /usr/bin/X11 and the modules and system.fvwmrc files were
installed in /usr/lib/X11/fvwm.

Yes, Dan also discussed moving things around.  As I mentioned in a
response to him, the new layout is the GNU standard.  The binaries are
in .../bin and any ancillary, "supporter" apps that can't/shouldn't be
invoked directly go in .../libexec.

Of course, you can always change the installation layout to anything you
want via one of the methods mentioned before (using options to configure
or writing a config.site file containing your preferences).

As I mentioned to Steve last week, though, it's a problem that modules
change directories every release.  Although removing the ModulePath from
your .fvwm2rc file fixes the simplest problems, it doesn't help when (a)
you _need_ to add module paths, and (b) you use that value for other
things (for example I have a little shell script I invoke at init time
that does an "ls" on the modules directory and creates a menu of modules
to invoke).

Here's a thought: maybe fvwm could define the builtin paths as
_environment_variables_ when it starts up.  Say FVWM_MODULEPATH or
something.  Then that environment variable can be used in the .fvwm2rc
file, like this:

  ModulePath /my/modules:$FVWM_MODULEPATH:/some/other/modules

This would also (of course) be exported to subshells.  Would this be
good enough for FvwmCpp (I don't use it so I don't know)?

Basically, I think it's OK to require people to change their setup
_once_ when they install Fvwm 2.2, but I don't think they should be
required to do so for _every_ new fvwm they install.

PS. Even though it's a pain, I do like having things install in
    different places with each release.  Don't know about you all but
    here I always have to maintain old versions and for Imake apps
    that's always impossible.  I really appreciate the GNU tools that
    allow concurrent, working installations.

Oops.

It wasn't just unnecessary work, though; it was an undefined memory
reference (that's why Purify picked it up).  If the string is empty then
this:

  length = strlen(token);
  if (token[length-1] == 'p') {

is broken (length is 0 and length-1 references before the beginning of
the array).

I guess the right fix is to change GetNextToken so it never returns an
empty string, but instead always returns a NULL ptr if the token is
empty.  I suppose that may break other code, but it's the right fix.
I'll look into doing this.

No, don't touch it. Far too many functions and modules rely on this
exact behaviour. It is guaranteed that GetNextToken mallocs a string
if the input string was not NULL (roughly). If we change that, lots
of stuff will crash. It should be done someday, but not now.

Yup, it was. If FVWM_MODULEPATH wasn't defined, the current dir
was used. Now the default is taken instead.

I understand the reasoning, but it effectively prevents me from
using a local installation as I do now (just copy the executables
somewhere in the path before the real binaries).

I wasn't clear.  I meant that fvwm2 could define that environment
variable (using putenv) _immediately_ upon startup, and it would contain
only the compiled-in value, not the entire ModulePath.  It could be done
first thing in main(), even.  It's a predefined value, after all, so
there's no need to read the config file to get it.

I guess I should have named the environment variable
FVWM_DEFAULTMODULEPATH or something, instead :).

The only question is whether FvwmCpp can make use of it; I guess that
depends on whether the FvwmCpp module is invoked via the shell and you
can use things like:

  -cmd 'FvwmCpp -DMPATH=\"$FVWM_DEFAULTMODULEPATH\" .fvwm2rc'

since cpp can't access values in the environment directly.

But then they don't work anymore, right?  I mean you have to rename them
back again.

We have a huge developer organization here and it's very nice if I can
install new tools and tell people who complain to just use the old
version ("run fvwm-2.0.46 instead of fvwm2") and it all just works.
These tools are all available on everyone's system via a large central
NFS-mounted filesystem.  That's what I mean by "concurrent, working
installations"; you can be running different versions at the same time
out of the same directory and they all work.

Heres how  I'm running configure  to get fvwm2 and  the modules in the
same place:

#!/bin/ksh

export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++

../version-2_1_0/configure \
  --bindir=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.1.0 \
  --libexecdir=/opt/public/src/ \
  --prefix=/opt/public \
  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib\
  --with-xpm-includes=/opt/public/include --with-xpm-library=/opt/public/lib

The "bindir" and the "libexecdir" are the crucial parts.

I've  always used  a  shell called "fvwm2"  start  fvwm2.   It exports
variables for   my  users to  use in  their  .fvwm2rc  for ModulePath,
PixMapPath, and some of the reads for common config files.

Long term, I see PixMapPath and ModulePath being built in during install.
Setting either in the .fvwm2rc would only stick values in front of that.

txt2html.ksh has been replaced with txt2html.sh.

There were some "html" type symbolics ("&amp;", etc.) in the NEWS file
which I removed.

The new  txt2html.sh  changes '<>&' in  text files  into their correct
html counterparts.

After I updated my home config last night with the latest changes,
I can no longer reproduce any problem with the "Custom" dialog.

Unless I hear otherwise, I have to consider the problem fixed.

No, they can be done with most modern "make" programs, they just can't
be done portably.

?? They already are.  If you don't provide any value in your ~/.fvwm2rc
file you get the default.

The problem is there's no way to access that default from within your
config file (or anywhere else).

That would probably be sufficient for the modules list (I can't think of
a good reason you'd want to add values behind the default), but what
about other things that want to know where modules live, like my script
to construct a modules menu?

I agree that fvwm2 should provide these by default.

In my experience,  if I replace a UNIX  binary while others are  using
it, I can cause the other users problems.  (Core dumps.)

Since there is now way I can get other users out of fvwm2 to install a
new version of  fvwm2, I maintain that fvwm2  should always be invoked
from a shell in a multi-user environment.

Yes, and  I believe,  if you try  to augment  the ModulePath or PixMap
path, you  loose what's built in.  I  think we all agree, fvwm2 should
be exporting some variables.

My plan, (I  keep coming  up with  plans),  was that  the module  menu
should  be built in.   You  wouldn't need to  construct  a menu.  This
module menu was the last step to get FvwmAnimate to zero configuration
lines.

(I agree that fvwm2 should export the module path,  so you could still
build your own menu.)

I do sort of like the "version" directory. It would allow for more than one
version installation, but then you would want a %version% tag in the
.fvwm2rc file as well as the %default% path also suggested.

I see as wrapper as a workaround. I would prefer a more elegant solution.

This is not true, I do this for high profile applications all the time;

mv important_app important_app.inuse; cp important_app.new important_app

The script will only help if you do not change the inode of a running

Correct.

I was thinking on these lines last week. It might be useful if fvwm could
go down its path and include anything it found. But then the user could get
way more choices (some buggy) then they really want.

Even though I am not done, and I have not linked "cvs.html" to
any other page yet, I have checked in "cvs.html".

I have to admit by cvs knowledge is sketchy so I'm sure I won't be
the only contributor to this page.  Feel free to get in there
and make changes.  I won't mind having to merge any additional
changes I come up with.

Should I be putting these pages up in place of the FVWM pages that exist
now?  I can probably even make a cron job to do it.

I don't want to unilaterally control the Fvwm web pages.  I would like
to wait a day or 2 for comments.  If there are no objections then, I'd
like to put the web pages in place.

The web pages  to some extent  reflect  the current  release.  I'm not
sure  a cron job is the  right way to go,  unless  we were to put some
kind  of trigger  file in the   source tree  to make   the actual copy
happen.

Do you have a copy of man2html or will you  need one of us to generate
up-to-date man/html pages?  (Note that for the  time being, we need to
leave the old man pages in place.)

Hi Gang,

I just committed a whole wack of change to the tree.  They are mostly code
cleanups, fixing the ifdefs to use autoconf-generated ones, etc.

I also incorporated stuff that Austin and Paul posted to the list.

So do an update and let me know if I broke anything.  It does work on the
four platforms I have handy.

Supercite, which is an Emacs package that can be combined with any of
the Emacs main handlers (the default RMAIL, or VM, or Gnus which handles
both mail and news).

FYI :)

Fair enough.  A trigger is possible, but requires a certain incestuous
relationship between the CVS user and the web user.

DE> Do you have a copy of man2html

I don't, but if someone tells me where I should get such a thing then I
will...

I won't touch the pages for now (though I could stick something useful in the news
section); I'll take the issue back up when we get to a release that we
think is as stable as 2.0.46 that we can recommend that folks upgrade to.

	This is getting weird! I tried re-commenting out the XQueryPointer
that you'd uncommented in move.c, and that corrected both the cursor-
leading-the-move quirk and the move-out-of-pager problems. I think this
is better left as it was, unless there's a way you can uniquely identify
the call to InteractiveMove as being triggered from a decoration-bound
menu.

	I didn't quite understand what you were trying to fix, so I decided
to try doing various moves, and discovered that something else has gone
astray. Move invoked from a menu bound to a titlebar button simply doesn't
work anymore (with or without the XQueryPointer)! You can interactively move
the window around, but when you drop it, it snaps back to its original
position. 

	Can we, um, get a dialogue going among all the folks tinkering with
move.c?

	Could we get a dialogue going among everyone working on move.c? There
are currently a few bugs in the code, and I don't want to step on what others
are doing by tring to fix them without a little consultation.

	I'm attaching a couple of patch chunks that I tried out this evening.
They correct some of the problems I've found, but not all, and I can't
guarantee that they don't interfere with other work in progress.

	1) The ActivePlacement breakage is corrected by the first chunk - I
	   don't believe it has any side effects.
	2) The second chunk corrects both the move-out-of-Pager problem and
	   the cursor-leading-the-move quirk - but it probably leaves the
	   original problem Tim was trying to address unfixed. I can't tell,
	   because....
	3) Move invoked from a menu bound to a titlebar button seems to be
	   broken now (with or without my patches). You can drag the window
	   around, but when you drop it, it snaps back to its original
	   position. I've no idea what's going on here, but it looks
	   superficially similar to the ActivePlacement problem (moveLoop
	   not updating the caller's x,y, coordinates).

	Here's the patch - at this point, it's just a suggestion, because I
really don't know what work is in progress.

	What happens is that the second title and everything below it
display; everything above the line containing the second title gets lost.

 	I don't think this is really going to be a palatable solution.
The reason that people like to use additional titles is appearance -
they're neatly centered. I vote for trying to find a better way around
the problem (whatever it was) than removing an attractive feature:
people just hate that.

	One more annoying bit of menu behavior I've noticed is this. If you
pop up the root menu (click or press-and-drag, it doesn't matter), then
slide over till a submenu pops up, then decide "Oops, that wasn't the one
I wanted" and slide back to the higher-level menu, the menus disappear
(i.e., root menu and all), just as though you'd moved off the menu to the
desktop and released the mouse button.

	I believe this is a post-2.0.47 misfeature.

	This only happens with regular, non-animated FVWM-style menus, by
the way.

Just a thought about the menus.

We may be tyring to support too many options.

One of the things I control for most of my users is menu
action and appearance.  I fully intend to change the default
behavior to animated, I don't expect to get any resistance
to that.

Perhaps that should be the ONLY choice?

It should be OK.  I was applying them to my sources as you posted them,
then Dominik would commit them himself.  Doing an update usually catches
it.

I just downloaded from http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/man2html.html
but I haven't unpacked or tried it yet.

We only need this working when we put the 2.1.0 man pages
in place.  Until then, the current pages are fine.

Well, it has been 2 days since I posted the new docs, and there doesn't seem
to be any objection.  I suggest we put the new docs in place.

These are 2.0.46 docs, with just a little information about whats
going on now.

I just linked up the "docs" page to the CVS page.

Make your updates to the NEWS file, then cd to where you want
the web pages, and run:

$fvwmsrc/docs/txt2html.sh $fvwmsrc/NEWS
$fvwmsrc/docs/txt2html.sh $fvwmsrc/TODO
$fvwmsrc/docs/txt2html.sh $fvwmsrc/FAQ

cp $fvwmsrc/docs/*.html .
cp $fvwmsrc/docs/*.jpg .

I think animated menus are fancy, but I don't like them very
much because on my desktop the only place to pop up menus is
near the right edge, so my menus do alway animate. I definitely
want to be able to turn them off.

How did you invoke the move (key or button). I wrote some code that should
allow you to undo a move with the mouse (just like pressing <ESC>). It
should be like this: If you drag the window holding down a button,
pressing an releasing a different button terminates the move. This
should only happen if you are dragging with a button pressed. Can you
verify if the behaviour you see matches with what I describe?

Please see my other posting. Perhaps I have time to debug it
this weekend, but maybe not, sorry.

The extra Pagers happen when I have swallow(respawn).  I'm guessing but
the extra pager happens when I release button 2 in a move from the
pager.  Moves in the pager cause a little window in the pager to be
created which follows the cursor. When I release button 2 this little
window is closed.  It might be that FvwmButtons gets the little window
closure event and assumes that it is the swallowed window going away and
so starts a new one.  Does this sound reasonable?

Me too, undo my patch to move.c until I fix it, the old behaviour is
more correct.  I was trying to fix a problem that is made worse with the
menu positioning code. i.e. I have a window and the pointer in the
middle of the screen.  With a key press I get a menu to pop up in the
bottom left of the screen and from that I start a move.  What happens is
that the move command gets the dragX, dragY numbers from the menu which
is in the bottom left so it keeps the window some distance to the upper
right of the pointer.   When you start moving the window zooms off to
the upper right and you can't get it out of the upper right quadrant.

What I need to do is enclose the Querypointer in a test of the event
type.

Cheers,
Tim.

I've made a rough hack to make the current menu-item to be highlighted
like tk/gtk/whatever... Should I clean it up a bit and submit a patch?

I do think it should be optional.. but.. the menustyle thingie is
getting a bit overloaded with options now... Any ideas?

Maybe split away the "Color" part from the "Style" part?

The best would be if one could choose color to highlight with instead of
my current +15% or something...

Just noticed a thing that makes one think it wants to be a certain
version... fvwm/fvwm2.1  8)

Hi all,

At the moment there is actually a lot going on because
of various bugfixes. We should keep cool at the moment
and think twice about any change that is committed and
who does it.

As critical as those bugs still in menus/moves may
appear, that is what we should expect. Much of the menu
and moving code has been enhanced/rewritten. Don't panic.

Some of the problems can explained or solved easier by
reading the changs section in archive/README.xxxx files.
Do read them before starting wild discussions about weird
behaviour etc. That will definitely help.

What to do:
-----------
I will resolve any problem with menus and the bug that
move does not work from a button, but I need time I don't
have at the moment. Please ignore these for now, I will
not forget them.

Steve, please make a new distribution, tag it as 2.1.1
and put it on the web server. However buggy this may be,
we need a new basis for common work. I don't want to hear
bug reports from people who are using 2.1.0 as many
things have been fixed already (remember others that
the workers list are already testing).

Also there is more important work to do: Fixing memory
leaks. There are *dozens* of them !! I worked on this
last night, fixed perhaps 20 or 30 (but built in one or
more coredumps, so I'll have to do more at the weekend).

I cannot fix all these leaks alone. Anyone willing to help
is welcome, but do not just start working, post it to this
thread.

I will address these leaks myself (refer to the purify log):

- everything where '...Menu...' appears somewhere in the stack
  trace

- everything where 'DoGetNextToken', 'GetNextOption' and
  'GetNextToken' appears in the stack trace

- IconPath, findIconFile, ...path leaks

I need help especially for the leaks related to fonts. I have
no experience on these and the leaks are quite big (3k, 7k
and so on).

Bye

Dominik,  good points.  Actually, I think things are going
quite well.

Someone cleaned up the "usleep" vs. "sleep_a_little" issue
while I was documenting.  Progress, progress, progress.

This is great.

Since it  looks like we are going  to be at this a  while, and I don't
quite see how to sneak into these memory leak problems without getting
in  the way, I  think  I'll get back  to FvwmAnimate.   Seems like the
"Color"  options work under at   least some conditions,   so I want to
fully support that option.

This last set of updates needed "clean-depend" to work.

The closest I could come was to cd to the libs directory
and do "maintainer-clean-depend".

Even better would have been if it detected that libs/System.c
had changed and rebuilt the the libs/.deps/System.P file.

Actually, I've had lots of trouble getting this kind of thing to work
in my own GNUMake files, so if we get the later, thats extra points!

I think I've fixed these font leaks, folks don't need to work on them.

I have a bunch of changes to go in, hopefully today (I want to test
after my merge with Steve's latest stuff).  I'll generate another Purify
log after that, and try doing some different stuff.  I'd also like to
Purify FvwmButtons, FvwmAuto, FvwmAnimate, and other long-lasting
modules (I don't care much about short-lived ones like FvwmCpp, FvwmM4,
FvwmForm, etc.)

In addition to the font memory cleanup and some of the other build
changes, while trying to figure out the FvwmAnimate/FvwmForm/DeadPipe
problem I worked on the SendPacket()/Broadcast() stuff (again...)
Broadcasts were pretty inefficient because they basically invoked Send()
once for each module, so the entire construction of the exact same
packet was done over again for each module.  I changed it so it's done
once, then sent to all modules.  Also, all packet construction
eventually invokes one function to create the basic parts, so there's
only one place the header is created and only one place to change that
(if it becomes necessary).  This should all be shiny and clean now :).

I'm still not sure that the FvwmAnimate/FvwmForm/DeadPipe issues are
gone for me.  I'll check again after the latest batch of changes.

Steve, maybe you want to wait on a 2.1.1 dist until my changes go in?
Up to you.

Please check FvwmIconBox and FvwmPager too, I suspect leaks in
the parsers.

We can have a quick 2.1.2 followup if needed. There is no reason
to try to keep version numbers low at the moment.

You are welcome to do FvwmAnimate, but I've Purified it already.

In the purify thread I adviced GetNextToken whould not be
changed so that an empty string (just '\0') was never
returned.

After checking lots of memory leaks I am convinced that this
change has to be done as soon as possible. There are too many
leaks caused by that than we can comfortably fix. I'd rather
check coredumps on this.

==> From monday on (I'll check it in then) we may have new
    problems with parsing of many commands and a few modules
    (FvwmIconBox, FvwmButtons, FvwmPager).

Howdy all.

I'm glad to see that several of you have decided to take up the torch as a
communal effort.  I've been briefly scanning the mailing lists as I've had
time, and hopefully I'll even be able to contribute again, sometime in the
future...

For now though, I'd like to offer a suggestion for someone to look into
that is related to some of the discussions that were going on about
exporting ModulePath as an env var.

Before I handed the stuff off to Brady, I had begun FvwmPreproc which was
meant to be a replacement for FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp, but with a slightly
different behavior.  It wasn't meant to be a module per se, but rather used
via the PipeRead command (or the -p command line option, brother to -f,
that I didn't finish adding either) to invoke either m4 or cpp, reading
several env vars that would have been exported by fvwm (ModulePath,
PixmapPath, version number, FvwmDir, compiled in options, etc - basically
any of the fvwm specific info that couldn't be accessed via straight X11
calls).

Unfortunately I didn't finish it, although the partially finished version
was in the tarball I gave Brady so I'm assuming that it made it into CVS (I
don't know if anyone noticed it or not).  I highly recommend that someone
finish it up, since it should help solve some of the evil bugs with the way
that FvwmM4/Cpp work currently ("Say, why didn't some of my windows get my
border definitions until I did a recapture?").

Chuck

ps - about the ModulePath stuff - you may want to make fvwm try the
currently defined ModulePath when looking for a module, then look to the
compiled in ModulePath if the first one fails.  That way you don't even
need to worry about putting the default ModulePath in any redefinition of
it in your rc files (unless of course you want it in the middle of your
ModulePath, then the env var could be used).

Just grabbed the cvs tree, and I'm getting a compile error that says
there's a missing file. Here's the error:
make[2]: Entering directory `/user003/tilstra/src/fvwm/libs'
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `System.h', needed by `System.o'.  Stop.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/user003/tilstra/src/fvwm/libs'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

So is there a System.h file?
Or does this problem come from elsewhere?
(I'm looking, but its been a while since I've looked at these files, so I'm
quite lost at the moment.)

No, my screen isn't big enough.  What I meant was that having some
modules configurable by menus and others not might make the fvwm package
look a bit fragmented.  If we could get a lot of the modules to go the
way of FvwmAnimate it would be a big improvement.

This would be nice.  How about fvwm generating some menus every time the
ModulePath changes? e.g. MenuStartModule, MenuStopModule,
MenuConfigModule
that would have an entry for every module it found. Start and stop would
just start and stop them but MenuConfigModule would run an FvwmForm with
whatever form the module had created.  Maybe MenuConfigModule could be
auto created so that only real-time configurable modules were on the
menu by looking for *FvwmFormModuleSomething configuration lines.  I'd
like the auto menus to include a mini-pixmap if there were one on the
pixmap path and to have a hot key assigned. (if you solve this one it
might be worth putting auto hot key generation in all the menus or
having auto hot key generation being a menustyle)

Whatever defaults you pick will not suit everyone.  I like dark
backgrounds and light text but then I don't sit near a window.  Some
sort of global setting would be nice but maybe FvwmForm is not the way
to go.  I haven't tried FvwmScript but it does appear to be a bit more
flexible.

Tim.

How do I get the stack trace off a fvwm2 core file?

  # gdb --corefile=core
  (gdb) where

prints the addresses only, not the function names.

Another problem might be that the corefile is from a
module, not fvwm2. Can I prevent this?

There's no trace of an FvwmPreproc module in CVS; you may want to resend or
I can give you write access.  (I can't imagine that anyone would object.)

This is what my note about "make clean-depend" was about.

I know I have looked at stack traces of modules beofre, I think the
solution to get function names was to compile with just -g not the -O2.
See if that helps.  But fortunatelly I don't have any cores lying around
right now so I'm not 100% sure.

You have to provide the executable name (and path), too:

  gdb /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 core
  (gdb) bt

(where and bt (backtrace) are synonyms)

  dv> prints the addresses only, not the function names.

If you are providing the executable name, then this means you don't have
any debugging info in the executable.

If you've installed stripped, then strip has removed all that info.  You
can provide the name of an unstripped binary, even if the core was from
a stripped binary, and GDB will put it all together.  So, if you did
install-strip you should run GDB with the version in the build tree.

Or, you might have not compiled with -g in the first place.

No, but GDB should tell you the name of the app when you start it; look
in the startup text.

If you think cores are stomping on each other you need to somehow chdir
to a new directory for each app: maybe add chdir() to the main() of
the modules.

Or, you could not start those modules while you debug the main app.

This is a known issue with the current automake dependency generation:
if you remove a header you can get bitten like this.

The reasons are quite esoteric and require a detailed understanding of
GNU make and how automake does dependencies; Tom Tromey and I have
discussed it at length.

I think he's implemented a fix for this for the next release of
automake.

I suppose you could give me write access, since I was probably going to ask
for it eventually anyways, but unfortunately I probably won't be able to
find the time to learn enough about CVS to check it in anytime soon.

So if anyone out there wants to take a crack at finishing it up (as well as
the couple of small changes to fvwm itself to accomodate it) that already
has write access to the CVS tree (and knows how to access it) just let me
know and I'll get the unfinished source to you.  Otherwise, I guess I'll
just finish it up myself and figure out how to work with CVS as time
permits - and most of you know how that has gone for me in the past. :)

OK, I found out what's going on between FvwmAnimate and FvwmForm.  It's
a gross bug.

To review: FvwmAnimate generates an FvwmForm with configuration
information in it.  Once you say "Apply", it (FvwmForm) generates
FvwmAnimate module commands to set the options you specified.

In my environment, it only sets the first 2 of 5 options.

Here's the problem (kinda obvious in hindsight :-/): FvwmForm writes 5
lines of data to fvwm2's pipe.  Then it exits!!  (You can already see
where this is going, I'm sure :).

On the fvwm2 side, it starts to read the data.  It gets the first two
lines and processes them.  For those unfamiliar with this, the loop
we're talking about is events.c:My_XNextEvent().  It does a select(),
then loops through all the read/write filedescriptors looking for
something with data:

  retval=select(fd_width,&in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, NULL);
    ...
  for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
    {
      if(readPipes[i] >= 0)
	{
	  if((retval>0)&&(FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)))
            ...process read data...

      if(writePipes[i] >= 0)
	{
	  if((retval>0)&&(FD_ISSET(writePipes[i], &out_fdset)))
            ...
       	      FlushQueue(i);

What happens is that there's data on the FvwmForm module's write pipe (I
don't know how it got there; maybe it was a broadcast message or
something--actually I just looked at at least the first item in the
queue is a FOCUS_CHANGE event).

So, after it reads and processes the second line on the FvwmForm read
pipe, it calls FlushQueue() to flush the write pipe queue.  In
module.c:FlushQueue() we see:

  while(pipeQueue[module] != NULL)
    {
      d = pipeQueue[module];
      dptr = (char *)d->data;
      while(d->done < d->size)
	{
	  a = write(writePipes[module],&dptr[d->done], d->size - d->done);

Here it just goes through the data queued for the pipe and tries to
write it.  BUT!  Since the write pipe has been closed by FvwmForm
exiting, write(2) returns an error (-1) and errno is, of course, EPIPE.
In this case, the code run KillModule(), which closes the fvwm2 end of
both the read and write pipes with prejudice, and cleans up everything
else.

And any data left in that read pipe, like the last few lines of the
FvwmForm results, is lost.

:(

This is an important bug and must be fixed.  However, the fix will
require some careful tiptoeing, I think.  Offhand, I see two ways to fix
it:

 1) Change all the modules (that might have write data--maybe this is
    only FvwmForm?) so before exiting they loop on their write pipe
    until it's empty, then exit.

This, I think is a hack but it's probably the fastest way to fix
FvwmForm.  Who knows that other modules may run into this, though?  I
hate these kinds of timing bugs :-/.

 2) Modify fvwm2 so that it doesn't throw out any data in the read pipe
    (close it) just because the write pipe was closed.  I imagine this
    could be done by managing the two pipes independently and only
    tearing down the module information when _BOTH_ the read and write
    pipes were closed.

    In other words, FlushQueue() shouldn't automatically call
    KillModule() if it gets back an error (well, maybe it could but
    KillModule would be more intelligent--that would probably be
    simpler).

    Instead of that, it would close the write side of the pipe (in this
    case), and zap the filedescriptor in writePipe[] so it wouldn't be
    written to or managed any further.

    Then, it would continue on.  At some point during
    HandleModuleInput() the read pipe would be drained, then it, too,
    would return EPIPE during the next read.  KillModule() could be
    invoked again and this time it would see that both the pipes were
    down, and it could tear down the connection for real.

    Ditto for the other way.

    The questions here are what about deadlock?  Can we get into a state
    where one of the pipes stays open indefinitely?  And where, if
    anywhere, in the current code are assumptions made about both pipes
    being available (if one is, the other always is) that might break if
    we changed this.

Anyway, that's too much for me to work on right now, but it's a nice
juicy UNIX-y kinda bug if someone else wants to tackle it :).  If not
we'll have to re-examine it later.

Good find.  I'm not sure why its taken so long to surface, or why
I couldn't reproduce it the next day.

How about if we just have FvwmForm fflush the pipe before exit?

Maybe the flush belongs in the WritePipe routine?

Well, it's pretty timing-dependent, I think.  For example, when I had
FvwmForm compiled with Purify it didn't show up, because Purify was
calculating the memory leaks and didn't really close the app until after
fvwm2 managed to grab all the data.

  de> How about if we just have FvwmForm fflush the pipe before exit?

Won't work; fflush() just pushes any data in the stdio buffers down into
the file (pipe).  It doesn't wait until the reader at the other end of
the pipe has read everything and the pipe is empty again.

Also, fflush() works on a FILE* but fvwm and modules write to pipes
using low-level write(2) and filedescrs, so there's no buffered data in
the first place.

You'd need to select on the write pipe, somehow, and wait until it
cleared.  I _assume_ there's some way to tell but to be honest I'd have
to go look it up to be sure; I don't think I've ever done anything like
that.  This was basically my suggestion #1 :)

I just committed a bunch of changes, including lots of memory fixes
(leaks, uninitialized access, etc.), performance enhancements to the
module interaction code, some build fixes, some configuration fixes,
etc.  I implemented a first-cut at the generic DB() macro for debugging
info.  It doesn't have the module name stuff in it, and right now it all
prints to stderr; we should probably have it print to a module-specific
file or something.

I compiled on SunOS and Solaris, and did a successful make distcheck on
Solaris, too.

It seems to run OK, barring the odd things dealing with menus and moving
windows that others have mentioned.  And of course my "FvwmForm exits
too fast" bug I just found :).

I'll run some purify on fvwm2 and post it, so people can see what's
left.  Note I'm just going to be doing some basic stuff, so I might miss
some more esoteric things.

Here's a Purify log for fvwm2 after all my latest commits.  Looks like I
missed one UMR, and some of the pixmaps are still leaking (the one at
icons.c:700).  I've got both of those already; I'll commit them soon.

Other than that, go fix 'em! :)

I'll try to get a log for FvwmButtons, too; I don't use IconMan myself
but I can start that up for a purify log.

I've updated docs/README
and added docs/man-pages.html and docs/run_man2html.sh.

man-pages.html is the current man page index using the new color
scheme.

run_man2html.sh is a shell that can be used to invoke man2html.
The shell creates man pages using the new color scheme.

Jason, if you are feeling extra ambitious, you could install
man2html and use run_man2html on the 2.0.46 man pages
to get them to look like the rest of the pages.
(Check the README file and the shell.)
Otherwise, that part could wait for a real release.

Installing man2html is simple.

Installing Perl on my home machine took me a while though.

	Ah...now I think I'm beginning to understand what Tim was trying to
fix! I so seldom use keyboard shortcuts, I sometimes forget that they're there.
In my case, I 1) pull down a menu (the standard old Window-Ops2) with a
mouse-click on Titlebar button 1, then 2) click on the first menu item, "Move".
At this point, the cursor changes to the move/resize cursor, and I can begin
dragging (with or without pressing the mouse button). All appears to go well
until I drop the window (button release or click), at which point the window
snaps back to its starting position.

	Now, if I select the menu item with its keyboard shortcut instead of
a mouse click, the move works properly: the window stays moved when I drop
it.

	I've also found that the same misbehavior occurs with resize invoked from
a menu bound to the window decorations. If resize is selected from the menu via
its keyboard shortcut, it works fine; if it's selected by a mouse click on the
menu item, the window remains its original size when you release the rubber
band.

	I hope this helps clarify the problem.


- Bob

Hi,

So I've built a 2.1.1 distribution and uploaded it to the FTP server.  

The corresponding CVS tag is "version-2_1_1". 

In the current CVS sources, configure sets the version to 2.2.2.

Sorry to have  been a little dense there,  this time  I carefully read
what you wrote and checked the code.  I  favor the second fix over the
first because its the right way to go.  The pipe structures aren't too
widely used in the code, and both pipes really  should be empty before
they are torn down.  Note  the comment I  left  in module.h about  the
pipe arrays.

The much simpler fix is to change the  form that FvwmAnimate generates
so  that the apply buttons leave  the form  running.  Only the dismiss
button    will do a    quit.  I've  already   made  this  change to my
development copy until the underlying problem can be addressed.

Another fix would be along the lines of your  first suggestion.  Right
now, when FvwmForm sends commands to FvwmAnimate,  any errors in input
are sent to stderr.  I've toyed with  the idea for making  FvwmForm an
interactive module.  That way, when bad input  is sent to FvwmAnimate,
FvwmAnimate can turn around and send a command back to FvwmForm saying
Field X is invalid.   The same technology would  be used to  shut down
FvwmForm.  Ie.     if all fields   are  valid, FvwmAnimate  would tell
FvwmForm to stop.

Since its a core dump during malloc, it looks like the heap is corrupted
in some way.  Not a particularly easy problem to track down without
Purify.  (I'm at home, so I can't use it.)

Am I the only one seeing this problem?

I'll check that. Seems to be a menu problem.

Hi all,

CVS seems to have a problem with whitespace conflicts.
I spent nearly half an hour resolving such conflicts
today. We must all agree on a common whitespace strategy
if we want to avoid this.

I suggest:

 - tab = 8 spaces
 - configure your emacs so that it actually uses tabs
   (you can have tabs replaced with spaces automatically)

Reeindenting of large parts *must* wait.

Bye

Another suggestion:

  At leats 15 minutes before anyone starts committing
  large changes, we should send a mail about what is
  going to happen (and a mail when it is finished).
  This should spare us unneccessary trouble (As it
  occurs quite often).

is it possible to have 'make clean' work in the extras
directory too (can you do it)?

I don't see it (I'm running 2.1.1 now) and Purify didn't report anything
like that for me, so it must be you're using some feature of configure
that I don't use (my setup is pretty vanilla, actually).

I've got some major (real) work to get done by Monday evening and next
week, and I need to work on a new release of GNU make at some point, so
I won't be able to do too much more (beyond the two minor fixes I
mentioned yesterday) for a bit... I think you're going to need to try
Purifying it :(

Don't know if you guys are aware of it or not, but there's nothing
better for debugging window managers than the Xnest server!  It's a
"virtual server" which opens a window displaying on your regular X
server, but acts like a full-fledged server.  You can test much more
easily, including debugging, using this so it doesn't freeze your normal
display.  Just start it like:

  $ Xnest :1 &

to have it take display:1, then debug fvwm2 like this:

  $ gdb fvwm2
  (gdb) run -display :1

Or, you can attach to a running process (like a module) with:

  $ gdb FvwmButtons <pid>

As long as the bug isn't when something has grabbed the mouse/keyboard,
you can easily debug this stuff.

You can even run remotely: start the Xnest locally, then on the remote
system (where you may have Purify available, for example), you can set
it to display locally.

I know there's an XFree86 Xnest server package.  For other systems you
have to build it yourself since almost no vendors ship it standard;
unfortunately there's no way to build it without building the entire X
source tree :(.  If you want to do that, let me know and I'll give you
some hints.

Hi Dominik,

Does it not work?  I think it should.

If you --enable-extras, then the extras directory is recursively processed
just like modules.  This happens for all the targets: all, install, clean,
etc.

Even if you do NOT enable extras, all the makefiles in that hierarchy
should be built.  You should be able to process individual modules, or the
entire lot of them by CD'ing into the appropriate directory.  For the
example at hand, "cd extras; make clean" should work.

I agree this is probably the very simplest solution, but of course (a)
it's not foolproof (maybe people can hit the keys to apply/close fast
enough to make it happen?) and (b) as a user-interface issue I much
prefer the old way :)

Anyway, hopefully this bug will be fixed before 2.2 ships but if not is
should be a high priority for the next release.

PS. I agree with some of your comments regarding pipes: it would be nice
    if the data about a module was collected into one structure rather
    than spread across multiple disparate arrays.

    However, I don't think the issue with file descriptors getting large
    is right: the offset into the array isn't the file descriptor (it
    can't be since read and write use different descriptors, but you
    need the same array offset for both so you can correlate them).  So,
    I see no reason that this array ever needs to be larger than the
    number of active modules.

    And, in general, I'd prefer an array over a linked list for this:
    it's faster to search and slightly easier to handle looping.  Of
    course, you have to look for and re-use dead spots (and skip them)
    whereas with a linked list you can just remove any "dead
    spots"... well, six of one.  The time difference probably wouldn't
    be that large.  But I still lean towards keeping the array (but make
    it an array of "module structures" containing read/write pipe fd's,
    name, etc.)

Hmm.  Yes, it's a shame we can't just ignore whitespace changes.  You
can do so easily on diffs; why not on merges?

  dv> I suggest:

Whatever everyone decides.  I, personally, never use TAB chars and
always use just spaces.  Then you never need to worry about how many
spaces are in a TAB or someone viewing it with them set incorrectly.
But I don't care that much (I'll have to figure out how to customize my
Emacs cc-mode sessions so when I'm editing my other files I keep the old
behavior and when I'm editing fvwm files I get the new; but that
shouldn't be too difficult).

One thing I do _very_strongly_ suggest is that everyone (editing with
Emacs, anyway) get a "trailing space" removing package.  I use one I
developed call rm-tspaces, which I will be happy to share; I know there
are a number of these.  Mine performs this function just before every
save of the file and allows you to set it up to always remove, never
remove, or ask whether or not to remove.  You can customize this on a
per-buffer basis (in a mode-hook, for example).

A lot of whitespace differences can be removed if everyone uses a tool
like this.

Longer-term we could come up with an indent command line that
"sanitized" the code and ask everyone to run it before checkin.  I don't
know that much about indent but it should be easy to get it to just fix
up whitespace without doing anything else, at least initially.

A few random things:

  * I know there is a _potential_ bug in the new packet sending code for
    any non-32-bit system (any system where sizeof(int) !=
    sizeof(long)).  Because these functions are variadic, you don't get
    automatic integer promotion as you would if they were full
    prototypes.  Thus, all the integer values should be cast to
    (unsigned long) to be safe.

    I thought of doing this, but that just seemed too much to type.  And
    I think trying to rely on something like u_long or ulong and working
    around systems that may define that themselves, etc. would be a
    pain.  I wonder if we shouldn't make a typedef like UL, or ful or
    f_ul, or something.

  * I saw Dan made a pass at supporting systems that use varargs.h, then
    Steve tried to fix it up more.  A commit I made Friday undoes this.

    Note that it's not feasible to use varargs.h with ANSI C prototypes.
    Varargs.h requires you to define the last option as a "va_dcl", and
    not in a prototype.  You must define variadic functions like:

      foo(bar, va_alist)
        int bar;
        va_dcl
      {
        ...
      }

    This can get gross; to fully support both old and new styles
    requires a lot of work and, as I said, can't be used with
    prototypes.  Since we already require an ANSI C compiler, at least
    one that handles prototypes, I think we should just ignore the
    varargs.h case.  If we don't, we definitely need to do a lot more
    work to get it right.  Thoughts/concerns?

  * There's something odd going on in someone's distribution
    (Dominik's?)  Whenever I update I seem to get all those
    Makefile.in's changed.  They _shouldn't_ be changed every time like
    that.  One thing I noticed is that the ones I get from CVS use the
    --gnu option to automake instead of the --foreign, while mine, when
    rebuilt, always use --foreign.  The problem is --gnu doesn't work,
    because until there's a copy of the COPYING file in the fvwm root
    directory it doesn't comply with the GNU standards (btw, why isn't
    the COPYING file in the root directory?)  Anyway, for me it fails
    and I have to rebuild the makefile.in's.

    I'm not quite sure how that's happening, but I wish it weren't :)

  * Can we decide to remove the things we were talking about previously
    from the dist?  In particular:

      textures/*
      sample.fvwmrc/BradyMontz

    Are there some modules we think are too old and don't need to be
    supported anymore we could get rid of?

    Maybe these could be separated into a different package, rather than
    being under source control.  Seems like it'd be a lot faster to
    update and build fvwm if we could get rid of unnecessary stuff.

  * If it were up to me I'd forget the fancy backgrounds, etc. on the
    web pages and stick with basic black on (off?) white.  Just one
    opinion :)

If you create a solution, please share it.  The code I produce at work
has to be portable to MVS.  Since I or someone else may try to edit it
on MVS, I don't normally put tabs into C source code.

I guess the  emacs  solution could be  as simple   as seeing  the  CVS
directory or not in a cc-mode-hook.

I don't  see any.  The  only module that has  significant distribution
size is extras/FvwmScript.

Hopefully just one.

I really like them, or I wouldn't have bothered.  I do understand tastes
vary.  Score so far, one for, one against.

The merge I did on saturday has a bug producing
a coredump. I don't have the sources now, so I
can give you no patch, but what you have to do is:

in module.c, executeModule (or ExecutMeodule) there
are two lines deleting cptr (in fact there are several
places in the function, but I refer to the LAST occurence
in the function).

The lines have to be deleted (cptr is already deleted
earlier).

  if (cptr)
    free(cptr);

This was caused by concurrent fixed by me and Paul
(I think) for a memory leak.

There is another problem in libs/Picture.c,
CachePicture (or something like this). The list
of cached Icons seems to be corrupted (you can 
see this if you have lots of icons in FvwmButtons).

Bye

Dominik

Uh, well I have one of those systems, so I'm a little concerned!  

[Actually, I'm a bit confused, too.  The alpha reports that an int is only
32 bits, where longs and pointers are 64!  I wonder if they did this so as
to not break code that assumes 32 bit integers?]

I didn't really catch all the rest of what you said, but we'll have to
figure out some portable way to handle this.  And soon.

I noticed!  :-)

I also noticed that you fixed up the includes for string and mem*
functions in acconfig.h.  Thanks!  What I had was copied directly out of
the autoconf manual.  I guess the manual should be updated, eh?

Is it the case that all compilers that handle prototypes have stdarg.h?

If stdarg.h is *required* to build fvwm, shouldn't we check for it in
configure and exit with a FATAL error if not found?  Currently vprintf and
vfprintf are probed for but the corresponding symbols (HAVE_VPRINTF,
HAVE_VFPRINTF) are never checked. 

For the instant, it doesn't bother me to drop varargs.h support.  All my
environments include gcc which supplies stdarg.h anyway.  But if there's a
chance that someone will try to build on a platform without stdarg.h, then
I think we should re-visit this before a 2.2 release comes out.

It was me.  I had to change them because the ones you checked in had "TAR
= gtar" in them.  I don't understand why the TAR variable is hardcoded in
distributed files anyway.  It seems to be a bug in automake.

That was me, too.  I built the 2.1.1 distribution by linking
archives/COPYING into the root and using --gnu, since all the rest of the
required files (NEWS, AUTHORS, etc) are there, even if empty.

I thought the copyright issues were worked out now?  Dominik?  Can we put
the COPYING file into the root dir now?

Me too.

I also favour removing the entire icons directory into its own
distribution.  Someone (Paul?) already pointed out that the icons don't
change much, so they probably don't need to be under CVS control. 
Moreover, they don't really need to be tied to a particular fvwm
distribution.

Size is not the only issue.  

There is duplication: FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp, for example, perform extremely
similar functions; Chuck has already said that he started work on merging
them into one module.  FvwmEvent seems to have been born of FvwmAudio, so
the latter is now obsolete, isn't it? 

There is also age: a module that is not maintained properly is very likely
to be broken.  To distribute code (even if labelled as "extra") that may
or may not work reflects badly upon us.

I think this is a good idea.

There are a few sort of "core" modules, like the pager, buttons, etc, that
should be distributed with fvwm.  The rest can be distributed separately.

Basically, the fvwm distribution should have a sample system.fvwm2rc file
that is very vanilla.  All the modules required for this sample file
should be included.  None of the others need be.

Didn't someone recently propose builtin menus with mini-icons?

Sorry, I don't see  duplication as a   problem.  (Maybe for  us during
builds, but we are a minority.)  I don't  use M4 or  Cpp, but I'm sure
there are people that do.  If we drop one we inconvienience some group
of people.

FvwmEvent  and FvwmAudio  present   similar   issues.   FvwmAudio   is
redundant (not obsolete?) but users config  files still invoke it.  If
we  come up with  some way  to make  FvwmAudio  config files work with
FvwmEvent, I'm all for it.

Hmm...

I haven't   seen  any  module  become   more broken  due   to lack  of
maintenance, the module interface is amazingly stable.  There seems to
have been  one  incompatible change between  fvwm 1.x  and  2.x.  (Not
counting new facilities.)

I'm not clear on what the proposal is.  Are we just dumping things, or
creating a separate source tree for the extras.  Which things?

Hm.  Does it work for you?  (The ultimate test :).  It may be that
_so_far_ there are no problems because the values passed to variadic
functions are all of type long anyway.

Or, the compiler may be automatically promoting all integers to the
largest type (although that seems wrong to me... my C standard is at
work, though).

There's nothing wrong with that.  The C standard only requires that
sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long), and short must be at least
16 bits (and I think long must be at least 32, but I forget).

Am I missing the confusion? :)

  sr> I didn't really catch all the rest of what you said, but we'll
  sr> have to figure out some portable way to handle this.  And soon.

I specified the proper code in my email: all the integers passed to
variadic functions (those with "..." in the parameter list, specifying
that they take a variable number of arguments) must be explicitly cast
to the type you want them to have.

The deal is this: if you have a prototype in scope:

  void foo(unsigned long)

and you pass this function a variable of type "int", the compiler is
required to do the integer promotion from int to long for you by the C
standard.

But in the case of a variadic function there's no prototype, so the
compiler can't do that.  I _think_ (again I don't have my standard
handy) that in the absence of a prototype the compiler is supposed to
promote everything to "int", but I forget.

In this case (and in the other very common case of a variable number of
pointers, delimited by a NULL pointer, which everyone also forgets) you
need to cast the value by hand in order to ensure proper promotion
(remember NULL is just a 0; it's only in a pointer context that it
becomes the magical "null pointer").

So, all the arguments BroadcastPacket(..., foo, bar, baz) should be
BroadcastPacket(..., (unsigned long)foo, (unsigned long)bar, (unsigned
long)baz).  However, although I did know this I didn't do it because
that's a royal pain.  My email was to suggest we create a typedef for
"unsigned long" so we don't have to type the entire thing out over and
over :-/.

  sr> I also noticed that you fixed up the includes for string and mem*
  sr> functions in acconfig.h.  Thanks!  What I had was copied directly
  sr> out of the autoconf manual.  I guess the manual should be updated,
  sr> eh?

Probably.  The GNU make stuff has been around a lot longer and on more
systems :)

  sr> Is it the case that all compilers that handle prototypes have stdarg.h?

Well, probably.  But either way you cannot use varargs.h with
prototypes, so if we're requiring prototypes we must require stdarg.h.

  sr> If stdarg.h is *required* to build fvwm, shouldn't we check for it

Well, I put some code for this into libs/debug.c (or maybe
libs/fvwmlib.h, I forget).  But in general you're right, there's some
missing configuration there.

  sr> For the instant, it doesn't bother me to drop varargs.h support.

Agreed... but as I said, it'd be an extraordinarily strange system that
had a prototype-capable compiler but didn't have stdard.h.

  sr> It was me.  I had to change them because the ones you checked in

Ah.  I'll look into that.

This depends completely on your compiler.  Some compilers won't allow
you to provide both -g and -O in the same object file (sometimes not
even in the same link!)

However, GCC (and, probably, most modern compilers) do allow and even
encourage this (note there are some warnings, for example, which won't
be issued unless optimization is enabled).

It can, of course, be a little odd debugging these apps since (esp. on
RISC systems where pipeline optimizations, etc. come into play) the code
pointer can skip around a lot, moving you what appears to be _backwards_
in the code as you step, sometimes... :)

GNU autoconf tests for this and doesn't enable optimization (as I
recall) if your compiler doesn't support both -g and -O at the same
time.

I agree with this, sort of.  Definitely everything required by
system.fvwm2rc should be provided by default.  However, it's not
entirely obvious to me we should provide only the most generic stuff.  I
dunno, I just don't like it when I have to go get 3 or 4 separate
packages and install them before I can get interesting functionality.
I would like to see a simple, but still interesting default setup that
used some mini-icons, maybe some other things.  We could ship 2 or
three: basic, medium, and gaudy or something.

And I think it would be nice if there were a basic set of tools everyone
(writing modules and themes) could rely on: for example, FvwmAnimate
relies on FvwmForm being available, and I really like the direction Dan
is taking with gui configurability in general.  If FvwmForm isn't
standard, that will be a whole lot harder (as an example).

Maybe someone should generate a list of what we have, module-wise, and
make initial suggestions.  That might be the best way to reach consensus
on this.

PS. I really agree with Dan that something like FvwmForm _must_ provide
    the ability to set "defaults" that take effect for all forms that
    don't explicitly override them.  This kind of thing will be crucial
    for good themes, I expect.  I'm not extremely familiar with the
    module config interface: is something like that possible now, or
    does fvwm only feed lines matching the "module alias"?

The problem with duplicated code is not BUILDing it, but MAINTAINing it. 
It means you have to apply the same fix multiple times.  If you forget an
instance of the code, something may break.  It means you have to debug
very similar code multiple times.  This is boring, so if the code is
similar enough one is tempted to test one instance and assume the others
also work.  Not good. 

In short: it is inelegant and, for reasons alluded to above, I tend to
view duplicated code as less trustworthy.

There were actually two proposals that I lumped together.  However, either
one or the other or both could be adopted:


1.  Remove redundant code from the distribution.  Two examples were cited
above: dropping FvwmAudio in favour of FvwmEvent (if it is truly a
superset), and merging the functionality of FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 into
FvwmPreproc.  


2.  Remove "non-core" modules.  I don't have a clear idea of what the
criteria for being considered "core" should be.  Clearly, it should
include the modules used in the most simple config file from "samples". 
I'm not sure it would include everything in "extras", though. 


Removing a module does not mean it would disappear.  If there were
sufficient interest, it would get maintained by someone.  Removing a
module means that the fvwm distribution proper is smaller, more focused,
and has a higher probability of all working together.

Yes, because I wasn't being clear.  I thought the alpha was a "64 bit
machine" and I assumed this meant it had 64 bit registers.  What puzzles
me is: why use only half the register width for integers?  Sure, a 32-bit
integer follows the C standard, but then you haven't derived any benefit
from the "64 bitness" of the machine (except for pointers).

Okay I'm confused again.

Why are varags.h and prototypes incompatible?  Granted, you can't
prototype a varadic function.  But does that mean you can't prototype the
other (non-varadic) functions?

You can't prototype the stdarg.h version of varadic functions either, can
you?

My problem with it is slightly different: I think it's _confusing_.

Let me use the example of buttonbars/icon managers.  We have the builtin
windowlist, builtin iconbox, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan,
FvwmWinList, FvwmGoodStuff, FvwmTaskBar, and FvwmWharf.  That's 9
different ways to deal with windows/icons!  Now, all of these (I
assume!) do slightly different things--I'm not very familiar with most
of them.  However, they're all somewhat overlapping, I think, and that's
pretty confusing for the user.  I know it confuses me!

Why should they use this one over that one?  What are differences?  The
features?  The shortcomings?  Which, if any, make sense to use together?
At the very least these things should be centrally documented.

  sr> 1.  Remove redundant code from the distribution.

  sr> 2.  Remove "non-core" modules.

I'd like to see the main areas of current modules examined, and try to
focus on _one_ module for each area.  This may mean merging features of
multiple modules or something, and I'm not saying this should be a 2.2
goal, of course.  But that's what I'd like to see.  Obviously the module
interface is still public and people can write all sorts of new
modules.  Maybe one of them will even become better than what's in fvwm
and become a standard.  My hope is that with a more open source
development there won't be as much incentive to "fork" whole new modules
to get slightly (?) different behavior.

Certainly there's something to be said for smaller, targeted modules but
there's also something to be said for more generically useful modules so
we don't need as many...

No, you can.  But the point is, if your compiler supports prototypes
then it either (a) can't do variadic functions, which seems almost
impossible, or (b) has stdarg.h.  Or, I guess, (c) which is it has some
completely non-standard way of doing it.

So if we require a prototyping compiler it seems not worth it to worry
about not having stdarg.h.

Not that I'm saying we shouldn't test for it in configure, mind you.
That's probably a good thing.  I'm just saying we probably don't need to
spend a lot of coding effort in fvwm attempting to work with varargs.h
environments.

But, I could be wrong :).

  sr> You can't prototype the stdarg.h version of varadic functions
  sr> either, can you?

Sure, that's what ... is for:

  void foo(int count, ...);

It works with --enable-extras, but not without it. I don't want

I have fixed the bugs introduced with my merge on saturday.

Other modifications in my last commit session:

 - Issue with aborting move/resize with a mouse cleaned up
   Pressing button 1 confirms the action, any other aborts it
   (except when dragging/resizing with a button held down. Any
   button press aborts then).

 - cleand up manpage

 - speeded up processing of InitFunction and RestartFunction
   (ClickTime is set to a negative value when executing these).

Bye

I have merged FvwmTile and FvwmCascade to form a new
module called FvwmRearrange. If 'FvwmTile' and 'FvwmCascade'
are links to the new executable they behave exactly as the
old modules before.

Steve, I didn't know how to create symbolic links with
in Makefile.am. Could you do this?

  FvwmTile -> FvwmRearrange
  FvwmCascade -> FvwmRearrange
  FvwmTile.1 -> FvwmRearrange.1
  FvwmCascade.1 -> FvwmRearrange.1

I didn't add the new module to the distribution. So could you
put it in and remove FvwmTile and FvwmCascade the same time 
please?

Bye

Hi All,
	Here's a patch to today's code (9th November) that I think fixes the
problem.  The QueryPointer is only done if the Xevent was a key press. 
This means moves from the pager and moves from window decorations acts
like before.
The problem with moves from key presses from menus is also fixed.

Let me know if this breaks anything,
Tim.

I have to  say, I admire Dominik's approach.   He  combines 2 modules,
points out the remaining problems, and we are done.

If  we  get the  make  process to  create  the links  needed,  I guess
FvwmAudio will follow shortly.

This is the relevant part of modconf.c:

void SendDataToModule(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
	      unsigned long context, char *action, int *Module)
{
  struct moduleInfoList *t;
...
  t = modlistroot;
  while(t != NULL) {
    SendName(*Module,M_CONFIG_INFO,0,0,0,t->data);
    t = t->next;
  }  
  SendPacket(*Module,M_END_CONFIG_INFO,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);
}

"modlistroot" is the list of all module config commands.
Note that fvwm2 has no knowledge of a module's alias.
This is something I'd like to fix, but it could get a little
tricky, as arg 1 to a module is not always the alias.

So the answer is...yes its possible now.

I noticed in the last revision that some changes were made in here, mainly
beacuse I had an updated version of it.  In looking we probably we want to
update both FvwmCommand and FvwmConsole to the most current versions,
since a lot of bug fixes were made.  If anyone else wants to do this go
ahead otherwise I will get CVS access and do it.

Additionally I don't seem to see any log notes on what exactly the
motivation for the changes to FvwmCommand.c were.  Could whoever made
these enlighten me.

Brad

Well, it does work as advertised for me.

If I build WITHOUT enabling extras, I can still cd into extras, or even
extras/foo, and run any make command including clean.

But maybe I didn't understand your original request properly.  If you are
asking that "make clean" recurse into extras from the top level directory,
regardless of whether you --enable-extras or not, the answer is no.

I can't (at least a few days ago). I'll try it again and post
the error output if it fails again.

No, you undestood it exactly.

It seems some changes to readconfig.c were made to clean up memory leaks
in FvwmIconMan but now the gotobutton lines don't work corrrectlly.  Here
is the error I get.

FvwmIconMan: Bad function list, comma expectedFvwmIconMan: Bad action:
gotobutton Left, select
FvwmIconMan: Offending line: *FvwmIconMan*action Key   Left   N gotobutton
Left, select
FvwmIconMan: Bad action


which is exactlly what the man page describes.  This doesn't matter much
to me since I rarely use the keyboard navigation, but either another
change needs to be made, or the man page needs to change

This series is another where it seems like we have 'way more variants of
modules than are really necessary.  We have FvwmTalk, FvwmCommand,
FvwmConsole, FvwmPipe (?), and fvwmperl and fvwmpython.

Shouldn't we be able to condense these into at most two modules; some
kind of interactive module and one for scripting?  Maybe that's just me :)

You should really check out the CVSWeb interface, it's most excellent:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi

(I don't know if it's my link to UH or what, but the WWW access to this
site always seems pretty slow... is it just me?  The CVS access isn't
bad at all.)

However, I don't see any changes in FvwmCommand.c, except some simple
whitespace differences.  What in particular were you thinking of?

When I try to build a distribution (--enable-extras),
FvwmScript does not build anymore during the initial
make (right after the configure). Sorry, I don't have
the error output at the moment.

FvwmTalk and FvwmConsole are just about the same.  FvwmConsole can use
the readline library which is very nice (searchable history) but it
requires xterm so that may rule out deleting FvwmTalk.

FvwmCommand is a superset of FvwmPipe.

Don't know about fvwmperl/python but there is an FvwmCommand.pl that can
be used in perl scripts.

Cheers,
Tim.

I agree, I don't even install Talk, Console is a full functiong superset,
that includes a saved scrollable history mechanism as well.

I don't have a preference on a scripting module FvwmCommand just happen to
have a lot of examples that did what I needed.

I remember the error now. It was something like:

  no rule to create 'y.foobar.c' needed for target 'y.foobar.o'.

fvwmperl is obsolete now. I exchanged mail with the author
(copyrights) and he told me there is a better successor.
Unfortunatelt I threw away the mail by accident and cannot
remember the name exactly, but it was something like
fvwmX11. Could someone try to find that?

I'm not sure what my problem is.  I get core dumps at home and at work
with all the latest releases.  The problem is in the XPM library:

 FNH: Freeing non heap memory
 This is occurring while in:
       free           [rtlib.o]
       xpmFreeColorTable [Attrib.c]
       XpmFreeXpmImage [Image.c]
       GetXPMFile     [icons.c:727]
              tmp_win->flags |= SHAPED_ICON;
          #endif
          
       =>   XpmFreeXpmImage(&my_image);
            free(path);
          #endif /* XPM */
          }
       CreateIconWindow [icons.c:76]
       Iconify        [icons.c:935]
       HandleMapRequestKeepRaised [events.c:773]
       CaptureAllWindows [fvwm.c:571]
       Recapture      [builtins.c:3353]
       ExecuteFunction [functions.c:247]
       ComplexFunction [complex.c:159]
       ExecuteFunction [functions.c:253]
       ReadSubFunc    [read.c:160]
       ReadFile       [read.c:181]
       ExecuteFunction [functions.c:247]
       main           [fvwm.c:380]
       _start         [crt1.o]
 Attempting to free block at 0xe4268 in the text section.
 Address 0xe4268 is 14316 bytes past start of global variable "_lib_version".
 This is defined in fvwm2.


I tried initializing  my_image to  zero  which  didn't  help.  My  XPM
library is 3.4j.

When  I comment out the XpmFreeXpmImage,  I don't see any memory leak.
However, I can't  seem to run  fvwm2 2.1.2 to completion under purify,
it  hangs  in  icons.c line  600,   doing a "grabiconsbuttons"  during
startup.

I'm suspecting a bug in the Xpm library, but so far, I don't see it.

You can also open up another virtual terminal under Linux and start another
X11 session there.  In fact, something like that will likely be necessary
for solving some bugs.

There are a couple of other alternatives too that I used to use at work
under AIX:

  VNC:  http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/
  XMX:  http://www.cs.brown.edu/software/xmx/

VNC behaves a little better than XMX for debugging fvwm, from my experience
(since it is actually an XFree86 X11 server, like Xnest, where XMX is
playing games to achieve that effect).

VNC and XMX are also quite useful for other things too (like remotely
working from home, remote problem solving, and classroom demonstrations)
and probably much easier to build than the full X11 distribution.

I've never seen any other complaints.  Of course, it's reasonably fast for
me since I'm local, but the machine running it isn't the best thing in the
world.

I've just got 2.1.1 working and I'm still having the same problem
w/ActivePlacement.  I'm not sure if this problem was addressed in
this version or not, any ideas????

foobar = "tab", perhaps?  I see a "y.tab.c" in extras/FvwmScript. 

It sounds like the file is missing, or at least "make" thinks so.  Despite
the name, it is NOT a built file, so there is no reason for it to be
missing.  Maybe just update your sources?

This is the reason that the site is so slow I believe:
Nov  9 17:07:40 angreal identd[10461]: from: 129.7.3.5 ( Sina.HPC.UH.EDU ) for: 3214, 80
Nov  9 17:07:40 angreal identd[10461]: Successful lookup: 3214 , 80 : ehliar.ehliar 

The server tries to check identd for every single connection...
I grew so frustrated that I firewalled connections from sina.hpc.uh.edu
to port 113 on my computer, and that site is much faster now.. although one
should probably discuss this with the administrators of www.hpc.uh.edu.

Hi Paul,

Sorry for being pedantic on this.  This is a genuine question, and not
rhetorical.

I asked:

>   sr> Is it the case that all compilers that handle prototypes have stdarg.h?

Paul says:
 
>   >> Well, probably.  But either way you cannot use varargs.h with
>   >> prototypes, so if we're requiring prototypes we must require stdarg.h.

I didn't see the connection between varags.h and prototypes, so I asked:

>   sr> Why are varags.h and prototypes incompatible?

And Paul says:

> [...]  But the point is, if your compiler supports prototypes
> then it either (a) can't do variadic functions, which seems almost
> impossible, or (b) has stdarg.h.  Or, I guess, (c) which is it has some

So, this seems to come back to the original answer: "probably".

There is no connection between prototypes and stdarg.h.  You could
logically have a compiler with prototypes, varargs.h but without stdarg.h. 

On the other hand, if the compiler knows prototypes, it likely also has
stdarg.h.  In other words, option (b) is more likely than (c). 

Is this a correct reading?

I didn't know that, anyway, I just wanted to point out to the admin that
the ident connections slow down interactivity a _lot_, especially if you are
on a dialup connection. but if it is policy, I guess you can't do much about it.

Well, not really, as it directly effects development.

The relevant directive requires us to collect as much info as possible.
Unfortunately ident is pretty much useless anyway, especially for web
browsing where most of your hits are from proxies or PCs.  I had a little
talk with the translator between legalese and admin-speak (who says that
the directive means "thou shalt make ident queries") and explained that
this is equivalent to "thy web performance shall suck".  The option is
turned off for the time being.

Once I move stuff to a dedicated machine I shouldn't have to worry about
it.

Maybe we could still remove it, but provide FvwmConsole with a non-xterm
option?  IOW, merge them?  We could even do what Dominik did and have
FvwmConsole use a private window if it was invoked as FvwmTalk.

  tp> FvwmCommand is a superset of FvwmPipe.

So, does anyone use FvwmPipe?  It's in the extras directory anyway.
Maybe it's simple to remove.

I don't know much about them either, and neither of them seem
"up-to-date".  Seems like a wrapper to interact with FvwmCommand (as in
FvwmCommand.pl) would be much simpler.  Maybe they should both go, too.

The problem is in FvwmScript/Makefile.in:

  distclean-compile:
          -rm -f *.tab.c

This is probably how that file disappeared.  Since there's nothing in
Makefile.am that should introduce that, I guess automake is "helpfully"
adding it for you.

My best advice, if you want to keep that file a source file instead of a
derived file, is to rename it so it doesn't look like a yacc output file.

It looks to me like your XpmFreeXpmImage tries to free the contents of
the pointer it's passed, not just the things it points to, so it's
trying to free memory on the stack (the my_image structure).  Well,
maybe not, the free is in xpmFreeColorTable.  Hmm.  I don't have xpm
sources handy; do you know what the code looks like there?

Mine says 3.4j, too, when I run strings on the shared lib.

Very odd.  Can you rebuild xpm with debugging on and see anything more?

Weird!

The xpmFreeColorTable() function makes me ask: what about the "color
normalization" code for pixmaps?  Where does that fit into fvwm and how
is it invoked?  Maybe there's a bug in here which is corrupting pixmaps
somehow?  I wonder if you have an older or newer version of that code
lying around somewhere?  Have you tried to "cvs co" a shiny new version
to see if it happens there, too?

Hi all,
	The following is a trial patch that adds an optional argument "Warp" to
the Move and AnimatedMove commands.  With it the commands warp the
pointer with the window, without it the pointer remains where it is.

It's a trial version because I don't understand how to do parsing
properly so it just looks for Warp in the action string. i.e. it's case
sensitive.  Please feel free to hack it into shape.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hm, I misread your question if that's what you wanted to know :).

They're incompatible because you cannot declare a function that uses the
"..." format using varargs.h.  Varargs.h creates a special type called
"va_dcl" that _requires_ an old-style, non-prototyped function
definition.  That is, to use varargs.h you _must_ declare your variadic
function like this:

  int foo(va_alist)
    va_dcl      /* Note!  No semicolon here, either! :( */
  {
    va_list ap;

    va_start(ap);
    ...
    va_end(ap);
  }

This is quite incompatible with prototypes "..." format; you can't use
them together.  Or at least, I've never heard of a way (and I can't see
any way) to do so.

So...

In other words, since varargs.h can't be used with "...", if the
compiler supports "..." it must support something besides varargs.h.

So, either (case a) it supports prototypes in general but _not_ "..." in
particular, which I've never heard of, or (case b) it supports "..." and
has stdarg.h (most everyone), or (case c) it supports "..." and has some
other way, not stdarg.h or varargs.h, to deal with it (again, I've not
heard of this--seems very silly to not use stdarg.h in this case).

  sr> There is no connection between prototypes and stdarg.h.  You could

I don't see how this is possible (assuming, here, you are including the
"..." notation when you say "prototypes").  Without stdarg.h (or some
other, non-varargs.h method) prototyped variadic functions are useless
as they cannot be defined.

This looks like it's the obsoleted 0.4 release. 1.0 is living in CPAN,
under the name X11-Fvwm. Try
http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-category/08_User_Interfaces/
    X11/X11-Fvwm-1.0.tar.gz
for 1.0 (sorry about the linewrap)...  I've used it for quite a few
months now. Incidentally, the perl-based make explicitly requires that
the version == 2.0.46...

dv> How do I do this?

If I remember correctly, like this:

  startx -- :1

Then just use Alt-Ctrl-F7/F8 to toggle between :0 and :1 (I believe that by
default F1 to F6 are text virtual terminals and F7 to F12 are for X :0 to
:5).

That's also useful if you need to run a program under a different
visual/depth than what your current X session is (ie - programs that can
only handle 8bpp PseudoColor when you might normally run 24bpp TrueColor)
since XFree86 doesn't currently support multiple visual types.

Has anyone noticed
1. that certain windows like FvwmButtons seem to grow on a recapture
2. other windows shift up 10 pixels or so.

I seem to remember the second happening in 2.0.46 but some patch had fixed
it.  The first I have never seen before.

No, I didn't put it in the stuff which ended up in CVS. I started working on
it and it looked to me to be at that sort of half-finished stage where it was
just easier for me to write my own from scratch than try to figure it out. I
didn't get much farther than you did though :-(.

Thanks Paul, you put your finger right on it.
Also recompiling the xpm library with debug led me right to it.

The colorlimiting code was replacing the malloced storage
in the XPM color structure with some static storage.
(It seemed very efficient to me at the time.)

I've checked in a fix for this.

Just a friendly reminder: please include a ChangeLog snippet with each
patch so we can install it when we apply the patch.  It gives you credit
and it helps people understand what changes have been made.

Also, for those with write access, don't forget to update the ChangeLog
when you make changes...

For Emacs users nothing could be simpler: after you finish editing a
function, just type C-x 4 a (add-change-log-entry-other-buffer) and
everything is filled in for you.  It'll even find the right file for
you.  It takes a bit to get into the habit, but then it's really
second-nature.

For users of other editors... well, cut and paste, I guess :).  Please
try to keep the same format, as much as possible.

This documentation _really_ helps people, esp. in the far future.  Trust
me, I know :)

I see #2--sort of.  When I restart fvwm2 my Emacs windows seem to shift
over to the right 10 pixels or so.  It happens to both open windows and
inconified windows.

Note my Emacs frames are created with geometry -0+70; maybe it's a
negative geometry problem?  Are your windows that shift up created with
a +X-Y geometry?

Offhand it appears that other apps that are created with a +X+Y geometry
don't seem to have the same problem... but it could also be just Emacs
frames; that's the only app I've noticed it with so far.

I haven't read the COPYING file myself (not had time to set up a CVS
tree), but Debian will be happy so long as the position is clear,
rather than the muddled state of affairs that's currently the case.

I _very_ much prefer the old click-drag-release system.  2.0.46 warps
the pointer, as does 2.0.47b.  I don't have a 2.0.47d build,
unfortunately.

	Dan, had you planned to extend the FvwmAnimate technology to a
rework of the AnimatedWindowshade patch that's been lying around in
unofficial_patches for ages?

	I was just starting to make up a list of things that would be
nice to start working on after the release, and this one sprang to mind
(since I used the old patch on 2.0.46, and was sorry it didn't make it
into the release).

	However, seeing what you've done with FvwmAnimate, it seems to 
me that we ought to look into re-implementing windowshade animation via
the module interface.

Haven't had time to check the CVS-tree, so I'll just put a
quick question here: Has the pager-ballon stuff by Ric Lister
been incorporated into the CVS-sources? It's a *really* nice
addition to my 2.0.46 setup, and should be worth to have in
the 'soon-to-be-coming-we-hope' distribution.

Nice to see that work on our dear WM has been given a boost
again - hope you can keep it up!

Tonight I fixed the remaining memory leaks (at least the ones
I am aware of).

Problems remaining:

 - I couldn't find any hint in the code for the uninitialised
   memory read Paul had in the purify log. In fact it looks as
   is someone fixed that (nothing in the Changelog however).

 - In add_windows.c there was a memory leak with XGetWMName.
   The manpage does not state that the string has to be freed,
   but there was definitely a leak. So I did this and it does
   not coredump. Any comments?

Nobody seems to know how the animated panels in FvwmButtons
work. But perhaps someone can tell me how to contact the author?

from teh Changelog:

  15. Patch to FvwmButtons to add animated panels to it (like CDE
      or Wharf) from Jui-Hsuan Joshua Feng
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perhaps someone should write a paper on how parsing should be done ;-)
Perhaps I will do this someday.

I would do it like this:

  n = GetPositionArguments(action,x,y,width+tmp_win->bw,
                           height+tmp_win->bw,&FinalX,&FinalY);
  GetNextToken(SkipNTokens(action, n), &token);
  if (StrEquals(token, "Warp"))
    fWarp = TRUE;
  if (token)
    free(token)

BTW, you should do it the other way round since warping was
is the default at the moment:

  fWarp = TRUE;
  if (StrEquals(token, "NoWarp"))
    fWarp = TRUE;

Don't know what happened but FvwmIconMan crashes on start-up.  The
following is all that it prints. The complaint about /dev/console has
been around for yonks and is almost certainly not the problem though it
should be fixed one day.
This is without any configuration lines at all.

*FvwmIconMan: cannot open /dev/console

I'm assuming you only want one manager

It doesn't complete the Font: line

Even better: write some library routines!

Is there something wrong with this?
I don't see how there possibly could be:

That is the reason for the paper: the library routines are already
there. I wrote a number of them (see Parse.c and XResources.c).
Just nobody knows.

I've not seen the growing behaviour, but I can reproduce (2).  There's
a full description at:

  http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/16/16143.html

The patch that was posted to this list was a hack, and didn't make
clear the root cause of the problem.

Cool.  

I had to put in a

	#include "config.h"
line.

OK, the symlinks are made during build.  However, they may be installed as
real files, not symlinks.

OK, I have modified the makefiles so that 

	modules/FvwmTile
	modules/FvwmCascade
and also
	textures
	extras/fvwmperl
	extras/fvwmpython

are NOT built and are NOT part of the distribution (make dist).  

I've left them in the CVS tree for now, in case someone really objects and
we need to put them back.  Please DON'T rename them to "old-something", or
put them in some other directory, because it messes up the CVS tree
forever.

I was going to fix it when I added my other pixmap cleanup, but you'd
already fixed it when you reworked all that code in windows.c :).

I hadn't planned to attack windowshading.   Since I'm pretty obviously
a builtin    iconbox  user, windowshade animation    doesn't hold much
interest.

I think using the module interface should be feasible.

I'm never   sure what  I'll do next,   but  I've been  thinking  about
FvwmForms, and  I'd really like to  figure out why  XScreenSaver can't
install its Private Colormap with fvwm2.

I just noticed that there appear to be duplicate entries in some of the
Changelogs?

E.g., in fvwm/Changelog I see:

  1998-11-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmButtons/parse.c (seekright): switched to new syntax of
	DoGetNextToken.

but then in fvwm/modules/Changelog I also see:

  1998-11-10  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmButtons/parse.c (seekright): switched to new syntax of
	DoGetNextToken.

Is there a problem in the process somewhere or is this just a "typo"?

I just compiled the latest snapshot of FvwmIconMan and in debug.h
PRINT_DEBUG is defined (I'm not sure that it was before).  But, with this
defined you can't get the executable to actually start, there are two many
places where null strings are being passed in to the print functions with
no checks.  This should be easy enough to fix all the debug functions are
in debug.c we could just check if any of the args are null then issue a
warning about them.

We probably we want to create the links after we install instead of making
links to Cascade and Tile during the compile that way it is a little more
obvious that they are all the same module.

That is the reason for the paper: the library routines are already
there. I wrote a number of them (see Parse.c and XResources.c).
Just nobody knows.

I see Steve tried to do this; it _kinda_ works but not really :)

The current method creates symlinks in the build tree, but when "make
install" is run it _copies_ these to the install directory and that
resolves the symlink and copies the binary.  So, you end up with 3
distinct files with identical contents in your install directory.

Steve, I think you're going to have to write a special-case install rule
to handle this, rather than allowing automake to do it.  You can define
a rule in Makefile.am like:

  install-exec-local:
            ...normal make script here...

which automake will see and automatically hook up to be run when
install-exec is run (see the manual for automake) and you can make
symlinks, etc. in here.  You don't even need to make the symlinks in the
build directory at all; just create them on installation.

_However_, I'd like to discuss _not_ doing this first :)

I guess I'd just hate to see the distribution become crowded with lots
of these sorts of things.  Can't FvwmRearrange be invoked with an alias
to get the same effect:

  + "I" FvwmRearrange FvwmTile

or something?  (If not, shouldn't it? :)  If so, I guess I'd prefer that
we document this in the NEWS file as the correct way to fix older setups
rather than installing links.

My $0.02.

I found that the yacc & lex sources were included, in the "Compiler"
subdir.  So, I stuck them in the same FvwmScript directory and changed the
makefile to build the scanner & parser .c and .h files.

The automake docs claim that the yacc-constructed files will end up in the
distribution, but that doesn't seem to be happening.  This is probably
because I am NOT building in the source directory. 

By the way: is anyone using FvwmScript?  I'm not.  When I ran yacc (or was
it bison) on the grammar, I got a slightly different C source file.  It'd
be good to know if it still works correctly.

I'd prefer not to warp by default. This patch applies to Move and
AnimatedMove
and since Move is older and it never did warping I think that should be
the default.  AnimatedMove wasn't in 2.0.46 so less people will be
bothered by its default warp setting being changed.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think it is important to have the links so that people cn continue to use
there existing .fvwm2rc files without having everything break under them.
There is a huge installed base to deal with.

However, I also think that your suggestion is correct, and should be added
so that as new startup files are written, they can be done without
dependancy on the links. Then at a later day (like a year) it can be
dropped. 

I think that once a good "themes" infrastructure is in place in the
distribution it will be alot easier to switch.

The NEWS should say "convert before it is to late!".

My emacs walks even with positve y's but so do things like xterms and
FvwmButtons.

It seems that it is mostly FvwmButtons that is growing (and the ocassional
gimp subwindow).  But I don't know to much of the Buttons code, to even
know where to begin to look.

Lookin' good!!!  The log is small enough that I don't feel the need to
post it gzipped :).

Hmm.  We still have a bothersome leak in the pixmap cache in
libs/Picture.c.  I took a medium-depth look at LoadPicture,
CachePicture, and a shorter look at DestroyPicture, and didn't notice
anything offhand.  It looks like someone must be free'ing the Picture
struct returned from CachePicture() without freeing the pixmaps.  Hmm.
Don't know if this is related but I see one probable leak; in
menus.c:AddToMenu() is this code:

      if (StrEquals(token2, "title"))
	{
	  tmp->next = menu->first->next;
	  free(menu->first);
	}

I don't think you can just free the MenuItem here.  Shouldn't there be a
FreeMenuItem() function or something that makes sure to free up any and
all pixmaps or other memory associated with the menu item?

And there are still a couple of other pixmap and stripcpy leaks.

That's why I built in this behaviour with symlinks.

I didn't think I had to mention it explicitly: You can *of course*
call FvwmRearrange to get both effects. If invoked as

  FvwmRearrange -tile ...

it behaves like FvwmTile, if invoked as

  FvwmRearrange -cascade ..

it behaves like FvwmCascade :-)

OK, I thought it was vice versa.

Good. I was hoping for a smaller update of the log so I can
concentrate on the remaining problems. However we will
probably discover new leaks if we make a config-file that
uses more of the features.

Can't purify detect this somehow?

You're right. I'll try to do this.

I want to make a test setup for fvwm2 so we can verify/purify
more code in parallel. Please send me your gzipped .fvwm2rc
files (if possible with name and email address on the first
line).

Please send directly to me to keep the list clean:

I noticed that the current install setup puts modules into a dir that is
based on the current version, but still overwrites the old version of
fvwm2.
 
Seems to me that it would make more sense to install fvwm as fvwm2.1.2 (or
whichever) and build a symlink to fvwm2.  This way, the old versions will
still be around, but you can also still just call fvwm2 get get the latest
one.

Its just an idea, but maybe one that should be considered?

later,

Attached is a rather lengthy FvwmScript that I wrote for fvwm-2.0.45.
The number of widgets here greatly exceeded the default in the version
of FvwmScript that shipped with fvwm-2.0.45, so I patched up FvwmScript
and sent the changes to the author. I'm hoping the version of FvwmScript
that is in the repository works without any source changes.

FvwmScript is a really nice tool, IMHO. I wrote the script below to allow
people at my work to open "customized" X terminals (basically, it is a
GUI for setting foreground/background color, picking amongst 8 decent
xterm fonts, setting the window title, etc.)

I wouldn't mind having the script (or a variant of it, if somebody has
some changes/suggestions) included with the next release of fvwm; I think
it would be a nice addition, and it may show people the possibilities
of using FvwmScript. The fact that it is in the "extras" directory doesn't
help, since a lot of people don't compile with "--enable-extras".

This is my first message to the fvwm-workers list. Is there a "Getting
Started" document that would show me how to pull the latest-and-greatest
fvwm from CVS and play with it? I'd like to see if some features I requested
(WarpToTransient for example :-) have been implemented via the "Style"
flags... it is an incredibly useful feature (think about Netscape's "Find"
window, for example.) The other thing I hacked in fvwm-2.0.45/46 was the
ability to use the middle and right mouse buttons during ActivePlacement
to allow resizing the window (before placing it) by clicking-and-dragging
the middle button (click drops the window, and dragging allows you to resize
it before the window is actually mapped), and "resize to bottom of screen"
with the right mouse button (that is, during active placment, you drag
around the outline of the window, click the right button, and the height
of the window is adjusted to within a few pixels of the bottom of the
screen. Great for creating "tall" xterms!)

Finally, there is a "bug" in fvwm-2.0.45/.46 that prevents you from "grabbing"
the outline of a window if it touching the edge of the screen. Instead,
fvwm "passes" the click through to the root window, as if the window border
wasn't even there. This has something to do with the "invisible" window around
the edge of the screen that is used for something (I can't remember what.)
But is something I'm hoping is fixed as well.

Anyway, here is my "Terminal Settings" FvwmScript. Comments/feedback welcome.

Yes, that's in there already.

I've successfully built the entire tree with --enable-extras and
CFLAGS=-DDEBUG :)

Now, how _useful_ that was is questionable, given the varying levels of
debugging (and the fact that fvwm itself seems to have a different way
to enable debugging), but it all compiled.

Someday, someone should look into unifying this and providing a
flexible, basic debugging capability.  I made a start on this with the
DB(()) macro in fvwmlib.h and libs/debug.c, but more needs to be done:

 1) The debugging output should (optionally?) go to a file and the
    filename should (optionally?) be based on the app name, so you can
    keep separate files for each module if you want.  This is the
    biggest pain with Purify, since the logfile is stored in an
    env. variable and so all the modules try to use the same logfile
    :-/.  If I want to purify multiple modules I have to run it with the
    graphical tool, then write the logfiles by hand.

 2) There should probably be different levels of debugging you can set;
    some of the debugging statements I added while testing the module
    packet stuff generated so much output I had to comment them out;
    being able to specify verbosity would be much better.

Just whistling in the wind...

No, I don't think so.

It only looks for lost heap at the end of processing (or, alternatively,
you can ask it to look yourself by breaking the app with a debugger and
calling an internal purify function--if we had an idea of where the
problem was I could probably narrow it down that way.)

And DEVELOPERS!  Don't forget DEVELOPERS (which admittedly overlaps

If you document this stuff we could put it in the instructions
for developers. The biggest problem is that everything has already

*Sigh* So much to do and so little time. I'd like to do lots
of cleanups for parsing and debugging if I only had the time.
But this must probably wait until 2.2.

It's still not finished. It will take some time, but before 2.2
we will have *one* file that explains the copyrights (there will
be some exceptions from the general copyright, but that will be
in the file too).

Hi folks,

we have got done pretty much in the last few weeks. The
list of urgent problems shrinks by the day and we are fast
approaching 2.2. Here goes a list of things that have to be
done before. Have I forgotten anything? Comments?

new stuff:
 - Manpage for FvwmButtons panels (alomost done)
 - Update of FvwmButtons panels patch (optional)
 - Tim's menu-warp patch (almost done)
 - German's newmenu patches (optional, how is the status, German?)
 - Window attraction patch (I want that badly :-) )
 - Go through a list of minor patches and add them (do you
   have some results on this already, Dan?)
 - Get the copyrights straight (80% done)
 - Write the AUTHORS file. Everyone who contributed should
   be listed there.

fixes:
 - Fix the remaining memory leaks
 - Do a thorough purify session that uses most features
   (and fix the bugs of course)

and finally:
 - announce a full-fledged beta test

If we proceed at the same pace we can definitely have the
early in December and perhaps 2.2 as a christmas present.
Sounds nice 8-)  After that I'll reduce my workload
drastically and pass whatever responsibilities I took to
the list.  In fact I'm doing little more than most of you
right now.  This communal effort works surprisingly well!
Keep up the *excellent* work guys.

Bye

Why don't you put your list in some separate section in the TODO file?
Doesn't make sense if everybody keeps his own list.

Hi Jason and folks,

I would like to merge my update patch for the animated panel into the
FvwmButtons module CVS tree.

How could I get a CVS user ID? Thank you very much.

Would you believe my employer has been keeping me busy?

I  think I've gone thru    everything I had    in my inbox.  I  didn't
actually  come up  with any   changes.   Many  of the  patches  became
obsolete or got applied.   Here are the 3  I feel compelled to comment
on:

Status, rejected, don't know why I'd want the resize frame simpler.

Subject: in place of that lame colors.c.patch here comes newhilightcolor.patch. enjoy!
This new patch adds a new .fvwm2rc command, NewHilightColor (ala
HilightColor).
syntax:
NewHilightColor  (foreground) (background) (topshadow) (bottomshadow)
again, to make fvwm2 look more like  mwm here's the eleet color combo:


Status: Rejected. Although I have problems with fvwm2's calculation of
shadow  and highlight colors,  I think Rob would  have  rejected it as
bloat.

Subject: Re: fvwm-2.0.47d released
Okay, finally nailed it.... :)

Status: Pending. This  patch gives a  fix to  FvwmAudio so  that if it
gets a  message  that exceeds MAX_BODY_SIZE it   won't core dump.  The
patch is  for FvwmAudio only,   and I don't  think its  not in a valid
patch format.  It  looks to me like FvwmAudio  still  has the problem,
unless we did some truncation  somewhere else.  The long message comes
from a really long Netscape  window title.  Have we  fixed this on the
sending side?


I've filed these temporarily as "fvwm_rejected" and "fvwm_pending".

I  think so too, imagine  if we had an  even larger  group with update
access.  Even with  the group we  have  now, it seems  chaotic, but it
seems to work.

I upgraded to the latest source, and noticed these problems:

 1) The new colors seem like they'd be cool, but something's wrong.  I
    used to get an animated frame that was mostly white (it seemed to
    me) and easy to see.  With the new FvwmAnimate when I keep the
    default "Black^White", the frame is a medium blue which is hard to
    see.

    In fact, I can't seem to find any of the colors that really show up
    well against my background :(

 2) In the customize Form, I left the color field blank and FvwmAnimate
    dumped core :).  In FvwmAnimate.c:903, GetArgument() is returning a
    NULL ptr but is later passed to strncasecmp() without checking...

The default Black^White hasn't changed.  Its the same XOR pattern
fvwm uses for resize and move frames.

Since the animation frame color XORs into the background, and on non-true
color displays, you are XORing a color cell number into another color
cell number, you have to expect less than ideal results.

Are you using true color, 8 bit, or 16 bit?

On my 8 bit display, using solid  backgrounds, I usually saw something
with the default, but some colors  gave me nothing, where other colors
produced nice effects.  I never got the color I called for.

Not good, I'll get to  it.  It would be neat  if FvwmForm had required
fields.

Don't know what happened but FvwmIconMan crashes on start-up.  The
following is all that it prints. The complaint about /dev/console has
been around for yonks and is almost certainly not the problem though it
should be fixed one day.
This is without any configuration lines at all.

We probably we want to create the links after we install instead of making
links to Cascade and Tile during the compile that way it is a little more
obvious that they are all the same module.

That is the reason for the paper: the library routines are already
there. I wrote a number of them (see Parse.c and XResources.c).
Just nobody knows.

I've not seen the growing behaviour, but I can reproduce (2).  There's
a full description at:

  http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/16/16143.html

The patch that was posted to this list was a hack, and didn't make
clear the root cause of the problem.

Even better: write some library routines!

I just compiled the latest snapshot of FvwmIconMan and in debug.h
PRINT_DEBUG is defined (I'm not sure that it was before).  But, with this
defined you can't get the executable to actually start, there are two many
places where null strings are being passed in to the print functions with
no checks.  This should be easy enough to fix all the debug functions are
in debug.c we could just check if any of the args are null then issue a
warning about them.

That is the reason for the paper: the library routines are already
there. I wrote a number of them (see Parse.c and XResources.c).
Just nobody knows.

I was going to fix it when I added my other pixmap cleanup, but you'd
already fixed it when you reworked all that code in windows.c :).

I just noticed that there appear to be duplicate entries in some of the
Changelogs?

E.g., in fvwm/Changelog I see:

  1998-11-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmButtons/parse.c (seekright): switched to new syntax of
	DoGetNextToken.

but then in fvwm/modules/Changelog I also see:

  1998-11-10  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* FvwmButtons/parse.c (seekright): switched to new syntax of
	DoGetNextToken.

Is there a problem in the process somewhere or is this just a "typo"?

I hadn't planned to attack windowshading.   Since I'm pretty obviously
a builtin    iconbox  user, windowshade animation    doesn't hold much
interest.

I think using the module interface should be feasible.

I'm never   sure what  I'll do next,   but  I've been  thinking  about
FvwmForms, and  I'd really like to  figure out why  XScreenSaver can't
install its Private Colormap with fvwm2.

Cool.  

I had to put in a

	#include "config.h"
line.

OK, the symlinks are made during build.  However, they may be installed as
real files, not symlinks.

OK, I have modified the makefiles so that 

	modules/FvwmTile
	modules/FvwmCascade
and also
	textures
	extras/fvwmperl
	extras/fvwmpython

are NOT built and are NOT part of the distribution (make dist).  

I've left them in the CVS tree for now, in case someone really objects and
we need to put them back.  Please DON'T rename them to "old-something", or
put them in some other directory, because it messes up the CVS tree
forever.

Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

An entire _case_ of virtual beer if you figure this out! :-/.

Note that the latest xlockmore installations also do something funky;
when started on _some_ systems they create a white background; on others
(mine, for example), the background is properly black.

This _sounds_ very similar to the problem with xscreensaver I reported
to the list back in mid-June.  I still have that report if you can't
find it in the archives.

If you do decide to look into this, contact JWZ 'cause he said he'd be
interested in working with someone who "knew what the @#$%& fvwm did
with colormaps" to solve the problem (of course, JWZ never really uses
"@#$%*", he always says the real thing :).

In retrospect, I wish the module command line had been defined to use
UNIX option format instead of a fixed set of parameters, and that
modules were required to ignore any params that they didn't understand.
Might have made upgrades simpler...

It's too bad, but it's definitely illegal and must go.  Good catch; I
never thought of looking in the icons for copyrights.

You might mention this in the NEWS file so (a) we don't get lots of
questions and (b) maybe someone who can, will do something about it :)

Oof.  Note this actually works on some systems (like SunOS); they just
print (NULL) or something :).

You can't do that without re-writing a good chunk of *printf().  The
only way you know what the types of the parameters to the function are
or how many there are is by the %-options in the format string.  You'd
have to parse that string to make this check.

We'll either have to leave PRINT_DEBUG off permanently, or fix the code.

Of course by "paper" you mean some html docs.

Don't forget Modparse.c!  (parsing for modules)

(I can almost hear what our scwm friends are thinking.)

Yah, I was just going to try them until one jumped out at me; none did
then FvwmAnimate dumped core :)

Note I didn't have any lines about color in my (old) .FvwmAnimate file;
I wonder if that matters?

  de> Are you using true color, 8 bit, or 16 bit?

I'm running on a SPARC SunOS system with an X11 (not Openwindows)
server; it's 8-bit PsuedoColor, as best as I can tell.

The "old" default, and the other wire frames, are fine for me.  I'll see
if I can't get them back and play a little more.

I've saved it all since I'm somewhat determined to eventually get it
to work.

I've  been trying to  understand the  ICCCM on this  subject, but  not
really  getting it.   fvwm  seems determined  to   not let any  client
install  a colormap.  The ICCCM  has some other  way for the client to
ask for a colormap to be installed, but I don't think JWZ uses it.

What  I think  JWZ  is   trying to  do is    create  a  root that   is
"overrideredirect".

  attrmask = (CWOverrideRedirect | CWEventMask | CWBackingStore | CWColormap |
	      CWBackPixel | CWBackingPixel | CWBorderPixel);
  attrs.override_redirect = True;

fvwm does this in colormap.c:

  /* Reinstall the colormap that we think should be installed,
   * UNLESS and unrecognized window has the focus - it might be
   * an override-redirect window that has its own colormap. */
  if((ReInstall)&&(Scr.UnknownWinFocused == None))
    {
      XInstallColormap(dpy,last_cmap);    
    }

But I don't see how  that logic detects  override-redirect windows.  I
also don't exactly see  in the ICCCM where  it says that that type  of
window has  the freedom  to install its   own  colormap.  I  think  in
general an override redirect window can  do anything, but I'm not sure
about the colormap in particular.

By the way,  all of this  information is  half-cooked.  (I'm not  sure
about  parts of it, and I've  had some difficultly creating tests that
show what goes on.)

The mail I saw didn't say "work with".

I've seen the language.  I find his home  page and Netnews posts quite
entertaining.

A replacement should probably be put in place so that folks get at least
some meaningful icon, even if it's not exactly what they expect.

I fixed this in FvwmAnimate,  then realised  that  I copied the  logic
from FvwmEvent.  I then fixed this  in FvwmEvent, and during trying to
test FvwmEvent  using  FvwmTalk, I realized I  had  previously fixed a
command truncation  problem  in  FvwmAnimate   that I also    got from
FvwmEvent.  Which I then also fixed in FvwmEvent.

Is everybody following this?

What  I am trying to say  is, I've just  checked  in FvwmAnimate.c and
FvwmEvent.c and their changelogs.

No, not with my setup. Can you narrow it down to a minimal
config with the problem?

I just noticed the subject is wrong! I meant

 FvwmIconMan dies!

The pager was not and is not broken.

Of course I have, I'm the maintainer ;-) (although only for a while).
Anyway, I tried to get the animated panels running, but it
cordumps in free or malloc. There have been changes in parsing and
this may be related to the cores. Does the code with the patch below
work for you?

	Well, I've been a little busy, I tried to upgrade to glibc-2.1 
pre series and my box got totally screwed!, I had to restore a backup
(dated 13-9-98... :( and I lost some things in the process, one of them
the last version of the newmenus patch (I know, I know, BACKUP are 
important...); after that I decide to integrate the old version (that 
works pretty well) in the CVS tree, but now we have a 2.1.1 version 
around, (I've been disconnected from the net during a time, because our
mailserver crashed on saturday and was down until yesterday), my question
is in what should I integrate the newmenus?, in the main CVS tree?, in 
the 2.1.1 version? in any particular branch of the CVS tree?, if the answer
is in the CVS tree, it would be enough to send a encrypted password to 
the mailing list administrator?

	Finally I have a suggestion, what about a fvwm-workers-digest
mailing list? nowadays I am receiving more than twenty mails a day from
the list, it would be nice to have an option to just get a big mail, what 
do you think?

Well, any idea for the replacement icon? We could just copy
a similar one.

I wasn't really aware of the module ChangeLog at first and
copied the entries without thinking.

Into the CVS tree if you feel confident that it runs fairly well (2.1.1
is already obsolete again).

Basically yes. It has become practice however that one of the people
with commit privileges advocates you before giving out the rights
to do so (I do always abstain from these votes). At least people 
should have the chance to voice objections (not that I think that
will happen).

Have a look at my Page, down right. Would that be some substitution?

You can  do anything you  want.  You can even  send me the ASCII and I
will format it for you.

I think you are  trying to say  you don't have much experience writing
html.  I think if you look at one of our  simpler html files, you will
see that you can copy   one, and the  only  thing you  have to add  is
ASCII.

You can even  start your text with "<pre>"  (preformatted) and end  it
with  "</pre>" (end preformatted),   and get the  exact equivalent  of
ASCII.

Well, being an avid XEmacs user,  I have no problem  at all with LISP,
but I'm well aware I have lots of users here that would scream.

I hope someday to make this a non-issue, if  we can remove the need to
edit the configuration  files.  (My guess, we are  years away from the
final goal.)

Might it not be a good idea to put SOMETHING in the place of the
illegal icon?  I've included a simple replacement to this message.
This way, people that are using "canned configurations" will get
an image if they reference xterm-bsd.xpm.

It should be noted that having write access on the CVS is not required to
submit a change, be it a feature or fix.

Anyone can pull down the CVS tree and generate a diff for it very easily. 
Then post the patch (if small enough) or just announce (if the patch is
large) that you have a patch for such-and-such.  One of the maintainers
will commit the patch into the tree on your behalf. 

If you do this frequently enough, you'll be granted CVS write privileges
in short order!  ;-)

Seems like someone else has seen this.  Follows is a quick path to turn
off the debug printing.  This stops it from core dumping on me.

I still get the following complaint that I think is due to the new
parsing:

FvwmIconMan: bif: too few arguments
FvwmIconMan: No function defined
FvwmIconMan: Bad action: Bif Next 3, GotoButton 0, Select, Ret,
GotoButton Next, Select
FvwmIconMan: Offending line: *FvwmIconMan*Action Mouse 2 N Bif Next 3,
GotoButton 0, Select, Ret, GotoButton 

Cheers,
Tim.

Didn't I fix this yesterday? The commas were not parsed correctly,
but I fixed this (hope so).

Can youc check this?

Hi all,

Since this has caused a bit of discussion, let me explain my reasoning,
and make a new proposal about how to handle the obsoleted modules.

Yep, I knew about install-exec-local.  I don't know how to use it without
putting in all the gobbledy-gook that automake & autoconf generate: 
DESTDIR, name mangling, etc.  I suppose it really isn't as bad as I
thought, and I could put it in, but I'm worried about it breaking in a
future revision of automake or autoconf. 

But see below for an alternate plan.

Right.  I created the symlinks in the build directory in case it is useful
to test fvwm and its modules from the build directory.  Maybe it's not
even possible to do so, but it should be.

Yeah, I have to agree here.  I'd rather document the fact that it was
replaced and let people change their configurations.  The deleted modules
(FvwmCascade and FvwmTile) don't even appear in the current sample
system.fvwm2rc files, so maybe they are only marginally used.

Yes, this is an important consideration, and it's why I went against my
preferences and put the links in.

I'm all for documenting the change, and dropping the modules later.
However, I suspect that perhaps people won't read the docs and STILL be
surprised a year later ;-)  And that a year from now we will be having the
same discussion, and the modules will never go away.

The current sample configs use neither Cascade nor Tile.  Anyone know how
long this has been the case?  Maybe for these two modules, we can just
drop them now and document that fact?

Great!  So as an alternative to making a symlink, we could install a small
shell script that goes like:

	#!/bin/sh
	echo >2 "FvwmTile is obsolete; it has been replaced by FvwmRearrange."
	echo >2 "Please change your configuration file."
	exec @moduledir@/FvwmRearrange -tile $@


If it printed this message at every startup, it would be harder to ignore
than a note buried in NEWS that the modules are going away.  Thus, it
would be easier to actually get them removed in a years time.

Of course, people who dump the X11 startup output into .xsession-errors or
whatever *still* wouldn't see this message.  Does fvwm have a module that
could flash up a notice in a dialog box instead?  Something like xmotd?

I agree; this is The Right Way to get privileges.  If you generate
enough work applying patches for maintainers they'll beg you to "just do
it yourself!" :)

If you don't, then write-access is just one more small administrative
burden for both you and Jason, and who needs that?  As Steve points out,
you can always get the latest stuff in the tree, and sending patches
rather than having write-privileges _removes_ a lot of responsibility:
you don't have to worry as much about breaking the tree or having the
very latest code (although it's nice :), etc.

Well, then gzip and post it (possibly with the lines from your

I tried GNU indent but it is not nearly as good as one would hope.
Don't know if it can remove trailing spaces.

Just noticed that you couldn't get zoom3d effects apart from when the
effect is random.  The problem is in a strncasecmp which matches zoom
with zoom3d.  Could be fixed by reordering the effects array but here's
a patch that changed the name of zoom3d to 3dzoom.

Cheers,
Tim.

I have downloaded and successfully build 2.1.1 with all the extras on Solaris
2.5.1, gcc 2.8.0, X11R6.1, make 3.76.1.

The StartsOnDesk Style in not working for me.  I noticed that in the man page
for fvwm2 a new "GlobalOpts" option has been added as a TEMPORARY command to set
some global options.

I have the following set in my $HOME/.fvwm2rc file:

GlobalOpts ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

Here is in excerp of the man page"

               ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage suppresses StartsOn-
               Page or StartsOnDesk placement in the event that both
               ActivePlacement and SkipMapping are in effect when a
               window is created. This prevents you from interactively
               placing a window and then wondering where it disap-
               peared to, because it got placed on a different desk or
               page. Specify ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage to
               allow this to happen anyway, which was the old way that
               StartsOnDesk worked. This has no effect if SkipMapping
               is not in effect, because fvwm will switch to the
               proper desk/page to perform interactive placement. The
               default is ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage.


Using ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage was a stab in the dark for me (I don't
set ActivePlacement as a Style) to see if this would enable the "StartsOnDesk"
Style.  It does not :-{(}

Also if I have a swallowed FvwmPager in FvwmButtons then drag and drop a window
from desktop to another, a second, third, fourth.... pager will be started.

Here is the line from my fvwmbuttons file:

(1x6,Swallow (Close,NoHints,Respawn,NoOld,Notitle) "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0
5",Frame 0,Back firebrick3)

This problem has to be related to being swallowed by FvwmButtons.  If I have the
pager running externally, the problem is not there.  I have tried several
different "Swallow" options with no change.

I will recompile with debug turned on and try to gather some use full
information, but maybe those of you out there who have been elbow deep in the
code can come up with a solution faster then I ever could.

I have been living with the swallowed pager problem for a long time now, but I
cannot live without my "StartsOnDesk" Style (this just might be a new setting
that I am missing.)

FvwmForm can create a popup.
It might not look too nice, (double spaced), but it will do it.

Somehow I think the user will come accross  the message in the session
errors file  sooner or later.  I actually  "tee" the fvwm2 output to a
file and the console.

Please remember that 2.1.1 (as all 2.1.x will be) is an *unstable*
development beta release intended for testing and as a playground
for the developers. It has not been and will not be officially
announced.

Anyway, thanks for the input. We're working hard to fix any bug
that comes up.

Okay, but some builtin method would be better.

You could start fvwm from xsession, which will then display all the
output for you to see. Helps immensely when switching between different
WMs or binaries as well.

(Get it from somewhere like this
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/X11/contrib/applications/).

Which brings me to my bug report :-)  I built Nov 10 version from CVS, and
ran into a growing-window problem with xsession. (This is on RedHat linux,
2.1.125, X11R6.3).

With no WM or some other WMs (can't remember which, but probably twm and
some other derivatives) xsession autoraises even when it doesn't have
focus. This is correct behaviour when there is no WM, so it is always
on top and accessible to start a WM.

Under fvwm-2.0.46 and earlier, xsession behaved like any other window.
Under the new beta it autoraises, but also grows a few pixels in both
directions from bottom right every couple of seconds. The position of the
window remains unchanged. I suspect this is related to the recapture bug.

I have no time to investigate this further at the moment (work, etc, ...).
Maybe at the weekend.

Last time I checked, it would fail to create lighter or darker colors.

If you make a frame #00FF00 (green), it would attempt to create a brighter
color by increasing each rgb component 40%.

So increase 0 by 40% and you get zero.  Increase the max "FF" by 40% and
you get "FF".  So the end result is #00FF00.

Some smarter algorithm is called for.

I just hacked CVS to give meaningful commit messages.  There were generated
before, but didn't actually show who was doing the commit so I just sent
them to myself.  Now they actually show who is doing what, so I think
they're useful enough to send out.  I'm having them sent here; if the
volume gets too high I can move them off to a separate list.

Be sure to use reasonable log entries, since the whole list gets to see
them now.  If you would normally send off a message saying that you updated
this and that, just include it in the log message and save yourself the
trouble.

You know, I  thought I noticed something  like that but it just didn't
sink in.  Thanks for the patch, but I decided I liked the names as is,
and I didn't like the strncasecmp approach this thing was using.

Except for the one case it needs it, I changed to strcasecmp and fixed
the problem.  The changes are committed.

I could fix this, but I see other activity going on for move.c,
and I don't want to confuse the issue.

My download from a few hours ago cores out in move.c, line 506:

  x_move_size = Scr.Hilite->hints.width_inc;

In this case, Scr.Hilite is zero.

Other places in the source code where Scr.Hilite is referenced, there
is first a test for zero.

Yes, I compile the whole fvwm2 from the current CVS tree. It works just fine
with the patch.

I guess there is a bug in the function 'CreateWindow()' in the file
FvwmButtons.c, which might be the cause of the coredumps. It was written as

  {
    myclassshints.res_name=(char *)malloc(sizeof(MyName)+6);
    strcpy(myclasshints.res_name,MyName);
    strcat(myclasshints.res_name,"Panel");
  }

I changed the first line to the following in the patch I sent you:

    myclassshints.res_name=(char *)malloc(strlen(MyName)+6);

The 'strlen' should be used to return the correct length of the string
instead of 'sizeof'. I hope it will fix the problem.

Regards

Might be my doing, but can't remember exactly. I'll check it.

Well, yes, but I'd rather do that than have the modules duplicated.  If
it breaks we'll have another excuse to take it out :)

I guess we need to decide how "backward compatible" we want to be from
release to release.  I personally don't have any problems requiring
these kinds of simple changes to users' config files, as long as they're
well-documented in the NEWS file.  For example, Emacs makes
non-compatible changes all the time and it's much more widely used than
fvwm :).

Also, the fact that this is the first _official_ fvwm 2.x stable release
should give us a _little_ leeway :).  And, I just don't see that many
people using these modules that it would be a huge burden.

But, I don't care that much either way (except I do care that we install
symlinks and not full copies of files :).

	Sorry about the oversight. I meant to change a default setting, and
overlooked it.

	For a temporary fix, add the line

		GlobalOpts StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition

to your .fvwm2rc. I will check in the default change to CVS later this evening,
so if you grab tomorrow's CVS snapshot, or the next beta tarball, you can
lose the GlobalOpts line.

	Don't blame you...I couldn't either. In fact, I couldn't live without 
StartsOnPage, either.

Both problems are solved. The coredump was caused only
by the debugging code, the other one was indeed a parsing
bug.

All leaks in the last log are fixed. Problably. I can't say
for sure since I do not really know where some of these came
from. I fixed leaks that could have caused any of them, but
maybe there's something else left.

Don't know why it comes up now, but it's been in the code for
long.

Fixed.

Well, thanks. It works now. There was another problem with the example
from the manpage I don't quite understand. There was a 'Style' line
broken into several lines with '\'. That didn't work. Don't know why
since the code clearly copes with that.

Hi all,

I finally got this copyrights stuff straight. The results of
my work are in the COPYING file in the main directory. Please
have a look at this file. It would be an immense help if
one of you native English speakers would proof-read that file.

Now that most problems are solved, could you make a 2.1.2
distribution and upload it, Steve? I still haven't managed
to create a distribution from the sources. At the moment
my problem is that I cannot find automake 1.3b on the web.
The GNU mirror sites only have a package called 1.3. Or is
that the one I need?

I noticed FvwmIconMan is compiled with debug by default.
That should probably be turned off before 2.2. I'd like
to replace the debugging functions with macros too, but
they are called about 400 times in the code (with variable
parameter lists). That should save lots of k's.

What are the needs of the people who are debugging?
Is it ok to just have stderr output or is output to
a file absolutely necessary? That would require more
code, however, I don't think it can be done with macros.

Well, I vote for "as backward compatible as  possible".  I don't think
we can put Emacs users  and fvwm2 users in the  same category.

In  the  case of Tile/Cascade  I  happened  to globally  configure its
menus, so I'm not concerned.  But I think developing the technology of
installing module and even man page links may pay off in the future.

It doesn't pick topshadow and bottomshadow colours with the same
algorithm as Motif.  I don't know what their algorithm is (and it
changed from 1.1 to 1.2) but it does some fairly fancy stuff when the
background colour gets very light or dark.  If you can run a CDE session
in pseudocolor and then run the style manager you can change your
colours interactively and watch it do the top/bottomshadow colours. 
When you go dark there is a point at which the bottomshadow becomes
lighter than the background.  There is also a point at which the
topshadow becomes darker than the background.

Does anyone know if the Xaw3d library does any better than Fvwm.

Cheers,
Tim.

Somewhat like the algorithm I imagine.

I  thought it would make sense  to detect overflows in  the  R G and B
values.  If  R  overflows, distribute it to  B  and G, etc.   When all
done, if there  is still unapplied overflow, it  could  be because you
were trying to brighten white.  So instead darken it.

Good suggestion, haven't looked there yet.

Um, 1.3 would probably work, but you might as well get 1.3b, from:

	ftp.cygnus.com:/pub/tromey

Please go ahead and make the distribution.  I can't get to it until
Sunday.

CDE seems to calculate contrast, not brightness; even depending
on the colour (red is brighter than blue). At home I'll try to
think of a formula that duplicates CDE's behaviour.

No, when I have automake installed it explicitly throws an
error that 1.3b is needed (??)

Just a note about a trap you might fall into.

When  I  first  tried to  do  colorlimiting, I   took the most logical
approach which was to use  the built in X CMS  routines to convert RGB
to HVC.

I  think   you could then   directly  adjust  the  'V' component,  for
brightness (maybe its 'C')?   But anyway,  thats not  the point.   The
point is,  for some colors, these  routines can make upwards of 40,000
iterations (or  some  number    like   that) during some   of    their
calculations.  Clearly not  a   good idea during   colorlimiting,  and
probably not the best idea anywhere in fvwm.

Well, I'm  not completely automake'd yet  either,  but I'm missing the
reason we want a distribution.

No one has cleaned out the BradyMontz directories yet.  I think we
had no argument on that, if no one else wants to do it, I will.

If I don't hear otherwise in 3 hours, I'll proceed.

Except for allowing user overrides, and a override on contrast,
the logic is no better than fvwm.

Steve mentioned something about not trying to delete files in CVS, so
until we understand that better (he has more experience in this matter
than I do, for sure) we should probably not try this.

What you _can_ do, fairly easily I think, is change the dist creation
code so it doesn't put those directories into the dist.  That's what
Steve did with the textures directory.

You should use (or start with, anyway) the DB(()) macro I added a week
or so ago.  It's defined in fvwmlib.h and the code is in libfvwm.a.

It evaluates to empty when DEBUG is not set, and it evaluates to a
special debugging function (in libs/debug.c) when DEBUG is set.  That
function takes printf-style options (that's why you need double-parens)
and automatically prepends the filename and linenumber where the DB call
originates... like this:

  DB(("Window ID: %d", wid));

Note you shouldn't use \n at the end of debug format strings; they're
added for you automatically.

It uses stderr for now, but it would be easy to have it go to a file
instead, and wouldn't require any of the DB() calls to change.

One other thing I wanted to add but forgot to mention in my last email
is a configuration for module name; this would probably require some
kind of DB_INIT() macro that would be called in main() and eval to
nothing without DEBUG, or to a real function call with DEBUG.  It would
take the module name and could optionally create a log file instead of
going to stderr.  Maybe it would set some levels, too.

I just grabbed the latest CVS 11/12 and everything seems okay except for
FvwmButtons during initilization it dumps core.  Unfortunatelly the best I
can get is a stack trace.  I can't seem to figure out what went wrong
from there so here it is.

I think I can show you the problem for 1.
and you can disregard 2.

Here are my Style flags for the pager
Style "Fvwm*"           NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip,
BorderWidth 0 
Style "Fvwm*"           CirculateSkip, CirculateSkipIcon, ClickToFocus 

Then start the pager and do some recaptures, sometimes it doesn't do it
but if you do a few succesive recaptures it will. But it seems to always
grow if it is swallowed by FvwmButtons then both modules will grow.

It's no problem to delete a file from CVS.  It gets moved into the attic
and it can be resurrected later (by checking out an older version of that
file, then cvs adding it, then committing).  You might want to tag the file
with something like 'before_delete' so you know exactly what to check out
if you want it back.

For more info, see http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_7.html.

Everyone using CVS should remember to do cvs update -dP to pick up new
directories and get rid of ones that are deleted from the repository.

I just want not too much stuff between the distributions.
Most memory leaks have been fixed and the parsing changes seem
to be mostly stable now. Remember there are people outside
that are downloading our betas and are already reporting bugs
that have been already fixed.

This is also why we have to carry three version of emacs around at all
times. Makeing 50,000 users do an editor switch-a-roo is evil (yoh Stallman
you listening?). 


For me, the problem is not "simple changes to users' config files", but
rather changes to global defaults across many platforms (1000+ machines).

I am strongly apposed to random (release-by-release) incompatibilities. It
does not scale. This sort of thing should be done very carefully. If well
desigend, this should rarely become a problem.

You should save the incompatibilities for Major number releases. New
features should be acceptable, but an "old" config file should still be able
to run between most revisions.

: Well, I vote for "as backward compatible as  possible".  I don't think
: we can put Emacs users  and fvwm2 users in the  same category.

Absolutly!

Speaking of Motif.... Is anyone on this list involved with "GTK" a.k.a. "The
Gimp Toolkit"?  It seems to have many Motif capabilities, but is not
dependent on lisencing problems which has lead to lots of old version
around.

I see that Netscape will be using "GTK" instead of Motif in their "NGT"
a.k.a. "Next Generation Technology" browser.

	I finally do it :), it is not a definitive version, but it works
(at least for me). Please include it in the may CVS branch as soon as you
can, it should apply cleanly to today or even tomorrow CVS, it is 
important to note that the new MenuStyle broke previous .fvwm2rc, but you 
only need to change a line, and I think it is worthwile. I have updated 
the man page to reflect the changes, so take a look at it before asking 
for help, jeje, sure you will need help.
	I would like to have commit allowed, as I should start working in
debugging the menustyle, and I think Dominik is already very busy to 
receive a patch more than once a day :)
	As it seems that nobody answer my question about a 
fvwm-workers-digest mailing list, I should think you do not want it...
it is a pity, my sysadmin would be much more happy with it.

Of course, there is the argument relating to beta releases, but I don't
think anyone buys that.  There's also the question of whether 2.2.0 will be
a 'major' release.  I think it probably qualifies as much as anything else.

Perhaps we need a version specifier somewhere in the the config file.

I've tracked this down a little bit further and what is happening is
that FvwmPager is mapping and unmapping a little window. FvwmButtons
gets the UnmapNotify event and assumes the window it swallowed has gone
away.  Attached is a small patch that disables this.  It will still
respawn if the window is destroyed.  I've tested it on my set up and it
works for me.  I'm a bit worried though that other apps that get
swallowed might be unmapping themselves and would not get respawned. I'm
not sure if respawning when a swallowed window unmaps is the right
thing, if the window is destroyed (by the app dying) then a respawn will
happen but if apps unmap themselves you would end up with lots.

A more complete fix would be to check that the window that got unmapped
is the directly swallowed one and not a child of the swallowed one.  I'm
not sure what FvwmPager is doing when it creates the moving window but
FvwmButtons gets a ReparentNotify when the moving window is created
followed by MapNotify when it appears, followed by ConfigureNotify's as
it moves. When you let go there is an UnmapNotify (which causes the
respawn).

Any ideas?
Tim.

If I  understand you, I  don't think introducing  a change that breaks
existing config files is an acceptable change.

I suggest you find a way to configure  new behavior that lets existing
config files continue to work.

	I tried this setup, and couldn't make it change size with 25
Recaptures. I think we probably need to see the *FvwmPager config lines.

	Haven't tried it this way.

Try as I might, I can't create the problem.  If you could recompile
the Xpm library with the -g flag, that would probably help a lot.

Never saw  that color  logic in  FvwmButtons  before, (using  the  XPM
library   to allocate  close  colors).  It   looks  too generic  to be
embedded in FvwmButtons.

Alright I found the problem now someone else can explain it to me.  I
noted all the windows that were growing were growing by 5w and 12h. But
then I checked in my fvwm2rc to see which ones were growing.

In my style flags I had 
Style ...
Style ...
Style ...

Style
.
.
.

Then any window after the first blank line was one of the growing windows.
The solution loose the blanks.
Now this is recent because I have had the blanks in there for quite some
time.  So I imagine something in the config parsing is choking on blank
lines.

Well I found my problem so now I know I'm not going crazy so if someone
can't get to it before tomorrow I'll see if I can find the problem
tomorrow

I had FvwmCommand running with the push-away script when I did the
recapture and it was pushing things away from my IconMan which was in a
FvwmButtons which grew 10 pixels or so. and therefore I got the shift

	I think there was some discussion about the FvwmCommand version
1.4 - 1.5 issue a while back, but I missed the outcome. 

	Is there a particular reason that the version we have in the
CVS tree is 1.4? Has anyone looked into including Toshi Isogai's 1.5
version? I'm not sure what his changes were (bug fixes, if I recall),
but I had been using that version for some time with 2.0.46.

	Is Toshi the official maintainer of FvwmCommand, or is the
distribution from his Web site considered unsanctioned?

Hi,

My fault. The example for that 'style' line in FvwmButtons manual is wrong.
Since the FvwmButtons parser can cope with '\', so I asummed that 'Style'
could do the same. But I fount that in the file 'fvwm/parse.c', things are
handled differently (the SKIPSPACE macro skips 'space chars' only). It seems
the 'Style' line has to split into two lines, as:

Style "FvwmButtonsPanel" Title, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
Style "FvwmButtonsPanel" NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Sticky

Better update this in the CVS tree sometime.

Here is the change:
05/11/98 Ver. 1.5

  Fixed bugs in reading and writing FIFOs.

  Will not exit after bad messages.

  Server keeps track of connection to client to avoid sending
  unnecessary messages.

  Handle multiple (long) commands correctly.

  Added lock mechanism to avoid connecting multiple FvwmCommand
  to a FIFO. 

  Added focus-link.pl script and its manpage.

Simply put, 1.5 is definitely better than 1.4.

I just have FvwmCommand in my site because it has been more convenient 
for me.

If you can put 1.5 (1.5.1 to be exact) into CVS tree, it is better all 
around. I will be a bit busy for next 4 weeks or so, and I wouldn't be
able to do it.

	as blah blah blah.

	FVWM does not concern itself with dates, the area where the
	millenium rollover is an issue. The only areas in which
	it makes use of timestamps are:

		Short interval timers blah blah.
		X event timestamps blah

	Disclaimer: This software is provided free of charge, and the
	responsibility for verifying its Y2k compliance rests entirely
	with you, as do all other responsibilites concerning its blah,
	blah, and blah. So don't even *think* of trying to sue anyone
	when your system breaks. Blah.

	Well, I'm currently changing it, just make a warper for the "old" 
MenuStyle and adding a "new" SetMenuStyle, I hope this would be 
acceptable, I should do it before, sorry (when you are thinking in that 
misterious segfault you forget about trivial things :)

I have done a little work on GTK.  But I don't see what the issue is.

You say it has Motif capabilities - this is not true: GTK is not
source or binary compatible with Motif.  Yes, both are widget sets,
but that's as close as they get to being similar.

It really happens.

Is seems that if your .fvwm2rc file contains:

Module FvwmWinList

then the problem manifests itself.

If you have:

Module FvwmWinList
Style "Fvwm*" NoHandles
Style "Fvwm*" BorderWidth 0

As you are probably  aware, lawyers see  this  whole thing as a  great
opportunity.  The last part, (the  Disclaimer) is the only statement I
would even think about making.  (But I am not making it.)

I think these questions are something like the "pull my finger joke",
any attempt to answer the question shows you have been taken.

I don't favor putting anything in the FAQ, or anywhere else that could
be construed   as part of  fvwm.

It just amazes  me that these  people using open source, free software
would have the  nerve to seek some kind   of guarantee.  What do  they
want, their money back?    No, they want   someone to sue.   This last
question seemed  to come from  a  big corporation.  Do you  think they
would be willing to examine the  source code and make a representation
on the mailing list that the software was safe?

I'd give even odds that the answer from Portugal won't be good enough.

Oops, sorry, (I may calm down in about 13 months, 20 days).

We are looking  for  a non-proprietary algorithm   that produces a  3D
shadow effect, from a  base color, thats fast and  small enough  to be
used in a window manager.

We  are trying  to  come  up with something   thats  better than whats
currently in "fvwm/colors.c".   There are cases  now, that the current
algorithm doesn't give a 3D effect at all.

	Bummer! We still seem to have the wandering WinList problem.
FvwmWinList does this even without the NoHandles and BorderWidth 0
settings.

	The original problem Brad was reporting seems to have been cleared
up, but this is different, and peculiar to FvwmWinList. I don't use
FvwmWinList myself, so hadn't been bothered by it, but I seem to recall
discussions about the problem in the past. Has anyone looked into this?

I don't know who the maintainer is but I have been using 1.5 in the
current tree and it works fine the only thing I had to change was adding
config.h and remoing the sun_header stuff.  
It is much cleaner code and more user friendly, before it put pipes in
/tmp where they could get stomped on now it puts them wherever you say to
or in $HOME by default.

But seriouslly.  I am often forced to leave my cushy Ultra 1 and work on a
sparc 2s and sometimes if intel machines( shudder).  And the speed
increase your patch provides is phenomenal.  just the time saved in
redraws makes more than one desktop usable on older machines and even the
newer ones too.

So in short Bob you have my votes.

Now don't go putting words in my mouth, my origional problem is still
there I just changed my rc to get around it.  ( for those not paying
attention the problem was spaces between style lines)

Now as for walking winlists both FvwmIconMan and FvwmWinList like to
stroll around from time to time.  And I'm almost iritated enough by them
to fix it.  If you want to forceto walk, start something like a
GUI builder or Gimp with a bunch of windows 5 to 10.  Then exit the app
and watch that list walk.

The description  sounds great, Brad's comments   are all positive, and
although I've never tried it, I think my home Sparc 1+ is really going
to  like it.  (It  should be a Sparc  5, if I  take some time off from
fvwm2 work.)

You've got my vote.

I think I believe you.

I like this patch.  It seems like a logical extension.

Here are some opinions:

"changemenusytle"  should probably  accept  wildcards.   As  it is  it
accepts multiple file names, so wildcards would seem logical.

"destroymenusytle"   should take   the   same kind   of  arguments  as
"changemenustyle".

When you use the "NEXT" menustyle,  you get popups  but the docs don't
say so.

The Titles aren't centering in the menus correctly.

When you  use "next (solid  red)" that overrides the background color,
making me  wonder  why the command  has a  background color it doesn't
use.  I think I know why this is, but there is a problem there.


You've let a little of your native language creep in, which is OK with
me, but what does "etiqueta_final" mean?

This looks to have negligible impact on footprint and on regular
performance.  If it indeed helps things on slower machines thin it's
probably a very good thing; we need to do whatever possible to cater to the
low end.

Plus, that stacking order inversion on restart has always bugged the crap
out of me.

Well, what I actually said was "please don't delete FvwmCascade and
FvwmTile *yet*".  There's no problem with deleting stuff per se.  I just
didn't want to delete it right THEN in case I got email two hours later
saying "why did you do that???".

Mostly, I didn't want someone to RENAME the directories, because RENAMING
causes massive headaches with CVS.  In short: you can't rename.  You have
to "cvs remove oldname" then "cvs add newname".  The problem is that you
loose the link between the "newname" and the "oldname", so you can't
properly track changes.

Since a couple of days have passed, it's fine by me to delete them.  I'll
do it myself when I get a moment.

Same for fvwmperl and fvwmpython.

Yup... and the four modules mentioned above: cascade, tile, perl, and
python.

(The sample.fvwmrc/BradyMontz directory has been out of the distribution
from just about the beginning)

Well, you tried it just once, and found it alright for kicks,
Now you found out that it's a habit that sticks,
And you're an orgasm addict.

The Style command should never see the backslash. That should have
been done when the config file was read in.

Believe me, it wasn't worth a log message. I just deleted some
private files from the archives directory.

I agree.  The only Y2K statement that we should make is that we don't
have a Y2K statement.

	You are right, I'll add this tonight, I posted this although it 
isn't finished, becasue I want it in the CVS, I don't like to apply 
patches by hand every time I upgrade my CVS tree. That is the reason I 
would like to get a commit account in the CVS.

	Yeah, you are right again, the question is, should I remove the
solid option? or should I extend the menustyle to always use MenuFace 
command?, I mean I think I could make a MWM FVWM or even WIN gradients and
pixmaps background face, in that case you expecify the style to choose 
between diferent popup and selector types, and Solid would be necesary.
I hope to receive more opinions on the subject, mainly because what looks 
nice for me may be look horrible for others...

	In the begining (where no fvwm development were undergo, about a 
year ago) I started the patch as a just-for-me patch, so things like that
keep there until you notice it, jeje, sorry about it, etiquete_final are
the spanish words for "last_label", about the use of a goto I think it is
the cleanest way in that case.

Well, we could put that statement into a file 'Y2K' and be rid
of those wuestions. Perhaps a reminder of the copyrights and
warranties (=none) in the COPYING file would help too.

I didn't look at the new version of the patch, so please
correct me if I'm saying something stupid.

Long term I'd like to change the MenuStyle syntax to a format
similar to Style (comma-separated list of named opptions a la
MenyStyle Foreground black, Background steelblue, mwm, animated).

Comments?

So, if there is an agreement that this patch goes into CVS
we should do it as fast as possible. Will anybody do this
over the weekend.

I want to do some experimenting for the GSFR soon so that
we can have it finished not too far in the future. There
is a proposal how to do it in the TODO file. I think it's
good, but I'd like to use an array of chars rather than ints
(ints may vary in size, chars do not).

	No, it's an array of 1-bit bitfields (these are of a
pretty constant size, too). This is definitely the way to go.

	There are a couple of questions we should kick around,
though. 

	1) Chuck has them grouped into a struct within a union.
Is this really necessary? It doesn't seem so to me.

	2) I feel strongly that we need to divorce window *style*
flags from window *state* flags. The one type has little to do
with the other, and the necessitly of keeping subsets of two
different structures artificially aligned is confusing and
error-prone. (It's also one reason the flags word filled up too
quickly).
	If we enclose the flags within a struct or union, there
need to be two of them: one for style flags, and one for state flags.

	3) Some people like the idea of masking the bitfield
manipulation with a set of macros, e.g.,

	SetSticky(Win)

would do something like

	Win->Sticky = True;

	I kind of like this idea. Greg Badros went a step further
with SCWM, and defined a derived data type called PackedBool, or
something like that, which is a single bit field. We don't need to
go that far, but it wouldn't hurt, either.

In its current state I would only recommend it on a branch.
(I think we are trying to get to a stable release level.)  Given
that the command syntax is in question, the docs aren't ready,
I'm not sure we are talking about a 2.2 feature.

I could be proven wrong.

Well, that is exactly the question. I assumed we want it in 2.2,
so putting it in the main trunk will help finding the bugs
and problems. If we don't want it in 2.2 a branch is the right
place. Personally I vote for taking it into 2.2. What do you
think?

Sounds OK, if that could be done without breaking the current
MenuStyle parsing.

Note that the new syntax is:

SetMenuStyle default foreground background shade active font anim type

type is fvwm, mwm, win, and now "next".

"next" takes a list of args in parens similar to titlestyle/borderstyle
including "solid", "pixmap", "tiledpixmap", various gradients.

I never liked the "type" concept, which is a collection of behaviors,
like "autopopup" and minor variances in appearance.

As German seems to be aware, tying all the new appearance stuff to
"next" is a mistake.

I don't think we have to do anything to MenuStyle, but "SetMenuStyle"
should not attempt to mimick the old "MenuStyle".

I just tried building libxpm with -g and now I can't reproduce it with the
new library.  Perhaps my library was to old I had 4.7 and what I built -g
made 4.11.  With 4.11 Everything seems to work with or without -g

It's easy to duplicate with memcpy as a union with a character
array.

The reason for ONE union is compatibility with the old code.
Otherwise we'd have to scan much more code for possible errors.

I don't like it at all. Marcos used in this way tend to make
you think they do something different than they do, they make
the code less readable, harder to change, may produce lots of
unnecessary code. Just have a look at the SET_MANAGER macro
in modules/FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c and you know what I mean.
There's much code duplication caused by this macro. But do try
to change that. I couldn't. You may object that this is not the
case with simple macros like the on above. But then you don't
need it at all.

I have seen a lot of macros in my life. Macros that contain actual
code almost never help you but can cause many problems (remeber
they fall through the syntax checker in C).

If this is the case it must be documented somewhere (BUGS file?).

I think we've had 2 votes against.

Any Y2K statement in the package could inhibit the ability of some
of us to work on fvwm2.

(Yes, it is that bad.)

Don't let these questions fool you.  They imply that they can't use
fvwm2 unless its certified.

Big deal, they  stop using fvwm   on 12/31/99 11:59:59,  then suddenly
they check it out  on 01/01/00 01:00:00, when its  no longer an issue,
and decide, maybe they can use this thing after all.

My prediction of the hour...  Every system developed from scratch
using only current and future dates, where development starts between
2000 and 2097 will be non-Y2100 compliant.

I notice when I break autoconf, you quietly fix the config files.
Its true, I haven't finished reading about autoconf, or installing it,
but this time, I at least attempted to make sure I didn't break it
when I removed the directories.

I wouldn't mind if you pointed out my mistakes.

If you feel that way, I'm not going to object.

If you want to go that way, I suggest you recommend that German get
update access now.  (Patches will slow this down.)

I don't think we want to include this in a release until the command
syntax is stable, or we will be stuck with the syntax.

No, I meant the statement that there is and will be no statement
just to be rid of all these questions.

Yes, I understood that. I don't care if any company uses fvwm. I can
get a precompiled fvwm at HP and there will be one after 1-1-2000. Noone
guaranteed them anything though.

It's not the stacking order which changes - it reversed the windows in
the order they were created.  This is Debian Bug#10862 (see
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/debian/Bugs/db/10/10862.html)

I posted a patch that fixes this problem over a year ago.  The
original bug report is around 500 days old.

The reason for using ints (or better, something word-sized, eg a long
on most architectures) is that loading a word from memory is often
faster than loading a single byte.  This is especially true for RISCy
CPUs, but these days probably on ix86 as well.

Can autoconf give us a word_t and the number of bits wide it is?

Although some of you might think that I am making (the) decisions
this is history already. In fact fvwm is maintained by the
workers list. Period. I'm one of many (and I'm very happy with
that).

That's up to others (I mentioned that I'd not recommend anyone
or object to anyone). Personally I don't fear that German does
something wrong.

Good point. I'm in no particular hurry with the release,
so there should be enough time to define the syntax before (?)

OK, but the flags are copied only rarely. Typically once for every

I didn't mean  what I said that  way.  I am on  the fence.   If anyone
wanted it in, I wouldn't object.  If anyone  has an opinion against, I
could be convinced.

I think  I'm beyond that too.   If I remember  right, I'm the only one
recommending for update access.  Thats not right  either.  (If you and
I keep this up long enough, someone has to jump in.)

My primary hesitation, is,  I'm not convinced  this is  as easy  as it
seems.

Has anyone else tried these patches?  Any opinions about including this
in the next release?

I'd vote for keeping it out.  I think more attention should be paid to
stability.

Take what we have now, stabilise it, and make a proper release.  Then
do another couple of stable releases to fix the bugs that will crawl
out as a result of the initial release.

Only _then_ should new stuff go in.

Stability isn't glamorous, but it in a window manager it is absolutely
vital.

The problem is there is nothing in the core like it.  This gives you the
ability to talk to fvwm from a script.  Any script, not just perl.  Which
makes life a whole lot easier, for automating tasks.

Granted we get probably want to loose some of the redundant modules but we
don't want to get rid of behaviors.  
So what we have is 
FvwmCommand which is a superset of FvwmPipe
and fvwmperl (X11fvwmperl) and fvwmpython which I haven't used but
probably give us the same functionality but lock you into one scripting
language.

	Well, the stacking order *is* changed by the time the Restart is
finished. And the current code doesn't really reverse the windows in order
of creation, either. They're reversed in the order in which windows have
been focused (but not necessarily raised): that's the way the window chain
is maintained. That's why the order isn't precisely this thing or that
when the Restart is finished.


> I posted a patch that fixes this problem over a year ago.

	Yes, since Fvwm currently has no idea of the windows' stacking order
(it only knows who's on top), your patch had to ask the X server all about
it. However, when (for other purposes) I decided that Fvwm should be keeping
track of the stacking order all along, it occurred to me that a simple 
change to the loop control in Reborder, using the new stacking order chain,
would elimnate this misfeature without any need to query the server.


>  The original bug report is around 500 days old.

	And it's about time we eliminated the bug! I'll be putting the fix
into CVS this weekend.

I'd vote for putting it in.  If it all goes pear shaped then we can
easily go back, that's what the V in CVS is for.  It's a chicken & egg
situation: if it isn't in the CVS tree then it won't get tested.

Lets make that 2 votes for putting it in.  We had said we wanted it for
quite a while now so lets get it in and see what happens.  True it would
be nice if we can use MenuStyle the way it used to be.  But if we need to
break the command it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Users who
upgrade are going to see that their menus are broken immediatelly even if
they aren't whatching the log.

The PackedBool abstraction makes it really easy to choose to use a long
instead of a single bit field, or whatever makes the most sense for a
given platform.  Also note that beginning of Scwm's window.c has some
functions:

ResetCommonFlags
ResetAllFlags
CopyCommonFlags
CopySetCommonFlags
CopyAllFlags
CopySetAllFlags

that are used to accomplish what the previous code did with a bunch of
bit manipulations.  The above functions are written in the most obvious
way-- they are not a performance bottleneck, so it's not worth
sacrificing portability or readability. 

Though some of Scwm's related code has changed or been extended, the
mapping back to the fvwm2 source is probably straightforward enough to
understand w/o too much trouble.

Well, that depends.  There are multiple ways to rename; one of which you
folks can do and several that I can do manually.

The cvs delete;cvs add pair works fine for some things; if you check out an
old version of the repository you get the old file.  You lose the history
on the new file (because to CVS it is a new file) so it helps to commit
with a message that says what it was renamed from.

I can just rename the history file, which retroactively changes the name
for all past versions.

I can copy the history file and nuke the old tags from it, which keeps the
old history with the new file but has its own problems.

An explanation of these is all at
http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_7.html.

I'd like to keep it.  I find it useful and having to get is separately

pain.

The patch, as it now is, doesn't break existing config files.

Lets have some other testers actually install and test this before
we make a decision.

I'd also have to vote for seeing this in. I got it back when it went into
2.0.46. I like the stuff that it lets you do with the menus.

Though I'm also going to agree with the above, that menu syntax needs
fixing.

just my opinions.

I don't think this argument is really germane.  The compiler is free to
implement bitfields however it likes; we will have to trust it to do at
least as good a job as we would do (use the appropriate native type for
fastest service, etc.)

Also, the whole "copying" thing doesn't matter; when you invoke
memcpy() it cannot know what the C type of the memory is.  It will move
the memory around as efficiently as possible.

Ditto for whole-structure copying, if that's what you mean; we must rely
on the compiler to implement that as efficiently as possible regardless
of the types involved.

There was a lot of discussion of this a while back; I suggest interested
parties examine the archives.  I can't remember the reasoning for the
union offhand.

One use would be if you wanted to treat them as integers at some point;
for example, passing them to modules which uses "packets" consisting of
ints.  Or maybe to print them out in blocks, instead of individually.
But we never do either of these.  So I'm not sure.

  dv> It's easy to duplicate with memcpy as a union with a character

As I mentioned before, I don't follow this.  memcpy() takes a void
pointer and a length (sizeof...); it can't know or care _what_ the C
structure of the pointed-to memory is.  It just moves memory.  It will
be no more or less efficient at it whether the bitfields are unioned
with an array of ints, or an array of chars, or anything else.

  dv> The reason for ONE union is compatibility with the old code.
  dv> Otherwise we'd have to scan much more code for possible errors.

Note this is the GSFR.  We've long been planning this as a somewhat
major project (which is why we haven't done it yet).  I think we should
choose the best implementation and go with it, and not rely on
compatibility.  If it takes longer to find the problems associated, so
be it; the important thing is to get it right.  I don't know whether
there are good reasons to split or not, but if there are we should do
it.

Also, note there's no need to scan the code for errors; let the compiler
do it! :).  We're changing the C structure, presumably renaming the
fields, changing their types, etc.  The compiler will faithfully point
out any parts of the code we missed ;).

  dv> I don't like it at all. Marcos used in this way tend to make

I don't have strong feelings, either way, but I think I disagree with
most of this reasoning :).

The macro here clearly sets the sticky attribute for window win.  Now,
the entire point of using a macro is you don't _know_ (or have to know)
how that happens.  As long as that's what it does (and _only_ what it
does), then who cares how much code it hides?  Macros like this are (or
should be) simply faster, more efficient ways to implement data-hiding
that you'd probably do in a function if it weren't so slow.

Second, this code is just as readable to me, if not moreso, than
the win->Sticky = 1 variant... that leads you to wonder: what if I set
it to 2?  Which is obviously illegal.

Third, I don't see how it's harder to change; just the opposite!  If we
were using those macros all along, for example, we could do what Dan
suggests and make two different structures instead of one and change
_NO_ code!  In fact, the GSFR itself might be accomplished in its
entirety without needing to change _any_ C code, just the header file!
The entire point of macros like this is to concentrate details into one
place to allow the details to be changed later, invisibly, without
modifying all the code that uses the feature.

  dv> Just have a look at the SET_MANAGER macro in
  dv> modules/FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c and you know what I mean.

I haven't looked at it, but I know where you're coming from.  I've seen
_MANY_ examples of the C preprocessor used inappropriately.  In
particular, when it's used as a poor-man's inline function it can be
gross.  But, simple things like this don't bother me.

  dv> There's much code duplication caused by this macro. But do try to
  dv> change that. I couldn't. You may object that this is not the case

Not so, for the reasons I've outlined above.  There are many advantages
to implementation-hiding via macros, even if the macros expand to
something just as easly written by hand.

  dv> I have seen a lot of macros in my life. Macros that contain actual
  dv> code almost never help you but can cause many problems (remeber

??  Not so.  Obviously the compiler will be checking syntax on the
post-processed code, not the preprocessed code.

Perhaps you mean other kinds of syntax-checkers, like lint?  I don't
remember whether lint preprocesses first or not, but anyway, I don't
think it's used much anymore since the advent of more robust warning
features in GCC for example.

I would be glad to test.  I'll try anything twice.  But I seem to have
dropped the patch in the bit bucket.  And the archive is telling me
something about only being able to highlight html.  Jason????

This patch is one rev behind.

change:

to:

This line needs to be changes in two locations, the MotionNotify and the
ButtonRelease cases.  My patch is for 2.0.46, so thats why I'm just notifying
this tweak instead of reposting the patch itself.

Humm.... maybe I could even stomach running fvwm2 to my house down my ISDN
line! Currently I just use the Windows Window manager (NT or Win95) which
has really stupid focus policies. I always have things overlapping, even
with two monitors each with their own virtual windows.

I really like performance improvements.

I can't duplicate that, but I do have our new machine running (it's

be working on properly dealing with the web pages over the weekend.

I don't know about fvwmpython, but X11::Fvwm for perl is, AFAIK, a bit
different from FvwmCommand/FvwmPipe... It's advertised to expose the
fvwm modules interface in perl, so it's not that it allows you to emit
Fvwm builtins to be PipeRead'd. It actually doesn't even live in the
modules directory, being entirely resident in your perl lib tree. Ok,
it installs some sample modules written with X11::Fvwm into the
modules tree, but that's it.

The following GPL code from scwm implements a good, fast 3D-shadowing
algorithm. It converts the color from RGB to HLS space, then
multiplies both the luminosity and the saturation by a specified
factor (clipping at the extremes). Then it converts back to RGB and
creates a color. The guts of it, i.e. the `color_mult' routine, looks
a bit longish, but this is only because there are 6-way conditionals
at the begining and end; it actually runs quite fast. The algorithm is
the same as Gtk's, but the implemenation is independent and more
streamlined.

Calling `adjust_pixel_brightness' with a `factor' of 1.3 for hilights
and 0.7 for shadows exactly emulates Gtk's shadowing, which is, IMO
the most visually pleasing shadowing of any widget set; using 1.2 and
0.5 respectively gives something closer to the "classic" fvwm effect
with deeper shadows and more subtle hilights, but still (IMO) smoother
and more attractive than fvwm.

The only color these routines do not usefully handle is black; black
will be returned even for a factor greater than 1.0, when optimally
one would like to see a very dark gray. This could possibly be
addressed by adding a small additive factor when brightening
colors. If anyone adds that feature, please feed it upstream to me.

Feel free to use this code in fvwm2, of course.

OK, looking at the message ID I guess this is inresponse to my posted
hilight generation patch.

You're welcome.

Since fvwm is starting to be actively developed again, I'd like to
bring up an old issue, that of fvwm2/scwm cooperation. I'm going to
assume for now at least that an outright merge is politically
infeasible, but I think given our shared code base and, to some
extent, similar ideals (extensibility on a behavioral and functional
rather than purely visual) level, we should find ways to work
together.

Here's a suggestion for a starting point. Recently, the idea of
splitting the fvwm icons into a separate distribution was brought
up. The icons are already split out of scwm. How about we create a
grand unified distribution of window manager images? Here are some
unsorted thoughts about the idea:

* Most OS distributions that ship with fvwm and other window managers
do not even use the icons that ship with the wm in the wm package. Red
Hat has a "fvwm95-icons" package which is actually a bunch of various
icons and mini-icons from the fvwm95 distribution.

* There's 4 basic categories of broadly interesting window manager
images: icons, mini-icons, textures and tiles. Tiles are currently not
of direct interest to fvwm or scwm, but (a) they might be in the
future and (b) it would be good to try to get other window manager
devel groups on board. Hence, I propose this directory structure for a
source tarball (of hypothetical version x.y):

wmimages-x.y/
wmimages-x.y/icons/
wmimages-x.y/mini-icons/
wmimages-x.y/textures/
wmimages-x.y/tiles/

As a start on populating these, we could take the stuff from fvwm2 and
scwm, merge it, and remove anything redundant or undistributable.

Later we could start incorporating stuff from other window managers (I
think the last fvwm95 might have interesting images that don't ship
with either fvwm or scwm's icon package). Hopefully authors will want
to cooperate with us.

* It should use autoconf and automake for configuration/make/install
stuff.

* Make it install in a rational location (IMO: not in the X11 tree).

* Possibly: Have a configure-time option to gzip xpm's when
installing, since libXpm can read gzipped .xpm files transparently.

* Highly speculative territory: Have a configure-time option to conver X

* Possibly: Install a trivial wmimages-config script so that
wmimages-compliant window managers can find the path where it is
installed at configure time.

* Possibly: set up the package so that it is easy or at least possible
for a window manager distribution to incorporate part or all of the
wmimages distribution, for use when installing on systems where
wmimages is not installed, to spare users the need to download an
extra package.


If people agree this would be a good move, I'll ask the other scwm
people what they think (I don't expect any massive objections) and
then try to work out the administrivia with both groups.

You are right.  I've changed the subject line.

I think your proposal is, for phase 1, have both fvwm and scwm
ship icons, but make sure they are exactly the same icons?

Some of the other Window Managers seem to be pretty particular
about icon sizes.

There  have been proposals about  sorting or naming  icons  by size or
color   use  (8bit vs. 24bit).   I  think  fvwm2 is the   only WM with
colorlimiting where the color segregation is a non-issue.

(I'm just indentifying issues.)

As you are probably aware, fvwm2 doesn't currently install icons,
and we would like to have a way to know where the icons are, and
which icons are installed.  So this sounds like a good way to go.

Perhaps each window manager should have at least one icon it can
probe for so it can tell whats installed.

Sounds good to me.

Speaking of icons, I notice that when I change an icon for an existing
window, the next time I iconify that window, the icon changes.

I think thats new behaviour.

I see  we are  using some kind   of caching logic, and  apparently its
causing my configuration to read the icon image on every use.

The new behaviour doesn't seem to create a performance problem,
but I wonder if the change is intentional.

No, my proposal for phase one is, set up a wmimages package in some
cvs repository, release a version of it, and have subsequent versions
of fvwm and scwm point users to that and/or incorporate it (scwm
already has a separate icon package so this is a non-issue for us -
and I saw mention of possibly splitting all the icons out of fvwm2,
but I don't know how people here feel about that).

Umm, we could encode that in the name or segregate but that seems
distasteful somehow.

At least WindowMaker and Enlightenment also have color limiting.

Yes, but vendors do, and painfully enough, often in fvwm's compiled-in
path, which is IMO wrong for things not part of the X11 distribution.

I believe the bullet points in my previous message outline a better
technical solution for finding out: (a) whether the wmimages package
is installed; and if so (b) under what path. My proposal for what
windowmanagers should do with this info is to add an appropriate
autoconf test for wmimages and munge their compiled-in image path to
be able to find the installed images.

Cool. Any other opinions?

	I seem to have misplaced a bit of code or something when I added
the StackingOrder changes. The symptom is that the Pager appears to
be broken.

	When you move from one page to another, some of the little
window icons tend to disappear from the Pager. It would seem most likely
that I misplaced a line or so in the virtual.c modifications, causing
the BroadcastPacket not to happen properly for every window, so the 
Pager doesn't know where all the windows are.

	I'll get it fixed as soon as I have a chance to figure it out.
If anyone spots something obvious, please let me know.

	Well, first of all, I must said that the newmenus stuff is very
stable here, I've running it for almost a year, and have no problems, but
remember, I said *here*. So I think it is a good idea to put it in the main
branch, one of the benefits of the patch is that if you want to disable you
may use MenuStyle, using that almost no code of the new patch is used 
(only the parser), and putting it there is the only way to be sure people 
test it, I think (as Dan already said) is not a new feature but a missing 
one.
	About icons and fvwm2rc's well, I have a *BIG* collection of 
icons and a really nice fvwmrc (~50K), but I think I will wait a bit, then 
I'll put all of them in a web or ftp so you could download and test it.
	Other important thing is why x11amp doesn't get managed correctly
under fvwm2?, it works well under kwm, windowmaker, afterstep and icewm, it
is a problem in x11amp or in fvwm2?
	
	And finally but not the less important, I really need a 
fvwm-workers-digest, I'm receiving more than 200 mails a day (about 50 
from the list) I think it would be a nice option for people like me, that
don't have a permanent connection and have to read the mail in a "burst 
mode", if your answer is no I should be thinking on an script to do it 
myself, but I'm too lazy... please :)

	I have temporarily backed out the StackingOrder changes to
virtual.c, while I try to puzzle out just what broke.

	This eliminates the paging/desk-switching part for the
moment (sorry, Brad!); the stacking order correction on Restart is
still intact.

That sounds like an excellent idea to me.

I like this idea.  Don't some shared libs (GNOME libs?) install with a
similar file?

All that I can recall is that you add files to, say, docs, and don't
update the makefiles.  It's just a matter of adding the filename to
Makefile.am, and then do a rebuild.  The makefiles have rules in them to
rebuild Makefile.in and Makefile, if necessary.

I haven't tried it.  My opinion is based solely on this comment from the
author: 

>>> You are right, I'll add this tonight, I posted this although it

I worry about code produced with this attitude.

Further, there is no reason for applying patches by hand on every "cvs
update".  After the first implantation of automake, I spent a week
cleaning up old code.  I touched *nearly every file* in my local copy of
the sources, while others were busy committing things to the repository. 
I did very frequent updates to keep in synch with the sources, and had no
more than two or three trivial conflicts in all that! 

Nobody expects that the cvs sources are reliable or even that the sources
will compile.  I *do*, however, expect that developers take reasonable
steps to check in quality code.  Committing something because they "don't
like to apply patches by hand" after cvs update is not reasonable.  IMHO.

I'm losing it fast...

Oh, wait, fvwm's memory.  Right.

I checked in some fixes to minor nits in FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan.  I
don't have an IconMan config so its parser didn't get any workout, and
my FvwmButtons, while not trivial, ain't all that either.

I also found some memory leaks still in fvwm2 (very latest stuff, as of
about 4pm today) and in FvwmButtons.  I increased the traceback size
Purify records; hopefully that will give folks enough info to track
these puppies down.  Logs to follow.

One _darn_ annoying thing was the FvwmIconMan _spewed_ garbage to my
console left and right.  This should absolutely be turned off before we
give this code to anyone else... and the sooner the better.  Right now
it's bounded with "#if 1"; that should be "#ifdef DEBUG" or something I
think.

Pretty good; only ~600 bytes leaked out of 90k allocated.  I wouldn't
lose lots of sleep over this but it would be nice to be "clean".

A few leaks.  Note that in another debugging session I got a number of
errors reading memory after it'd already been freed!  Unfortunately I
lost the log and couldn't reproduce (although I didn't try too hard).
Not good, though.

Someone else is free to digestify the mail, but I don't see it happening
here in the foreseeable future; perhaps after I've finished writing the
digest code for Majordomo2.  If you don't have a permanent connection,
though, you have even less reason to want a digest; the total size of mail
to download is the same and when you pull your mail from the server you get
all of the conversation up to that point instead of having to wait for the
server to generate a digest.

Hi!

I have been trying to the get the sources from the cvs-server, but my
dialup-connection provided by the university is unfortunately a little
bit limited so that I can not connect directly outside the university
(only http allowed outside).  Of course I can connect anywhere from
machines of the university, but I would like to access the cvs-server
from my home machine.

I already tried to use ssh to forward the port 2401 of one university
machine to cvs.hpc.uh.edu:2401 and then use that machine as
cvs-server, but it did not seem to work.  Is :pserver: the only
allowed method?  Any ideas how I could access the server?

	Sorry if you undertand it in that way, I meaned (?) that I want it in 
the CVS because if we don't put it there I would have to apply patches by 
hand, The reason I would like a commit account it that I think that post 
here a patch everyday so people could test it would be a bad attitude :), 
but if you think that way is better, no problem...

	Uhmm, newmenus are reliable, and anyway, what do you think CVS 
was designed for?, Concurrent means more than one person at the same 
time, if Dominic is going to do all the work (I said it to you Dominic, 
you will regret your decission :), we wouldn't need a CVS server, with a 
ftp site it will be more than enough.

	Anyway if you think I would better keep my hands out of the CVS 
well, I'll post patches here, but I repeat, that is contrary to the idea 
of a CVS server.

PS: After rereading the email it seems to me that it may seem as if I 
were angry, and I'm not, I'm very happy with the new development scheme 
fvwm2 has go into, so don't misunderstand me please.

I just tried and was able to do this.  My home machine is A, the campus
machine is B and the CVS server is C.  This seems to work:

[tibbs@A ~]$ ssh -R 2401:C:2401 B

Then I can talk CVS protocol to port 2401 on B and it gets forwarded to C.
I don't have the restrictions you do, though, so I don't know if there is
something else in your config that could be stopping this from working.

TH> Is :pserver: the only allowed method?

What other access methods are there?  RSH?  Direct NFS export?  Not bloody
likely.

You could do a checkout to your University account and then use rsync to
get it home, if you have the space.  That would be the most efficient
two-step process.  Or you could wait a couple of days until I get anonymous
rsync running on the new machine and try again to forward that.

	I've disabled the StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition -
StartsOnPageHonorsUSPosition GlobalOpts pair.

	It was always my intent to remove this option, but the patch
had been sitting in limbo for so long that I'd forgotten all about it.
The reasoning behind this is presented on the StartsOnPage Web page at

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/StartsOnPage.html

where there's a statement that I had no intention of fixing the
"StartsOnPageHonorsUSPosition breaks StartsOnDesk" bug, since the
bug would go away when I removed the option. Well, the bug's gone
away.

This is not correct.

If you have changes in your copy of the repository, you can certainly
track other's changes to the repository without "reapplying the patches by
hand every time".  That's what cvs update is for.

Precisely.  You can keep abreast with others commits while you work on
yours.  You don't need to commit "unfinished" code (your word) in order
to get it in there first.

properly.  I am using the word "you" in a generic sense in what follows,
as it is not aimed at anyone in particular.

It's not that I think German (or anyone) is a particularly bad coder per
se.  I'm not at all opposed to further widening commit access to the
repository. 

However, it seems that the power and purpose of cvs is often not well
understood.  Its purpose is NOT to publish code as fast as you can, and
ask everyone to do your alpha testing for you.  It is not a place to dump
untested code.

It IS a way for multiple developers to work concurrently and
cooperatively.  Cooperation requires that we all respect one another.  We
should keep in mind that others' time is as precious to them as your time
is to you.  I should not make a change to the code without testing it, and
assume others will test it for me.  If it is important enough to me, I
will spend the time to test it.  I require that the other developers show
the same respect for me and my time.

I should not make a change and fail to document it.  This attitude assumes
that the few minutes of time it takes to make a ChangeLog entry is more
valuable than all the other users' and developers' time spent in tracking
down an obscure bug, perhaps many months in the future. 

I know that terms like "test", "unfinished", and the like are nebulous
(and inflammatory!) in the context of software development.  We could
spend a lot of time trying to define them, but I am not interested in that
discussion.  I think the group can come to informal concensus.  I am NOT,
certainly, trying to argue that one should sit on their changes until they
have been in production use for six months!  I fully expect bugs and
alpha-quality code in the CVS tree. 

But there has to be some minimum standards for putting changes back into
the public repository.  I think the community expects things like: useful
entries in the NEWS and ChangeLog files, updating the manpages when you
change the corresponding code, and that the configure and build process
still works.  Nobody is asking that perfection be achieved always (I have
forgotten stuff on my own list at times) but pefection is what we should
strive for. 

With daily changes to the repository, fvwm is certainly a moving target. 
If the sources were only published in a complete tarball, it would be very
frustrating to try to work on them.  One would indeed be obliged to keep
re-patching the code by hand. 

But this is not the case!  We are using CVS, which keeps a *history* of
the changes made.  This allows you to merge others' changes into your copy
of the code semiautomatically.  In practice, the merging is *very* good. 
You can track many many repository changes while you work on your copy of
the code before the merge algorithm starts breaking.  The main exception
to this rule, ironically, seems to be with the ChangeLog files. 

The lesson here is that if you understand how cvs works, you should not
feel pressure from other's commits to publish your changes prematurely. 
That is how I interpreted German's statement.

Yeah, I was thinking of ${pkgdatadir}, i.e. ${datadir}/wmimages, but
either option makes sense.

Yeah, the only drawback is possible user confusion. Do you think this
mode should be the default if gzip is found on the system?

Several packages install with such a script, most notable guile, glib,
gtk+ and gnome-libs. It takes sooooo much of the pain out of finding
packages you depend on.

	By other hand I would never put no tested code in the CVS, when I 
say testing I mean test it in the more configurations available, I know 
that although my .fvwm2rc is really large there are people with very

Steve,

  Some of that was so well phrased, perhaps there is a place for it
in our docs/cvs.html file?

There's no hurry.

Here are some thoughts on MenuStyle:

How about extending the existing "MenuStyle" as follows:

MenuStyle "*" ForeGround <color>, BackGround <color>, Pixmap <pixmap>, ...

Leave the existing parsing alone, use the new parsing, only when the
first arg is a double quoted string.

The double quoted string would be used to wildcard match the menu name.

This uses the existing "Style" command as a model.

Hmm... it seems that this solution does not work in my case, because
the server opens other ports too.  When I make checkout from campus
machine, suspend the process and run netstat there are the following
two connections:

tcp        0      0  jaspis.auth            Sina.HPC.UH.EDU.63468  TIME_WAIT
tcp    33580      0  jaspis.2156            Sina.HPC.UH.EDU.writes ESTABLISHED

So this connection does not get through when I run the checkout on my
home machine. :(

Yep.  I must try this.

Hmm... sounds good.  Could you mail me, when this is possible?  And
thanks for your advice so far.

	Well, it could be done this way, but I think there are many 
posibilities, I would like to here from more people before changing it,
the reason because I defined the ChangeMenuStyle was to be able to change 
menu style at runtime without having to redefine the complete style (I 
know we could have something like UseStyle, but this should imply 
more work :). Maybe I start it again, this time using a "Style"ish 
approach, it would be nice if you could  specify everything about 
menu's look in a similar way you specify apps' style.

	More opinions on it are welcome...

afs read-only of the repository?  With the advent of arla, the free afs

Heh.  Just a thought.

Could the 'powers that be' that control the configure sources consider
how to cause the following effect in some mannerism or another?

I know it's not optimal, some better way should be used to generate
dependencies, or perhaps having a single file like the Imakefiles used
to.

The reason I make this request is that for non gmake based systems,
the one line in almost every makefile that prevents another make
binary from working is the one I've commented out below.

I see it's not in Makefile.am so I can only conclude something in
gnu's automake script causes the '-include $(DEP_FILES)' line to
be put in there.

Thanks,

I have made a patch which provides a "Direction" function for finding
the closest window in a given direction and executing a function on
it.  I use it only for moving focus as I like mouseless operations,
but maybe it is better to keep the function general.

At the moment I have copied the flag test from the "Circulate"
function, so that I can use "!Sticky" and other useful flags, but of
course, having the same code in two different places is not the
correct solution.  Would it be a good idea if i tried to write a
general flag test function, which could be then used from "Circulate"
and "Direction"?  Or would it better to implement "Direction" features
inside the "Circulate" function?

Or is anyone interested in such feature at all? :)
I find it very handy for moving from window to another.

By all means, think before coding.

The    current "Style" command effectively    "merges"  styles into  a
composite.  It currently lacks a way to "destroy"  a style except that
every subsequent command   argument overrides the    one before.  (Old
style commands are never freed.)

I thought with 'MenuStyle "*"'  it might be a good  idea to merge  the
styles and move them to the end of the list, rather than build an ever
growing    linklist.   With   this scheme  you    might    not need  a
ChangeMenuStyle, but DestroyMenuStyle would still apply.

It might get a little tricky, and I know what you  are really after is
colorful menus, not configuration elegance, but I think its worthwhile
to spend some time on this.

Heres an opinion.

The  various UNIX  vendors   implementations of  "make"  are  horribly
incompatible.  If   you want to be portable,    vendor makes should be
avoided like the plague.  If you  need portability, and attempt to use
vendor makes, you  will be restricted to a  very small subset of  make
functionality.

"gnumake"  is the solution.  You may  not be able  to install it using
the executable name "make"  as it won't always  work as a  superset to
the vendors make, but its very worthwhile installing it and using it.

	Sorry, but I don't understand you, what do you mean with "to 
merge the styles and move them to the end of the list", 
^^^^^
I think it can be code in an easier way if we simply store the match 
string ("*" in you example) and then search the list backward for the
first matching style whenever a menu is popped, to enable redefinition we
just replace a style if the matching string is the same. I don't know
if it is what you were saying, but I think it is easier than "merging"???

More appositely, I believe only developer Makefiles generated by
automake require GNU make, not the Makefiles generated by `make
dist'. Personally, I think it is eminently reasonable to require
developers to have gmake if the distribution itself works with
least-common-denominator vendor `make'.

Sorry, once you've tried to modify the Style logic in fvwm2, this might
make more sense.

If you issue:

Style "*" icon x, Forecolor color
Style "*" icontitle, notitle

fvwm2 stores both commands.

When  it wants to create a  window, it creates  an empty "style area".
It  then goes thru  all the styles that match  the window and for each
one that matches  the style, it MERGES  the attributes  into the style
area.

For the menustyle command, similar logic might be appropriate.

MenuStyle "*" Foreground white, Background gray, AutoPop
MenuStyle "System*" Background blue

	But in this way you need more memory, don't you?, because usally you
have less styles than menus, I know that with apps is different, you may 
have many styles defined but no window really active, but with menus you 
usually would have less than ten styles, but you can have many menus. The 
question is that if we want to follow the "fvwm2 style" we need to do it 
as you suggest, although I think it is not such a big change, and as I 
see it, fvwm2 is good because it is small, efficient and very configurable,
not because it has a consistent configuration language (take a look at 
scwm :). 
	I would even say that other style commands should work in a 
similar way, that is with a linked list of styles, and windows or other 
things get a pointer to that style, in this way you could save some 
memory, and I think that assigning a pointer is faster than parsing a 
string, that could be very long. I know this is a drastic change, and 
many people wont' agree with me, but thinking in 2.3 (or even 2.5)...
	We could just postpone newmenus (I'm using them, but if somebody 
feels  not too good about it, no problemo :) until we decide this kind of 
things, well, but we are in a mailing list... what do other people think 
about it??, it seems than only Dan and me are interested in newmenus 
(although it is not so strange, who else should like that crappy patch? ;)

	That's all for now...

PS: Fear my next eamil, it would be even longer and even worse redacted XD

well, i like the new menus. The looks anyways, I'll agree though that I
think the config stuff needs work.  Though I've not had time to put any
real thought into it. (end of quarter coming up and I've too many final
projects)

The reason I requested the above is because earlier versions of fvwm
were incorporated into the tree in OpenBSD under the X11 subdir.  Now
what does this matter?  OpenBSD developers need to rely on their own
tools.  If I cannot build fvwm with gmake I will be faced with two
alternatives:

  1) write what we call 'Makefile.bsd-wrapper' which will be used
     instead of the regular makefile.  aka re-implement the makefile
     just so it doesn't require gmake
  2) convince someone that this one little fix is worth it.

X makefiles WERE compatible with everyone's make programs.  I don't
see why we have to loose bigtime just because configure is used.

I am confused.  I, as a developer, on my OpenBSD machine, must use
gmake, but then when someone else wants to use it, magically, my 'native'
make program will work?

I thought development involved testing and verification that the entire
build process worked, including the makefiles.

How can we build development versions with one set of makefiles and
then distribute yet another?

I'm utterly confused.  Please elaborate.

Yes.  That's the magic of automake.
 
Both "developer" and "installer" makefiles are built from the same
Makefile.am input files.  The major difference is that the latter include
dependency information *in the makefile*, while the former *generate* said
dependency info.  Hence, the distributed makefiles don't need any of the
"include" lines.

Sure.  Automake very helpfully includes a "make distcheck" rule for this
very purpose!

Hm.  Is there a load-time penalty involved with gzip?  How bad is it?  I
would assume it isn't bad, since icons will be read only rarely.  If that
is the case, then I say: yes, make it default.

Is this script associated with some standard tool (libtool?) or are they
all ad-hoc scripts?

Hmm, I am now clear on how things work.  But this is called asking to shoot
ones self in foot.  How many people know about the obscure 'make distcheck'
and how many are going to try it just for kicks and grins?

I bet we have someone who tests something as a developer makefile, then
it breaks in the final makefile.  I don't understand the philosophy of
building/developming with one set of makefiles and having others 'the people
who need to be given a good impression' with untested Makefiles.  Sounds
like an accident waiting to happen.  But I guess it is something that
is supported.  Oh well.  Just seemed strange to me.

So now I have to:
cd fvwm
cvs update -PAd
gmake dist
cd ..
tar xvzf fvwm/fvwm-2.1.x.tar.gz
cd fvwm-2.1.x
./configure .........
make


Every single time I want to build the latest version with my own make
program?  Whee.

The magic didn't work.

I did the 'gmake dist' which created fvwm-2.1.2.tar.gz.
I extracted fvwm-2.1.2.tar.gz and cd'ed into fvwm-2.1.2
I ran './configure --prefix=/sw/pkgs/fvwm' and then I typed 'make' and
I got this:

todd@LightHouse:~/src/fvwm/f/fvwm-2.1.2(45)$ make
make  all-recursive
Making all in libs
"Makefile", line 224: Need an operator
Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue
*** Error code 1

Stop.
*** Error code 1

Stop.
todd@LightHouse:~/src/fvwm/f/fvwm-2.1.2(46)$

Same error I got before.  Am I missing something or does it not work still?

Well, "small and efficient" is good.  But "consistent configuration" is
also good.  Is it really strictly one or the other?  Let's have both!

It should add no more extra time than gzip takes to decompress said
file, in fact, since gzip does streaming decompression it is partly
paralelizable. libXpm is so slow at loading .xpm files that its

They are all ad-hoc but follow relatively standard
conventions. Perhaps there should be a meta-tool for generating them,
but that's beyond the scope of this post :-)

How many people will build an official FVWM release dist?  Only one (per
release).  So this isn't a serious problem.

This is _extremely_ unlikely, since developers don't write makefiles,
they write (or more likely, add to existing) Makefile.am's, which are
fairly trivial.

Yes, it can break, but that's why the developer's tree is not gauranteed
to work.  Before it goes out someone with the appropriate knowledge will
test it and find the problem.  At least, that's just as likely as if
someone were writing makefiles from scratch.

  ttf> I don't understand the philosophy of building/developming with

The makefiles are _almost_ exactly the same; the differences are
essentially (a) the include line is replaced with the contents of the .d
files, and (b) the compilation lines don't have the special commands to
build the .d files.  Certainly there are no differences in the parts of
the makefiles that developers write.

Anyway, remember that all these makefiles are auto-generated from
Makefile.am so typically there's very little "user-error" that can
occur.

  ttf> So now I have to:
  ttf> cd fvwm
  ttf> cvs update -PAd
  ttf> gmake dist
  ttf> cd ..
  ttf> tar xvzf fvwm/fvwm-2.1.x.tar.gz
  ttf> cd fvwm-2.1.x
  ttf> ./configure .........
  ttf> make

  ttf> Every single time I want to build the latest version with my own make

You misunderstand the environment.

The CVS tree and the build it uses is meant for _developers_ who are
_developing_ fvwm.  If you decide you would like to be a developer and
keep up with all the latest changes as they're checked in, then yes,
it's a requirement that you have available all the required tools (those
being at least GNU make, and maybe GCC too).  In this case, you would
typically never (or hardly ever) build a dist yourself; you just compile
the source tree as-is because you have the tools.

If you don't want to do that, you can get the packaged tar files as
they're made available, both the release and beta versions.  These
require no special tools to build; any make and compiler will do.

These are the choices, and you need to decide what category you're in.
The idea is that if you're willing to go to all the hassle of keeping
up-to-date with the latest sources, etc. then using GNU make is the
least of your hassles :)

Essentially, no one should be handing out random selections of source as
a "distribution" using make dist.  There's nothing illegal about it, of
course, but it seems quite dangerous and I'm not sure we should spend a
lot of effort making it easy :)

Excellent!

I also started thinking about AUTHORS yesterday.  I thought it would be
good of us to "prime the pump" by putting in all the *past* contributors,
as well as present.

I put in the names I know, then I started going through files looking for
other names.  I have done one pass through ChangeLog, FAQ, NEWS, and
README.  I also went through the sources and manpages under modules.  I
have yet to look in the directories fvwm and libs. 

Perhaps it is appropriate to pause now and think about the criteria for
inclusion.  I favour being very inclusive.  I was including anyone who is: 

  * listed as an author in the manpage, or a source file
  * noted as supplying a "patch" or "fix"

There were some notes (especially in the old ChangeLog entries) that
thanked people for bug reports, or for nothing in particular.  I didn't
include them.  Sometimes packages have a file named THANKS for this kind
of thing.  Should we?

What shall we do about modules?  I included all authors of those in the
"modules" directory.  I have mixed feelings about the "extra" modules.  In
principle, modules should be considered independent of fvwm.  However, it
seems mean-spirited to not include those traditionally distributed with
fvwm, even if not "core" modules.  On the other hand, if all the "extra" 
module authors are included, need we also acknowledge authors of other
modules available elsewhere on the net? 

More important than the above questions, I'm not sure of what exactly is
the purpose of the AUTHORS file.  I had assumed it would be a simple list
of names.  On the other hand, as Dan points out, GNU has some definite
ideas about what should go in here.  Their standards document
(maintain.texi) states: 

---------------------------- GNU maintain.texi ---------------------------
   *Keep records of which portions were written by whom.*

   These records don't need to be as detailed as a change log.  They
don't need to distinguish work done at different times, only different
people.

   They should say which files or functions were written by each person,
and which files or functions were revised by each person.  They don't
need to say what the purpose of the change was.  The Register of
Copyrights doesn't care what the program does.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I came up with 66 names (see attached file).  Getting detailed information
like the above seems like a lot of work!  Is it useful?  Necessary from a
legalistic point of view?

I just tried the same thing, using Sun make, and it worked fine for me.
Line 224 in libs/Makefile containts some dependency lines.  There is no
"include xxx" or "-include xxx" in the makefile anywhere.

If this did not work for you, we'll need to debug it.  I've never had
this not work for me.

What version of automake do you have installed?

Hm.  One possible problem is that you _don't_ have automake installed.
The developer's tree doesn't require automake but it _is_ required in
order to build a distribution.  If you don't have automake, a special
script called "missing" is run instead; this allows things to work (it
will touch the files automake would have update, so the make succeeds)
but it obviously doesn't do all the things automake would do... such as
create new makefiles which don't use the "include" feature.

For modules on the net, if its not  in the fvwm2 distribution, I don't
think "author" applies.

Thanks for getting a copy.   I think it would make  a nice footnote in
the authors file.  No, wait, it is a footnote in the authors file.

The more names in the  author file, the better.   Thanks for doing the
work.

	I just sync-ed up with CVS, and there seems to be a file missing
from fvwm/libs - did you forget to do a cvs add for ColorUtils.c before
committing your changes?

We rewrite the code in more than one step. This makes life a lot easier.

It 'clearly sets the sticky attribute for window win' until there is
a problem that you can easily solve by adding another line to the macro.
Then you'll have this line 9 times out of ten in places where it isn't
needed.

With bitfields it won't even compile.

I knew that reasoning would come up. If we want to do the GSFR by
changing macros, we have clearly screwed up the design before. This
way macros are an excuse for writing dirty code. There's plenty of
this kind already (did you ever look at style.c?) and I think we can't
we can't afford misdesign any more.

The macros I have seen (simple value/flag definitions excluded) are
used in an abusive way about 90% of the time. And we don't even have
*one* authority on which style of code/patches makes it into CVS.

Neither do they bother me. My fear is that 'simple things' will become
more complex over time up to the point where any attempt to rewrite
them may fail (*do* look at SET_MANAGER).

How about type checking? The compiler won't notice you use chars where
integers are expected.

Oops. Lint (at least some of the enhanced lints) is much better than
any compiler can be.

The I have the ultimate horror for you ;-)

I've written a configuration that tests nearly all options of all
commands (see attachment, descriptions in README file). I wanted
to put it in the archive directory but our socks servers are
unreachable for the moment, so this has to wait.

I'd like to have it in now. I tested it a few weeks ago (not very
thoroughly) and it worked ok. On the weekdend I got my menu titles
screwed up, but that mighy be caused of some other change I made.

I think we all agree that we want it in the long run. If we force
German to update his patch once and again it will slowly loose
stability while other code is being changed.

Furthermore there are some evil memory leaks in the MenuStyle
stuff and I won't bother to fix them until the patch is in.
Same with the syntax rewrite. Doesn't make sense to do this and
the redo it in the patch.

Bye

Dominik

fvwm2 coredumps if a function or menu destroys itself
(via DestryMenu or DestroyFunc). Any idead how to avoid
this?

  AddToFunc suicide
   + "I" DestroyFunc suicide

I was thinking about a counter that is increased every time
that a function is called and decreased if the function ends.
Only functions/menus with zero count can be destroyed.

Another problem are recursive functions.

  AddToFunc recurse
   + "I" Function recurse

This coredumps too after a while.

The whole chain of functions could be aborted if the counter
reaches a recursion depth of x. Or better have a global counter
for recursion depth (i.e. passed to subfunctions).

Exactly what I'm thinking of.

Why so complicated? MenyStyle doesn't work properly if not at least five
arguments are provided, so just count the words up to the first comma:

  >= 5 ==> old syntax
  <  5 ==> new syntax

Nothing strange done with quotes. Note that although the quotes are
always used in the examples for 'Style' they are not needed.

Yes, I'm opposed to removing FvwmCommand too. We'll loose some nice
functionality (great for testing and debugging and the only way to do
some very advanced configuration without shell scripts).

Let's have a look at the patch. Go ahead and post it.

Here's a wrapup of the ongoing discussion about German's
newmenu patch (as i see it):

People who want it in CVS now:

  German (of course)
  Mike
  Dominik

Opposed to putting it in:

  Austin (wants a stable release quickly)

More or less neutral:

  Dan (does not want it in the main trunk but would accept both decisions)
  Steve (opposed to putting in untested code).


So I'd like to put it in tonight. I think Steve's points are valid,
but I'd still do it because the patch has been around for long, German
thinks it's very stable and (most important) there is little hope that
stability will improve if it is in a branch (Steve himself argued in the
past that branches would create the false hope of code being tested).

Another reason is that we don't want to mingle the newmenus patch
with the syntax rewrite.

BTW, pleas, nobody rewrites the MenyStyle syntax right now. Let's
discuss that to the end first.

Bye

Dominik

Whatever the details will be in the end, there seems to be
a consensus that the flags will be implemented with bit fields.
A logical first step would be to code this in a single struct,
not a union until the benefit of the union is proven.

I don't think so. At least there is no documentation on that.
When has this changed? Maybe it's related to some memory leak
fix.

Sure did, and the source code is at home.

This might take a few minutes to recreate...

Well, if no one on the list made a  purpose change, I'll look into it.
Perhaps its something in  my environment.  I recently  wrote something
that generates some menus with over 1000 mini-icons (all the same).
Could be I'm forcing things out of the cache.

Hey, wait a minute, I put those macros in style.c!

Well, you may have a point.  I put those macros in as a first step to
boiling the code down a little.  It sorely needs to be table driven.

I was just trying to make the actual structure of the parsing a little
clearer.

Take a look at the same code without the macros, and I think you will
appreciate the macros a little more.


Don't get  me  wrong, I'm not  getting involved  in  the GSFR  with or
without macros controversy.

I want to be clear.  I think I've already said it.  I like this patch.
Since fvwm can already paint pixmaps and gradients all over the place,
adding the same capability to  menus seems logical.  (Rob Nation might
not  have agreed, I seem  to recall some  specific comment about gaudy
menus, but  we've gone way beyond  that.)   I honestly don't  see much
bloat in this patch anyway.

The command parsing is a minor part of the patch.  I  know I have been
proposing progressively more and more complex syntaxes for the command
syntax.  Take my proposals for what they are, "proposals".

Exactly what benefit does gzip'ing the icons give us?

On most Unix systems, the granularity of the file system usually means
that a 3.5K file and a 1-byte file take up the same amount of disk
space.  Since most XPM's are usually pretty small, especially for things
like icons, I don't see how adding the complexity of gzip'ing the icons
will provide any benefit.

If you insist on providing this capability, please give the user the
option to turn it off, or (even better) to only enable it with a
configuration option:

	./configure --with-gzip		# my preference
	./configure --without-gzip	# an alternative

To me too.

Afterstep does this:

  AfterStep-1.5pre6/afterstep/desktop/icons:
  drwxrwxr-x   2 dane      2048 Jul  1 15:19 16bpp
  drwxrwxr-x   2 dane      2048 Jul  1 15:20 8bpp
  drwxrwxr-x   2 dane      1024 Jul  4 11:25 common

(I don't like it.  Just starting a list.)

It would seem if we don't organize this wmicons package this way,
Afterstep would be a non-participant.

You're right,  I  did see the code  in  Enlightenment, since it wasn't

Sounds good, actually, having autoconf look for the package is the kind
of probe I was thinking of.

I have too many opinions for my own good.  I bet you mean opinions on
the icon package subject only...

1. Thanks Bob, I love my new stackingorder patch, now I can go back to
using two desks again.

2. The new color stuff for shadowing, maybe its just me but I'm not sure I
like the colors it comes up with.  Previously I had rather definite lines
in my modules and now they all seem a little gray and blurry, gives me the
feeling I've run out of colors and need to restart with less running.
Unfortunatelly that doesn't help.

Now I'm sure I'll get used to it in a day or two.  But was wondering if
others had some thoughts.

3. Subject lines.  Now don't get me wrong discussio on topics is good, but
we seem to be getting in the habbit of carrying on several conversations
at once under one subject heading.  Which makes it a little difficult to
catch up on Monday morning when 3/4 of the messages fall under the same
subject.  So for example if you wanted to make comments on both points 2
and 3 of this message try to make the subject line suggest the contents.

Just some thoughts,
Brad

Hmm, in my eyes it's easier to understand without the macros.
The operation is trivial but the macro forces me to look somewhere
else.

Please let me   know the background   color you are seeing this  with.
Most of my tests  showed improvement in the 3D  effect, but of  course
this is  partly  a perception issue,  which  can vary from   person to
person.

There  are factors being  applied to  the  calculation of brighter and
darker colors, perhaps some tuning is in order.

The whole world is not Linux, unfortunately.  People running on SunOS
4.1.3, as an example which I have at home have larger block sizes
thanks to the Berkeley Fast File System.

Some more reasons:

1.  Some programs cannot figure out what sort of file www.xpm.gz is.  (I
    know this is true for xpaint, whether or not the gzip'ed file is
    named www.xpm.gz or www.xpm, although it seems that xv gets it
    right.  Anybody know about GIMP?)

2.  Appending .gz to filenames makes directory listings longer.  This is
    already a problem with all those mini icons with "mini-" prepended
    to their name.  If the intention is to gzip the icons and leave the
    file extension intact, this becomes a non-issue.

3.  The `file' command can no longer discern what kind of file it is:

	$ file www.xpm.gz 
	www.xpm.gz:     gzip compressed data - deflate method , original file
	                name , last modified: Thu Oct 29 12:31:09 1998 os: Unix

    (I thought this was a compressed X-Pixmap file!)

I still think it should be up to the user to decide whether or not their
XPM files should be gzip'ed.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Gimp copes just fine with gzipped files (As
it should IMHO ...)

My 2p's worth is that fvwm should use gzipped icons transparently if
they're there, ie if you gzip your icons fvwm will carry on working but
should by default have the icons unzipped ...

	On first glance, I'm rather inclined to agree with Brad. I think the
new color code may want a bit of tinkering, and a good deal of thoughtful
visual inspection of the results under as many varied environments as the
developers can manage to find.

	I'm hesitant to include screen shot attachments, so I put a couple
of before and after shots on my Web site:

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/ColorShots.tar.gz

The file is about 330k. It contains 4 grabs of a window using one of my
commonly used styles:

	1. OldColor2.jpg -  a highlighted window with the old color code
	2. NewColor2.jpg -  a highlighted window with the new color code
	3. OldColor2a.jpg - a non-highlighted window with the old color code
	4. NewColor2a.jpg - a non-highlighted window with the new color code

	For my taste, I prefer the slightly crisper look of the old style; but
we may be able to reproduce this more closely with the new code, I don't know.
I haven't had a chance to examine it.

	Another thought: some user-configurability of the color algorithm would
be a nice idea. Or will I find that that's already there when I look at the
actual code changes?

If this is the new algorithm I posted earlier, it definitely admits of
tuning very easily, since it multiplies the saturation and luminosity
by an arbitrary double. You can probably get a crisper look by using a
smaller shadow factor and a higher hilight factor. I was too lazy to
experiment very much with it when I implemented the change
originally. 

Oh yeah, having an additive factor on hilighting in addition to a
multiplicative one should probably result in crisper hilights as
well. Again, if you guys do figure out better settings and/or code
changes, please send them upstream. Originally, I missed the crisper
look too, but since I've grown to prefer the smoother look, I've been
too lazy to try to reproduce it.

I made all the tunable parameters of this algorithm user-settable in
scwm, but I am no longer totally certain how valuable that is. Hardly
anyone seems to change it from the default.

I seem to remember this being mentioned in the past. I forget exactly
why this occurs. I was digging around in ComplexFunction() yesterday
though... It probably has something to do with ComplexFunction()
iterating over mi's, which are about to get clobbered by the
DestroyFunc... maybe before setting mi=mi->next, there should be a
quick check to see if mi is still around, and break if it's gone
missing? Though really elegant would be to allow for functions like:

AddToFunc dynamic-func "I" DestroyFunc dynamic-func
+ "I" foo
+ "I" bar

where foo & bar are Reads, PipeReads, etc... Not sure about how to
handle something like that.

Hah, that's funny. Also very ugly is binding a function "I" to a
keyboard shortcut and having autorepeat... That really bent fvwm out
of shape.

Incidentally, does anyone know what in the world "CLICK_AND_A_HALF" is
all about? It's not at all documented, from what I can tell...

That's pretty darn picky, to change something like that :).

Perhaps what we'd prefer is two or three or four alternatives that look
sufficiently different, and document them in the man page or something
("this one gives deep shadows... this one is smooth..." etc.)  No one
is (probably) going to play with the numbers themselves, just like
Maciej didn't bother :)

The tuning is in libs/ColorUtils.c:

Pixel GetShadow(Pixel background) {
 return adjust_pixel_brightness(background, 0.7);
}
Pixel GetHilite(Pixel background) {
 return adjust_pixel_brightness(background, 1.3);
}

.7 is for the background, 1.3 is the foreground.
For more definition try .6 and 1.4.  I think they will be close to
the original.

BTW, in the code at home, these are at least #define'd.

I haven't provided any means of external control.

Well, yeah, the code revealed that much to me, but I was more
referring to the fact that there's an undocumented feature in fvwm,
which AFAICT has been around for as long as I've used fvwm, that I
never knew about because it's undocumented.

I guess more to the point, should click and a half functions exist? If
so, it should be documented. If not, not.

If my memory is correct there is no one-and-a-half click for functions
(although it would be cool). I think that was used only for some
obscure bugfix or feature somewhere.

I think we need to split this thread into two parts.

The first question Dan raised is: should we stay with simple:

  win->Sticky = 1;

or should we attempt some form of abstraction with something like:

  SetStick(win);

As far as I can tell, the real argument here is whether there are any
benefits in abstraction and maintainability to the latter and, if so, do
they outweigh the potential for abuse that macros may allow (as a
corollary, how great is that potential in this brave new development
environment?)

Thoughts?

Hey, I'm pretty sure I said nothing of the sort, I want to stay out of
this one.

OK, you are finally going to get an opinion.  Let the person doing the
coding decide.  (I know, its a crumby opinion, thats why I didnt' want
to  reveal what  I thought.)  Oh,  here's  another opinion, macros are
uppercase only, so its: SETSTICK(win);

Along those lines, note you can create a ~/.cvsrc file containing

  $ cat ~/.cvsrc
  update -dP

Hi.

I checked out the code from cvs (from the head) as of 10 minutes ago,
and when I try to resize some windows with my hotkeys (below), the
resize-frame just flashes and is gone.

Mouse 3 W       M       Resize
[...]
Style "FvwmButtons" NoTitle, Handles, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0
Style "FvwmButtons" NoIcon, ClickToFocus

On all normal windows with MouseFocus, it works just fine.. but not with
CTF (which I just use for dummy windows like xconsole, fvwmbuttons etc)...

Any ideas?

/Tomas

Cool; I got the latest from the CVS site so I'll try to get to test it
today.

Here's the second thread Dan raised; I hope he'll followup and explain
this one better, but essentially he suggests it would make more sense to
split the existing flags into two sets, rather than leaving them lumped
together in one structure.

Dan, details and arguments?

Apologies; I thought it was Dan who'd raised these issues but I guess
not.  Looking at the archive I see it was Bob W.

So, replace "Dan" with "Bob".  Other comments stand! :)

What thread are you talking about?  Are  you reading the archives from
the  first  time this   went  around?  Could    you please  include  a
quotation?

Oh, this might be Bob too?

Anyway, there is an issue.  From add_window.c:

  tmp_win->flags |= styles.on_flags & ALL_COMMON_FLAGS;

As you can  see, there comes a  time when some  of the style flags are
copied into the FvwmWindow structure.  It might be logical to put the
common flags in one area, and the remaining flags in another.

Sorry, this got lost.  OK, attached is my latest rm-tspaces.el.  In my

Recognizing the potential for abuse, I _still_ vote for abstraction.

Put a note in the header file stating "these macros may not be changed".
Detail the reasons why.

OK, that's fine.  But I repeat: the GSFR has been a long time in coming
and we should do it _right_, and not worry too much about how much fvwm
code might break.  That's why we're waiting until the next release: we
expect things to break.

  dv> Semantic errors!

I guess I'm thick, but I just don't see what kind of semantic errors
you're envisioning being a problem by splitting one structure (which
doesn't even exist yet!) into two.  You're going to have to change all
that code anyway for GSFR.  And any code you _didn't_ change would fail
to compile, whereupon you could examine the code and ensure that it was
both syntactically _and_ semantically correct.

That is obviously terrible code.  If people are going to write bad code,
then they'll write bad code.  I'm not sure we should forgo any possible
advantages in readability and maintainability this might give us because
of that.

But this, definitely, is the crux of the argument so far.

  >> Second, this code is just as readable to me, if not moreso, than
  >> the win->Sticky = 1 variant... that leads you to wonder: what if I

  dv> With bitfields it won't even compile.

I'm talking about reading and comprehending the code.  Certainly it
won't compile, but who's going to try to change it and compile it just
to see?  Anyway, I'm just pointing out that between these two:

  SetSticky(win);
  win->sticky = 1;

it's not obvious to me that the second is superior, in terms of
understanding what it does, than the first.

Obviously none of this holds if SetSticky() _doesn't_ do that, or does
more, but that's another argument (see above).  Maybe it's my happy
experience so far, but I typically take macros and functions at face
value and don't bother going to see what they _really_ do... unless it
seems likely there's something wrong with them.  That makes them a net
win in ease of understanding for me :).

  >> The entire point of macros like this is to concentrate details into
  >> one place to allow the details to be changed later, invisibly,

  dv> I knew that reasoning would come up. If we want to do the GSFR by
  dv> changing macros, we have clearly screwed up the design before.

Well, obviously the current style code _IS_ broken, that's why we have
to rewrite it.  My point is that it could have been rewritten without
changing any code _if_ some abstraction from the fundamental types were
used.

Also, I'm not sure I agree with the argument that implementation- and
data-hiding is useless because if the design was right it wouldn't be
necessary :).  In changing environments and requirements, the design may
need to change.  The ability to do this with minimal disruption to code
which doesn't need to know about the change is the hallmark of a good
implementation.

  dv> used in an abusive way about 90% of the time.

Wow, you've had bad experience.  I've had the opposite, fortunately:
most of the time I see macros they're useful and used properly.  There
are exceptions but they're not many, and squashed with prejudice
wherever possible.  Note that your parenthetical statement leaves out
about 90% of the macros I've seen in my life, though :)

We have better than that, we have many people with "authority" :).

???  Of course it will.  The compiler does all this _after_ the macro
has been completely expanded.  The compiler doesn't even _SEE_ the code
until after the preprocessor is done with it.

There is no check that the compiler will or will not make differently on
code using a macro than it would make on the same code with the macro
expanded (since the compiler is seeing the code with the macro expanded).

  dv> Oops. Lint (at least some of the enhanced lints) is much better than

But, most lint's don't work with ANSI code/prototypes.  Anyway, this
argument is moot because I just checked the lint man page and is sez:

  | lint runs the C preprocessor as its first phase,

so lint will _also_ not be fooled by macros, just like the compiler.

I count 189 downloads of fvwm-2.1.1.tar.gz and a handful of 2.1.0 since we
put them up.

I'm not sure that the lack of bug reports indicates that the release is
just incredibly solid, but it wouldn't surprise me.

	Jeje, we all hope so, but it may be due to people don't caring about 
stres-testing it, and posibly they are using more beta soft, so they 
don't know if what made it segfault was itself or a bug in the last 
2.1.129-pre5 kernel :)
	Anyway I think fvwm2 is more solid that it seems, it never crashed 
here, I know this is no valid info, but I'm sure that everyone agree in 
that finding bugs in fvwm2 is a hard task, so the question is why not 
release a 2.2-pre1 or something similar, I mean , something that inform 
people out of the mailing list and the CVS about the proximity of a new 
release, we may even post an announce to freshmeat (if you are prepared 
to get 180 downloads a day ;).
	The most important reason to do this should be that after that, we
could split our task force, there are people who wants a *very* stable
2.2, so they could work on it, and then other people (like me) would be
free to theorizy about command syntax and such things, it has been almost
two years from the las "official" release of fvwm2 so I think it's time to
update the Official Home Page of Fvwm2, and it would be great if we could
come with a stable 2.2 release before the end of this month, I have
nothing against december, but posponing it with the idea of include more
features of some syntax redesing is not a god idea (IMHO of course). 

	What do you think?

	I didn't say it was going to be easy, but since every bit of code
that passes a copy of the flag word around now will need to be tweaked
to do the GSFR, I think we ought to take the time to think out whether
there is any rationale (other than trying not to break code that we're
going to break anyway) for having a bunch of flags related to a window's
status tagging along with the style flags when we call code that is only
concerned with matching styles. I don't think there is.

	Clearly, of course, the simplicity of passing flags as a calling
arg has to go, to be replaced with a pointer to a style flags structure.
Any code that really needs to be looking at both will either need extra
args (pointers to both structures), or it will need to be looking at the
FvwmWindow structure; I think that most of those places are already
looking at the FvwmWindow.

	I officially vote for two new flag structures - style flags and
status flags.

	I'll cast my vote for the abstraction.

	As a matter of practical coding grunt work, by the way, if we agree
on the set of macros, the GSFR API, if you will, some people could actually
begin the grunt work of changing code while we're still debating the final
format of the flags (struct/union-within-struct, one set of flags or two,
etc.) And we can still be changing that format up to the last minute without
breaking hundreds of lines of code. In my experience, this sort of thing has
been a big win.

	(Of course, I'm quite certain we'll all agree on a perfect design
before writing a line of code, but just in case....)   ;-)

	Well, maybe not quite that strongly put...if we can't ever change
them, we lose the advantage of encapsulation.

	Well, I would hope that we're giving it a more thorough stress-testing
that the average user who just wants to take a look at the new features (or see
whether his favorite bug has been fixed). We certainly should be trying to.

	We're all really impatient to see a new release get out, believe me.
But cut us a little slack on this one. We're a brand new development team, and
we're still getting used to the procedures. Once the official 2.2 goes out, I
think you may be surprised at how quickly subsequent releases will follow,
compared to the way it's been in the past - if we do this one right!

I honestly believe that the users deserve a release soon (as much as users

get the infrastructure ready.  Apache is building now...

	Well, that should be enough, I suggested a prerelease because it 
indicate clearly the inmdiate release. Anyway I think that a two year 
release cycle is a too-slow release cycle (yeah, I know this is going to 
change now, but people out of the list don't know it)

Well, if we move  the first 13 bits   out of style flags,  into status
flags, it would seem to me we are only  using 19 of the  32 bits.  I'm
forgetting why we think we are out of bits?

	Well, for the time being, we'd no longer be out of bits. It wouldn't
surprise me at all, though, to find that we've got a backlog of more than 13

I have a feeling you are trying to convince me of something...

Thats 13  more style things  that can  be represented as  single bits,
that are not to be copied into the FvwmWindow struct.

I wouldn't mind going  ahead with isolating the  status bits, and then
use 8-9 more bits before we give this  another thought.  It could be a
while before the next 8 bits get used.

Note that when it comes to that there will be more code that needs to be
converted.  At least there should be a set of access methods that will
remain the same regardless of the underlying implementation so that the new
code won't need to be worked over when the change really does come.

Just another thought: there are 14 on/off switches that configure can
use do you think we should test all combinations (16384) to make sure it
will always compile.  My guess is that trying all-on, all-off, (all-on
minus one) * 14, (all-off plus one) * 14 would probably find all
problems.

Any thoughts?
Tim.

Finally I was able to rerun the performance test with the 2.1.1
distribution:

  configure  :  68 sec
  make       : 260 sec
  FvwmAnimate:   6 sec
  --------------------
  total      : 334 sec

This is only a little slower that 2.0.47d and may as well be
caused by the additional code :-)

E.g. you copy the struct with the style flags but forget to copy the

In this case I don't see better readability. And it should be

I don't trust names. They may suggest things that are not done.
This is a frequent cause of confusion with macros.

I am willing to give it a try, but I'm sceptical. In this case it

That's no advantage in respect to coding style. Many people ==>
different styles ==> noone bothers about the style of patches (?).

#define SETCHARPOINTER(c, p) { p = (char *)&c; }

{
  int i;
  int *pi;

  SETCHARPOINTER(i, pi);
}

That's what I mean.

Other lint derivates do a check on preprocessor directives if you tell them.

(I am mostly just lurking here, but I can't let this discussion go by
without comment...)

Abstraction, and separation of interface and implementation, are pretty
much universally accepted as a good thing. They have to be applied with
some taste (just like commenting, where ++i; /* increment i */ is
unhelpful), but I would say that in this case, where we are changing an
implementation and finding it hard because of the *lack* of separation
of the interface, it would be foolish to perpetuate the problem by not
abstracting out the interface while we are making the changes.

[I think the attributions are wrong here, I've lost the thread of all
this... But the point remains the same]

This comment applies EXACTLY as well for functions, as for macros. But I
don't think we're arguing here that functions are a bad thing. The
question is simply whether encapsulating style-setting type operations
is a sufficiently useful abstraction to be worth doing. If functions
offered zero overhead compared to the inline code, then we'd be talking
about functions. However, as they don't, we have to use macros as a poor
man's substitute.

Further, the issue here is not about macros in general - it's about ONE
PARTICULAR style of macro usage - the case where macros are used to
emulate inline functions. If the C optimiser had a god-like ability to
decide on the fly whether to inline a function or to use it out of line,
then we could just write a function

    void SetSticky(Window *win)
    {
        win->sticky = 1;
    }

and we'd be OK. If we were using C++, we could make this an inline
function and have most of the benefits (inline functions can cause code
bloat in some cases, where the optimiser isn't good enough). But we're
using C, so we have macros, which have to be written carefully to get
the same benefit. (And which can hide strange problems if badly written
- but if they are big enough to risk problems like this, they should be
(non-inline) functions and not macros). I'm assuming that everyone
changing the code is competent enough to avoid the well-known problems
(by tricks like parenthesising everything) and would do

    #define SetSticky(win) (void)(((win)->sticky) = 1)

and not

    #define SetSticky(win) win->sticky = 1

or

    #define SetSticky(win) { win->sticky = 1; }

This is just an implementation issue of macros, well known to C
programmers, and shouldn't be a difficulty.

[PS - I agree that macros should be all-capitals, although I'm less
convinced in cases like these, where we'd write a normal function except
for efficiency concerns].

Of course, I also assume that the call SetSticky(win), however
implemented, can be trusted to do what it says (set the sticky flag),
and nothing else. Dominik seems to have some difficulty trusting code
this far, which seems to me to be unreasonable - if we can't trust the
documentation (and I consider function names to be documentation) then
we are totally lost.

If we had an alternative to macros, I'd agree that we should use it.
It's a real pity that C hasn't got inline functions (especially as gcc
has got them, but being non-standard we can't use them :-() But we
don't, so we should use macros (and document clearly how and why we're
using them, so the principle remains clean).

Saying that we shouldn't encapsulate because the only implementation
technique we have is prone to problems in the wrong hands, is a case of
throwing the baby out with the bathwater...

>I am willing to give it a try, but I'm sceptical. In this case it
>may be reasonable after all.

It's a matter of being clear WHY and HOW we are using macros, and
keeping the boundaries clear. In my view, any inline-function-substitute
macro which needs tricks like do { ... } while (0) to combine multiple
statements is suspect - we should limit ourselves to SINGLE expressions.

And I strongly advise against macros like

    #define MyMacro()  stmt1; \
                      stmt2; \
                      stmt3;

These simply don't work like functions in all contexts. Use comma
expressions, and ?: for conditions, and remember to cast to void any
macro expression which is intended to act like a void function. And go
no further...

Agreed. But we should therefore document our practices to help share
style. And we shouldn't be afraid of querying a patch on stylistic
grounds ("wouldn't it be better to code that construct like this?").

That's simply a badly written macro. What's wrong with

    #define SETCHARPOINTER(c,p) (void)((p) = &(c))

Note that using an expression cast to void allows correct use in the if
() SETCHARPOINTER(); else situation, and parenthesising p and c avoids
precedence problems. And the compiler will type check the assignment
correctly.

And anyway, this is NOT a case of a macro emulating an inline function -
you can't write SETCHARPOINTER as a function. I *don't* support (in
general) macros which are syntactically or semantically different from
"pure" C. Unless they are clearly documented, and VERY carefully written
to act as closely to normal statements as possible - see the if...else
case above. If you are worried about this style of macro, I would
generally support you
(but remember we didn't need nastinesses like pass-by-reference for
SetStcky, above).

Back to lurking, until I can put my code where my mouth is...

I'd like to see it cleaned up with purify before the release.
There are lots of nice in my head that I cannot implement now
too, but it will simply have to wait for a while.

This exchange between Brad and myself was off the list.

Time to sum this up.

What we have  now  with this  new  shadow/hilite function is a  common
routine for creating three-D hightlights and  shadows, usable by fvwm2
and the modules.

While colors stay away from extremes, the colors produced are the
same as fvwm2 has been producing for a while.  What this new algorithm
buys us is better colors when the colors contain maxed out RGB values.
I tested these colors, with what looked like good results:

FF0000 Red
00FF00 Green
0000FF Blue
FFFF00 Yellow
00FFFF Cyan
FF00FF Magenta

(Middle tones still produce a more pleasing effect.)

I didn't test black or white, but looking at the code, and comments, I
don't see how it would 3D those colors.  (That doesn't bother me.)

Closely associated  with  the Shadow  logic,  is the color  allocation
logic.   I almost made color allocation   a "libs" subroutine, until I
realized that  when  color allocation fails   in  fvwm2, it   wants to
broadcast the failure to all modules using "fvwm_msg(ERR,...)".

I don't see how that  function will work in  a module. A module  would
have to send  a broadcast  request to fvwm2.   So, I've  put that idea
aside, for now.

Hi All,
	FvwmButtons gets it wrong when you give it a geometry of -0-0.  It
calculates the position hints by subtracting the width of the window
from the display width and then creates a simple window with a border
width of 1.  It should either take the border width into account when
calculating the position hints or set the border width to 0. Since
FvwmButtons is only ever run by fvwm which sets the borderwidth to 0
when reparenting I've attached a patch which does the latter.

Cheers,
Tim.

What I've seen motif do is to make the hilite colour darker than the
background when the background is very light, and make the shadow colour
lighter than the background when the background is very dark.  This
breaks the hilite > background > shadow look but does at least let you
keep all three colours visibly different.  I don't know how the motif
algorithm picks the threshold at which it flips, it doesn't appear to be
just a luminance number.  I've played with the CDE style manager colour
picker and you can set a saturation and luminance and then as you move
the hue around some hilite colours will be lighter and others darker. 
They must have paid a human factors person to come up with the rules.

I vote for keeping in sync with GTK, it makes swallowed GTK windows and
FvwmButtons look really nice if the shadow colours match.

Cheers,
Tim.

(i'm not subscribed, so cc me. =)

well, since people were asking... here are somethings i've noticed w/
2.1.1  i was using 2.0.46 for the last ~6m w/o most of these problems.

*FvwmWinListGeometry -1+1
*FvwmWinListMinWidth 100
*FvwmWinListMaxWidth 130

winlist has a tendancy to creep west.  if i restart fvwm with a smaller
MaxWidth (-n), it will end up living farther and farther west until it's
n pixels off the right edge.  the odd thing is that ident still claims
it has a NE gravity. (did not notice in 2.0.46)

also for winlist, if i use -0+0 for the gravity, it does not stay on
the NE corner. (also in 2.0.46)

pager does not deal w/ 2 displays very well.  I have 2 displays :0.0
:0.1  if i switch from one to the other, pager still marks the last
window that had focus, as still having focus.   (not in 2.0.46)

i'm using sloppy focus.  i go from :0.0 to :0.1, and then return.  the
last window that had focus on :0.0 does not have the focus returned.  in
general, there seem to be focus problems when switching from one display
to the other.  if i use the mouse to move from :0.0 to :0.1 and the
mouse does not pass over any of the root window in :0.1 (eg netscape is
stitting on the screen edge), no window gets focus until i pass over the
root window.  after that, everything is a-ok.  (did not notice in 2.0.46)

if i start up an xterm, and have to click to place it, it will let me
click to place it, and then proceed to place it at +0+0, no matter
what.  if there is enough free space to let fvwm place the window, there
is no problem.  (not in 2.0.46)

buttonbar cannot swallow pager right if i have an odd number of buttons defined.
so, if there is an empty space, it does not swallow pager, and i cannot see if
the buttons are getting drawn ok. (not in 2.0.46)

so, that's what i've found in the last ~3 days...  i'm happy to play
with things to help isolate or fix these problems.

i'm including my .fvwm2rc for reference.

Blargh, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Obscure macros with
lots of code doing intransparent things. It does not matter it you
use commas or not.

That is not better in any way. You can STILL use ints without a
warning. The point is: you use the macro correctly at first, then
change the data type someday --> crash.

Agreed. To write good macros, you have to be careful and convoluted. But
that's a write-once problem (and macros where it's a *real* issue are
already getting too big, IMHO). The big read-many benefit is in
encapsulation (that *doesn't* just mean it's easier to read, it also,
and more importantly, means it's easy to change low-level implementation
decisions).

And none of this applies for a simple

    #define SetSticky(w) (void)((w)->sticky = 1)

>> That's simply a badly written macro. What's wrong with
>> 
>>     #define SETCHARPOINTER(c,p) (void)((p) = &(c))

As I pointed out, I *don't* support macros which aren't semantically
equivalent to functions, except in special cases (which this isn't -
it's a hypothetical example). But here, I don't have the spec for your
SETCHARPOINTER. What is it supposed to do? Why do you want it
encapsulated like that (when there is no non-macro equivalent construct
in C)? There is no safe equivalent. In your macro (with a cast) you can
assign the address of a non-char to a char *. In mine, you can assign
the address of an int to an int *. Neither is how the macro was intended
to be used (you state). Remember, I agree with you that this sort of
(ill-defined, semantically different from a C function) macro is not
good. But if you have a real use in mind, specify it and we can discuss
cases. [BTW, if you want to insist that p is a (char *), I think you're
out of luck, as you can't express that constraint in C!]

But I won't continue this, as it just turns into an exercise in me
showing off how I can write *really* tricky macros which do fancy things
- which, as I say are a silly theoretical exercise which I wouldn't do
in real code. I would, on the other hand, write a macro to emulate an
inline function for performance reasons. But that's generally not hard
(assuming the function is small enough to *want* to inline).

Hope this helps,
Paul.

I tried to merge the newmenus patch yesterday, but it didn't
compile ('white' and 'black' externals were missing in
builtins.c). Is there a newer patch that works with the current
code?

A result of my latest change.

Change white to "white" and black to "black".

I removed the externs for these because they seemed really dumb.

A bug in interactive placement. Hopefully fixed in 2.1.2. If not,
please post this again.

I'm not sure I understand correctly. Do you mean you actually
USE an odd number of buttons or has the whole button bar an
odd number? Could you please post the FvwmButtons config
strings that reproduce/solve this? (Plus the Pager config in
the same mail, please).

I need an exact description of what you have done (what is in
your config file, what keys/buttons do you press or release
when, when exactly does the frame flash, when does it vanish...).

You say you hit a hotkey but post the mouse bindings ??

Hmm.  I guess I'd need to see the details of implementation to decide
how likely I think this is.

No.  Again, I'm talking about _reading_ and _comprehending_ the code.
Not changing the code.

I'm reading a function in my editor, to see what it does.  I look at the
line.  I see the value set to 1.  "1" is a magic number: there's nothing
_inherent_ in the line that tells me what it means.  If I happen to know
that "win->sticky" is a bitfield of size 1 bit, I can infer that turns
on a boolean.  But maybe it's not; maybe I'd get a different "style" of
stickiness if I set it to 2.  I don't know.

I shouldn't have to change the code and compile it and get a compilation
error in order to understand what it does!  (Obviously that's silly; of
course I'd go look up the struct definition--but still, if the code is
well-written I wouldn't need to even do that to make a very accurate
guess as to what's going on.)

I suppose another way to fix this would be to change the fieldname to:

  win->isSticky = 1;

or something, so the name implies a boolean.

  dv> I don't trust names. They may suggest things that are not done.
  dv> This is a frequent cause of confusion with macros.

???

The same can be said of functions, of course.

Maybe it's just my experiences, but I prefer to trust the code as
written, including function and macro names.  If something turns out to
violate that trust, _then_ I swear a blue streak and complain bitterly
(or fix it myself :).

  dv> That's no advantage in respect to coding style. Many people ==>
  dv> different styles ==> noone bothers about the style of patches (?).

That's a choice we can make ourselves.  It's certainly not unheard of
for there to be coding guidelines in opensource development.

Anyway, it's one thing to be picky about brace placement, comment
formatting, etc. and quite another to be strict about modifications to
significant code areas, like GSFR.

  dv> #define SETCHARPOINTER(c, p) { p = (char *)&c; }

  dv> That's what I mean.

Anyone can break any kind of error checking with casts.  And anyone can
write bad macros... just as they can write bad code otherwise.

There are enough eyes looking at the code that I don't feel worried that
this sort of thing will become a problem.  Maybe I'm just an optimist :)

With the mouse-binding above, I press Meta then resize windows by
click+drag inside the window with mousebutton 3. It works for all
windows with MouseFocus but those with CTF, for them I just get the
resize-frame for an msec or so, then the frame goes away and the
size-info-thing in the upper-left corner disappears as well. No redraws
(for instance what the size-info wiped out) are done until I let go of
the mouse.

<speculations>
It would seem like the CTF grabs the click+hold, and removes it from
WhatsCurrentlyActive (uh.. or something) instead of just passing it
through to the bindings-department. Something seems to be aware of the
pressed mouse-button (some wait-loop?), otherwise I should get a redraw
and continue with life as nothing happened..
</speculations>

	Of course not, since you said you didn't want to have anything
to do with the GSFR!  :-)  I was just replying generically to the
thread.

	Well, we both spoke too soon, without referring to the code
("...use the Source, Luke!) The FvwmWindow flags word would have some
extra bit-like entities, but the flags word that name_list uses is
totally full of style flags: there is no room at the inn.

	But you raised an interesting point, which is probably at the
heart of the whole matter. Does anyone understand the history of the
infamous ALL_COMMON_FLAGS, and why only those style flags are carried
in the FvwmWindow structure? And if so, please share it with us. To me
it seems an abominable practice.

	But the point of my other suggestion ("GSFR: One flags structure
or two?") is that there shouldn't *be* such code. It seems to me that
any code that concerns itself with both STARTICONIC (aka START_ICONIC_FLAG)
and ICONIFIED ought to be looking at the FvwmWindow struct, not just a copy
of the flags word. I suspect that this is the case, but thorough research
will probably prove me wrong.

Ok.  Here it is.  

First I implemented a WindowMask struct which holds the flags used in
Circulate function.  This struct is handled by a few functions:

FreeMask	- frees the name field of mask
DefaultMask	- sets the default values of the mask
CreateMask	- sets the values of the mask from a string of flags
MatchesMask	- check whether a window matches the mask

There is also a function CreateFlagString, which is just to parse the
text between [ ] or ( ) characters and return it and the rest of the
line.

Then I modified the Circulate function to use these functions - hope
that I did not break anything - I do not normally use Circulate in my
configuration. :) Though, I checked it a little and it seemed to work
without hogging any memory.  I implemented also a new Direction
function which can be used like this, for example:

Direction North [!Sticky] Focus
Direction East [!Sticky] Focus
Direction South [!Sticky] Focus
Direction West [!Sticky] Focus

The score function for choosing the closet window is calculated based
on the position of the titlebar, which feeled most logical to me.

And here is the patch.  I hope that those revision numbers do not
cause any problems.

I assume we would:

add  to FvwmWindow a  "status"  field which are  the
common flags  from  the style   merge.   The existing flags field   in
FvwmWindow would have 13 bits unused.

Add a "status" field to the Style list  which would hold the 13 common
bits.  The existing on_flag  and  off_flag fields  would have 13  bits
unused.

Replace the masked move using ALL_COMMON_FLAGS with simple assignment.
Eliminate ALL_COMMON_FLAGS.

The ALL_COMMON_FLAGS   bits     are moved  into   the   FvwmWindow  at
"add_window" time.  The other bits aren't set  at add_window time from
the  merged  Styles because  they  reflect  the  current  state of the
window.

I sort of like the idea of separating the bits.  They are grouped right
now, only because they are bits.

Nope, I don't want it either, I'm not planning on doing anything big and
I like having patches looked at before getting committed. Besides, I'd
like to stay anonymous if possible.

Thanks for the fast reply although I don't need it anymore. I could
reproduce this at home. The fix will be checked into CVS today.

Totally wrong ;-) The reason is that the button appears to be pressed
when the move code is entered, but after that the button press
arrives. Obviously the events get out of sync somewhere. I've
not investigated this matter but implemented a simple workaround.

Subject: New module
From: fred-m@crl.hitachi.co.jp
To: dominik_vogt@hp.com

--------- snip ---------

What I need to know first of all is how to contribute it. Is it OK (for the
fvwm mailing list's netiquette and reader's bandwidth) to send a whole
module in an e-mail? What do you recommend? (For instance: you or another
maintainer could put it in the unofficial patches directory, and after that
I could announce it in the mailing list and have people try it for a while).


By the way, below is an announcement of the module, so you will know what it
is about before unpacking it...

---------------------------------

The attached files have FvwmStyleCmd.pl, a module that I created which I
hope to have distributed with Fvwm. This module works like a Style function
that accepts any Fvwm command instead of only style options. Some examples
of what can be done (in the format used in the .fvwm2rc file) are:

# Maximize ghostview by default
*FvwmStyleCmd  -resource  "ghostview"   Maximize
# Maximize emacs and xdvi on the vertical by default
*FvwmStyleCmd  -resource  "emacs"  Maximize 0 100
*FvwmStyleCmd  -resource  "xdvi"   Maximize 0 100
# Move Netscape's download windows to the right and return focus to
# the browser window
*FvwmStyleCmd  -name "Netscape Download" Move 50 75, Prev [*] Focus
# Move Netscape's Find window to the right, and place the mouse pointer
# on the input field
*FvwmStyleCmd  -name "Netscape: Find" Move 60 50, WarpToWindow 80 30

The module is simple, but it answers some requests that I found in the
mailing list (e.g., maximize by default) and has the potential to do a lot
more (without any programming by the user). Please give a try.

By the way, this module uses the fvwmmod.pl in extras/fvwmperl. I know that
fvwmperl has reached a dead end, I have already talked to Dan Astoorian and
Randy Ray (the author of X11::Fvwm). Porting this module to X11::Fvwm might
be The Right Thing, but:
- I am worried that since X11::Fvwm is distributed separately from Fvwm
(Randy prefers it this way) it will reach far less people.
- I am using Perl to make the initial development of the module faster. I
want to make a C language version as soon as I get some feedback.

All comments are welcome.

---------------------------------

Thanks in advance,

                         Fred Maciel

You don't need a maintainer  to get things  in the unofficial  patches
directory.  Right now I can't put my fingers  on the instructions, but
I'm sure someone else on this list can supply them.

I see there is a copy attached, perhaps you won't need to do that.

Neat!  I've been  thinking  of revising  the builtin "sytle"   command
wildcard matching rules, and you came up with a possible syntax.

That would give us:

Style -class "XTerm" Icon xterm.xpm
Style -class "XTerm" -name "AIX*" Icon aix-xterm.xpm

Did you happen to use wildcard matches in the FvwmStyle module?

Perhaps there is a way to integrate this with FvwmEvent?

I would prefer a C implementation also.

Was there a discussion about him? Or is al this alcohol from
out 12000-units-sold-party fogging my mind?

I think the outcome was that German doesn't necessarily need
access. I will happily commit his patches (in fact this should
have been already done, but something goes wrong every time :-( ).
If he still thinks he should have access  I have no objections.
What do you say, German. Are you happy if I commit your changes
or do you feel the need to get access for the furture? In any case
you shouldn't commit the newmenus patch. I will do that (with a
little cleanup in the old menystyle code).

Bye

I don't  remember seeing  this  request.  Based  on the ChangeLog Todd
submitted the  UseStyle patch,  and based on  the mail  archives, he's
been actively involved for quite some time, so I would support this.

Last I heard,  Dominik proposed adding Newmenus  via patches.  I think
this request is still pending.

I got thinking about this and had a look for XCreate.*Window and found
lots of places where windows are created with non-zero borderwidths.
Having non-zero borderwidths is good in programs that may be run without
a window manager but fvwm and all it's modules only run when there is
one.

FvwmWinList.c has some really nasty cruft in it where various brave
souls have attempted to stop it creeping around. Attached is a patch
which I think fixes the problems.  Having a borderwidth of 12 helps make
errors obvious. I've also removed some commented out code and fixed an
off-by-one error in the height.

One thing that pops out of this is that when a window resizes itself
fvwm does not handle the windows gravity.  FvwmWinList sets the gravity
correctly when initializing and fvwm gets it right when it reparents the
window. Things go pear shaped when FvwmWinList resizes itself though. 
fvwm just changes the size when it should be shifting the origin if a
gravity of anything but NorthWest is specified.

Should we fix fvwm?  There are other modules that resize themselves
(FvwmIconMan for one). Do these have problems with gravity or do they do
their own thing. I know we're close to the real release so it might be
better to just live with it.

Anyway please test the following patch if your FvwmWinList wanders.

Cheers,
Tim.

I thought about that too but didn't get very far. There are some
other problems related to border width:

 - SnapAttraction patch snaps the right border of a window
   off-screen (just one pixel or so of the border remains
   visible, the rest is on the next page).

 - same when you use geometry: -0+x on any window. The border
   is not completely visible.

Could you see after this?

I'd say we try to fix. This kind of patches isn't very
obvious to users so I don't care if the work carries on over
the release (as long as we don't break things of course).

Should I commit the patch now or are you unsure about that?

I don't know if anyone else has seen this.  But I thought it would through
it out maybe someone has an idea how to fix it.

I have an xterm that supports ansi color compiled under Solaris.  But what
of its nifty features is called active icons ( what it gives me, is a
scaled down view of my xterm when I iconify it. that updates its contents
automatically.  so you could iconify a log window, then when something
writes to it you can see the text inside your mini view change.)

Now the problem is if I resize this window after i create it.  As soon as
a release my mouse button.  The thing shrinks down to the size of my
handles plus xterm scrollbar width.  If I don't use active icons then the
sterm behaves normally on resize.  I've tried it out under CDE and it
behaves correctlly, so I am doubtful that it is the xterm, but more
likelly something in fvwm.

Any thoughts,
Brad

How can I reproduce this (i.e. how do you activate

well you can do xterm +ai  if its compiled in otherwise you need to
rebuild an xterm that has that feature,  I can pass along the source if
you want it.

I was kind of hoping to see some comments comparing BugZilla with Jitterbug
before I actually did anything.

Jitterbug is the only thing I have any experience with at all, and that is
just as an end user.  I did try BugZilla but didn't really enjoy the
experience.  I can't put a finger on why, though.

Anyway, things have calmed down a bit and I'm able to put some time in on
this.  I also just scrounged a rather nice disk to slot into the machine,
so we have a reasonable amount of storage.

Anyway, does anyone know any tips on Jitterbug they want to share while I'm
at it?

I do, thanks for the offer. My current Linux distribution dosn't
contain the X11 sources anymore.

As an end-user, I preferred Jitterbug, too.

I don't have any tips but I'm trying to get them to install it on the
gnu site, too, for GNU make bugs, because I don't feel comfortable with
www gnats.  If I hear any info from them about issues I'll pass 'em on.

I started to run the purify test, but it hangs forever for me when
trying to execute this line in the sample .fvwm2rc:

  piperead cat

The stack trace is:

It's run a popen on cat, which won't close until its input pipe is
closed, which it won't be because fvwm doesn't close it, so it sits
forever.  Perhaps your implementation of cat does something different?
Anyway I suggest this test be modified :)

BTW, I got the same problem with these lines:

  piperead cat /nonexistent/foo/bar
  piperead 	cat	  /tmp/purify.read

because the first argument ("cat") is the command name and the rest are
assumed to be options to the command (this is odd; why aren't the
options first?  Annoying).  Anyway, I had to quote them:

  piperead "cat /nonexistent/foo/bar"
  piperead "	cat	  /tmp/purify.read"

Then, I got a lot further but I eventually got a coredump :(

I'll describe that in a followup message.

The problem is that Tmp_win appears to contain junk:

(gdb)  p *Tmp_win        
$5 = {next = 0x0, prev = 0x8104, stack_next = 0xef3b3a04,

  nr_left_buttons = 331232, nr_right_buttons = 8292, left_w = {0, 4036513624,
    ...

A very suspicious comment appears above this code in Destroy():

  /*
      RBW - 11/13/1998 - new: have to unhook the stacking order chain also.
      There's always a prev and next, since this is a ring anchored on
      Scr.FvwmRoot
  */

Hmm... :)

But, that may not be the problem.  Something is going on here that has
Purify so confused it's generating bad data; here's the first really
serious (non-read related) report:

****  Purify instrumented /usr/local/pure/bin/fvwm2 (pid 14357)  ****
FMR: Free memory read:
  * This is occurring while in:
        ComplexFunction [complex.c:155]
        ExecuteFunction [functions.c:247]

  * Reading 4 bytes from 0xe8a00 in the heap.
  * Address 0xe8a00 is 24 bytes into a freed  block at 0xe89e8 of 508 bytes.
  * This block was allocated from:
        start          [crt0.o]
  * There have been -314681 frees since this block was freed.

Uh?  -314681 frees?  And allocated from "start" in crt0.o?  And no
traceback regarding where it was freed?  Usually with FMR you get a
trace on where it was used, where it was freed, _and_ where it was
allocated.

I'll send the entire Purify log but I'm not sure it'll be too
enlightening.

	I agree with you, I do not need commit acces if you are going to 
commit them, so in the future I will send the patches to you instead of

	Well, after a little time of inactivity and some testing of
the new generation of window managers, as Enlightenment and
WindowMaker, I realize that we need to work hard if we want to make
something really usefull. Although Enlightenment is really huge and
not very usable (IMHO of course), WindowMaker seems really good, and
it's configuration program is the best I've seen around. So here are
some TODO thoughts to keep fvwm2 where it deserves!
    The following is always IMHO, so if you disagree, mail to the
list, so we all could know about it :)

	- We NEED a configurator program, something better than
FvwmConfig is definetely required if we want to have a chance. Looking 
at WPrefs (from WindowMaker) should provide enough ideas for a year of 
work :)
	- The discussion about syntax is futile, we already have some
politics on styles definitions, we have the Style command as a model.
I've already started changing the SetMenuStyle so it ressemble as much 
as posible to the Style command, for now I'm storing the styles
preparsed (just a linked list), I'm adding new capabilities, as
selecting the way items are marked, with rectangles, ovals, other
colors, other pixmaps, etc; and also setting the popups properties, 
triangle definitions,etc, no more fvwm, mwm, win, next or
anything else a sick mind as mine could think of :) 
	- I  need someone who  think of an intelligent way to make the
gradients, I think I did the best I could (with memory, not speed, in
mind) if someone knows of a better way to do it (without storing
prerendered pixmaps with the gradients) please email me, the routine I
use now isn't optimized at all. 
	- Someone should become Theme Manager for fvwm2, collecting
icons, textures, and .fvwm2rc, sorting them and making some original
art; what about a little update to our logo? any gimp artist here?
	- We should decide what modules are really important/usefull,
I know it is not a good idea to remove something if it works, but the
question is how much time are we going to spend in debugging modules
that nobody uses? 

	I know it is too much sutff and it is not easy, but window
managers world is going really fast, the war has blowed up.

    FVWM2 NEEDS YOU, JOIN THE ARMY (that is join the mailing list ;)

	Thats all (at least for today it's enough)

There is fvwm.themes.org.  However, I prefer single .fvwm2rc files as
opposed to the fvwm.themes.org multifile format (that's just my taste
though, either way is fine really).  His logo is nice looking too...could
be made into fvwm logo I would think.

	You scared me there, for a minute! But you're right, that's not the
problem. It would have segfaulted a couple of lines further down if my code
hadn't been there, because we're not looking at an FvwmWindow struct. From
the Purify log, I gather there's been a lot of looking at whatever it is,
before somebody invoked a Destroy command that tries to touch as well as
look.

	Well, it's enlightening to the extent that it shows that somebody is
calling ExecuteFunction with a presumably uninitialized, non-null tmp_win
pointer; and that this seems to have been happening over and over. Whatever
was in this tmp_win pointer was probably never a valid address, and just
happens to evaluate to the address of a valid (but not for us) memory location.

	Have you been able to determine how far you got into the script, and
what sequence of commands/functions led up to this?

Hmm, I tried the same and it didn't work for me either.
Perhaps this is used only internally in complex.c? I can't
imagine what it's good for however. It is set under obscure
circumstances, but ... ?

Good. But hold on for a moment. I've finally merged the lastest patch
you posted and will commit it today. Since I've done some cleanup in
MenuStyle et.al. (there were still some ancient memory leaks) you
should fetch the current source from CVS first, so future patches
should be reasonably small to send them to the list anyway (so more
people can test).

I want that patch as soon as possible, even before the 2.2 release.
However a few things have to be done first :(

1) The manpage has to be updated.

2) Some names should be more specific:

     Direction()   -> DirectionFunc()
     ...Mask()     -> ...ConditionMask()
     WindowMask    -> WindowConditionMask

   No big deal, ther're just a bit meaningless.

3) The scoring algorithm is a little erratic and needs some more
   work:

   Example: (windows a, b and c)

       +---------------------+
       |                     |
       |                     |
       |           a         |
       |                     |
       |                     |
       |   +--------------+  |
       +---|              |--+
           |              |
           |       b      |
           |              |--+
           |              |  |
           +--------------+ c|
                        |    |
                        +----+

   Assume window a has the focus at first:
   (I used 'Direction ... [!Sticky] Focus')

     south -> b
     south -> c
     north -> a!! should probably be b, no matter how wide b is.

   Another one:

           +--------------+   
           |              |   
           |              |
           |       b      |
           |              |--+
           |              |  |
   +-------+--------------+ c|
   |     a     |        |    |
   +-----------+        +----+

   Note that a and b do not overlap.

   a: East -> c
   c: West -> a

   I think you should take the overall proximity of the windows into
   account. Window c is clearly more east of a than b, but b is much
   closer and still east of a. Big jumps can confuse the user.

Why not base it on the mid-points of the windows under consideration?

Wow, that's a good chunk of work to do.

I will work on the following stuff:

 - everything where menus are invloved (i.e. any function
   with 'menu' in the name)

 - everything where '...GetNextToken' is involved (parsing).

If somebody else works on some of the messages, please post
what you're doing so we can coordinate that. Just an idea:

Add your name and a description of what you're doing to the
following list and repost it (just the list):

Bye

While testing the direction patch I noticed that neither
the (Visible) nor the (Raised) conditions (for Circulate
etc.) do what I would expect.

Visible selects only windows that are fully visible (that's
what I'd expect for Raised). The right thing seems to be
to select partially obscured windows too.

Raised on the other hand does nothing the user could
comprehend. It seems to be used internally to get the
stacking behaviour of 'StaysOnTop' windows right. I
suggest after the GSFR this should be changed:

  Visible = all windows that ar at least partially visible
  Raised  = all windows that are fully visible

At the moment another flags would have to be introduced :(
To mee it looks as if someone patched these flags to get
OnTop right but forgot the Circulate conditions.

Well, I don't get coredumps on my Linux box, but that doesn't
mean anything. I've probably the same stack errors but they
don't cause a segfault. Anyway that's part of the test. Obviously
this Piperead command has to be examined carefully. Unfortunately
I have no idea what we can do to prevent the hang. Perhaps my
Linux cat knows that it does not run in an interactive environment
and terminates itself while yours does not?

I agree with you on all counts here.  I had been using this patch for
quite a while, the author had released it previouslly as FocusToDir.  But
some work deffintelly does need to be done on the scoring, but I wouldn't
let that stop us from putting it in right now.  Using Next/Prev is pretty
counterintuitive anyway so a few inconsistences with this method won't
make to much differenc to most anyway.  Just my 2 cents.

I'd love to put it in immediately. The only reason why I have not
committed it already is that Teemu said he's working with 2.1.1 and
I don't want to mix up CVS vs his patch. I can do the name changes
as well.

Proposal:

I commit the patch he posted on friday, we package 2.1.2 and all further
patches go against that. Is that allright with you, Teemu? You don't
necessarily need to do all the work on the scoring function
yourself.

Is anybody autoconf'ed well enough to make this release? I'd do
it myself but are still having problems with the distribution.
Dan? What about Steve (are you still alive)?

Just tried this patch from today's CVS (19th Nov.).  I had a few fvwm
crashes when I type in the wrong SetMenuStyle command. e.g. SetMenuStyle
with no parameters.

I have another problem to do with menus that is not caused by this patch
but I've only noticed it while playing:

I tend to specify menus as

AddToMenu junk
+ "item1	$pixmap1%"	exec item1
+ "item2	%pixmap2%"	exec item2

I use TABs between the item name and the pixmap specifier.  If there are
two TABs I get an NL character on the menu item.  This happens when I
use the font "fixed".  It looks like the X call to draw the item name on
the menu is getting handed some trailing stuff or it's not handling
TABs.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm not sure if I  have everything I need, if  I get a chance I'll try
it.  I don't think you want to rely on me  getting this done, at least
not today.

I think one  of  your lists  would be in  order.   As it stands,   the
AUTHORS file  has one  author, I  think  updating this file should  be
mandatory before creating 2.1.2.

We also really need to get the NEWS file correct.  It should list all
new features since 2.0.46.

I assume 2.1.2 will be an ANNOUNCED beta?

Does anyone else feel  that the announced  beta should be done at  the
same  time we install the  web  docs?  (I  know  Jason has machines to
install,  and other work to   do, but I   wouldn't mind waiting, if it
won't be too long.)

No, not today, first I want to commit the direction patch.

Sorry, I have no clue what you are talking about. What lists?

Oh well, I can fill in the things I have done or know of, but that's
limited to the recent past.

I'm willing to help here, but someone else should work on this too.

> I assume 2.1.2 will be an ANNOUNCED beta?

Hmm, sounds a bit risky with the latest purify log. On the other
hand these problems do not occur during a 'normal' fvwm session (?)
Two things to consider:

 - what impact will the announcement have? Will we have time to
   fix the problems we're aware of at the moment?
 - should we have the bug tracker installed first (I think yes).

Overall I'd be more comfortable if we make 2.1.2 unofficial, get
Jitterbug or whatever running and announce 2.1.3 as official beta
late next week.

It should, but if it takes a few days I don't mind.

For compatibility with past and/or future versions of FVWM's syntax
parser, would it be possible to support a new keyword:

    FvwmRCVersion	<release>

This would allow .fvwm2rc files to "advertise" the RC syntax that they
are using.  It would also allow somebody to write a helper program
(FvwmSetVer, perhaps?), that might be able to translate the differences
between the various versions.

A simple example of an RC change could be changing the "Style" command
to use a new syntax as follows:

    Old (2.0.0):	Style "Fvwm*" HandleWidth 0, WindowListSkip

    New (2.1.2):	Style [title="Fvwm*" resource="Fvwm*"] \ 			
			    HandleWidth 0, WindowListSkip

(Note that this is just an example, although such a syntax could easily
be used by the Next, Prev, Current, keywords as well!)

When reading the .fvwm2rc file, the parser could see the FvwmRCVersion
number (2.0.0), and if it is not the version number that it expects
(2.1.0), it could launch the FvwmSetVer program to attempt to convert
between the two RC file formats in order to properly process the file
(sort of like how fvwm2 currently can spawn m4 or cpp to pre-process
the image).  Thus, the fvwm2 parser only needs to parse the new syntax,
leaving the support of the older syntax to the helper program.

The drudgery of supporting older RC files is now relegated to that
simple helper program.  All the program needs to know is the version
number of the RC file (from the FvwmRCVersion keyword) and the version
number understood by the parser.  The helper program then either has an
internal filter that can do the parsing, or it tries to launch a
specialized script.

The actions of the helper program are very simple and could easily be
written in perl, awk, or any other language with good parsing ability.

This could help ease the burden on users when the syntax of the RC file
changes, as the change could be handled as transparently as possible. 
It also removes the complaint "Well, that sounds nice, but it would
break existing configuration files."

Comments?

Thanks.  I have liked the feature very much too.  I have it bound on
vi-keys with Super-modifier (old caps-lock - who needs it anyway :)
And that super can be used for wm-function, without confusing other
applications.

Yep.  If nobody insist doing it himself, I can do that.

I thought that also.  But the following can also be confusing.

+---+ +---+
| a | | b |
+---+ +---+
      +---+
      | c |
      +---+
 
a: south -> definitely c
c: north -> now a might be quite confusing

But I am sure that some people would expect to end up in the same
window if they move north and south.  Maybe we should implement some
remember-the-last-window-in-the-direction-func-flag. :)

I would expect a: east -> c, but that's beacuse I have used this patch
quite a lot myself. :)

Yep.  It is hard to devide where to make the limit.  If we move b
upwards, when would it be more logical to jump in c instead of b?  And
always a malicious user can produce a weird window configuration in
which the DirectionFunc does not work "correctly". :)

Maybe we could implement a few (maybe 2 or 3) user configurable
coefficients in then score function, because no score function can be
logical to all of us.  The 3 coefficient could be for
- angle
- pythagoran distance
- distance in the given direction

I'm refering to the lists you generally send under the subject line
of "Status".  The things remaining to be done, and I suggested time line.

Just add yourself, Steve has a really good list of contributors, I hope

I don't see any  risk.  I think  we  will get some  valuable debugging
done.  I'd like the web docs done, but I think  the bug tracker should
be on the nice to have, but not mandatory list.  At this point we have
a number of people with update access, who  know the code better every
day. I think handling bugs should be no problem.

Since late next week was the time frame I had in mind, we agree.

Aye, I'm alive, but only barely ;-)

I'm much too swamped with work & travel to do anything at all before the
new year.  Someone else will have to do the autoconfing stuff, at least
for now.

Its not always easy to update the users config file.  There are reads,
and pipereads, and commands  coming in thru M4 and  CPP.  Better to do
our best to keep the command syntax compatible.

I take it you favor :

Style [title="Fvwm*" resource="Fvwm*"]

over

Style -title "Fvwm*" -resource "Fvwm*"

I do too.

Sure, go ahead.  The DirectionFunc is so small that it does not matter
even if I had to modify a few things manually.

No problem, I am quite pleased to do that.  I think the most important
thing is to make the score function as configurable as possible to
satisfy all users.

However, my biggest worry is the condition flag system of Circulate
which I modified.  I must admit that I do not know that system too
well, because I have not used those functions myself.

Hmm, the part 'satisfy all users' is good, but I don't think we need
a configurable scoring function. I can't imagine anyone is willing
to experiment with such parameters if there is a reasonable default.

Don't worry about that before problems occur. Most of it was
cut-and-paste and I think the bugs therein have been there before.

If you think so it's allright by me. Let's go ahead.

I don't really worry that we can't handle the bugs but that some
may get lost. My inbox holds about 10 to 20 bug reports already
and try as I might I can't remember the status of some of them.
Anyway, it's not necessarily a showstopper.

Well, I had 2.1.2 in mind for the direction patch only (and there's
a lot of new stuff in since 2.1.1).

No, the segfault came a lot further down; see my next message.  I don't
think it's related to this issue.  I'm suggesting the test be changed to
not use cat, because if you use it then the test hangs and never
completes, waiting for input.

  dv> Unfortunately I have no idea what we can do to prevent the

Doubtful, since it's perfectly legitimate to use cat outside of an
interactive environment--I think it more likely your version of popen()
behaves differently than mine--maybe closes stdin of the subprocess.
Either way I'm not suggesting that we (right now) try to fix the
hang--as you say, how to do that isn't clear.

I'm just saying we shouldn't put that into the test since it _does_ hang
on some systems.

One idea would be to close stdin to the subprocess... but I'm not sure
if that would be a good idea, and also it would mean we'd have to write
our own fork/exec function instead of relying on popen().

I must have missed this one.  When did syntax become valid?

As for a processor.
There is a couple of problems
1. I'm assuming you want the RCVersion to be in the rc file itself, well
that could create some problems for older files where it doesn't exist, so
you'll need to figure out if the file is an old fvwm2 or an old fvwm1 file
I suppose.

2. I'm not sure would this be something that is run at each start up or is
it run once when you switch versions?
	-- if its everytime that could lead to problems if lines don't
parse quite right
	-- if its once then maybe we start doing some preprocssing on all
files,  if we ever get FvwmPreproc (M4 and CPP combined) we could tag
sections that are version specific 
		if (VERSION == fvwmxxx) this
		else that  -- which is what I do in my rc with M4 right
now.

It is not valid  yet.  I recently proposed that  the style matching be
enhanced along these lines.  Ie. be able to  say what exactly you want
to  match on, instead   of matching on everything   and hoping for the
best.

I think we are close to settling on the command syntax.

Unfortunately you don't get much information from this output other
than it fvwm has passed these commands before it cordumped. Although
I tried to test every command with invalid parameters not all of them
produce a message. I'd try a binary search to find the coredumping
command.

That's ok. It is more important that we get a valid purify log and
can address other problems later. However, please don't remove the
lines but comment them out and write a short description into the
file why they were taken out (there are other places where I did this).

No, definitely not. I have still the vague idea that fvwm should
never hang or coredump regardless of what it is told to do.

Of course.  Actually, thinking a bit more, I think it should be
something like:

#FvwmRCVersion	2.0.0

(so previous versions of fvwm2 would ignore it as a comment)

Users can then add the lines to their RC files to allow newer version
of fvwm2 to process them correctly without modification.

Every time.

> parse quite right

Let's look at some things that COULD change:

1.  Adding a new "Keyword" into an RC file

    Older RC files will not have the keyword, so the helper program
    can simply ignore this situation.  However, it is possible that
    a user has a user-defined function with the same name.  The easy
    solution here is to have the helper program notice the "mis-used"
    keyword, and modify it to some other name, caching the name, and
    replacing the new name wherever the old function name is found.

2.  Deleting a "Keyword" from an RC file

    The helper program only needs to modify such keywords to NOP's.

3.  Changing a Keyword's syntax.

    Example:

	Old:	Style "Fvwm*" HandleWidth 0
	New:	Style [title="Fvwm*" resource="Fvwm*"] HandleWidth 0

    In this example, it is easy to represent the new syntax from the
    old format to the new format using a helper program.  Fvwm's
    parser only needs to process the new format.

Remember, the conversion is being done by a "helper program" and not
by fvwm itself.  The conversion programs should be conservative... if
they aren't perfect, the user is still able to modify the RC file to
the correct format.  The idea is to give the user "something that
works."

* * *

Finally.... the FvwmSetVer "helper program" -- while being useful -- is
NOT REALLY NECESSARY!!!

If fvwm were only to parse the FvwmRCVersion string and notice that it
is missing (probably an old configuration file), or not the expected
value, it can put up a warning message indicating that the RC file may
be out of date, and even give the user the option of continuing to
parse the file (all bets off), or to stop parsing immediately (giving
some minimal functionality).

Simply attempting to read an out-dated RC file and causing all sorts
of havoc and unexpected consequences causes a lot of confusion on the
user's end.

Another useful feature of this... I have seen some .fvwm2rc files
passed around on this and the main FVWM mailing list, as well as on
some web sites.  Having a version number in the RC file documents which
version of fvwm that it was written for.

Actually, I think such a feature should have been in fvwm ever since
the big RC file format change that lead to the first version 2.x
release.

Just as a thought... I was thinking last night that there is an
abundance of very nice, well thought-out, attractive "schemes" for a
Macintosh program called "Kaleidoscope". It would be terrific if
we could add support to fvwm2 to transparently "use" (some parts of)
a "Kaleidoscope Scheme" file. Take a look at some of the designs at:

 http://kaleidoscope.net/schemes/

While I realize a lot of Kaleidoscope deals with changing the "widgets"
(checkboxes, buttons, scroll bars, etc. which we can't "override" in
fvwm2 [bummer]), it also deals with color selection, title bar styles,
title bar button shape, etc.

The default Macintosh title bar has three buttons (for those that
don't know). From left to right, they are "close", "maximize" and
"window shade".

This would be an easy way for people to customize FVWM's "apperance"
if we could take advantage of existing "designs" like the hundreds
of thousands of Kaleidoscope schemes. Some of the schemes get pretty
far-out, and give "Enlightenment" a run for its money (see the "New
Schemes" section in the above link, and scroll down to the "Mackintosh",
"XLR Power" and "IZA Blue Metal" schemes, for example...)

Being an avid Mac user/programmer, I can offer assistance to decoding
the Kaleidoscope themes, etc. if anybody thinks looking in to this
functionality would be worthwhile. Personally, I think it would be an
awesome extension to fvwm2...

It appears that I can now make a package.  At least "make dist"
creates a tar.gz file that I can unpack and looks complete.

Let me know when you want to create one, and where I should put it.

Uh, please never Never NEVER just use "make dist".  Always always use
"make distcheck". 

Why?  Because "distcheck" does an unpack & build of the distribution, and
will catch errors that you won't catch "by eye". 

This is documented in DEVELOPERS, by the way.  Please read it for some 
more explanations, but the basic recipe is:

Steps: 1. make sure you have XPM and a C++ compiler
       2. configure with the flag --enable-extras
       3. make
       4. make distcheck
       5. ensure that you see the message 
          "fvwm-x.y.z.tar.gz ready for distribution"
          before uploading the tar file somewhere

One thing I've learned the hard way: 

        You have to configure with ALL THE OPTIONAL SUBDIRECTORIES
        in order to build a distribution!

In other words, you need Xpm, and a C++ compiler, AND you have to
configure using the flag --enable-extras. 

Happy dist'ing,

Steve R

I think I got this far too (don't remember exactly), but
make distcheck failed. Have you tested that?

You mean I have to read documentation, follow all the steps and check
my work also?  Sounds like work.

OK, OK, I've got some C++ problem, but I'll see if I can't fix it.

I know you're kidding, but note that make distcheck actually is _less_
work.  It will:

 1) Create the tar file
 2) Unpack the tar file
 3) Run configure
 4) Run make
 5) Run make check (that doesn't do anything for us, but...)

and let you know if it worked or failed.  All automatically.  Very
nice.

I've had another think about this and a look through the ICCCM seems to
suggest that compliant programmes should not make XMove/ResizeWindow
calls, they should use ConfigureWindow instead. A look at the man page
for XMove/ResizeWindow says that for reparented windows the call will be
translated to a ConfigureRequest event so it may well be perfectly
reasonable to use XMove/ResizeWindow given that the window manager will
not be able to tell the difference between XMove and XConfigure. The
ICCCM is pretty clear that gravity must be respected when a window is
initially created and mapped but then it goes on to say that the window
manager is free to override the gravity later.  I'd say that fvwm
shouldn't be touched and clients should not assume that their gravity
can be used to get their position right if they resize themselves.  It
looks like the ICCCM doesn't specify how windows should resize
themselves.

> Should I commit the patch now or are you unsure about that?

Commit it, plus the following please:

FvwmGoodStuff.c: off by one due to borderwidth (not tested)
FvwmBanner.c: not centred by one and won't display a pixmap == screen
size
FvwmIconBox.c: got it right but I cleaned it up to prevent confusion

Argh!      After the  patch   is applied,   I'll   take  the  parts of
FvwmIdent-de.c that are  supposed to be  in  FvwmIdent.c and put  them
there and remove the  2 extra files.   (Could have sworn this was done
long ago.)

Any window, not just a specific module. Perhaps only the shadow
is off-screen? Try a low border width.

OK, will be in tomorrow.

	Have any of you seen keystone?  It's another free
trouble-tracking/project-tracking system.  It is mysql/php based... and
works very well... and is relatively easy to set up.  It is web and email
based.  

	You can find it at:  http://www.stonekeep.com/keystone.php3

There is an online version you can try under the support & docs section,
or you can go directly to:

	http://www.stonekeep.com/ksonline/visitor.php3

I seriously suggest that you check out the online version.  It is
very impressive.  

Jay

[please cc: me, since i'm not on the -workers list]

I'm running FreeBSD:

FreeBSD jabberwock 3.0-CURRENT FreeBSD 3.0-CURRENT #0:

#1
==
When I try to compile 2.1.1, the compile fails because <search.h> is
not found. FreeBSD doesn't have search.h. The function bsearch()
(which is what fvwm seems to want) is in <stdlib.h>.

The <search.h> includes are found in 2 files:

[vshah@jabberwock] ~/Apps/fvwm-2.1.1> find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs grep -i "include.*<search\.h>"
./libs/ModParse.h:#include <search.h>
./modules/FvwmEvent/Parse.h:#include <search.h>

I was wondering if that could be somehow made part of the configure
script, or could be #ifdef'ed out based on the OS.

#2
==

In extras/FvwmConsole/FvwmConsole.h

<sys/types.h> needs to be included before <sys/select.h>


#3
==

I also get a bunch of these warnings in FvwmScript:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../../libs  -I/usr/X11R6/include    -g -O2 -c FvwmScript.c
In file included from types.h:12,
                 from FvwmScript.c:7:
/usr/include/malloc.h:2: warning: #warning "this file includes <malloc.h> which is deprecated, use <stdlib.h> instead"


This problem is taken care of in other files in fvwm in two different
ways:

In ./modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.c

#if !defined(__bsdi__) && !defined(__FreeBSD__)
#include <malloc.h>
#endif


In ./modules/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan.h :

#ifdef MALLOC_H
#include <malloc.h>
#endif

The second way looks cleaner, but both work.

could someone modify extras/FvwmScript/types.h so that the malloc.h
include is conditonally compiled. 


Thanks

I had not, but I did use PTS a bit; eventually we switched to REQ but that

I'll take a look and how difficult this is to get going.

Keystone is _not_ free.  It's available for no charge for up to 9
people (in a week).  10 or more, and you need a commercial license.

Well, maybe the Visible flag should be made transparent to the X
states, VisibilityUnobscured, VisibilityPartiallyObscured, and
VisibilityFullyObscured. That way you get to choose what kind of
visibility you're talking about.

Or perhaps VISIBLE could be false for CompletelyObscured and true for
PartiallyObscured or Unobscured? Then add a different flag for ISONTOP
or somesuch?

I was also digging around with the KeepOnTop() behavior, investigating
the long-standing bug which causes transients of StaysOnTop windows to
fall beneath their parents... Anyway, the RAISED flag seems to be
pretty critical for making sure StaysOnTop works properly, so taking
its flag back might not be a good idea...

   I was thinking about a very similar thing.  How about someone work out
a 'theme' module... Something that could read different types of themes...
say from windowmaker, kaleidoscope, etc... and configure you 
accordingly.  It could support our own 'native' format, of course, but it
would lend nicely to our Favorite/Flexible virtual window manager to be
able to use other systems themes.  It shouldn't be too difficult to
convert 'themes' to fvwm configuration commands... 

Anyone else think this is a good Idea?  I'd be willing to work on it...

(though I can tell you that I do have alot on my plate so anyone 
 interested in working on it too is more than welcome... )

Thoughts?

This is one of my back-burner projects for scwm.  I have code written (and
checked into the scwm cvs server, in a not-quite-working state) to read
MacBinary, AppleSingle and AppleDouble files, to find the resource fork, and
to fetch resource data by type and ID.

I have written, but not checked in, code to convert some of the icons (the
ics#, ics4, ics8, ICN#, icl4, icl8) to xpm format.

There's still a lot of work to do, but this might be a helpful place to
start.  The code is GPL, with an exception that allows its use in other
twm-derived WMs.


The big 'infrastructure' requirement left is to be able to read StuffIt Deluxe 
files.  Has anybody seen ANY information about the compression technique, or
have the time & expertise to reverse engineer it?

It would take a lot of hacking for fvwm to be able to actually look
like the window managers and other GUIs you mention. Anything
requiring shaped windows, widely different borders, etc, would require
a lot of changes to fvwm. This is made harder by the fact that the
current fvwm2 decoration code is a mess (and no, this is not meant to
be hostile, we haven't cleaned it up that much in scwm yet either,
though we have made a few things more flexible).

Understandable.  I'm not saying lets hack the decoration code...  I just
would like to see a 'themes' thing for Fvwm.  Some type of config that is
relatively simple to produce that can be used for decoration information.
That's why I suggested a themes module.  It could transparently do the
conversion of the 'theme' file to fvwm configure commands.  If it could
try to interpret other themes, so much the better.  Either way, whether we
build it for only it's native format or if it can read others (and use at
least some of the decorations) I am willing to work on it.

	More ideas to the TODO list (this should be easy enough, maybe 
even I make it before starting the big change to MenuStyle).
	What about an option to render an Icon (a MiniIcon should not be 
necessary) by rendering first a background icon, for example BackIcon 
template_3d.xpm, and then rendering the icon specify by Icon. It would be
a very nice feature, and certainly very usefull.
	Another nice feature, not so easy as the first should be 
something I would call MagneticIcons <force> , with this command you 
could specify a "magnetic" force between icons, so when you move an icon 
near another it will be attracted and put side by side, we could use a 
rectangular attraction pattern, and the <force> parameter should specify 
how far one icon get attracted by others.

	Well, as you can see my brain is going faster than my fingers 
(and that isn't usual in my case :)

I'll have a look at this, and I'll have a go at the handling of shaped
windows too: Fvwm will put a border round a shaped window and this
causes odd things with geometry and SnapAttraction.

I think the RAISED flag once did the correct thing, but then was
patched to get KeepOnTop working. The bug you mention isn't easily
fixed. The problem is that you can not tell a StaysOnTop window to
raise above all non-StaysOnTop windows but not above other
StayOnTop's.

I tried with a big border size. Its definitely only a few pixels
(one or two), regardless of how thick the border is.

I see it clear as day now:

The window is destroyed *twice*. The first call to Destroy
kills it, but before the tmp_win is deleted from the list
of windows Destroy() is called again (probably triggered
by an event in events.c). *crash*

Could someone describe how exactly fvwm2 is multitasked
or multithreaded? There must be a kind of locking mechanism
on the window list to prevent such bugs.

Both should be fixed, but please check the SetMenuStyle coredump
again if there are still problems.

Whatever i specify as direction for a panel in FvwmButtons the 
panel still pops up at the same place.
It is always in relation to the upper left corner of the orriginal button.

I don't understand what you mean with 'rendering'. Could you explain
this again for complete cretins?

That's SnapAttraction for Icons. Have you tried this? It's
in the CVS tree for a few days now. Works only for windows
at the moment but may not be too hard to patch for icons
too.

To get the test running you can comment the Close/Delete/Destroy

OK, I've completed a make distcheck and put the result in

/pub/incoming/fvwm/de-2.1.2.tar.gz

Why the funny name?  Seemed to be something in the way.  The transcript
is below.

I had a problem with "make distcheck" with tar vs. gtar.
The only way I could get the make to work is:

gnumake TAR=gtar distcheck

I think somethings wrong, some of the Makefiles call for gtar and
some call for tar.

It's been moved and named appropriately.  I don't know what the problem
with the zero-length file was.

Thanks, Dan. But remember to tag the sources before making
the distribution. Otherwise the sources might change while
you 'make distcheck' and the tree cannot be tagged correctly
anymore. I'll write this into the DEVELOPERS file.

Disposing of  old  mail,   I  see  that  the  next   step is  to  edit
configure.in and update the version.

Perhaps you will add that to the DEVELOPERS file?

You can update configure.in if you want to.

I thought we had   a clear policy  on this,  but  my memory failed  me
again.    You  may have  noticed  a  new  more   ChangeLogs than Steve
proposed:

machine> find . -name ChangeLog
./ChangeLog
./docs/ChangeLog
./extras/ChangeLog
./icons/ChangeLog
./modules/ChangeLog
./modules/FvwmAnimate/ChangeLog
./modules/FvwmEvent/ChangeLog
./modules/FvwmIdent/ChangeLog


I'm afraid they are my  doing.  I prefer  it, but if there are  strong
objections,  I'll   back this  stuff  out.   The   modules really  are
independent, I   think the  ChangeLogs  should be  inside the  modules
directory.

My, isn't the tree getting a bit overcrowded with ChangeLog's?
I don't have any feelings about that, but if there are files for
individual modules/extras, there should be one for every single
module. The file one level higher records only add/remove/rename
of a module.

The module/extra ChangeLog's have to be cleaned up then (i.e.
move entries to the correct ChangeLog).

Sounds like SnapAttraction for Icons.  The underlying snap grid concept could
be applied to both classic SnapAttraction and that for Icons.
(I actually played with the underlying grid thing when I did SnapAttraction, 
but wasnt satisfied with the initial results due mainly to my personal usage 
patterns.  Therefore, I didnt really test it and therefore didnt submit the 
patch.  If there is interest I can submit the patch.)

Is  this snapping icons  to each  other, or the  icongrid?  No  answer
required, I'll check the patch too.

I wasn't clear about  the first part of  German's proposal either, but
my guess is he is referring to "clipping" the icon to a specific size.
Any attempt to forcing things into  the grid should probably be paired
with clipping.

The current  logic  has a grid,  but  without clipping, you  still get
uneven gaps between the icons.

My guess is that just the clipping would be  sufficient, why would you
start moving icons around, if you had them all  lined up neatly in the
first place?

Most of the  window  manager screenshots  I  see with neatly  lined up
icons, are not  using shaped icons.  I   don't believe I've  ever seen
neatly lined up shaped icons.

The patch  that was pending,  was  for configurable shadow  and hilite
colors.    Since I am  now completely   satisfied  with the calculated
shadows and hilites, I   suggest we move  that  patch from  pending to
rejected.

You know, I haven't notified any of the submitters of rejection of the
patch.  Never seen it done in the past  either.  I think thats for the
best.  Perhaps when  we have Jitterbug installed,  we can follow  thru
with these things in a more consistent way.

The latest distribution:

-rw-rw-r--  dane  1003926 Nov 20 10:13 fvwm-2.1.2.tar.gz
                  ^^^^^^^

We are comfortably within the 1.4 meg sweet spot.


Still  going thru old  mail.   Got as far   as  the proposal that  all
modules have their own ChangeLog.  Guess I wasn't dreaming after all.

Yes :).

You could snap either to other windows (or soon Icons too), the grid, or both.
Icon functionality is not in the patch.  Currently, it just does windows, but
obviously I need to do Icons now too.

Choosing Clipping or overlapping behavior could be an option, with clipping as 
the likely default.

Not sure what you mean here; AFAIK X apps _aren't_ multithreaded.  The
event loop is "run to completion" and ensures that one event completes
before the next one is invoked.  Isn't it?  I'm no X expert, that's for
damn sure.

If you mean that, _within_ an X event handling sequence, the window is
destroyed twice?  If that's the case, IMO it's just a coding error.

For example, perhaps the window should be removed from the list _first_,
before any other processing to destroy it is done?  Then if subsequent
processing tries to destroy a window that isn't found in the list, it
can just be ignored.  Or something.

I'll re-run the test with the latest code and let you know.  I'll remove
all the old objects and rebuild from scratch; maybe the Purify log will
be less "corrupted" this time.

"No, definitely not" to which part :)?

Anyway, certainly fvwm should _never_ dump core, but I don't see any
possible way to avoid hangs if the user does something silly.

The already-provided example with cat is one.  Another is something like:

    piperead "sleep 500000"

How can you protect against this?  The only way I can see is to install
some sort of timer signal that goes off after some amount of time, and
wakes up fvwm from the read(2) so it can kill the pipe or something.
That's a _LOT_ of complexity to avoid luser-stupidity :)

Wasn't there talk about making AutoHide a module by itself (ie. sorta in
the same vein that FvwmAuto (FvwmAutoRaise really :-) is) ?

Alas, it would also seem as a great idea to make part of style flags; its a
pretty useful idea.

  Style "FvwmButtons"	NoTitle, AutoHide
  Style "xterm"		AutoHide

Neither am I. I'm completely ignorant of X.

Perhaps like this:

 1) Destroy called from a command from the config file
 2) 'Window destroyed' event arrives
 3) event code calls Destroy *again*

Commands invoked from the config file are not handled by the
event loop. Do we actually need to handle all events during startup?
Another idea is to change the command run in the xterm windows in
purify.fvwm2rc. I think if you use a shell instead of sleep this
coredump might not happen anymore.

Might work. Let's try it.

If you're fast I can take the log home and work on it
during the weekend (you have 30 minutes :) )

Here is how X likes to handle events.
You create your app 
You register to listen for events 
You start the main event loop

Now any events that happen be tween step 2 and step 3 get cued because you
told the xserver you wanted them.  So when you start your loop you get
values off the queue.  There is a event flush command you can call just
before you start the event loop which will probablly handle getting rid of
most events.  But you probably will find we want most of the events so
flushing isn't that good of an idea

This is the correct way to handle it.

I can reproduce this (if that hels you) but didn't have time to
look after this. I'd start writing debug code into the resize
functions.

I agree the modules are independent, and I don't have strong feelings
about it at all, but left up to me I think I'd have just three:

  ./ChangeLog
  ./modules/ChangeLog
  ./extras/ChangeLog

Reason?  I just don't think the majority of the modules we have are
significant enough to warrant a whole changelog to themselves.  In other
words, the amount of changes made to them won't justify it (is my
feeling).

If there were just one ChangeLog for modules, I could look at that one
file and see the changes for all the standard modules.  It's easy enough
to search for entries relating to the module I'm interested in.

As I said, I don't care much one way or t'other, that's just my $0.005.

Latest log.  Looks a lot cleaner; it seems to me that somehow fvwm is
getting a pointer to what it _thinks_ is an FvwmWindow, but actually is
something completely different; I think the "badness" starts at the ABR
around line 615 in the log.  Note it says:

  * Address 0x10898c is 77 bytes past end of a malloc'd block at 0x1088d8 of 104 bytes.

Now, an FvwmWindow structure is over 500 bytes long, so that t is
definitely not pointing to one of those if the allocated block is only
104 bytes.

Not sure how this could happen, really, but there you go.

Yes, but I think that X doesn't interrupt your process.  X events aren't
like signals, they're like data on a filedescriptor (actually, they
usually _are_ data on a filedescriptor :).  Arriving X events, like
arriving data, are queued until you select() or whatever, then read(2)
them off (in this case, the X libraries do that for you).

So, X events should never _interrupt_, asynchronously, handling of
previous events.  That's how I understand it, anyway.

We can certainly change the code, but based on my reading of the latest
Purify logs, I just don't think this is the problem.  As I mentioned in
my post, it seems to me like fvwm thinks that something is a pointer to
an FvwmWindow structure when in fact it's nothing of the sort.

The fact that the pointer is allocated from within:

  * This block was allocated from:
        malloc         [rtlib.o]
        _XEnq          [libX11.so.4.30]
        _XReply        [libX11.so.4.30]
        XGetWindowProperty [libX11.so.4.30]
        XGetTextProperty [libX11.so.4.30]
        XGetWMName     [libX11.so.4.30]
        AddWindow      [add_window.c:635]
        HandleMapRequestKeepRaised [events.c:704]
        CaptureAllWindows [fvwm.c:612]
        Recapture      [builtins.c:4034]

leads me to believe it's really a WM_NAME property pointer--unless
Purify is _really_ confused.  One interesting thing is that the code in
HandleMapRequestKeepRaised() is:

  /* If the window has never been mapped before ... */
  if(!Tmp_win)
    {
      /* Add decorations. */
      Tmp_win = AddWindow(Event.xany.window);
      if (Tmp_win == NULL)
	return;
    }

One could easily imagine that this code is not executed all that often (?)

Hi,

first of all, I'd like to say that I am very glad that the
development of fvwm now obviously is being continued - thank you
all!

I just tried fvwm 2.1.1 from the "testing" directory and found,
that the StartsOnDesk-Flag doesn't work anymore. I then tried the
current CVS-tree where this is mostly fixed, except for one
little bug: a desktop number of "-1" (perfectly legal according
to the documentation - and my favorite desk for a couple of
windows ;-) is ignored.

In add_window.c, PlaceWindow(..) is called with the specified desk
number + 1. In placement.c:441:

      else if ((tflag & STARTSONDESK_FLAG) && Desk && HonorStartsOnPage)

evaluates to false and the StartsOnDesk flag is ignored. Simplest
fix: just delete the "&& Desk" from that line - at least it looks
to me like it is superfluous.

Regards,
              Peter

http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html

It has some really cool tools to let you look thru
a) cvs logs
b) cvs diffs
c) cvs blame (which author changed which line)
d) cross-referenced source code
e) lots of cvs dated/author/file queries
f) links to bugzilla  -

For instance, this is the cvs log for a main Makefile.

http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bonsai/cvslog.cgi?file=mozilla/htmlparser/src/Makefile&rev=&root=/cvsroot

note the diff, lxr, directory browse and blame links.

browse:
http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bonsai/rview.cgi?dir=mozilla%2F&rev=&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot

blame:
http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bonsai/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/htmlparser/src/Makefile&rev=&root=/cvsroot

Bugzilla
http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bugzilla/query.cgi
example:
http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=REOPENED&assigned_to=&reporter=&changedin=&product=Mozilla&short_desc=&short_desc_type=substr&long_desc=&long_desc_type=substr&cmdtype=doit&newqueryname=&order=%22Importance%22&form_name=query

ok, enuf evangalizing, back to your regularly scheduled work

	Sorry; when I added the StartsOnPage style, I broke the special
case of desk number -1 (-2 would have worked). I'll work on a fix over
the weekend.

	Nope. Unfortunately, it's a good deal more complicated than that,
and this change would really break StartsOnPage.

	Under the new handling, the style structure carries the desk number
and the page x,y numbers as actual + 1, and a zero value (or, in your case,
-1 + 1) means "don't care". I'll have to change several spots in the code to
account for this case.

	It just never occurred to me that anyone would be using negative
desktop numbers, and I had to reserve some value for the "don't care" case.
I'll fix it. Thanks for catching this *now*, instead of after the formal
release went out.

	But now you've got my curiosity up. Why does -1 seem such a neat
desktop to use? It has no special meaning to X, nor does it to FVWM (with
this, er,  temporary exception).

	I don't think this would buy us much (too bad Destroy doesn't
return a value, so the caller could check whether he made a boo-boo).
True, we could prevent a segfault by checking the list for a match on
Tmp_win (_first_, before referencing the Tmp_win pointer), but I think
this might just mask a bug that would be better squashed.

	I agree. As I said yesterday, I think somebody is simply passing
an uninitialized but non-null local variable (i.e., dirty memory on the
stack) as an FvwmWindow pointer. The trick is tracing back to whodunnit.

	Sorry I haven't had time to look into this more; it looks like it
could be quite an entertaining romp. Maybe this weekend, after I fix
StartsOnPage once more (naaahh, you'll probably have found it by then!)

Yeah, it's an automake oddity.  What you did is the best way to handle
this for now.  I think automake should be fixed, and I've raised the issue
on the automake mailing list. 

The deal is: automake was envisaged for a "single maintainer" to use.  As
such, it hardcodes the value of TAR in the _maintainer_ makefiles.  By
checking in the Makefile.in files to CVS, we broke this single-maintainer
model.  I chose to do this, so as NOT to force every sundry developer to
have all the auto tools lying around. 

> some of the Makefiles call for gtar and some call for tar. 

The makefiles inherit the TAR setting from the Makefile.in's, which means
it is set by whoever last checked in the Makefile.in.

Hi,

and thanks for that quick fix. Btw, I am not sure what a page
number of -1 would mean, but a desktop number of "-1" is really
pretty handy: if no desktop number is specified, the default is
"0". I have key bindings to "scroll" forward/backward one desktop,
and with that, "-1" is the immediate predecessor of the default
desktop...

regards,
            Peter

	It would actually make a "hidden" window. StartsOnPage 0 -1 0,
for example, would place the window one page to the left of the page
in the upper left hand corner of the virtual desktop (as viewed by
the Pager). The window would not be visible, and would not show up in
the Pager. You could only get to it by selecting it from the window
list. Perfectly legal, but probably confusing to most users. I hadn't
really thought about this, but now I'll have to see if I can think of
a good use for it.  :-)

	Well, this is true at startup...otherwise, the default is the
current desk. Maybe we should think of 0 as the "home desk".

	This suggests a new wrinkle on the window placement issue,
though. A new style specification of StartsOnRelativePage might be
useful, where the numbers are interpreted relative to the current
desk/page position.

	[Sigh.] Maybe after the Great Style Flag Rewrite (TM)....

I added a new feature to Fvwm2.0.46/extras/FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c,
whereby keeping the cursor on a button in taskbar raises the window,
if tip is open (should be independent ideally). See diff -u below.

BTW, I don't know X so well, but I am looking at the taskbar
taking keyboard input. Let me know if you have any suggestions,
eg. left / Right arrow in TaskBar can move between windows, pressing
't' starts 'top', (configurable = button+key+action).

I also am thinking of adding a '*FvwmTaskBarQuickFocus' option,
that will do the above, without waiting for the tip.

- Mohsin.

In ~/.fvwm2rc turn on the option by:
*FvwmTaskBarAutoFocus
*FvwmTaskBarShowTips

	This is strange. I can't duplicate this on my Linux system
(using a CVS build from Friday evening).

	I tried putting a little debugging code at the entry to Destroy,
which checks whether the Tmp_win pointer matches anything in the window
chain, and puts out a debugging message if not. Then I ran the Purify
script. No luck. The script runs to completion, no segfault, and no
bogus window pointers caught.

	I'm really stumped at this point.

	I'm beginning to wonder whether Purify *is* doing something
strange. Can you run the script without a segfault in a non-Purify
environment?

Ok, you are right.  I just always would want to have all as
configurable as possible. :)

I played a little with the scoring function and ended up to the
following: 

score = 1024 * offset / distance + 2 * distance + 2 * offset;

It does not penalty angle so much as the previous function.

I also thought the feature that the function would remember the window
we came from.  However, I think it would be too confusing, if the
target window would depend on the last window.

Then I also found an annoying feature in the Focus function.  If I try
to focus to a window A on other page and the mouse pointer lands on
other window B, the focus goes to B instead of A.  I really do not
want to raise the target window and moving the mouse pointer does not
help if the window is under other windows.

I'm not quite sure what you mean. You say 'display', but :0.0 and
:0.1 are different *screens* on a single display. Don't know if
fvwm deals with more than one screen at all (can somebody help me
out here?). I have not the slightest idea how to connect more than
one screen to an X server and how to switch between them. But perhaps
you are talking about desks? Or pages (your comment about mouse
movement suggests this)?

 - Display: every display has it's own X server and fvwm2 running.
            Therefore you cannot 'switch' fvwm2 between them.

 - Screen: don't know. If that is what you have please tell me how
           I can connect/switch multiple screens to my X server
           (XFree86).

 - Desk: yes, the focus isn't returned to the original window that had
         the focus when you first switched desks. This has nothing to do
         with the pager (FvwmPager I assume) however. And this has not
         changed between 2.0.46 and 2.1.x. You can't switch desks with
         mouse movement.

 - Page: nothing strange with the focus here. It works like it should
         as it did in 2.0.46. This isn't related to FvwmPager either.
         The focus is never switched when you change pages. Only if
         the pointer happens upon another window that window may
         receive the focus. Works as intended.

Please clarify what you did (if you don't know exactly what 'desk,
'page', 'screen' (not the same as an X screen like :0.0 and :0.1)
and 'virtual desktop' mean, please have a look at the fvwm2 manpage.
The terms are explained in detail there.

Thanks

Recently I paged through a document called speedup-x-faq.txt
taht came with my Linuxand contains the following passage
(referring to memory usage):

Suggestions for your consideration:

  I used to recommend fvwm here, but the 2.x man page for fvwm
  now says: "Although it was redesigned to minimize memory consumption,
  it is now as bloated as any other window-manager. Users searching for
  a low-memory consumption window-manager are advised to look elsewhere,
  possibly to an earlier version of fvwm."
                [thanks to: Ian Thurlbeck (ian@stams.strath.ac.uk) ]

I don't believe anything like this has ever been in the manpage.
Comments?

Bye

That's why I released the script anyway. I don't get a coredump
on my Linux too.

	Well, I'll be out of the net for a while, my motherboard died 
last friday, I've already sent it to repair, but until next friday (or 
even later :( I'll have no computer, if you don't hear from me again, 
maybe I could not stand the thing...

	I've read some of the email from a friend's account, and I think 
you've forgot about the first thing I propose in my last "ideas mail", 
the thing about the "background icon rendering", as I've said to Dominik 
my english is worse than I thought, what I was trying to say is to draw a 
background (for example a WindowMaker tile) and then draw another icon 
(the normal icon, specified with Icon ... ) above it; of course it should 
clip the fore icon over the back icon. We could also specify come kind of 
geometry in the Icon directive, something like 

	Style "*"	BackIcon Tile00.xpm, Icon x11.xpm:+10+10

If no geometry is specify the icon should be drawn centered in the 
background icon, I wouldn't be able to look at it until I get my 
motherboard repaired, so if anybody wants to start it... ;-)

	Bye, I'll be away (hope not for too much time)

Whatever the bug may be, I have done this change. If this prevents the
coredump on your system and you want to further investigate you have to
move about 10 lines from the beginning of the Destroy function back to it's
old position (there were other changes in the file, so just using an old
copy might not work).

Before anyone asks: I didn't touch the Makefile.in files. I assume
they were changed automatically during the last build.

I think I cleaned up everything except:

 - the coredump
 - the ABR with DoGetNextToken. Try as I might, I can't see anything
   that might be causing the ABR. I'm beginning to suspect your
   compiler is broken (?) I checked read.c, Parse.c, SetGlobalOpts
   etc. but found nothing. Since I don't have purify someone else
   should investigate that. It seems to be a whole class of violations
   not necessarily related to DoGetNextToken. They all seem to cause
   the ABR 69 or 87 bytes behind __new_handler.

Could you try to get fvwm running by commenting the Close/Delete/Destroy
lines? I can't do much about the coredump without purify, but if you
have some output with memory leaks I can at least do something.

Hm, do you really think someone would use that? I can't imagine
why.

I can only recommend using this. Works pretty well, is trivial to
configure and perfectly safe (you are asked if there are whitespace
that would be removed).

It certainly was in the  man page.  Whoever  removed it has my thanks.
Fvwm2 may not be the least bloated window manager around, but I always
felt that statement in the man page went too far.

I still feel fvwm2 achieves a pretty good balance between features and
resource usage.

Hi Dominik,

my name is Giuseppe. I'm a user of Fvwm since 2.0.43 I think, and I'm very
happy to see the development on my favourite wm going fast and well again.
I'm not expert enough to contribute directly to the code, but I would like
to help notifying you of three problems I've found.

I'm working on a Digital Alpha and using gcc 2.7.2.3, and I'm using fvwm
2.1.3 from yesterday evening (22/11).

The first problem I've seen is related to SnapAttraction (a very nice
feature, I must say: I like to fill all the availabel space ... :-) )
Let's suppose I've two windows, A (on the left) and B (on the right).
If I move A towords B, SnapAttraction works ok. If I move B towards A,
then B ens up a little bit too close to A (1 pixel I would say).
The same problem is present with a upper/lower configuration: if I move
the lower window close to the upper one, again there is an overlap.
Maybe it's related with the computation of the window effective size ?
I'm using Style "*" BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5
if this can help.

The second problem is "Netscape related". I'm using:
Style "Netscape*"      SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 2 0 0
but this is not working for me: the window appears always on the current
page. Instead 
Style "Pine"           SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 4 0 0
works ok with :
Exec exec xterm +sb -title Pine -n Pine -e pine -d 0
Why ?

The third problem is more tricky, I think, because it's difficut to
reproduce and to describe: it just happens from time to time. When I
"refresh" a window, or just create it, sometimes it comes out with the
wrong size: the actual size is 10/20 pixels bigger, in both dimensions,
than the size I've requested.
If I insist in "refreshing"/creating this kind of windows, they became
bigger and bigger each time. If I resize one of them by hand, the problem
disappers, but not forever: it's just there, waiting to appear again ...
As I said, it's very difficult to describe: for "refresh", I mean for
example what Netscape does when you navigate from one site to another
(maybe "redrawing" is a better term ? I'm not an expert of X11 events...).
But it happens also when I create an xload window with a (definite) size.
It seems to me that some informations becomes corrupted, and my resizing
by hand just corrects them temporarly.

I've just "cvs-updated" my fvwm with the latest fixes: the problem is
still there. Unfortunately I have no ways of reproducing it (apart from,
maybe, makind a lot of "Restart") ... I wanted just to tell someone that
it is there, since I've not seen something like this on the fvwm-workers
list.
Thanks a lot for your pacience and ...

                                       ...  good work !

best regards,
Giuseppe

>I'm not quite sure what you mean. You say 'display', but :0.0 and
>:0.1 are different *screens* on a single display. Don't know if

i was using display in the sense of monitor/frame buffer/whatever.

how about this for clarification:

sun ultra 170E:
/dev/fb0 is a creator (24bit accel) :0.1
/dev/fb1 is a cgsix (8bit accel card) :0.0

i'm starting X with this line in /usr/dt/config/Xservers.  i'm using CDE
and have added fvwm to the menu of windowmanagers/env's to choose from.

:0   Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner -dev /dev/fb0 right -dev /dev/fb1 left

I end up with X running on both frame buffers. the login screen is on
the cgsix.  And i can move my mouse off the right edge of :0.0 and end
up on the left edge of :0.1.  it's a pretty normal multihead X setup.
You can get the same type of thing with 2 matrox boards under linux.

>fvwm deals with more than one screen at all (can somebody help me
>out here?). I have not the slightest idea how to connect more than

it forks off a second copy to run on the separate display. (see -s flag)

>one screen to an X server and how to switch between them. But perhaps
>you are talking about desks? Or pages (your comment about mouse
>movement suggests this)?

??  i'm not sure i follow you.  i'm not talking about desks, oversized
desktops, or anything of that ilk.

the basic problem is that fvwm does not seem to understand what to do
when the mouse is not anywhere on it's $DISPLAY.  

I don;t know X internals very well, but something like this would fix
the problem (i think):

when the mouse moves off a DISPLAY, drop all focus.
when the mouse returns to a DISPLAY, give focus back to the last window
that had focus.

I'd guess that you could do that by looking for stuff happening with the
root window.  or perhaps by putting a 0 width border around the root
window, and looking for events that indicate that the mouse is not on
DISPLAY anymore.  it does not seem like knowing which DISPLAY/fvwm has
the focus/mouse; since i can use cntl-<arrow> to move around within the
current desk.

or maybe when the 2nd copy of fvwm gets forks off, a pipe could be setup
between the two so they know what's happening?

i'd be happy to play with this more, or turn on prolific logging.

thanks

job

With broders of five I don't seem to be able to reproduce this, I even
used xmag and I don't see an overalp.

I have noticed this with winows with no borders and netscape, but then I
tend to discount netscape since its behavior tends to be a little
different than anything else

Duh, I don't have two graphics cards. Can't help you much with

Sorry, you insist on calling sth a display that is clearly called
a screen in X terminology if the numbers are correct, :0.0 and :0.1
are the same display but a different screen.

Anyway, anybody on the list that can duplicate this setup to verify
what is happening?

I've added all I could find to the NEWS file but didn't

How is the status here? Don't think the patch is in, but I had
the impression it's only a temporary fix.

I received an error message when trying to build fvwm-2.1.2.

Package:	fvwm-2.1.2.tar.gz       980 Kb    Fri Nov 20 15:48:00 1998
Environment:	Digital Unix T5.0 (prerelease) Alpha processor
		DEC C

Error:

cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../libs  -I/freeware/include    -O2 -c bindings.c
cc: Error: bindings.c, line 252: The function "ParseMouseEntry" has return type void, and so must not contain a return statement with an expression. (voidreturn)
  return ParseBindEntry(eventp, w, tmp_win, junk, tline, Module, 0);
--^

The relevant lines of code in bindings.c:

void ParseMouseEntry(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
                     unsigned long junk, char *tline,int* Module)
{
  return ParseBindEntry(eventp, w, tmp_win, junk, tline, Module, 0);
}


The simple fix is to remove the 'return ' keyword from this and the
other void functions (like the one following it).

I don't have CVS access, but the ChangeLog shows this entry for
bindings.c:

1998-11-11  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@hp.com>

	* fvwm/bindings.c (ParseKeyEntry): Speedup for Key binding parsing

The patch that comments out the handling of unmap notify events works
for me, I think you should commit it.

Don't remind me. :-) This is one of my biggest complaints with fvwm2. I
run an Ultra 170E with nearly the same configuration (Creator card
is :0.0, cgsix is :0.1 in my case; haven't tried the latest 2.1.2
release to see if there are problems with multiple heads; still running
2.0.46 here.) The fact that I have to fork two copies of fvwm2, two
FvwmButtons, two FvwmPagers, two FvwmIconMans, two FvwmAuto's, etc. is
really a bummer. `vtwm' (Virtual Tab Window Manager?) can happily
handle multi-headed X sessions without forking. If there is one thing I
*really* wish for in fvwm2 it is the the ability of the window manager
itself and all of the modules to handle multiple instantiations (i.e.,
multiple button bars, multiple pagers, etc.) _without_ having to fork
for each display. It seems like such a waste of precious resources... :-)

A bad one, it is probably a leftover from when file routines returned an
unsigned long on success or 0 on failure, in which case the test is valid,
it also still works, I guess, since NULL == 0, under most compilers. But
none the less someone should commint the change to !=NULL.

This is one of the niceties of the modules interface. You can limit bloat as
you see fit.

I'm not going to say the NEWS file is perfect, but with the last
batch of changes, I think it is release ready.

Absolutely.

I wonder, if   you disabled every  optional  feature at compile  time,
(XPMs, mini-icons,   window shading,  gradients,  shapes,  etc..)  how
non-bloated fvwm2 would become.

Not that I think its necessary to try, I just think the old disclaimer
in the man page was way too self critical.

Does anyone use CursorMove to switch pages?  The man page implies that
CursorMove 200 0 will move two pages to the right but all that happens
is that the cursor gets banged up against the right hand side.  The code
in builtins.c (routine: movecursor) has some weird stuff starting at
line 628:
#ifndef NON_VIRTUAL
  if(x >= Scr.MyDisplayWidth -2 && val1 > 0)
  {
    delta_x = Scr.EdgeScrollX;
    warp_x = Scr.EdgeScrollX - 4;
  }

The 2 I think refers to the pan frame width so it ought to use that
macro, I have no idea what the 4 is for.

Cheers,
Tim.

Can you post the line? There's no string at all on line 2394
of my copy.

I'd say it's a bug. Pointers should be unsigned.

I added the val1 > 0 test recently to fix another bug (sorry, can't
remember what it was). You remove it and try again. You'll probably
find something in the ChangeLog.

Hmm... Ultra 170E and precious resources, oh right, I see the smiley.

At  least 2 of the maintainers  (Dominik and myself) lack multi-headed
displays.  As for myself, not having a multi-headed display, I am at a
loss to appreciate the problems this forking causes.  It would seem to
me that running 2 copies of the same program by way of a fork would be
pretty efficient.

I would  also guess that a workstation  with more than 1 display would
tend to  be  high powered.    This would  argue  for using   addtional
resources   in  the  multi-headed     case,  and  optimizing for   the
non-multi-headed case.

Anyway, the point I am  trying to make is, we  can't do much about the
"don't remind me" issues without patches.  Even  with patches, some of
us can't do any realistic testing, so patches, and testing are needed.

I guess I just find the fact that every instantiation of an Fvwm "feature"
takes about a megbyte of "real" memory (and 2.5MB of virtual memory) a little
disconcerting:

2.5MB virtual/1.4MB real (per display) to get auto-raise
functionality? Modules are a nice way to add "big" features, but couldn't
auto-raise be added in a couple K if it were part of the fvwm2 proper?

Now I am not one to take the memory requirements reported by `ps' as
gospel (nobody can ever give me a straight answer on how to determine
the *real* memory requirements of a process), but adding up the above
indicates about 32MB of virtual and about 16MB of real memory. That seems
like a lot to me. :-) I only recently upgraded my machine to 128MB of
RAM, so fvwm2 and "friends" was using a pretty decent chunk (nothing
compared to the X server itself or Netscape, of course :-).

Hopefully more people will start using multiple video cards in Linux-type
systems so testing the multi-headed-ness of fvwm2 is nice and thorough. I
know that with the MetroX server and Matrox video cards, you can run
multi-headed in Linux today (up to 4 cards I think).

`--
Hope you guys didn't take it the wrong way; I just was pointing out
something that I thought would be nice to be looked at. I really appreciate
all the work the current maintainers are doing on fvwm2, and I look forward
to the next "official" release so I can update all our workstations here
from 2.0.45 to 2.2. :-)

Keep up the great work!!

Sorry, I can do these things only without seeing the effect.

Typo:  Line 2934 (so much for short-term memory).

I changed the line to read (some initial spaces removed):

          "expected number of colors to allocate in gradient");

Hi All,
	just been playing with the direction func and I think it's not going
all the way around the windowlist to find likely targets. I set up a
test arrangement:

+---+ +---+
|   | | b |
|   | +---+
|   | +---+
| a | | c |
|   | +---+
|   | +---+
|   | | d |
+---+ +---+

>From window `a' I couldn't get `Direction East [currentdesk] focus' to
focus on window `b' and it would either focus on `c' or `d' depending on
how I'd been focussing before getting into `a'.  I tried adding a printf
in the scoring bit and it wouldn't print out 3 scores for the 3 windows,
sometimes it produced 2 scores (when it focused on `c') and other times
it produced just one (when it focused on `d'). Is it not following the
windowlist right the way around?

Also I noticed that it calculated scores by the distance (x & y) from
the top centre of each window. Wouldn't it be more consistent to use the
centres?

Cheers,
Tim.

Dear All,
	I've been trying to fix a bug in placing at geometry +x-0.  I haven't
succeeded but wading through the code has thrown up a few fixes I'd like
to go in.  These are:

1) add_window.c:  sets borderwidth of shaped windows to 0 (try oclock
-geometry -0-0). Sets reparenting window background to none, this is an
ancient bug I've wanted to fix for ages that makes a window flash as it
dies, most noticeable on slow servers.

2) fvwm.h: cleaned up some pan frame stuff

3) virtual.c: made sure appropriate pan frames are visible

Cheers,
Tim

Right. I assumed the shared libc portion in the non-resident virtual
memory space (the 2.5MB space). I could be wrong about this, but I don't
think the memory from multiple FvwmAuto or FvwmButton instantiations is
shared. That would mean that FvwmButton of FvwmAuto is the one doing the
forking, and I don't think that is the case. It appears that fvwm2 spawns
all of the child processes:

 8  3271  2019  1888  0  58 20 2672 1240   mm_dip S console   0:19 FvwmPager

Looking at the Parent Process ID of all these modules, they are
all children of fvwm2 (which the first one should be, but not the
second/third/fourth copies if what you are saying holds true). But I
guess I didn't make that point very clear in my first message. In other
words, they all appear to be separate entities. This is already pushing
my limited knowledge of the Unix kernel, but are saying the OS is smart
enough to share page space amongst all child processes? (i.e., fvwm2
spawns three copies of FvwmButtons, the OS is smart enough to share the
code space amongst those three processes?) That would be pretty cool. :-)

(Note that the second copy of fvwm2 *is* a child of the first fvwm2 process.)

I've wrestled with it enough to get it working.  It still hasn't been
customized, but it seems to work well enough.  I'm trying to get the
background to look nice, so it may be ugly for a bit.

The URL is http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug.  Maintainers can use
http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug.private; your CVS password will
get you in.  I have also installed the web pages from the distribution at
http://fvwm.math.uh.edu.

Note that if you don't have a browser supporting HTTP/1.1, you'll need to
use http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/fvwm; it's a name-based virtual host.

Some comments on the pages (I should put these in Jitterbug...)

FvwmBanner didn't get built at all on my machine; I'm not quite sure why.
So there's no page for it.

run_man2html.sh generates pages named like FvwmAudio.html, but the index
wants them named like FvwmAudio-man.html.

There are no longer pages for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade.

FvwmCpp elicits the following from my nroff:

<standard input>:40: warning: numeric expression expected (got `o')
<standard input>:44: warning: numeric expression expected (got `n')
<standard input>:47: warning: numeric expression expected (got `f')

FvwmM4 is mostly the same:

<standard input>:50: warning: numeric expression expected (got `o')
<standard input>:54: warning: numeric expression expected (got `c')
<standard input>:57: warning: numeric expression expected (got `c')

ok, I started wroking on this idea. (whee! I'm gonna get to contribute
something :) And its going ok, except I got hung up rather quick tying to
understand the way the style line is read so I can add the `BackIcon'
option. (anyone suprised?)  
 
 I'm stuck on where it reads the option into the tname (name_list struct),
on each icon, mini icon, and apparently all other options have a
flag that they turn on to tell that that option exists. Well, my problem is
that it appears that all 32 bits are taken.

 I'm taking a lot of faith on how most of the code in style.c works. I
pretty much [so far] added a value to the name_list struct and made the
part that reads the BackIcon option simular to the icon and miniIcon
options.

 I think I could find a place to stick this bit flag, but I figured someone
else who know the code a bit better than I do may know where to put it. I'm
going to keep looking, but I'm not sure I'll find anything.

Thanks.

Good work, but don't put too much in this. It would be far more important
to have input/query masks that match our need.

Thanks

Not every thing parsed from  a "Style" command needs  a bit flag.  For
example, the IconGrid doesn't have a bit flag.

If you do need another bit, add  something to the list  to hold a bit.
There is  no  absolute need for  all bits  to  be  put into  the  same
container.

If it isn't, you need to be looking for a new OS.  Code pages should be
shared off of the disk; running the same program a pile of times should
result in all of its code pages being shared between all invocations.

EJG> This is already pushing my limited knowledge of the Unix kernel, but

If the OS is worth anything, it will do this.

It would still be nicer if modules were implemented as shared libraries
instead as separate processes, but that's a lot of work.

Huh?  Are you talking about the report form, or are you talking about
something else.  If there's something you want, you're going to have to be

Since the new "Panel" commands were debugged, I decided to give them a
try.  I'm trying to run a panel on the right side of my display,
starting near the bottom right corner.

It appears that if I specify anything in the parens after a "Panel"
command (eg, "Panel (left) xterms", "Panel (up) xterms", etc.),
FvwmButtons will disappear (no core dump).

The message I get is reproduced below:

Don't know why.  Try to "cd" to that directory and do a build there.

Someday  soon, I hope to put  something together to generate the index
itself.  In the mean time, I've commited a fix for the -man problem.

The new index only has FvwmRearrange.

Cool!

I guess we need to think about a bug tracking process so we can decide
what categories of bugs we need.  I see you have an "incoming" (and a
"test") category; sounds good.

So, the idea is all bugs start out in "incoming".  I assume we'd need a
"fixed" or "closed" category once the bug is fixed.  We probably want
some kind of "not going to be fixed" category, for things people may
complain about but that we think are features.

What about between those endpoints?  What's the process?  I think it
would be good to have a state that means "someone looked at it and it
seems like a real bug".  That could either be a "holding" state or
combined with others below.

Do we want to categorize things based on "bug" vs. "enhancement"?  Do we
want to have separate queues for doc bugs vs. code bugs?  For modules
vs. extras vs. core fvwm?

When someone decides to work on a bug, does that require a state change?
Should we have an "in progress" state for bugs someone is actively
looking at?

One thing I run into a lot professionally is duplicate bugs: does
Jitterbug handle that?  Do you just delete one?  Do we have a special
"duplicated" queue you assign it to, with a note specifying the original
bug number?

I  think its safe to say,  all UNIXs do this.  As  Eddy said when this
started out, "ps" is not to be trusted for this kind of information.

So, I think we are beyond the issue  of the "fork" consuming resources
and this being a problem in itself.

I've heard this one before, but can't say that I see where a "dlopen?"
would be significantly better than the current "fork"/"execvp".

Is the gain in function calls vs. pipe reading and writing?  Isn't the
asynchronous nature of the modules  an advantage in  most cases?   How
would we make shared libraries ansynchonous?

I do see the advantage to making libfvwm.a into a shared library, I'm
just not sure what the issue is with the modules.

I'm using groff, too, which is what I'm sure Linux uses, and I don't see
it.  Odd.

Anyway, the problem surely is this:

  .IP -Cppopt \fIoption\fP

This is incorrect.  The .IP macro specifies an indented paragraph; the
second option is supposed to be indentation level but here it's
"\fIoption\fP".  You should probably change these to:

  .TP
  -Cppopt \fIoption\fP

instead (.TP is the same as .IP, except that the tag for the indented
paragraph comes on the next line with .TP instead of the same line as
with .IP).

I hope so.  I think most object to it because when you type ps you get a

Depends on what you consider 'significant'.  Slightly lower footprint, fast
nature of function calls, no task switch overhead, etc.  Most machines are
fast/big enough to not care, but then if your machine is really fast and
big you probably aren't using FVWM for its size.

I suppose it would be nice if some of the folks who really hate the fact that
FVWM spawns piles of processes to put some work into proving the worth of
some alternatives.  (That's what my 'goad' was intended to elicit.)

'enhancements'

That I don't know.  Probably depends on volume.

Jitterbug is very lightweight.  I think the next step up is Bugzilla if we
decide Jitterbug is not adequate.  One mistake that often occurs when
something like this comes online is to try to impose too much structure on
it; it is often much better to let folks use it a bit and then codify what
works best.  Otherwise you can sit there all day and blow time figuring
out how you're going to use the system that you could be spending using the
system.

We didn't wring our hands much over CVS when it was set up; why should this
be any different?

Well, we did have a bit of hand-wringing over the details of branching
and labeling, as I recall, but I take your point.

We'll just wait and see what people think when we get our first dup bug :)

I can reproduce it and since I did the patch I will fix it.  However, I am 
moving this week and do not have anything but crude email access in the way
of setup right now so it may be a week.

	When this happens, do you also notice the window flashing, as though
it's being resized 2 or 3 times while it's being drawn? I had observed this
recently, but it seemed to have stopped, so I assumed that someone had fixed
it.

	According to some obscure natural law, as soon as I started to reply
to this message, the problem recurred.

	I've only observed this with Motif apps that are setting a remembered
window size (from the last time that a particular window was displayed). The
window dances around a bit, as though it were being resized while it's being
drawn, then ends up several pixels larger than the last time in both the x and
y directions. Once started, it keeps happening each time a new instance of the
problem window is created. As Giuseppe pointed out, manually resizing the window
causes it to stop...for a while. Then it happens again. I have no idea what
combination of conditions triggers it.

	I'd really thought this had gone away, but obviously it hasn't. The
mail reader I'm using at the moment is a somewhat quirky Motif app (I know,
some would say the phrase is redundant!), which is why I noticed it when I
started to reply.

	Do we have any heavy Motif users who can bang away at this release
and try to gather any more information?

This is precisely what happens !

The same happened to me when I was writing my report ... it really looks
like a sort of corruption of memory that builds up slowly ... and hits you
when you *really* have to use *that* application !

I can add another information: I've never seen this specific problem in
2.0.46. I hope this will help.

cheers,
Giuseppe.

	I use "Netscape*" with the '*'. It works fine this way, and has done
since at least 3.0 (of Netscape). It catches the Netscape style of window
titles, like "Netscape: Bob's Home Page". Brad, your version matches the
Class name they use, at least in recent versions (I'm using 4.04), so it
works just as well.

	Giuseppe, which version of Netscape are you using? Have they
possibly changed the window title or class conventions they use in the very
latest version? You can see what they're using with the Fvwm Identify module.
This may give a clue.

	Since StartsOnPage is working for other apps, the problem has to
be a failure to match styles with the window name or class or resource
name. Is there possibly a name clash somewhere in the .fvwm2rc that could
undo the Netscape specification?

	"If you build it, they will come."

	I can't imagine wanting it either. But Chuck taught me a long time ago
that I can't always assume my tastes are universal (even if they should be!)
That's why FVWM has so @^&@#&*!!! many options.

An idle FvwmCommand caused a network traffic jam here
by unnecessarily accessing my NFS mounted ~/FvwmCommand* files.

A UDP/IP based IPC (with X/Cookie based authorization) would
have really cut down io. Besides it is more generalized and
low on overheads. Any reason for choosing files for IPC?

Hi everybody !

I'm using Netscape 4.08. FvwmIdent gives:

Name:      Netscape: Version 4.08 [en]-98306
Icon Name: Netscape: Version 4.08 [en]-98306
Class:     Netscape
Resource:  Navigator

Desk:      0 (my current desk: it was supposed to go to desk 2)

X(current page): 10
Y(current page): 10

The 2 following lines:
Style "Netscape*"      Icon netscape_3d.xpm, MiniIcon mini.netscape.xpm
Style "Netscape*"      SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 2 0 0
are the only references to Netscape I have in my .fvwm2rc.
I've tried adding:
Style "Navigator*"     SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 2 0 0
Style "Communicator*"  SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 2 0 0
without success.

Contrary to what I've reported previously, I've started having problems
also with:
Style "Pine"           SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 4 0 0
(this was working at the time of my mail !)

In this case FvwmIdent gives:

Name:      Pine
Icon Name: Pine
Class:     XTerm
Resource:  xterm

I'm really confused !!

Giuseppe.

Yes, and that is part of the problem why we have very dirty
code in some parts. We're always trying to force in new stuff
and forget that nobody knows what's going on anymore. Take
the menu code or style.c. I doubt there is a living human
being that knows how it really works (ok, since I have written
the menu code recently I can still find my bearings therein,
but in six months the case may be another).

There's a discussion going on with Scwm at the moment about how to stop
Scwm killing itself.  Scwm aims to do everything itself without modules
and to help this it uses guile-gtk (some sort of library that lets
scheme code create windows). When a user kills one of these windows Scwm
dutifully kills the client connection (which is Scwm) and boom! bye-bye
Scwm.  Fixing this is very difficult.

The nice thing about Fvwm modules is that they can die with no risk of
killing Fvwm. It means Fvwm can be a window manager and other bits of
GUI can be provided separately.

If it really is a pain to have lots of processes I would suggest having
a mega module that has the usual modules linked in as dynamic libraries.
That would cut the number of processes down to two per screen and leave
Fvwm unchanged.

Cheers,
Tim.

I rewrote the function to do what is described in the manpage.
This was a tough one :)

I think it's a typo. Anyway, you won't find anything like this
in the new function.

Yes, patch attached.  I don't mind being in the AUTHORS file (that's
geek territory) but I'm not keen on the great unwashed banging on my
door.

Didn't you notice many pages contain comments that they're
onloy thought as examples and that you should edit the html
pages to get what you want? At the very least all these
somments should be removed (makes the pages easier to read).
I had only 10 minutes, so if I've overlooked something please
correct me. I missed a field in the report form (at least in
the form for maintainers) to assign a bug to a person.

How do I get a list of bugs assigned to me/nobody/someone else?

What is the email policy. This has to be set up somehow.

*Sigh* And you are absolutely sure I can't convice you to get
commit priviledge? I'm spending nearly 50% of my work for fvwm
on applying your patches or testing them or working on your bug
reports ;-)

Well I tried, but I can't see where this is happening. Can you reproduce
this and send the config file setup.  I thought I had seen it but I
can't reproduce it.  Maybe it's one for Jitterbug.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm really not doing anything unsusual, just BorderWidth and HandleWidth
set to 3. I can play with it at home to see if it is caused by something
in my config file tomorrow. Unfortunately you won't be able to do much
with my .fvwm2rc as it needs lots of files in various directories on
my system.

Hi!

I tried the dierction stuff on Panels, like this:

    *FvwmButtons(Title Tools,Panel (Left) Tools)

and the Panel got lost.

I found the bug in fvwm-2.1.2/modules/FvwmButtons/parse.c

I fixed the problem with this patch:


***************
*** 648,656 ****
--- 648,658 ----
              {
                s++;
                t = seekright(&s);
+ /*
                while(*s && *s!=')')
                  s++;
                if(*s==')')s++;
+ */
              }
              if      (strncasecmp(t,"right",5)==0) t = "panel-r";
              else if (strncasecmp(t,"left" ,4)==0) t = "panel-l";



Comment out/delete the while loop and the test for ')'.

Now everything works fine. Nice panels!

Oops, you cannot just remove the test for ')'. Parsing might
lose track of the number of '('s open. But thanks for the hint.
I will fix this.

I have created a few standard categories for our bugs:

assigned
fixed
in progress
no fix
postponed
unreproducible

(plus the two that were there before: incoming, confirmed)

Another one: although I'm logged in and entered my name, address, ...
in my profile, when I report a bug I have to enter all that information
again. The mask should be preinitialised with the information from
the user database.

I cannot change the subject after I sent a bug report. I reused
the mask for the previous bug and forgot to change the subject,
so I'm stuck with 2 different bugs with the same subject.

Can you describe each one so we understand exactly when a bug should be
assigned to one vs. another?

"No fix", "fixed", "unreproducible", and "incoming" seem
straightforward, but what exactly is the difference between "confirmed",
"assigned", "in progress", and "postponed"?  It seems like there's some
overlap there.  I'd prefer a very simple bug lifecycle; maybe 3 states:
"waiting to be fixed", "being worked on", and various disposition states
like "no fix", "fixed", etc.  Or, possibly 4 states if you leave
"incoming" as distinct from the "waiting to be fixed" state.

Remember the assignments aren't one-way.  You can move a bug to "being
worked on", then decide you can't/don't want to fix it, and move it back
again.

  dv> I missed a field in the report form (at least in the form for
  dv> maintainers) to assign a bug to a person.

There isn't one.  If you want to track this way you'd have to create a
category for each person, and assign bugs to that.

Personally, I don't think that's necessary at the moment.  As Jason
suggested, maybe we should wait and see how it goes.

  dv> How do I get a list of bugs assigned to me/nobody/someone else?

As above, you can't because that categorization doesn't exist.

Jitterbug is very simple.  It doesn't directly support a lot of things
more featureful bug trackers do, like age of a bug (except by looking in
the bug for the create date), properties (severity, priority, etc.),
owner, etc.

But that's not _necessarily_ a bad thing, unless we decide that stuff is
very important.

  dv> What is the email policy. This has to be set up somehow.

What is what email policy?

One odd thing I noticed was that the numbers next to the "previous" and
"next" links in the category view screens seem to be relatively random.

Go to incoming, and notice that the bottom says "next(1)"--but there are
about 14 more bugs!  Then use that link, and you get 10 more; you'll see
the linke "previous(0)" and "next(2)" !

Etc.  Either I don't know what those numbers are supposed to mean, or
they're wrong :)

I don't know how often you'd look into the bug list, but I will
do so quite often and it will help immensly if I don't have to
read and read again the titles of bug reports that do not concern
me and somebody else has already committed to fix. BTW, the four
states you mention are exactly what I call:

incoming    = incoming
confirmed   = confirmed
assigned    = waiting to be fixed (with owner)
in progress = being worked on

and the various disposition states:

fixed
no fix
postponed

So we're talking about the same thing.

Here's how I would do the state transitions

incoming -> confirmed
         -> unreproducible

confirmed -> assigned (to a person, see below, a detailed analysis
                       may go here, may have to be replaced by
                       one folder per person)
          -> no fix
          -> postponed (no fix anytime soon)

assigned -> in progress (bug is actively worked on)
         -> fixed

postponed -> any other state again

unreproducible -> no fix
               -> unreproducible (forever)

Ugh, not very nice. We'll have to find a way to keep track of this.

Well I don't even have the time to worry about all these things.
I don't mind as long it works.

When are you - as reporter of a bug, the person who works on it, etc. -
sent and email that a bug has been reported/changed/solved...
Or isn't that possible?

I think they're just the page number to which you will go (beginning

Sure, but that just means you wouldn't look in the "being worked on"

Almost; it looks like you have 5 states.  My suggestion seems to combine
the "confirmed" and "assigned" states into one generic "waiting to be
fixed".  Since we don't really have owners the difference isn't clear
(to me).

  dv> Ugh, not very nice. We'll have to find a way to keep track of this.

Could be as simple as adding a note to the bug, or adding yourself to
the Notification list when you decide to work on a bug.

Or, we could certainly create named queues.  I really don't care.  Only
people who have CVS write access have Jitterbug maintainer access, as
things stand; I'm not sure those two groups mesh exactly but probably
they're close enough.

  dv> When are you - as reporter of a bug, the person who works on it, etc. -
  dv> sent and email that a bug has been reported/changed/solved...
  dv> Or isn't that possible?

Sure.  Add your name to the notification list on the message view page.
Names should be comma-separated; you can have as many as you like.  I'm
not sure if the author of a bug is always notified automatically or not;
it's kinda hard to test since the person making the change is never
notified of changes they made (so you have to work with someone else to
test it).  Actually, I'm going to add a note to one of your bugs, so let
me know if you get a notification :)

Also, you can subscribe for a directory (category), and be notified when
any message in the directory changes.  For this, add yourself to the
Notification box on the directory screen.

The manual is terse, but useful in as far as it goes:

  ftp://samba.anu.edu.au/pub/jitterbug/JitterBug.txt

See the section on FAQ replies, too :)

You don't assign bugs to people.  If you want that, make a directory per
person and put the bug in their directory.

See above.

What do you mean by this?  Folks send mail to fvwm-bug@fvwm.math.uh.edu.
What kind of policy do you want to impose?

Er, what is the fifth state? In my eyes the difference between confirmed
and assigned (or whatever this becomes) is that a confirmed bug if
verified, but there is no plan how to fix it at the moment. Anyone
could volunteer to fix it as long it is confirmed whereas as soon
as it is assigned you shouldn't worry about it anymore. That still
does not mean something is done with it. But come to think of it,
as we all may be able to fix only infrequently, it does not make
much sense to have bugs lying aroung with an owner. Take Steve for
example. Two weeks ago he was doing large amounts of work, a few
days later he tells us he won't be able to help until January.
That's just the way it works on the list.

Anyway, let's trash the assigned directory at first and try
without it.

Er, you misunderstood what I wanted (that's ok, I didn't tell you).
It's that I *don't* want to get emails for each and every action on
all bugs my name appears im. Last week for example I had already
about 200 emails and can't cope with more (actually I still have to
do some 'real' work). I hopen I can activate emails selectively
(perhaps bug-based or only certain messages).

That can't be done? Then why do I enter all that information

OK last one from me for a while, Just a quick one that makes WindowList
put the current window at the top of the list rather than starting at
Scr.FvwmRoot.next

This makes Alt-TAB bound to Windowlist behave much more like that other
GUI and it doesn't break Next & Prev.  I had thought about changing the
Focus command to make sure that Scr.FvwmRoot.next was always the same as
Scr.Focus but got lost in the linked list stuff.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS there is only one reference to Scr.FvwmRoot.prev (in line 3758 of
builtins.c)
It should probably be replaced with NULL as that is what
Scr.FvwmRoot.prev is always set to and it might prevent future
confusion.

  if(Scr.Focus != NULL)
  {
    if(Direction == 1)
      fw = Scr.Focus->prev;
    else if(Direction == -1)
      fw = Scr.Focus->next;
    else
      fw = Scr.Focus;
  }
  else
    fw = Scr.FvwmRoot.prev; <<<<------!!!!!

  while((pass < 3)&&(found == NULL))
  {
    while((fw != NULL)&&(found==NULL)&&(fw != &Scr.FvwmRoot))

True.  Well, make yourself a queue :).  We can certainly leave it up to

It would be nice if we could somehow differentiate the "main" queues

  dv> Er, what is the fifth state?

incoming - confirmed - assigned - in progress - fixed/no-fix/etc.

5.

incoming - waiting to be fixed - being fixed - fixed/no-fix/etc.

4.

:)  Really, I don't give two figs.

Oh.  Well, did you get a notification for the change I made to one of
your bugs?

If not, then problem solved :)!  It appears that only if you explicitly
add your name will you get a notification.

If so, then bummer :(.  That change seems like it would have to go to
the Jitterbug folks (unless there's a config option that controls
this?)

Of course not. I haven't set it up yet ;-)

The point was that I'd like to have better configurability than
on/off.

Hi,
  I just tried 2.1.2, and it still fails to compile on FreeBSD. Could
  someone take a look at my previous msg, please. It's in the fvwm
  archive as :
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9811/msg00846.html
  
  If someone has already changed this, thanks. Otherwise, I've
  attached a diff to the 2.1.2 files below.

It hasn't get lost. It just takes some time (I'm not myself
concerned with compiling issues and had hoped someone else
would look after this).

To all: there was some discussion about ifdefs that I didn't follow.
Is this patch the correct things to do?

No, these shouldn't be applied as-is.

In the World of Autoconf you _never_ want to see specific system tests
like that.  It does sometimes happen, but it always leads to tears.

I'll try to look at it, since Steve is underwater.

Hi!

I'm having problems with this, from FvwmButtons.1:

       *FvwmButtonsPixmap pixmapfile
              Specifies a  background  pixmap  to  use.   Specify
              "none" for a transparent background.

>From fvwm-2.1.2

I have tried:

*FvwmButtonsPixmap none

And

*FvwmButtonsPixmap None /home/tore/pixmap/totd.xpm

None of them seems to work.

Tore.

OK, I've got jitterbug configured nicely.  I'm running a rather hacked
version and I've made some local mods to make the opening search page make
a bit more sense, though my HTML is probably terrible.  I think the FVWM
logo is a bit big for the page; if someone wants to shrink it down a bit
(or submit a prettier one) I'll be happy to install it.

I'm on the Jitterbug mailing list and will be forwarding any 'why can't we
do that' messages there.

I could do prettier, but I sort of like FvwmBanner, the Official Web page,
and everything else all tied together with the same 3D red FVWM.

I created one about  1/2 size called  "fvwm_smaller.gif" and put it in
the "docs" directory.  Good thing I tried this, on my first attempt, I
couldn't even get Gimp running because I  was out of colors.  That led
me to discover that ColorLimit was broken with this mornings changes.
(Its fixed now.)

It got awfully quiet in here all of a sudden.

I installed all of the HTML docs on http://fvwm.math.uh.edu; everything
looks nice.  Thanks, Dan, for the smaller logo that is now on the Jitterbug

Does seem quiet...  Its only relative.

The new pages look good to me.  They should be linked to Jitterbug...
Not tonight, at least for me.

	Now I'm getting really confused, too. It almost sounds as though
you're switching versions of FVWM. Have you had the same instance of
FVWM up all this time?

	Just out of curiosity, what happens if you add the following
line to your .fvwm2rc and restart?

GlobalOpts  StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition

	(This shouldn't be needed, but I'm curious to see what happens.)

	Again, I'm splitting this thread into discussions of the
indovidual problems, with shorter titles.

	Giuseppe, have you noticed the "growing window" problem
with any non-Motif applications? I've only seen it happen with
Motif apps, but I may be barking up the wrong tree.

	I have not been able to reproduce it since installing
the latest CVS build (this evening, 24/11). But it's only been
a couple of hours, and most of the time since I've been occupied
with early Thanksgiving dinner preparations. And, I've thought
it had gone away before, only to see it reappear.

	Nevertheless, I would be curious to know whether you still
see the problem if you update once more from the latest CVS sources.

	Yes, it does. Dan, I never got around to casting a vote on
the matter, but I rather like the new background. I never had a problem
with the old non-background, but I think a bit of a new look is called
for to signal a new generation of FVWM development.

Thanks.   Glad you like  it.  I've been  using it (the background) for
web pages for a while and as a background for  rxvt.  I think it might
make a cool menu background...

It looks a bit repeating IMO.... Hm.. There's a stone-like background
I've used myself for a while which doesn't look as repeating...
Have a look at http://www.ing.umu.se/~stric/fvwm2/ and say what you
think...

Hi all,

just one thing I wanted to tell you: it seems that we are
going pretty well with our 'fvwm maintained by list'
approach and as I said before I do not see me as 'the'
maintainer. Still, when I write mails to folks outdside
the list I call myself 'the maintainer'. This is for
simplicity only, so if you hear somebody calling me
the sole maintainer this is probably the reason.

Bye

A small enhancement request:

on the page where a list of bugs is displayed the list of available
folders is displayed left of the buglist. Would it be possible to
have it *above* the table? This way the table could be wider and
display more text on fewer lines. And perhaps the button in the
last column (where you can select a new folder for the message)
could be smaller too (with my browser it's the widest column of
the three).

Bye

I know, but I found a genuine bug in WindowList so here's another patch:

*) WindowList Unsort loops forever. I fixed this and renamed Unsort
to    NoDeskSort to make its meaning clear.

*) Became very brave and fixed SetFocus so that calling Focus from a
function moves the windowlist around to make the target window appears
at the top of the windowlist.

*) Cleaned up FlipFocus and fixed the man page.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS I think with this we have at last got a way to replicate the
Windows95 Alt-tab by using the windowlist menu.  The currently focused
window is always at the top if you use "WindowList NoDeskSort" or
"WindowList CurrentDesk" and if you replace the builtin windowlist
function with:

DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
+ "I" WindowId $0 FlipFocus
+ "I" WindowId $0 Raise
+ "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p 

you get the most recently used ordering.

Just a comment on the new web page (nothing to do with the
docs):

The contrast between the background (light grey) and the
titles like 'Welcome to ...' (pale pink) is terrible on my
system. It's barely readable at all. Could that be changed?

If you feel uncomfortable with "the maintainer", might
I suggest "a maintainer" or "one of the maintainers".

I've seen it with Netscape (I know, I know ...) and with xload

(I don't know if it is compiled against Motif or not)

No, before each report I have updated my version from CVS. That's why
things are "evolving" ....

The both repeat.   Yours is a little less  obvious.  Yours is a little
brighter. Dominik just  complained about  the lack  of contrast,  so I
think we need to go darker.

I'm finding, depending  on the display,  the stone pattern ranges from
almost  solid  black, to gray.   I  chose "pink"  "white" "yellow" and
"cyan" for foreground colors because they generally stand out.

I'll see if I can't make one of these stone patterns a little darker.

I thought about that too but didn't give it a try because
it might not be clear to the people I'm talking to.

That depends on the pixmaps you use. First of all you need
pixmaps with a transparent background (i.e. a background
at all, normal icons don't have a background). Second the
transparent background does not work in containers, only
plain buttons.

All this should be valid with any other background too.
Could you try with a background pixmap?

Please send me you FvwmButtons config and one of the used
pixmaps so I can check this problem.

The html page for FvwmRearrange is buggy: The AUTHORS
section has no heading. The manpage is definitely ok.

Someone at work has asked me whether fvwm can change the background
colour on a per-menu item basis.  I think the answer is no.  But if
you were able to put a pixmap behind menu items (not just at the side)
then you could get a similar effect by just having a 1x1 pixmap.

Thoughts?

You'll have to download the source code and make it so, or ask the
Jitterbug authors.

I can back out the hacks I applied and put it back on the bottom, but they
came along with other enhancements.  I'm not going to go playing
mix-and-match.

It's starting to sound like we're worse off with a bug tracker than we were
without one.

No, it can't be done with current code. And to be honest I don't
like the idea much. If we code things like these, fvwm will fast
suffer from advanced featuritis. I think there was a patch
recently that allowed this or something similar, but it was
rejected as code bloat (Dan might know more about that).

Hmm, after reading thos comments on the original pages I thought
the users of Jitterbug were expected to write the html pages more
or less themselves. Or did I misinterpret this completely?
Please, can you explain what Jitterbug is exactly? Which are the
parts that can be configured?

No, I think it does more or less what we need (only little
overhad for administrative actions).

restart.  I'm still not sure about using the top centre of a window as
opposed to the real centre but I'll get used to it.

The correct syntax appears to be:

*FvwmButtonsPixmap none

for my FvwmButtons,  this makes  anything  in a "Button"  float on the
root window.

The one I rejected  was for user  control over shadows and highlights.

German's  patch  (what  is the   status of that?)    is  for  per menu
color/pixmap/gradient   control.   As "and1000@cam.ac.uk"? points out,
pixmaps carefully matched  to the text  height would  create a similar
effect.  Per menu item  would be a step beyond  that.  As  I remember,
Rob (original  author) made  specific mention of  cvtwm's interpolated
menu color control as an example of bloat he wanted to avoid.

As you may be aware, fvwm does have the ability to "gray out" specific
menu items based on mwm window hints.  I recently had the desire to be
able   to gray out specific  items  based on  other  criteria.  Ie. in
FvwmAnimate generated menus,  I wanted to gray out  the menu item that
matched a current setting.  There isn't any current way to do this.

I'd  be more interested  in functional things, like "gray-out" control
rather than esthetic things   like throwing a   bunch of color  on the
menus.

That column (for me, in Netscape) is exactly as wide as necessary to
contain the button, and the button is as wide as the longest title in
the popup list (which, in this case, is "documentation bug").  I don't
know that there's any way, in HTML, to reduce these sizes except by
reducing the length of the bug category names.

That sounds better. Can you describe what you need/want/could imagine
here? I could do that if I know what is needed.

My browser is already nearly stretched to its limits. I just have a
small screen (only 17") and a terrible default setup (i.e. I can't
change the font size, it's prcompiled :( ). And still I can't see
much.

Perhaps we cound force a smaller font upon this column?

Somethings wrong.  You should  be able to find "preferences",  perhaps
under "edit", pick  "appearance", then "fonts", then choose  different
sizes.  (Netscape 4.5).

Please don't.  I find any time I go to a page that sets a smaller font
size, I can't read it.

Well, it's a bug tracking system.  You can customize the top of each page,
the bottom of each page, the introductory text, and the submission form.
Everything else is generated by the program.

Just a little thing I've just noticed. If you head over to Slashdot (I'm
sure you know the URL) you'll notice that LinuxCare have announced that
they'll do a Jitterbug thing for Open Source Projects, might be worth a
look ...

If you pop up a menu on certain windows, you will see "Delete" is
sometimes grayed out.  Ie. with this menustyle:

MenuStyle   white cornflowerblue navy 9x15bold fvwm

The word "Delete" is "navy".

I would like to generate  menus, where one or  more  items I pick  are
grayed out.  Given  the "funky" addtomenu  syntax, I'm not  sure how I
would design the syntax:

AddToMenu menu-name menu-label command-or-title

Note that "menu-label" has embedded pixmap functionality.

Perhaps:

AddToMenu "MenuFvwmAnimate" "[gray-out]Delay 1" *FvwmAnimateDelay 1
AddToMenu "MenuFvwmAnimate" "Delay 10" *FvwmAnimateDelay 10

On the other hand,

AddToMenu "MenuFvwmAnimate" "[ForeGround "navy"]Delay 1" *FvwmAnimateDelay 1

Ugh, quotes inside of quotes...


I really don't need this.  The menus do a decent job as they stand.
I certainly wouldn't want you to do anything to 2.1.3 for this.
I'd rather focus on a stable release right now.

OK, but how will that be any different than what we have now?  The version
of Jitterbug I'm running came from them.

Yes, I know.

I know where the panels for these settings are, but they are
completely ignored. The folks in the HP lab that provide
us with the browser have found a way to hard-code some settings
into it that you cannot change (I had something similar solved
before by upgrading to a new version, but font size is completely
ignored in Xdefaults, the preferences and sometimes even in the
documents (I like to override the fonts myself)).

If anyone knows where to get a netscape 4.x binary that runs
on an PA-RISC 712 workstation with HP-UX 10.20, please tell me.

*Sigh*

Html/web-interfaces seem to cause more problems than they solve.
I'm beginnig to hate this browser stuff.

I just thought it may have saved you some admin/maintenance burden ... I
have to confess I didn't read the entire thing in detail (I do after all
have work to do :) ), but I thought it might be worth considering.

I like   it, but  for   now,  I'll stick  with    a darker version  of
black-stone1.jpg.  I've  saved it since it  does seem superior in some
ways.  "xv" has a little problem reading it (Graphic control extension
ignored), but it does display it correctly and it reports that it only
has 6 colors.

On a related note, I've added a link to Jitterbug to the new Fvwm main
page.  I made the link to "cgi-bin/fvwm-bug" (instead of the full URL)
as I am guessing that the bug tracking system  will be co-located with
the pages.  Oh,  wait, thats not right, people  may  choose to install
these pages locally.

In that case, what will the final URL for the bug tracking system be?

I don't think they'd listen to one of their colleagues ;-)
Anyway, I now have a non-HP version of netscape that works.

Are you planning on moving the FVWM home page to "fvwm.math.uh.edu"?

The web docs also link to the mail archives.  Are they moving too?

Wow, Jitterbug is definitely worth its money. It cut my inbox
down from 236 messages (one or two weeks ago) to 36 now 8-).
So I have time to talk about what we want to do with fvwm2 in
the future.

In the last few weeks we've seen some patches, requests and
suggestions for colourful and fancy features that (in my eyes)
only few people will use. If anybody would ask me I'd tell him
that we have already gone too far in some respects: who does
really need borders with pixmaps? Or 25 different ways of
managing icons or window styles that can be stacked until the
swap space is exhausted?

Granted, such features look nice and make it incredibly
flexible. A few months ago I talked with Tim why there was
so little going on on the list and he suspected most people
were eagerly looking at scwm because it 'beats fvwm on
configurability'. But where does this place us regarding
usability? In some cases fvwm lacks (or lacked recently) the
most basic features that really help the average user:
cursor key movement in menus, tear-off menus, a generic (and
working!) auto hide mechanism. Or for developers: clearly
defined debugging and parsing APIs.

The masses definitely do not need pixmaps everywhere, each
and every colour definable etc. What the average user will
like (except easy customizetion, but that's another topic)
are fantastic features like SloppyFocus or SnapAttraction.

I think after 2.2 we should concentrate on cleaning up the
mess we have right now in some parts and keep a tight lid
on the new-feature box. The philosophy of fvwm once was
being small and efficient. When I learned about fvwm it
was called 'the' window manager. It is still widely known,
but will it continue like that if we try to force in each
and every fancy feature?

Just my own thoughts. Comments?

Bye

One thing I wanted to add:

If people do not like fvwm because it does not have every
feature imaginable they can use another window manager. There
are *so many* of them already. We don't want to make everybody
happy. If it were like this all window managers would end up
roughly the same, huge and maybe slow too, and users would
wonder why they were all bloated with stuff they'd never
wanted to use whereas there would be no small, fast and
efficient wm.

I agree with most of what you said.

Since I just love my blue-marble window borders, I'll disagree on that
one.

Scwm has  a nice configuration language.   What  fvwm2 needs to  do is
make the configuration language irrelevant.   We need good ways for an
administrator to configure  for users, and  users to configure without
using a text editor.

One of the reasons I'm doing all this work on FvwmForm,  is that I see
FvwmForm  as part of  the solution.  Maybe  it isn't, but we need some
kind of GUI  that we can use to  configure all the important  parts of
fvwm2.

The only other thing I think is relevant is, "people always contribute
what they want".  In other words,  I spent all  that time on the built
in icon box, because thats the iconbox I use.   If I used FvwmIconMan,
or FvwmIconBox, there  is no  way I would   have done anything  to the
built-in  iconbox.  So, to some extent,  people will usually only work
on what they are interested in.

I think we just have to deal with features on a case by case basis.

As   far  as spending time  making    fvwm2  more efficient,  I'm  not
experiencing any performance problems.  Look at what I'm running:

I'll take everything back, seems like it can stand a lot more features.

   When this happens to me, the window dances a bit while it resizes 3 or 4
times,
then ends up quite a few pixels larger than the program requested size.
    With this app, when I close the problem window, the app doesn't relly
destroy it,
it just unmaps it; when I open the window again, it does the same dance,
and ends up
several more pixels larger than it was the last time (the program-requested
size stays
the same). If I close the app altogether, then restart it, the window
starts over at
its original (oversized) size, then continues growing each time I open it
again.
    It almost looks like FVWM is arguing with the app over aspect ratio
constraints,
but wininfo shows that the window doesn't have these hints set.
    Is there anyone who's familiar with the current state of the
ConstrainSize code
and the like, and if so, could you enlighten us a bit here?

I was planning to add a redirect once what is at the new site is relevant
to a released version.  I can move it earlier, I suppose; it does still say
that the current beta is 2.0.46.

DE> The web docs also link to the mail archives.  Are they moving too?

They will eventually.  I already have Perl and Glimpse built but I want to
play with MHonArc styles first.  Realistically the mailing list stuff will
be the last to move.  I really want to move the CVS server first and get
the automated checkouts and rsync stuff done.

Hi !

I've the following lines in my .fvwm2rc (I've added the newlines and
the "\"):

*FvwmButtons(     Swallow(Close,Kill,NoOld) "XBiff-BB" \
 "Exec exec xbiff -geometry -1500-1500 -bg grey80 -title XBiff-BB",
 Title "Pine", \
 Action (Mouse 1) `Exec "Pine" exec xterm +sb -title Pine -n Pine -e pine -d 0`)

*FvwmButtons(     Swallow(Close,Kill,NoUse) "XLoad-BB" \
 "Exec exec xload -geometry -1500-1500 -bg grey80 -nolabel -title XLoad-BB")

*FvwmButtons(5x1, Swallow(Close,Kill,NoUse) "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 4")

At startup everything is fine. If I kill FvwmButtons, xload and FvwmPager
are killed, but xbiff is in the process list. 

Then, after restarting FvwmButtons, FvwmPager is restarted and swallowed,
xload is restarted and swallowed, while a *new* xbiff is started and
swallowed: the old one remains alive (I've checked, it still beeps when I
receive mails: I've found this problem because after restarting several
times the new mail notification was REALLY noisy !).
 
After closing FvwmButtons, the output of: "xlswins | grep iff" is empty,
but the output of: "ps -u dellaric | grep iff" is not !

I can solve all this just applying some code that is already in 
FvwmButtons.c, i.e.

diff -c FvwmButtons.c FvwmButtons.c.orig
*** FvwmButtons.c       Wed Nov 25 22:16:52 1998
--- FvwmButtons.c.orig  Tue Nov 24 16:00:52 1998
***************
*** 179,185 ****
  **/
  void DeadPipe(int whatever)
  {
! #if 1 /* can't do all this in a signal handler, so just exit */
    button_info *b,*ub=UberButton;
    int button=-1;
  
--- 179,185 ----
  **/
  void DeadPipe(int whatever)
  {
! #if 0 /* can't do all this in a signal handler, so just exit */
    button_info *b,*ub=UberButton;
    int button=-1;

It seems to me that, at least in this particular case (xbiff refusing to
die), this approach works. What's wrong with the code in DeadPipe ?

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi.

Direction without arguments makes fvwm_msg try to print a null-string
with %s, which gives sigsegv on solaris.

Checks for null has to be inserted, it's prolly best to catch them in
fvwm_msg, so it won't be missed anywhere...

The NoUse doesn't exist but that's not your problem.  If xbiff is not
dying and you want it to be reused when you restart FvwmButtons you
should use the UseOld option.  The NoOld option tells FvwmButtons to
ignore any existing windows called XBiff-BB and to start a new one to
swallow.

This is the cause of your problems.  It's a generic design fault in lots
of Fvwm modules.  The DeadPipe function is used as the signal handler
for every signal that FvwmButtons is ever likely to receive but the
functions is designed to be used only when the module interface pipes to
Fvwm are closed.  The signal handlers for the other signals should
probably do other things.  The reason that the clever stuff in
DeadPipe() is commented out is that some of the signals can happen in
the middle of Xlib function calls.  Xlib is not re-entrant or signal
safe and so you shouldn't call Xlib from a signal handler unless you
know that you're not in the middle of an Xlib call and that XFlush() has
been called (maybe even XSync()?).
What a signal handler should do is to set a global flag and return. The
flag should be examined frequently and the clever DeadPipe() called when
it is safe to do so.

At the moment it looks like the Kill/NoKill flag is useless. What
happens is that when the FvwmButtons window is destroyed the swallowed
windows get sent events (anybody know what?) and some programs quit
(xload, pager) and others don't. A workaround for you is to use the
UseOld flag for XBiff.

The reason for the commenting out is that some modules wouldn't die when
the X-server exited and would go into an endless loop.  Most modules
don't run other programs and so the correct behaviour is to just die on
any signal.  FvwmButtons is one exception and maybe it should be fixed. 
At the moment it's not as broken as it was.

Cheers,
Tim.

If anyone is going to change Direction_func could they put in NorthWest,
NorthEast, SouthWest and SouthEast directions too.  my keypad keys 7, 9,
1 and 3 are getting jealous of 8, 6, 4 and 2.  It doesn't have to use
sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy) for the distance function just dx+dy and the offset
can be just mod(dx-dy).

That is not the point I wanted to make. It may be nice to look at, but
it server no real purpose. There is no gain in usability. And usually
you want to keep the borders small so they don't take away so much
space.

Yes, absolutely. I don't see me as part of the development here though.

I've never seem it, but there's the dotfile generator with a module for
at least fvwm version 1. Might that help us too?

Perfectly clear, I do the same. Well, at least I used to.

I find page switching and startup annoyingly slow and would like to speed
that up (9 seconds to start X and fvwm2). There is much room for
improvementt in the initial parsing pass of the config file

Wow, you swap space alone is larger that my whole memory. Could you

Oh, I didn't know it was so small. What about this menu-shadow feature

Last time this came up you had some suggestion how to workaround
that (checking which pipe has closed, I think). Can you give me
a hint how to do this (or create a patch? ;-) ).

It was NoOld for all the buttons ... I wrote the mail while making the
test and messed up things a little ...

I've tried that, but since, after killing FvwmButtons, xbiff is in 
"ps -u dellaric | grep iff" but *not* in "xlswins | grep iff", FvwmButtons
can't swallow it (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Ok, that's definitely more important.

Looks like I was bit over zealous in removing some tests that I thought
were always going to return true.  I'm looking at fixing this and in
hunting around the code I found something a bit funny looking.  In
events.c around line 880 is the following:

  if((Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&(Scr.Focus)&&
     ((!Scr.Focus)||(Scr.Focus->flags & ClickToFocus)))
    {
      if (OnThisPage)
        {
          SetFocus(Tmp_win->w,Tmp_win,1);
        }
    }

Surely (Scr.Focus)&&(!Scr.Focus) is always false and the test should be

  if((Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&
     ((!Scr.Focus)||(Scr.Focus->flags & ClickToFocus)))

i.e. focus on ClickToFocus windows if there is no focussed window or the
focussed window is also ClickToFocus.

Can we rely on the order of evaluation to make sure that if Scr.Focus is
NULL the Scr.Focus->flags reference never happens? I thought that C
specifies left to right evaluation for tests. If we can't rely on it
then this statement (and probably more) will have to be expanded into a
nested if construct.

Cheers,
Tim.

Be careful what you change there. I don't know if you suggest the right
thing to do, but it is definitely not the same as the original code.
This would be:

  if((Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&(Scr.Focus)&&
     (Scr.Focus->flags & ClickToFocus))

Reason: the condition can be written as:

   A and B and (not B or C)
-> (A and B and not B) or (A and B and C)
-> FALSE or (A and B and C)
-> A and B and C

You can rely on that. If it doesn't work, the compiler is broken
and won't be of much use. As soon as the result of the test cannot
be changed by the expressions to the right, no further processing
is done. Otherwise simple things like the following wouldn't work:

  if (token && *token == 'a')

I had missed the case of focussing on a window that is not on the
windowlist.

Here it is again, diff's against CVS from today.  Hope it works but
don't bust a gut trying to commit it before the release.

Don't worry, I'm not going to touch it.  What I suggest is definitely
not the same as the existing code.  I think the existing code is not
what ClickToFocus type people want.  I'm not one of them so I will leave
it to one of them to fix and test.  The existing code won't give focus
to a new window if there is no currently focussed window.  I think that
ClickToFocus People want any new window to get the focus.  I think the
intent of this section is to give focus to new clickToFocus windows
unless the focus is on a Mouse/SloppyFocus window.  The current logic is
to give the focus to new ClickToFocus windows if the focus is on another
ClickToFocus window.

It's all a bit weird because Fvwm lets you mix ClickToFocus with
MouseFocus and it is very hard to come up with a strategy that everyone
is happy with.  e.g. what happens if the focus is on a SloppyFocus
window and a ClickToFocus window pops up under the pointer?

Cheers,
Tim.

The current pages are still consistent with 2.0.46.
I expect to change the beta pointer when the release is announced.
(Any one with access can make the change.)

I'll update the link to Jitterbug to a full path.

Since  you are  moving things  around, feel free   to get in there and
update the links in the docs.

	Exactly what should happen. You can throw away that command now.
Thanks for trying it.

	Now that's *not* what should happen. Since we haven't been able to
reproduce it, could you send me a copy of your entire .fvwm2rc, so I can
try it out? There's got to be some unusual combination of options that
are stumbling over each other.

	Thanks, I've found it. There's a bit of conflict among the
following options: StartsOnPage, SkipMapping, and ActivePlacement.

	To make StartsOnPage work with this combination, you have to
add the line

GlobalOpts ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

to your .fvwm2rc. Or, alternatively, you could add RandomPlacement
to the styles for Netscape and Pine (or whatever you want to use
SkipMapping and StartsOnPage with).

	Now, what happens with ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
is that, when you interactively place a window with the rubber band,
then click to set the placement, the window will not appear, but
will be placed on the desk/page you specified. This was the way
StartsOnDesk always used to work, but it seemed that this would be
confusing to inexperienced users, who would be left wondering "Hey,
where'd my window go?" That's why I decided to have the default
behavior be for ActivePlacement to override the SkipMapping/StartsOnPage
combination, but to allow this override to be overridden.

Great ! it works (I mean, also for me :-) ) Should this be mentioned

No need to apologise. One stumped user is one too many.

Bob, what do you think what we should do about that? At least there
should be something in the FAQ. Personally I'd rather return to the
old behaviour that might 'confuse the inexperienced user'. After all
do not believe inexperienced users would tinker with StartsOnPage.
And strange behaviour occuring only with a cryptig set of options
takes a long time to debug and creates plenty frustration.

What do you think?

Bye

Good news for the odd numbers on your keypad 8-) NW, NE, SW, SE are in
now. And I chamged the calculations so that proximity is based on window
centers. Please wait for my next commits.

Hi fellow-maintainers,

it has been rather quiet in the last few days and I suspect this
has something to do with Thanksgiving ;-) Hope you enjoyed your
fvwm-free days. At first I planned the 2.1.3 release and the
beginning of the beta test for today, but since nobody is there
to make the release it has to wait until next week.

Although the code is stable enough there are a few things to be
done before the beta is announced:

 - Compile a list of known problems in 2.1.3 so we don't hear
   the same bug reports over and over again. (I will do this)

 - How will we handle the beta test? Will we just tell the world
   the beta is there and everyone is invited to test it or
   will we keep a list of tasks to do and register people
   who are willing to test parts of this list (I prefer this)?

 - Write an announcement that sounds good. I don't want to do
   it myself becaus mei english isnt' well enuff. In other
   words: I need a *volunteer*.

Bye

Dominik

My guestimate:

  DontFocusOffscreen.patch
	don't know

  FvwmTaskBar_with_plugins_au...
	don't know (Is there anything FvwmTaskbar does that can't be done with
FvwmButtons + FvwmIconMan etc?).

  MouseFocusOnStartup.patch
	In

  StackingOrder.patch
	In (and very nice it is too) (there is a note at the end about closing
the windowlist into a loop, I don't think we should do this but we could
use Scr.FvwmRoot.prev as the pointer to the last item now that nothing
uses it. It would be a performance gain but it would probably not be
noticeable until you start the 100th xterm on a slow computer).

  iconboxes.patch
	In (and great)

  miniicons.patch
	In

  new_anim_shade.patch
  shade_anim_1.3.patch
	Out (I tried it on 2.0.46 and it worked)

	I had come to the same conclusion myself, and was just going
to solicit opinions from the group.

	I'll change the default later today.

 	Definitely In.  (It was in the, um, nonexistent 2.0.47d.)

	Which one did you use? I've been looking into trying
to resurrect this one (post-2.2) using the FvwmAnimate module
technique.

I would opt for telling the world where to get it.  Enough people have
reported the location of 2.1.1 to the fvwm mailing list that trying to
limit 2.1.3 availability may result in everyone grabbing old code and
reporting bugs.  I feel that with the purify effort fvwm2.1.3 is more
stable than 2.0.46. Apart from this an announcement to gnu.announce is a
lot easier than recruiting and registering people.

Don't put yourself down, your English is better than what mine is.  If
in doubt put the text in a file in CVS and we can all proof read it.

Here's a stab

The Funky Virtual Window Manager Group is pleased to announce the beta
test version of Fvwm2.2. Available at <URL for home page> it includes
the following features:

*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability
*) Proper Windows95 style Alt-Tab behaviour (OK I'm biased about this)
*) Animated Iconification
*) Mini Icons
*) ... that I can't remember since this is really the first release
since 1.x

No, that's a misunderstanding. I don't want to limit availability
of 2.1.3, just coordinate the people willing to test. Otherwise
we might end up with 1000 people testing the main executable but
nobody touching the more exotic moudles and options.

Thanks, we'll see if I can put something together at home.

I had some difficulties to find the download archive on our
new (and the old) web site. There is only a link to 2.0.46,
but I could not find /pub/fvwm itself. I had to type that
manually. Could you add that, Dan?

Another think is that the unofficial patches directory
contains patches for various versions. There should be
a directory for patches that have been applied to the
current version (some kind of archive).

new_anim_shade is built upon shade_anim_1.3 and fixes some serious
visual and semantic glitches (1.3 can turn into a while(1) loop if not
careful with parameters)... I have brought this patch along, and have it
up-to-date with current cvs if it's wanted.

I use it every day and it has caused no harm what-so-ever (since my
patches). I find it more pleasing to watch it zip together (and I use it
a lot on Sparcstation LX's and such, which has very limited cpu power).

It's not bloat, and it would be nice if it went in (I'll send an
up-to-date version if so)... diffstat:

Typo first.. line 1957 in fvwm2.1:
ame options for menuface as for ButtonStyle plus DGradient [.....]
^^^ should be 'same'

Then bug..? I'm not sure what's causing it, but it's appeared after I
switched to cvs-fvwm2 (as of yesterday or so).

screenshot @ http://www.ing.umu.se/~stric/xbuffy.gif

Basically.. the internal border grows from 3 to 6.
This only happens _sometimes_ (and then it does so for all
xbuffy-windows).. and then it suddenly reverts to the normal again...

It works just fine when running 2.0.46, but with 2.1.3 it appears every
now and then...

Any ideas?? (It's a normal Xaw(3d) app..)

This patch applies to 2.1.2 and fixes the off-by-1-pixel bug on SnapAttraction.

While I was at it I added icon and snap to grid functionality.  Icons may now
be snap attracted as well.  SnapAttraction now takes an optional second
argument that may be one of the following:

All     - Icons and Windows attract to other Icons or Windows
Likes   - Icons attract to Icons only and Windows attract to Windows only
Icons   - Icons attract to Icons only
Windows - Windows attract to Windows only

For example I use:

SnapAttraction 10 Likes

The manpage entry for SnapAttraction should also note that (due to SnapGrid)
there is a difference between SnapAttraction of 0 and SnapAttraction of -1.
The value -1 completely deactivates SnapAttraction, while a value of 0 will
allow windows to exactly touch of positoned as such (in other words, 0
overrides the grid on exact positioning while -1 does not).  SnapAttraction's
default is now:
SnapAttraction -1 All
which behaves like the old default used to, no attraction at all.

Also, there is a new option called SnapGrid that take two arguments; first
is the X grid size, second is the Y grid size.  The default is 
SnapGrid 1 1
which effectively is no grid at all.

	I had planned on trying to rework this patch to put the animation
code into a module - an extension to FvwmAnimate, if Dan had no objection -
after 2.2 was out. 

	In reality, the current Windowshade Animation adds very little code
to the core. Tomas is quite right, it's not bloat. I personally would not
mind seeing it in 2.2, if others want it; I, too, had been using it in
2.0.46 for well over a year and was sorry it didn't make the cut. (Actually,
I'd been using a monstrously hacked version - more on that below.)

	However, I do have a couple of reservations.

	First, I had wanted to re-implement it as module code as an exercise
in adding new features with minimal impact on the core code. I could easily
give up this idea, since there are any number of other things I might use to
play with this technique.

	Second, I wanted to "bloat" Windowshade Animation a bit. I had
experimented with some different, non-linear, stepping algorithms (Fibonacci
and fractional progressions, etc.), to allow fine-tuning the animation for a
smoother or more realistic windowshade effect; and I think the feature wants
a few extra tuning options. This might argue for putting the code out into a
module.

	If people want to see the present version included in 2.2, could I
suggest a minor simplification? How about using GlobalOpts to set the number
of animation steps, and store it in the ScreenInfo structure, instead of
adding a whole new command? This would make the code size hit even smaller,
as well as simplifying the code.

	On that subject, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to remove the man
page comment that GlobalOpts is a temporary hack for things that will be Style
options after the GSFR, and consider using it regularly for adding options
of a, well, global nature, instead of going through the rigamarolle of adding
a new command. Any opinions pro or con?

	Alternatively, Tomas, if you'd like to experiment with modularizing
the animation code, I'd be happy to collaborate with you on it.

	This sounds suspiciously like it may be related to the problem
described in the "Growing windows" thread. Please feel free to join that
thread; we need all the help we can get to squash this one.

	Maybe there were some changes in both the size constraint *and*
the bordering logic that occasionally don't work well together. So far,
I haven't got a clue.

    The problem was a combination of StartsOnPage, SkipMapping, and
ActivePlacement. The fix was to specify ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
(the default was ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage).
    Although this was the documented behavior, I think this default was
probably more confusing than the other way around (which was the way
StartsOnDesk used to work).
    I have changed the default to ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage.

My $0.02 on this:

The main advantage to fvwm, in my book, is modules.  Few, if any, other
WM's have these, and they allow people to pick and choose how fat or
skinny they want their WM without having to recompile special versions,
etc.  Also, it keeps the code clean, segregated, etc. etc.

I think we should absolutely try extra, extra hard to put new features
into modules wherever possible.  I also think trying hard to move
existing "fancy" features into modules wherever possible is A Good
Thing.

This may involve expansion/extension of the fvwm2-to-module interface.
That's fine w/ me.

It may involve examining and changing the current module configuration
scheme.  That's also fine w/ me.

Beyond that guiding principle, here're my items:

 1) We need theme support.  We should work hard with whomever is looking
    into this to be sure we can get fvwm2 to "do" themes in as painless
    a manner as possible.  Right now I don't think fvwm2 is very "theme
    friendly" from a config file point of view.

 2) Config file syntax.  I hate to bring up this bugaboo again, but the
    current syntax makes me nuts.  Plus, it seems like every time we
    turn around someone is adding a new feature that requires some new
    syntax, and much of it is added fairly helter-skelter.  It's kinda
    scary.  I've done a bit of it, and language design is a very, very
    hard thing to get right.  Fvwm2's config language is not too great:
    it's not regular enough, it's not easily extensible because the
    format is too open, etc.

    It may be that (Dan?  Bob?  Someone?) is right, and what we should
    be doing is trying to make that irrelevant by providing GUI config.
    While a laudable goal, it seems a long way off and still no excuse
    for excessively baroque syntax.

    Not sure exactly what to do here, except re-emphasize we should take
    hard looks at any enhancements which require config syntax changes,
    to make sure they're done as well as can be.

 3) It still seems to me like we have module overlap, and it would be
    good to generate a document with at least some basic strengths and
    weaknesses of each to allow users to make educated decisions.  And
    we should take a very hard look at things in extras: the goal here
    should be either to elevate them to modules, if they're polished
    enough (whatever that means :), or remove them from the dist (maybe
    make them available separately).

 4) My pet feature request: an icon manager that allows me to "group"
    windows by class (or instance, etc.) and, when iconfied, all windows
    in that class have only one icon.  When that icon is selected, a
    popup menu containing a list of windows in that group is provided.

    Just had to throw that in :)

Could you enlighten me what the patch actually does? Animated window shades
would seem pretty useless to me since they are not wider than a pixel, so
I assume this is something else (I didn't try the patch).

Whatever happens to the GlobalOpts command, most of it's options will
definitely be removed someday, so this warning makes sense after all.

I believe that is related to the growing windows bug. I have seem it
with the FvwmButtons panels too and it's definitely not FvwmButtons.

Xterm sends a configure request to resize the icon pixmap window, but

this fuzz about growing windows bugs? Bring 'em on :-[
(HandleEnterNotify): removed garbage (old ifdef).

Hmm, at the moment I don't want to add new features. Could you please post
a patch for the one-pixel-off bug only? Before the patch can be added it
has to have its manpage entry. I want the bugfix fast, but I'm not willing
to put new (and potentially buggy) stuff into CVS so close to the beta.

This is always the problem with configuration languages - they grow, and grow, 
and grow.  And they don't always grow very coherently.

In scwm:

(define xterm-window? (class-match?? "XTerm"))
(define (popup-icon-menu)
  (cond ((xterm-window? (get-window))
	 (show-window-list-menu #:only (lambda (win)
					 (and (xterm-window? win)
					      (iconified? win)))))
	(else
	 (popup-menu 'menu-window-actions))))
(bind-mouse 'icon 3 popup-icon-menu)

will give you the kind of menu you're looking for, for xterm icons.

Adding a small, straight forward patch:

And the following comes very close to giving you only one icon for xterms:

(define current-xterm-icon-window #f)

(define (xterm-iconify-hook window)
  (cond ((xterm-window? window)
	 (cond ((not current-xterm-icon-window)
		(set! current-xterm-icon-window window)
		(map (lambda (win) 
		       (cond ((not (eq? win window))
			      (set-show-icon! #f win))))
		     (list-windows #:only (lambda (win)
					    (and (xterm-window? win)
						 (not (iconified? win)))))))))))

(define (xterm-deiconify-hook window)
  (cond ((and (xterm-window? window)
	      (eq? window current-xterm-icon-window))
	 (let ((iconified-xterm-list 
		(list-windows #:only (lambda (win)
				       (and (xterm-window? win)
					    (iconified? win))))))
	   (cond ((eq? iconified-xterm-list ())
		  (map (lambda (win)
			 (set-show-icon! #t win))
		       (list-windows #:only (lambda (win)
					      (and (xterm-window? win)
						   (not (iconified? win)))))))
		 (else
		  (set-show-icon! #t (car iconified-xterm-list))))))))

(add-hook! iconify-hook xterm-iconify-hook)
(add-hook! deiconify-hook xterm-deiconify-hook)


I think all that's needed to finish it is to hook into new-window and 
set-show-icon! appropriately for new xterms, depending on whether or not
there's currently an xterm icon showing.  It's late, though, and I'm supposed
to be getting back on a normal schedule...

I expect the one-icon part can be done better.  I'm not a scheme expert by any 
means, and this was a half hour hack, C change included.

Hi all,

I want to make the beta today. There are two files in the
archive directory:

 - announcement-2.1.3
 - known_bugs

The announcement file needs some work. Dan, Jason, could you
both look at the file and fill in the missing URLs? Proof
reading it might not be wrong either. The known_bugs file
should be accessible in the download directory also. It
should contain bugs that we are aware of and that are
going to be fixed in 2.2. The file is not yet ready but
I will fill it today (if I forgot something, please add it).

Paul, Dan, one of you should make the 2.1.3 distribution
today. Please coordinate your efforts so you don't work
concurrently. Remeber to write an email first, then tag
the CVS tree with 'version-2_1_3'.

This was caused by HandleConfigureRequest (events.c). The code
handled configure requests for the icon window but not for
the icons pixmap window. This happens with active icons.

I haven't followed the discussion about growing windows all the way.
I want to look at that myself but have never seen it personally.
Could someone send me his .fvwm2rc and an exact description how I
can reproduce this bug?

I felt  the same way about  borders UNTIL  I started using blue-marble
window borders.  I found them so visually appealing,  I was willing to
give up  the  screen space to 10   pixel borders.  A  21  inch monitor
helps.

There is a fvwm2  version.    My first  complaint  is its  Tcl  based.
Second,  its   not interactive with  fvwm2.    I'm looking for tighter
integration with fvwm2.

Instead of going from a full window to the title-bar only, it shrinks to
the right size... And then grows when un-shading... Nothing really
useful, but makes things look neat.. like animated menus.. 8)

I can't reproduce this on demand, but when it feels like happening, it
has only happened when clicking on bookmarks in the Personal Toolbar in
NS 4.x ... When that "mode is active" I also get a few pixels of extra
border in xbuffy-windows... And then all of a sudden, it stops
happening.. 8/

Other than I'm using MouseFocus, I don't know what more information I
can give that's relevant..

I can, but I'm not sure  its a good idea.   The current approach is to
lead downloaders  to specific things we want  them to download.  There
are no links  to 2.0.38 for example.   For people that want unofficial
patches, old releases, etc.   They are generally resourceful enough to
find what they need.

If you would still like a link to  /pub/fvwm, give me  an idea of what
you would like the web page to say about it, and I will add it.

(This is from some other mail I've sent)

[...FvwmWinList drifting up and right...]

Ok, I've been able to reproduce this now.

Is seems that if your .fvwm2rc file contains:

Module FvwmWinList

then the problem manifests itself.

If you have:

Module FvwmWinList
Style "Fvwm*" NoHandles
Style "Fvwm*" BorderWidth 0

then the problem is fixed.  I belive there is an interaction between
the winlist module and having handles.  Your fvwm2rc file includes
NoHandle on all Fvwm*, but has a BorderWidth of 6, which is why you
see the effect.  I didn't, because I have a BorderWidth of 0 and
NoHandles.

Are you planning an making FvwmAnimate do other types of animation?

You could use the code from AnimatedMove, It uses a list of numbers from
SetAnimation to control the effects.  No need to put fancy algorithms in
the code.  We can run a competition after 2.2 comes out to get the most
spiffy looking effect.

I'd vote for using the SetAnimation numbers.

I'd like to see the animation sequence be part of the style.  Some
programs may get upset by the refreshes generated by WindowShade and it
would be useful to have these unshade in one go. Maybe a per style
animation sequence that is used for WindowShade, AnimatedMove and
AnimatedResize. 

I think the GlobalOpts should be marked as temporary since most of the
things it refers to would be more useful as part of the style stuff.

Cheers,

Well, I don't have strong feelings about that, but I don't understand
the reason for this secrecy. Why wouldn't we want people to see our
alpha code or the unofficial patches?

This is weird, I just managed to get WinList to exercise the bug.  I
normally have:
style * borderwidth 12 handlewidth 12

and FvwmWinList comes up fine at -0-0

I just tried

style FvwmWinList Handlewidth 6
style FvwmWinList NoHandles
FvwmWinList

and it came up +6+6 out.  What is weird is that the second FvwmWinList I
ran came up in the right place.

It smells like the add_window or constrainsize functions are using
handlewidth instead of borderwidth.  If we can't find this bug I think
we should remove HandleWidth and just use BorderWidth for Handle &
NoHandle windows.

Any ideas?
Tim.

Why do we want a known-bugs file?  I'd _MUCH_ prefer to simply document
the Jitterbug page and leave it at that.  Any bug list we supply with a
release will be very, very quickly out-of-date and the entire point of
having a globally accessible bug tracking system is so everyone can use
it.

Plus, it saves us the hassle of compiling the bug list every time :)

Why are we creating a bugs file, shouldn't we point to Jitterbug?

I may be able to do this today.  If I start, I'll send mail before I
do.  I certainly wouldn't mind anyone else doing this.

Only during the beta test. I'll throw it away as soon the 2.2 release
is out.

I agree with you. The reason is that I want to reduce unnecessary
bug reports as much as possible. We all don't have the time to
read the same reports over and over again. People will rather
look into an easily accessible file than start using Jitterbug.

I'm not trying to keep a secret, as much as trying to guide people
to the right place.  If you can come up with a sentence or 2 that
I can put on the page, that will clearly explain why I would want to
send someone to the /pub/fvwm directory,  I'll be glad to do it.

Please see my reply to Paul's mail. We could give the URL of the

How about this:

Old releases of fvwm1 and fvwm2 and (for the brave), the latest alpha
and beta releases as well as unofficial patches can be found at
<URL>.

I'm not looking at ChangeLogs, in the NEWS file, mini-icons appear for
the first time in 2.0.38.

I saw your reply to Paul, but I still agree with Paul.  Lets encourage
the use of Jitterbug  and see how  that goes.   It might save  us some
work.  As far as the URL, I think its best to just give out the URL to
the home page, and say, "follow the link to ...".

I agree 100%.  I think there is scope for removing lots of cruft from
fvwm and putting it into modules.  I think Fvwm should be a window
manager and not try to be a complete GUI.  The modules can be the GUI,
fvwm should do simple focus management, window geometry,
desking,paging,iconifying,shading.  The modules should do animation
effects, window decoration, menu posting etc.

I agree -100% 8-).  If you want a syntax language that has a BNF
definition, is Turing complete and all the other things that CS people
like then Scwm is where it's at.  The current syntax is simple to
implement (with the token stuff from fvwmlib) and is very quick to
code.  If we come up with a syntax it will only be a matter of months
before a new feature pops up that requires the syntax to be extended.

Yeah, I know, it seems like 50% of the modules are the WindowList menu
in some form: FvwmWinList, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmPager,
FvwmIconMan. They all do similar but different things.

Tim.

Ok, could you fill this in then? I've incorporated the other changes
already. I'm not opposed to using Jitterbug. My whole concern is that
I don't want to be swamped in bug reports. If I can talk you and Paul
into my idea this one time I'd be grateful. In the end I will be the
one that reads most of the bug reports, so please, please, *please*
let's do it my way.

OK, you've got me confused.

Do you want to get bug reports thru Jitterbug, and encourage people to
check Jitterbug before submitting   bug reports, or have people  check
the   "./BUGS" file or   the  "./archive/known_bugs" file?  Thats  not
counting:

./extras/FvwmScript/BUGS
./modules/FvwmButtons/BUGS

I  don't  see why  we  should get  swamped with  bug reports, no prior
release was particularly bad in that respect.

I don't see  why  you are taking it   on yourself to handle every  bug
report.   I  don't want you to  get  burned out,  trying to take final
responsibility  for   every bug.   If you  let   some of  these things
languish for a while, one of us will jump in.

OK, now you've got me confused too. I didn't realize there were more
BUGS files. Note that the archive directory isn't in the distribution
so I'd suggest to but the file in the save directory as the tar file
on the ftp server (perhaps name it 2.1.3). It should only track
progress of the betas. I don't think 2.1.3 will be the only one
before the release.

It's bugs like the growing windows that I am concerned about. This stuff
is *not* in the BUGS file and users *will* report it. I can't imagine
anyone is willing to page through 50 bugs in Jitterbug which is a bit
user-unfriendly when it comes to this. BTW, I'm not sure giving Jitterbug
access to the world is too smart. Personally I like filtering bug reports
and let someone who knows what's going on enter them (but I don't want
to start a discussion about this right now, I don't think we have the
time to do this).

Hmm, perhaps you didn't do much with Jitterbug until know. Putting
all these old bug reports into Jitterbug and moving them to the right
directories cost me hours. Much more time than I'd been willing to
invest.

Sorry, I didn't really answer this in my previous posting. If you can
give me at least a 90% guarantee that my horror scenario won't happen
I agree and let go of the know_bugs file. But still:
 - there are bugs described nowhere, not even in Jitterbug
 - have you really done an *announced* beta test in the past?
   This time we'll be asking for help in testing and we know
   we have lots of new features.

Hmm, after all this discussion about this known_bugs files
I suggest we copy the list therein into the BUGS file for
2.1.3 and keep that up to date during the beta phase.
Afterwards we can throw this away.

I just added the hint to Jitterbug to the announcement.
I noticed that our web page still suggests to send bug
reports to the list. This has to be changed first (Dan?).

Personally I'm done committing so you can go ahead as
soon this is OK.

This stuff will never be completely done.  The inconsistencies
in our bug reporting suggestions don't bother me at all.
People don't follow suggestions anyway.

I think its package time!

It would be nice if "jitterbug" could produce a report that could go in to a
BUGS or known_bugs file for the release. This would help the maintainance of
the file as well as not forcing everyone to get into jitterbug.

I ment to imply by the above that I think a BUGS list is helpful and a quick
reference when installing new software versions, and should be considered
for the release if there are infact bugs which we would be expecting users
to report. 

Maybe with some comment, that if people are looking at placees to contribute
to the fvwm effort, this would be an appreciated place to start.

I personally scan BUGS file to get a clue of what to expect from a package
or from user complaints.

Ahem, what I meant is: there is no hint to Jitterbug at
all on the page (I'm looking at out homepage, not the
CVS trre). But anyway, this has nothing to do with the
release, so go ahead, Paul.

I could whip up a script, but the problem is that there isn't enough
information in the subject and way too much information in the bug reports
themselves, so it would still take a human to digest things.

I was hoping that Jason will have  time today, to  bring the web pages
up to date with our latest changes, so that  they are available at the
same time the beta is announced.  Its  not 100% necessary, but I think
it would be a nice touch.

I haven't copied it over yet.  It looks like it's ready, so I'll go ahead
and do that now.

Actually I am going to have to dissagree with this to some point.  At one
time I put together a (IMHO) decent theme setup using PipeRead, a simple
shell script, and built up the pieces with Decors and a Function. (you
could almost add it to any existing config file with three lines(one to
build the menu, one to call the default item, and a addition to the pixmap
path)) It would switch themes without restarting fvwm from a built up menu. 
(but you did have to restart for it to reread the themes dir.) It still has 
a few bugs, but I've not done anything with it for a while yet either.

I will also have to say that this depends on what you call a theme.  From
my point-of-view, window titles&borders, menu colors&styles. But not the
content of the windows or menus.  (Its a complaint of mine when that kind
of stuff starts messing with menuitems or buttonbars.  I consider that
content and not themable.)

I could solidify what I have a bit and make it availible to people if
anyone is interested.

I would like, in the near future, to move the CVS tree to the new server.
This should be relatively painless, although I think everyone will have to
re-checkout which will probably be annoying.  I was hoping to get to this
during the holiday weekend, but it didn't happen.

One evening in the near future I'd like to freeze the tree for a bit and
copy it over.  This shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes or so.  Later
today I'll have a copy of the server running on the new system that folks
can test.

Good :-) Will you post the announcement when you put the tarball on
the ftp server? (list of recipients I could think of is at the
beginning of the file, so you should remove this first).

OK. When you do that, can you post the IP address of the new
server? I had a hard time to elicit this information from our
name servers (I can't use the name).

Personally I'd think a theme should include colour schemes as well.
This is really a pain in the ass. Did you ever try to put the same
background colour on all windows swallowed by FvwmButtons?
E.g. xosview doesn't accept '-bg', only .Xdefaults settings. What
I do at the moment: I #include a named colour scheme from a file
(that is rewritten when I change the scheme). Actually these
palettes are stolen from CDE. Then I use the #defines for my
application colours. For xosview I have to make xrdb swallow
a line with the xosview*background line, then waste as much time
as possible before starting xosview so that xrdb has finished
when xosview reads these entries. And still it fails about 20%
of the time.

Hi,

"FvwmPager" has a little Bug:

When the range of desks to show contains negative desk numbers
(something like "Module FvwmPager -1 1"), it doesn't react to
mouse button 3 anymore (everything else seems to work as usual)

Regards,
               Peter

Hmmm.  I know it's propagated to all of our secondaries and should be valid

Sometime ago I tried, I gave up on that.  Some apps can be so evil about
changing little things like color.  I will agree that things like colors
and possibly fonts should also be themable.  However, I will also have to
say that it would probably be perferable to avoid trying to themize things
that are outside of fvwm. (anything not fvwm or a module)  Mostly because
there are so many little apps that people use, and massive chaos could
araise trying to keep track of all of them. (Besides, isn't this kinda of
what gnome is trying to do (among other things))

All in all, I think it comes down to the fact that we should decide what is
and isn't themable.  And then work up the methods for doing themes.
Just so we don't kill ourselves trying to do `everything', when a few small
things will do.

I think one or two folks should grab the dist (once it's moved over) and
certify it builds correctly before making the announce.

If we have the modules saving and restoring config files do you think it
makes sense to have a ~/.fvwm2 directory? ~/.fvwm2rc could go in there
as ~/.fvwm2/fvwm2rc and the module conf as e.g. ~/.fvwm2/FvwmAnimate. We
could alter the Send_ConfigInfo message to use ~/.fvwm2/<Module name>
and create a Save_ConfigInfo message.

Modules like FvwmForm could ask for two sets, one for the default and
one for instance specific stuff.

I don't know how pre-processing might fit into this, I'd like to be a
able to have the module config files #include another to set default
colours but I can see it being a bit difficult to save such a set up.

For autoconfiguring I'd like some opinions on the following:
*) At startup fvwm automatically runs the (new) module FvwmAutoConfig.
*) FvwmAutoConfig scans the ModulePath and creates some menus depending
on what it finds:
	*) A run menu with the modules it finds (with mini-icon guestimates)
	*) A stop menu ''
	*) A config menu that calls FvwmForm as Form<Module-name>
*) These three menus placed on the default menu
*) when modules start they create Form<Module-name>
----
Alternative
*) At startup fvwm runs FvwmAutoConfig which does the following
*) creates a ModuleMenu with a submenu (Menu<Module-name>) per modules
*) puts ModuleMenu on the default system menu
*) creates an initial Menu<Module-name> that has Run and Run+args
entries
*) when modules run they manage the Menu<module-name> menu

Am I barking mad?

Auto-sensing and saving into a $HOME/.fvwm2 directory is a good idea I
keep  putting off since  we only have  .fvwm2rc and .FvwmAnimate right
now.

As you  may remember, I've been working  on FvwmForm for a  while now.
Right now, it  auto-creates the form  "FormFvwmForm".   This form lets
you set default  fonts and colors for any  other FvwmForm that doesn't
do overrides.  If I get to it,  it might also create FormFvwmFormHelp.
An actual form painter is only a concept at this point.

As it stands   right now, no matter   what name its  invoked under, it
always reads .FvwmForm looking for defaults.  Then it reads ".<Alias>"
allowing it to be configured from a file rather than from .fvwm2rc.

I'm thinking that I might be able  to autoconfigure an "rlogin" dialog
or a "print screen" dialog, but actual "do anything" autoconfiguration
seems like it's a way off.

Right now, I don't think pre-processing  fits in at  all.  At least it
doesn't   seem to be   applicable  to the  2  modules   I've tried  to
autoconfigure.

This is consistent with where I think we have to go.  Right now,
fvwm2 has a tiny little built-in menu bound to button 1 that allows you
to exit.  All the builtins are hard coded in fvwm.c:

void SetRCDefaults()
{
  /* set up default colors, fonts, etc */
  char *defaults[] = {
    "HilightColor black grey",
    "XORValue 0",
    "SetMenuStyle default black grey slategrey white fixed fvwm"
    "TitleStyle Centered -- Raised",
    "IconFont fixed",
    "WindowFont fixed",
    "Style \"*\" Color lightgrey/dimgrey, Title",
    "Style \"*\" RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement",
    "AddToMenu builtin_menu \"Builtin Menu\" Title",
    "+ \"Exit FVWM\" Quit",
    "Mouse 1 R N Popup builtin_menu",
    "AddToFunc WindowListFunc \"I\" WindowId $0 Iconify -1",
    "+ \"I\" WindowId $0 Focus",
    "+ \"I\" WindowId $0 Raise",
    "+ \"I\" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p",
    NULL
  };

I see all of this coming out of an autoloaded module instead.  I would
expect that  building a module menu  has to be  more than just sensing
that the  module is there, so add  it to a menu.   I think each module
presents its own unique requirements.

you're right I did mean mouse.

With some checking a straight
Mouse 3 T A Lower   -- does work
but a call Move-or-Lower that looks like

AddToFunc Move-or-Lower 
+ "C" Lower
+ "M" Move

now if I add an "I" Lower it will lower but I get a move start.
if I do give Motion then it does a Move.

So the problem seems to be on the click, and with further investigation it
does seem to be related to functions that use "C".

Now I do recall some discussion, about half clicks but I don't think
anything was done but I'm sure someone else can tell me.

I do know that these functions worked with a cvs grab from Monday shortlly
after the tag change to 2_1_3 was made.  So can someone help me out here.

After looking at the changelog I see two refrences to SetClick in
builtins.c and a bunch of stuff hapened in events.c to handle ClickToFocus
windows. So Dominik does this help any or should I start digging (I only
singled you out because your name is on the comment in the ChangeLog, Tim
may have created the patches I lost track overthe holidays).

Maybe that's the problem?  The window cares, but doesn't set the proper
hints?

PS. I know nothing about this, so I'm completely guessing here :)

SetClick has nothing to do with it. I changed the parser and
changed Scr.ClickTime - hmm, come to think of it, should I
have forgotten...? Oh shit, I introduced a fFvwmInStartup
global in fvwm.c that indicates if fvwm has reached the
HandleEvents loop or not. Click time is set to -ClickTime
during startup and obviously I forgot to reset fFvwnInStartup.

I'll see to this immediately.

Brad found an evil bug in 2.1.3 and I must confess it is my
fault. It will be fixed in a minute. If we can rebuild
the distribution or make a new one before the announcements
are posted, we should do so. Sorry about that.

Tim had an idea about the creeping WinList earlier today and
that rang a bell: Perhaps both, the growing windows and the
creeping WinList are caused by HandleWidth vs BorderWidth.
If both values are different and some code fails to
distinguish between them this could exactly explain both
bugs.

Sorry, can't hack that into Jitterbug right now, so if
someone else could do that for me?

Actually, the way I fixed the off by one is integral with the icon part.
(There is actually an off behavior in the original in which icons being moved
interact whilst sitting icons are not interacted with.  The new implementation
is fixes this too).
I tested it more thoroughly than the original so I would have to say that 
part is actually safer than the original patch anyway.  The grid part I can
yank, but it is rather trivial, which is why I sent it anyway.  If you the the
grid yanked, no problem.

So in summary the options are:
1.  No new patch at all, SnapAttraction stands pat.
2.  Full patch, grid and SnapAttraction second arg remain undocumented.
3.  Full patch with manpage patch updating new features.
4.  New patch with grid part removed.  (Since grid is unintrusive I'd rather
    not choose this option).
5.  New off-by-one-pixel fix patch.  This would be a brand new patch, without
    fixing the weird icon behavior.

Version 3 is OK, but not immediately (well, it already missed 2.1.3).
However, I'd suggest to use a more intuitive term instead of 'likes'.

Just call it 2.1.4 and avoid any possible confusion.  The distribution has
already been downloaded several times.  (Ten, to be exact.)

I'm willing to make a 2.1.4 now if people think it's a good idea.  How
widespread is the bug that was fixed; e.g., will it affect everyone, or
only people with a particular config?

Do we know who downloaded?  Are they all members of this list?  It would
be nice if there was some intermediate place to put the package so
people on the list could get at it before it was "public".  Obviously
they wouldn't find this bug, necessarily, although it was found so
quickly it would have probably gotten in, but I'd like to see more
people than just me build the dist, for sanity, before it gets
widespread use.

Tim had an idea about the creeping WinList earlier today and
that rang a bell: Perhaps both, the growing windows and the
creeping WinList are caused by HandleWidth vs BorderWidth.
If both values are different and some code fails to
distinguish between them this could exactly explain both
bugs.

OK, I updated Jitterbug with this info.

I used the "Reply" feature, since that's what Bob used before.

In the past, I've added "Notes" instead.

Does anyone know what the difference is (besides the fact that the reply
is sent via email) and when one would be preferred over the other?

Maybe notes would be more appropriate for this kind of thing, where
we're just adding info to the bug report, and a "reply" would be some
kind of official response to the bug?  Fixed, or not going to be fixed
becase... or whatever?

Even better, don't bother.  One bug  is no big deal,  wait a few days,
and lets get the big picture on 2.1.3.  If we create a 2.1.4 with this
one fix, we are sure to have a 2.1.5.

2.1.3 works fine for me.

I'll put in a second to this idea. It seems like the right thing to do.
Also, if we do something standard for themes, it could be the place to
stick all of the details.

I wonder if we should do some collecting of what people all use it for.
All I use it for is to randomize some pixmaps.  Something I could do more
difficultly with PipeRead.  But perhaps we should consider making the
preprocessors work different?  say something like a modified Read command?
Or some global setting so the preprocessor will sift over any file read by
fvwm?  Perhaps some fvwmlib command to read config files that will
preprocess them?

Just tossing some ideas around.

I have BW 3 and HW 3 for my netscape windows, and it smoothly grows
every now and then when I pick a bookmark from the "personal toolbar"..

	Since Notes are displayed in the item list for a folder, I figured
they probably should be kept short and few, and maybe used to indicate at
a glance some sort of status change, like "I've started working on it",
or "I'm testing a fix today", or "RTFM".

	Because the reply only gets displayed when you open up the item,
the text box there seemed to invite a bit more detailed description or
discussion.

	Anyway, that's how I've been using them. Other ideas...?
