I take it the usual arguments about synthetic X events apply here,
yes?

Does SCWM allow clicks to be faked from the rc file?

Yep, we have such a primitive.  See:

http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/scwm-doc/c01r209.htm

for the docs on it.

Nice online docs!

Clicking on the link to the source code gave me:

Netscape unable to find the file or directory named:
/scratch/gjb/scwm/scwm/events.c

I never understood the issue with  synthetic events.  I thought it had
something to  do with some applications not  accepting them.  Has this
feature caused any problem with Scwm?

Thanks -- they're still rough around the edges, but we extract directly
from the source code and it's turned out to be a *huge* win.

Yep, I know -- those links are mostly just for me, right now.  Once I
work up the install procedure to install the html documentation, then
I'll make options for permitting specification of where the source code
is so that the links will work if you install locally.

Right, lots of applications ignore synthetic events because they are a
security hole.  E.g., xterm, by default, ignores them.  It's caused some 
confusion w.r.t. people not realizing they need to turn on "Allow
Sendevents" in an xterm for them to work.

The original reason I implemented the mouse-button send-events was so I
could follow a link in Netscape w/o touching my mouse.  Netscape does
permit synthetic mouse events, so it's never been a problem for me.

Heres something we haven't seen in a while, a new "mini icon".

I shrunk the XEmacs gnu.xpm, and then touched it  up a bit and it came
out pretty well, if I don't say so.

Please consider including this in a future release:

[ I originally sent this message to Chuck Hines, but he advised me
  that he was no longer actively maintaining FVWM, and that I should
  instead send my message to this list.  I am not subscribed to the
  list.  -- jxh ]

Hello,

I wanted the ability to be able to cycle through my desktops rather
than needing to change directions.  So I hacked one of the functions
in fvwm/virtual.c to allow me to do this.  It involves altering the
syntax of the "Desk" command slightly.  Currently --

     Desk arg1 arg2
        ...

          If arg1 is non zero then the next desktop  number  will
          be  the  current  desktop  number  plus  arg1.  Desktop
          numbers can be negative.

          If arg1 is zero then the new  desktop  number  will  be
          arg2.
        ...

This would now be changed to --

          If arg1 is zero then the new  desktop  number  will  be
          arg2.

          If arg1 is 1 then the next desktop number will  be  the
          current  desktop  number  plus  arg2.  Desktop  numbers
          can be negative.

          If arg1 is greater than 1 the next desktop  number will
          be the current  desktop number  plus arg2  modulo arg1.
          The next desktop number will not be negative.

          If arg1 is less than 0  the next desktop number will be
          the current desktop  number plus  arg2 modulo +/- arg1.
          That is  if the next desktop  number will be less  than
          or equal to arg1  the next desktop number  will  become
          -arg1-1.  If the  next  desktop  number will be greater
          than  or equal to  -arg1  the next  desktop number will
          become arg1+1.  Otherwise the next desktop number keeps
          its calculated value.


Here is the new code I wrote --

Version -- fvwm-2.0.46
File -- fvwm/virtual.c
Function -- changeDesks()
Line -- 441

void  changeDesks(int val1, int val2)
{
  int oldDesk;
  unsigned int modulus, newdesk;

Hi folks,

I wanted to submit a (not so short) patch of FvwmButtons but
I can't reach Brady per email. Since the diffs are about 10k
I am reluctant to post them to the mailing list. What should
I do? Would anybody be so kind and forward the patch to Brady?
Please reply by email since at the moment I have problems
receiving mails from the list too.

Many thanks

Dominik
