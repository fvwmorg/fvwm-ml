Hi,
I have just tried to reconfigure fvwm2 (after the configure.in
changed) and suddenly my libreadline.so is no longer being
recognised. This is what config.log says:

configure:2973: checking with ncurses
configure:2975: checking for readline in -lreadline
configure:2994: gcc -o conftest -O2 -g -Wall -W -fomit-frame-pointer   conftest.c -lreadline   1>&5
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tgetnum'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tgoto'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tgetflag'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `BC'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tputs'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `PC'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tgetent'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `UP'
/usr/lib/libreadline.so: undefined reference to `tgetstr'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 2983 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char readline();

int main() {
readline()
; return 0; }


The key point here is that I don't have a libtermcap.a, and use the
termcap support in ncurses 5.0 instead. Therefore the configure script
*must* use "-lreadline -lncurses". Does anyone know how to fix this?

Cheers,
Chris.

I'd like to update the icons/sounds page with a link to the fvwm
links page and then add the fvwm-themes-config information to the links
page.

Would you like to contribute the wording or perhaps a patch?

Woops, I definitely intended to leave -lncurses. Can you try now?

Ahh, yes, Very good resource. Yes. I tried it out, but I find only one fatal
flaw. It requires fwvm 2.3.x, One of my big things I'm trying to do with
fvwm-themer, is keep it supporting at least fvwm 2.0  and up.

That's left to be seen, so far. fvwm.t.o is going to be looking for the "most
popular" easy to use theme engine. I know. I've already contacted them about
it. ;)

Oh, that? The reason it's so big, is because the Spruce and Spruce 2.3 themes
have wav's in it, for the most part. I should break down and include the bare
base of Motif-Plain/Motif-Plain-2.3 in it, and extrude the themes seperately,
for future use and expansion.
Which, for fvwm-themer 0.3 I will have that done, because of that. :)

Yes. I looked at that, too. VERY nice looking so far. I planned to do the same
thing, using FvwmForm and/or FvwmGtk, with my new engine I'm working to add
version checking support, I'll add a line to check for Gtk, and if 2.3.x+ and
GTK exist, I'll have it use FvwmGtk instead.

hmm.. I'll have to visit there. ;)


One last detail I'd like to iron out though.
fvwm-themes 0.2.4 uses $FVWM_USERHOME.. Is this only available in fvwm 2.3.x?
If so, is there any other way to set that FVWM_USERHOME elsewhere?

FVWM_USERHOME is in 2.3.x only.

There are other things in 2.3.x which might really  help a theme
package, "colorsets", and style update without recapture.

Does this mean you will not support all nice features of fvwm-2.4?
Supporting old versions is nice, but, as it were already said, they are not
designed for themes. 2.4 will be much better and 3.0 will be better yet. :)

I think it is ok to have a separate package for each major fvwm version,
i.e. I suggest you not to port your fvwm-themer to be 2.4 compilant, but
support the mentioned fvwm-themes instead, especially if you like it.

I originally was all for it. Seems good for me to have several (not many)
competing theme formats, and my suggestion was to link to all existing
ones (and a user will choose). But others on the fvwm-themes-devel list
argued that it will be very confusing to the average fvwm.themes.org user.
Now when I see at least 10 different setups, I think, I agree.

My biggest concern about other theme setups is that they are not designed
well in my opinion. I am pretty sure that the standard fvwm-themes format
should be developed by ones who know all fvwm internals. Otherwise it will
just become another unofficial fvwm2rc format.

Eric, I invite you and all others who have time to contribute to work
together and create the best fvwm-themes framework. Noone will like to
have several half functional and incompatible ones. :)

Mikhael.

The patch is this. I have commented out lines 172-173 and added lines
174-180,183. You can also search for word "readline" in configure.in.

As I already mentioned in one of the previous messages, the problem was
with two smr_CHECK_LIB macro calls. So I replaced the second one with the
actual expanded macro implementation (a mini variant), but without a code
adding the usage lines (for the second time). This is from the ChangeLog
and you are still asking, so I suppose you expect to hear something more?

For example, 1) why do we need these two check. This is done because some
users may have termcap, others - ncurses libs (or both of them), and
readline lib requires one of these term libs, so we first check compiling
with -lreadline -ltermcap, then with -lreadline -ncurses.

Or, 2) how did I get to this. By learning *.m4 autoconf macros and
installing/uninstalling readline (I have both libtermcap and libncurses).
It took me a lot of time, because I am learning autoconf stuff too.

Did I answer your question? :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

In fvwm 2.0.0 and up, does fvwm's PipeRead read only STDIN? If I print to
STDERR in a script, will the PipeRead pick that up, or will it be ignored?

I must confess that I usually don't read ChangeLog entries because
the fixes I make are usually too complex for a detailed entry.

PipeRead reads only from STDIN, not from stderr (if you read
from both, you can't know the order in which you have to
parse the input lines).  You probably know this, but just in
case you don't:  you can redirect all output to stderr to
stdin with '2>&1':

  grep "foo" bar 2>&1

Hi ,
I'm having problems with installing fvwm2 (ver 2.2.4)
I have installed xpm (ver 3.4k) under /usr/local/xpm and
ran configure with --with-xpm-library=... --with-xpm-includes=...
as it says in INSTALL.fvwm.
I tried so many times and I always get "Xpm library or header not
found!"
How I deal with it?

Send more info.

Start with the complete command  you typed in  and The complete output
from configure.

If you installed  xpm in /usr/local/xpm, the  2 parameters should have
been:

--with-xpm-library=/usr/local/xpm/lib
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/xpm/include

Hello,

I think that there is a FVWM_USERHOME bug:
In some sense fvwm know FVWM_USERHOME even if it
is not set: in this case fvwm consider that $HOME
is $FVWM_USERHOME and some time (I do not understand
when and why) it is really set to HOME (try
the FvwmScript:
Set $F = (GetOutput {echo $FVWM_USERHOME} 1 -1)
Do {Echo } $F
with $FVWM_USERHOME not set the result is:
[FVWM][Echo]: $HOME   !!??!!?

I think that if the user do not set FVWM_USERHOME then
fvwm have to set it. Moreover, I think that the better
idea is to set it to ~/.fvwm in this case. Why ? because
imagine a user which start fvwm2 without config, then
he use the Setup Form and the Form copy 10 (non cached) 
files: DefaultFvwmBacker, Default* ... in ~/  !? 

Moreover, we can imagine a Welcome Script or Form that 
gives the choice between 

1. Setup Form
2. the future Setup95 Script
3. loading a .fvwm2rc from somewhere

and which is started if no configuration file is
found (E.g., FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc may contain
one line which start this Script/Form).

I'm ready to do a Welcome script.

Olivier

For modules (and currently only for them) $FVWM_USERHOME is always set
and defaults, like in Read, to $HOME.

If we are speaking about this, here is an explanation why defining
  env FVWM_USERHOME=$HOME/.fvwm fvwm2 ...

as the WM command of a session menager is not enough. fvwm is restarted
by SM, and in the new process $FVWM_USERHOME is not set. So for "env ..."
to have effect, it should be added before gnome-session or xsm instead.

I was among ones arguing setting any global environment in all spawned
processes. Now I think it is ok to have $FVWM_USERHOME to be explicitly
set if needed, for consistency, because now scripts may do the work of
modules (like fvwm-menu-* scripts). But this is not really a problem.
The problem is the $HOME default.

I will post a patch doing this correctly (i.e. without breaking anything).
I had this in my queue of things to do, from the time we decided on
~/.fvwm default (before feature freeze).

I have no an opinion here yet.

If you want to do something like this, you can write a Setup Wizard using
FvwmScript, prompting about downloading the latest fvwm-themes (which is
probably not small enough to be included in fvwm itself), then installing
it to the system or user space, and restarting fvwm with the new configs.
I can provide you with all needed shell commands to do this.

This is what the FvwmButtons man page has to  say about "Pixmap none":

     *FvwmButtonsPixmap pixmapfile
          Specifies a background pixmap to use.   Specify  "none"
          for a transparent background.

It neglects   to mention that  this  suppresses  the window  title and
frame.

I  can't find  an  explanation of this behavior   in the fvwm man page
either.

Is this something fvwm does automatically to all shaped windows?

I don't understand what you are proposing.

We already have a setup form, "modules/FvwmForm/FormFvwmSetup.in".
Is that the same thing you are referring to in "1" above?

We don't really use anything from system.fvwm2rc  anymore, all of that
has been moved into a number of installable config files starting with
fvwm/ConfigFvwmSetup which gets installed as $FVWM_USERHOME/.fvwm2rc
by the setup form.  (Is'nt that the same thing you are describing in
"3" above?)

If you want to extend this to install a "95" type setup,
FormFvwmSetup would be the logical place to do it.

If you want to rewrite FormFvwmSetup using FvwmScript, I don't see
any problem with that.

Definitely not.  The must be a reason why FvwmButtons does
it this way.

Around line 410 in decorations.c:

#ifdef SHAPE
  if (ShapesSupported)
  {
    if(t->wShaped)
      decor &= ~(DECOR_BORDER|MWM_DECOR_RESIZEH);
  }
#endif

Disable it and you can get titles on shaped windows.
I suspect this is a change from the early days of fvwm
because I had a "Style xeyes NoTilte" line in my .fvwm2rc
that isn't necessary any more.

There must be other things  at work since  this turns off the  border,
and I end up with a title bar but still  no border.  I also killed the
code in add_window.c around line 432 but I still didn't have a border.

I'm not suggesting changing anything.  I'm just looking at the options
for a FAQ answer for the "desktop launcher" question.

Um, really?  Looks like a bug to me.  DECOR_BORDER shouldn't control
whether a window gets a title or not.  

Hm, checking again, deleting the DECOR_BORDER bit is essentially
a NOP.  This bit is never used anywhere else.

The SetShape() function in borders.c applies the shape.  There's
definitely code to handle a shaped window with border or title.
I don't understand why shaped windows don't have titles by default.
I'll probably have a look into this too.

Yes.

No, imagine that a user upgrade from 2.2.x to 2.4.X but now the default
installation for the config file is ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc. Then, with 3 he
can install the old ~/.fvwm2rc file in ~/.fvwm/ (and get some little pbs).
About the system.fvwm2rc my idea is that if a new user start fvwm without
config then fvwm gives some feedback: a welcome Script/Form is started
that give some instruction to install a config file (if not with some
new unix user it is: Ctl-Alt-F1, killall -9 fvwm2 because he see only
a grey screen). So my proposition for system.fvwm2rc is a one line config:
AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmForm/Script Form/ScriptWelcome

I suggest that the default config and sample-95 (and may be
other configs) have its own config script/form. For example,
for sample-95 I do a quite elaborated script that allows the
user to set some preferences (as the FormFvwmSetup ask the
user about adding modules configs). I will try to commit
as soon as possible my work on sample-95 for clarification.

If a new user starts fvwm without a config file, almost anything
he does should cause the default menu to pop up.
(F1, Help, or any button press.)

I hacked a local copy to insert (relative) page # on the left side of the
menu just before the name. Wouldve preferred absolute page....but that would
require knowledge of how to do it.

Params on left side make em easier to line up w/ name.

My next trick will be to prepend title w/ class, then sort, then print only
title.

I dropped support for 2.2 for the time being, till I can get some decent
version depenancy checking working by use of forms or FvwmScript. I figured for
the time being, with the new engine as more featured as it is, I could just
remove the 2.2 support for now, and make the current stuff work, then backtrack
it, and get 2.2.x stuff working. 
My problem with fvwm-themes is the restarting of fvwm when you make a
configuration change, the seperate options you can use amongs all the themes.
That's a bad concept, and why I went away from AfterStep, for one. Another, is,
if someone else, NOT part of the fvwm-themes team makes a theme and uses
totally different options not nicely congruently working together, you have
what I call, conflict of interest. fvwm-themer is a project I've wanted to do
for a long time, and over the period of 2 weeks, I've been doing it. Quite
successfully, so far, too. ;)
I'm not on some ego trip like a small handful might think, I just have specific
wants.

What? Steal design parts? The only thing I've even _started_ to use was the
ScriptsUtilsMessage, and I don't even have it implemented in 0.3's release. The
only other snippet I've used is now a very highly hacked up voidme theme
listing engine, as part of the initTheme section.

I've taken 2 weeks, doing fvwm-themer, and IMHO, is right next door to your
fvwm-themes. Still have a couple design flaws, which have been temporarily
disabled for a stable release, so I could take a break for a day or two.  With
something much more ready to be released than 0.2. ;)

Fixed.  The MWM_DECOR... flags were screwed up.  To be precise
I've translated them to a fvwm specific format a while ago but
forgot to remove one of the old flags (namely DECOR_BORDER).

Eric, you replied to the wrong list, so I need to continue this flame in

This is wrong, there is no Restart. If you speak about a long time, we are
disscussing this now, it is solved by implementing component dependancies.

Please clarify yourself, what exactly is a bad concept? I suggest you to
scan fvwm-themes-devel archives on "global vus local options" discussions.

Did you try to contact fvwm-themes team? We are not closed minds. Instead,
we are trying to implement everything peoples on our list request and
are searching for more developers.

Did you try to install and use your own version? :) The install script has
a syntax error and the theme script explicitly die's on different checks.

Sorry, I can't believe this. You would not announce every several days
your untested versions on freshmeat and you would join fvwm-themes-devel
list to discuss all fvwm theme aspects if it would be really no ego trip.
I wish to be wrong on this, of course.

You call your versions stable, this should be an April joke. :) The
version can't be stable if it is based on unstable fvwm and the theme
format is changed every few days. Your current 0.3 is less stable (after
fixing start bugs) and much less functional than our internal releases
from January. And we called them pre-alpha. Our current versions are very
strong and usable, but we are still call them alpha. To be called beta we
should at least finalize format and release specs for theme components.

Ok, I will not try to convince you to join fvwm-themes anymore,
but the door is always open for everybody, who really cares about fvwm.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Description:
	Many programs does not supply meaningful position and size
	values for their windows, and many does not heed a geometry
	setting in the X resources.  This is especially marked with GTK
	applications.

	A good example of the problem are the dialogs of Gimp and the
	associated guash plugin.  They make progress dialogs when
	loading and saving files, and successive dialogs wander along the
	screen, as they are placed automatically.  There is no way to
	control their positioning with fvwm, not as far as I know at
	least.  GTK and Gimp does not give any control over the placing.

	I would like to be able to tell fvwm to place these dialogs in a
	fixed position, like centered on the screen or centered on
	50%,25%.

	A solution to such behaviour would be to set a default position
	and/or size in the Style for the windows, with styles like
	InitialPosition and InitialSize.  Alternatively a WindowInitFunc
	could be specified, to be called when the window is mapped. That
	function could then move and resize the window.

	It would be very useful to be able to place a window centered on
	a given position, without knowing the size of the window.

	Another example comes to mind. I have used StarOffice a bit, and
	it makes one huge window. I then started it with the same
	setup-files on another machine, and the window came up larger
	than the screen. MaxWindowSize fixed that, but the window was
	still placed with origin outside the screen.  An 'InitialPosition
	0 0' could have solved that. Likewise 'InitialSize 100 100'
	could force it to start full-screen.

	Arguably this should not be in the window manager, but I don't
	think gtk will be made to use X resources in the future. I am
	afraid the gtk and Gimp developers will say this is a window
	manager issue, that the application should dictate where to
	place the windows.

Look at your NoPPostion/UsePPosition setting, it affects how fvwm pays
attention to application supplied hints.

Have you tried the various "placement" options fvwm provides,
"Smart", "Clever", "Dumb", ...

Also look at FvwmEvent.  I think you may be able to write functions
that recognize specific windows and move and resize them as they are
created.

Hi all, I'm fiddling with dynamic menus again. I play with them on and
off, but at this point, I'm fairly certain that something funny's
happening. The current version that I'm working with is at

http://www.best.com/~mikehan/PerlMenu

The output it yields looks like this:

AddToMenu /home/mikehan MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingMenu
AddToMenu /home/mikehan DynamicPopdownAction DestroyMenu recreate /home/mikehan
AddToMenu /home/mikehan 1 Popup /home/mikehan/1
AddToMenu /home/mikehan 107 Popup /home/mikehan/107
AddToMenu /home/mikehan 120 Popup /home/mikehan/120
AddToMenu /home/mikehan 134 Popup /home/mikehan/134
...

Note that I defined:

AddToMenu /home/mikehan DynamicPopupAction PipeRead PerlMenu /home/mikehan
AddToFunc MakeMissingMenu I PipeRead PerlMenu $0

When I try to popup a submenu of /home/mikehan, such as
/home/mikehan/1, I get a bunch of errors:

[FVWM][add_item_to_menu]: <<ERROR>> menu /home/mikehan is in use

and no submenu ever pops up.

I'm confused. Can anyone out there who knows about the dynamic menu
stuff tell me if I'm doing something that's obviously wrong? Output
from PerlMenu when invoked for a submenu looks like this:

AddToMenu /home/mikehan/1 MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingMenu
AddToMenu /home/mikehan/1 DynamicPopdownAction DestroyMenu recreate
/home/mikehan/1
AddToMenu /home/mikehan/1 /home/mikehan/1 Nop

If I add a "Beep" to the head of the output, when I navigate onto the
item with a submenu I get a bunch of beeps, so I know that FVWM is
correctly executing the missing submenu function. The only thing I can
think of right now is that somehow FVWM is trying to addtomenu to
/home/mikehan instead of /home/mikehan/1.

So, any thoughts?

By the way, while trying to figure this out, I discovered that the
manpage is wrong. The manpage says that the token for missing submenu
creation is "MissingSubmenuFunc" but the code really works with
"MissingSubmenuFunction". I have a manpage patch attached, though
perhaps the manpage is "right" and the code is wrong?

Seems like you want to reimplement fvwm-menu-directory, included in fvwm
2.3.7; it can even be in your $PATH. You can run it to get the correct
output; there are a lot of options (--help). Other fvwm-menu-* scripts
{desktop,headlines} use dynamic menus too and have good manpages.

This should actually be:

DestroyMenu recreate /home/mikehan
AddToMenu /home/mikehan MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingMenu
AddToMenu /home/mikehan DynamicPopdownAction DestroyMenu /home/mikehan

Everything else within your script seems to be correct.

Since all scripts shipped with fvwm, including Dominik's ones use
MissingSubmenuFunction, this should be the "right" name. :)

I'm not all that familiar with FvwmButtons.  Here's something that seems
to work, that I'd like to add to the FAQ for an "icon app launcher":

# FvwmButtons icon launcher:
DestroyFunc Launcher
AddToFunc Launcher
+ I DestroyModuleConfig $0Launch.*
+ I *$0Launch.Columns 1
+ I *$0Launch.(1x3, Icon $1, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
+ I *$0Launch.Pixmap none
+ I *$0Launch.(Font 9x15bold, Fore White, Back DarkBlue, Title $0, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
+ I Style $0Launch. HandleWidth 0, NoTitle
+ I Module FvwmButtons $3 $0Launch.
# Examples:
Launcher RXVT xterm.xpm "rxvt" "-g +0+0"
Launcher XV   xv.xpm    "xv"   "-g +0+100"


It seems to work, but I'm not sure I'm  using documented behavior with
the "Pixmap none" being overridden by the "(Back".

I'm also not sure about doing the icon as 1x3  to get the label placed
right.

Any comments?

That looks really nice :-)  Good old FvwmButtons always has a
surprise ready for you.

What you're doing is okay; but transparency isn't well documented.
Looking at the code I see that with transparency enabled:

 1) Reliefs and all parts not belonging to a button are transparent.
 2) Button icons are transparent where the icon itself is transparent.
 3) Button titles are *not* transparent.

(3) is a bit surprising.  From SetTransparentBackground() (FvwmButtons.c):

line 560 ff.

  /*
   * if button has an icon, draw a rect with the same size as the icon
   * (or the mask of the icon),
   * else draw a rect with the same size as the button.
   */
  if(b->flags&b_Icon)
  {
    ...
  }
  else
  {
    number=buttonNum(b);
    XFillRectangle(Dpy,pmap_mask,trans_gc,buttonXPos(b,number),
      buttonYPos(b,number),
      buttonWidth(b),buttonHeight(b));
  }

1) Try using specific geometries for buttons and the whole window:

# FvwmButtons icon launcher:
DestroyFunc Launcher
AddToFunc Launcher
+ I DestroyModuleConfig $0Launch.*
+ I *$0Launch.Geometry 64x68
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ I *$0Launch.Columns 1
+ I *$0Launch.Rows    4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ I *$0Launch.(1x3+0+0, Icon $1, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
               ^^^^^^^
+ I *$0Launch.Pixmap none
+ I *$0Launch.(1x1+0+3, Font 9x15bold, Fore White, Back DarkBlue, Title $0, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
               ^^^^^^^
+ I Style $0Launch. HandleWidth 0, NoTitle
+ I Module FvwmButtons $3 $0Launch.
# Examples:
Launcher rxvt xterm.xpm "rxvt" "-g +0+0"
Launcher xv   xv.xpm    "xv"   "-g +0+72"

2) Use a colour set instead of Back/Fore to get rid of this
   ugly border around the icon title, 

3) I'd not use a bold font for the icon titles.

4) We need an 'icon box' for windows (a 'window box' :-) ).
   This way these icons could easily be lined up without
   specifying a geometry.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Recently, 'automake --add-missing' throws this warning:

  aclocal.m4: 233: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete; use `AC_PROG_INSTALL'

Mikhael, is this an effect of your latest patch?

Bye

I'm trying to make am FvwmButton panel with specific ideas in mind. Those
ideas are as follows:

Both, FvwmStartGoodstuff, and FvwmGoodstuff, the FvwmStartGoodstuff
panalizes FvwmGoodstuff.
But, when I try to do specifics like sizing swallowed modules and
program, it's never perfect.

1> I'm trying to make a 50x50-sized FvwmPager with no label.
2> Add an IconMan that swallows up the rest of the FvwmButtons till the
next modules.
3> swallowed 50x50 xbiff, that you can click on and have it run
something.
4> swallowed 50x50 xload, that you can click on and have it run
something.
5> swallowed clock (like asclock-gtk)

1 should be on the left side, 3, 4, and 5 taking the right side. And 2
being all the rest of that in between 1 and 3,4,5.

Also, on top of it all, right now, I'm PipeReading a simple perlscript
that grabs the X display resolution, so it can be "maximized" to the
horizontal width of the screen. Is there a better way around that?

Well, I managed to find a bug in FvwmIconMan.
While trying to make my FvwmGoodstuff button bar for my spruce theme, I
managed to find that if someone sets the *FvwmIconMan*Title "", panalizes
it in an FvwmButtons panel, it does cooky strange stuff when nothing's
listed under Iconman.

Also, forgot to ask about:
Is it possible to make an FvwmButtons Panel expanded when first loaded,
instead of shrunk down to just the indicater?

Which fvwm version do you use?  This is hard to answer without that
information.  I've been using '*FvwmIconMan*Title ""' and an iconman
swallowed in FvwmButtons without any problems for a long time.  If you
use any fvwm version older than 2.2.x, try upgrading to 2.2.4.  If that
doesn't help please provide a screenshot of the 'cooky strange stuff'
you mention.

Finally I have pinned down the rxvt selection problem to
a single commit.

[The problem is that if you drag a window (you have to do it
fast over a rxvt window, some text in the rxvt is often
selected - depending on the load of the X server.  Try to
run 'while;true; do ls; done' in a shell on the screen to
keep the X server busy if necessary.]

The problem is not present in the code I get with

  cvs checkout -D 10/29/1999 -P -d fvwm

and starts with

  cvs checkout -D 10/31/1999 -P -d fvwm

The difference in the ChangeLog is the BUSY_CURSOR patch:

  1999-10-30  Olivier Chapuis  olivier.chapuis@free.fr

          * NEWS: BusyCursor, EscapeFunc and CursorStyle.
          * fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults: add the binding Key Escape A MC EscapeFunc
          ...
  
  1999-10-25  Hippo

Olivier, can you please help debugging this?  I'm fairly sure
that it has something to do with 'grabbing', but I have no idea
what exactly could cause it.  The configure option disabling the
BUSYCURSOR patch doesn't fix the problem, so probably you missed
something with that option.  Possibly it would even happen with
2.3.16 if the BUSYCURSOR patch was completely removed.  So it is
probably best to take the cvs from 31st or October, and remove
the diffs to cvs from 29th of October until the problem goes away.
Then we can see if the same changes to current cvs fix the problem
too.

Bye

Hello,
I've done a lot of change to sample-95. May be I go to far in one or
two directions, but if someone (or may be two) want I can remove some
of the new "functionalies". Also, I've some interrogation and request.
(For more info: read the beginning and the end of the file.)

New stuff that can cause problems (flames on other points are welcome):
- Now there is a script (ScriptFvwmSetup95) for installing sample-95.
(However, sample-95 "works" as it is, but with some minor pbs which 
are solved using the settings submenu). If you want that I add some
applications in the choices widget say me (especially for the .au player).
- The change you done via the settings submenu (up the first separator)
is saved for the next fvwm session.

Interrogations & help request:
- ScriptFvwmSetup95 use a one line perl script for installing sample-95
(if perl is not installed sed and cp is used but you cannot choose your
"preferences"). I think that it will be more sure to use a non executable
script install-sample-95.pl in FVWM_CONFIGDIR (if you've got pbs installing 
sample-95 it comes from this one line perl script). Any objections?
- I think it will be better to have a multi-file configurations. But
to do so we've to change the default FVWM_USERHOME to, say, ~/.fvwm.
If it is the case I can do so that install-sample-95.pl do the segmentation
of sample-95.
- It will be very easy to switch to FvwmTheme and to add a very elementary
theme engine (just for colors and window buttons (not button bindings)). 
The only problem is to found at least 10 "colors palettes". 
Any suggestions ?

Warning: I've written a lot of english ... But I will try to re-read all
this english ...

Finally, the problem is solved.  It was indeed introduced by the
BUSYCURSOR patch.  In execute_complex_function() (functions.c),
A UngrabEm() call was moved to a delicate place:

This code around line 1439 (current CVS)
  while(fi != NULL)
    {
      /* make lower case */
      c = fi->condition;
      ...
        ExecuteFunction(taction,tmp_win,ev,context,-2,expand_cmd);
      ...
    }
  WaitForButtonsUp(False);
  UngrabEm();                 <-----

was changed to this:

  UngrabEm(GRAB_NORMAL);      <-----
  while(fi != NULL)
    {
      /* make lower case */
      c = fi->condition;
      ...
        ExecuteFunction(taction,tmp_win,ev,context,-2,expand_cmd);
      ...
    }
  WaitForButtonsUp(False);

I.e. before the BUSYCURSOR patch, the pointer was grabbed throughout
a complex function until the button was release.  After the patch
the pointer was not grabbed anymore.  Now this explains nicely why
the selection problem happened:

 1) Press button on window title.
 2) The pointer is grabbed automatically in the selected window.
 3) The complex function is executed.
 4) Before the 'Move' command is called, above code releases the
    automatic grab on the pointer!
 5) Move the pointer fast over another window.  Sometimes when the
    X server is too busy, the mouse is ahead of the window.
 6) Now, the crucial point is that the pointer is not grabbed
    anymore.  Thus, 'MotionNotify' events are reported to the rxvt
    because rxvt has selected them spcifically.
 7) rxvt interprets the MotionNotify events with a button held as
    user input and selects text in its window until the moving
    window catches up with the pointer!!!

So, the fix is to move the UngrabEm() call back down after
WaitForButtonsUp().  The big question is: why was it moved up
in the first place?  Probably because you can't grab the BUSYCURSOR
if the pointer is already grabbed.  Well, Olivier, you have to
think of a different way to achieve this.  The pointer must not
be ungrabbed for a single CPU cycle or otherwise the problem might
come back again.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Thanks.  I still think its silly to launch an app from an icon,
but what can you do...

Actually   if you put  a  title on  the icon itself,  its placed quite
nicely but  the background is    transparent.  Thats why  I used   the
separate item.

I  feel dumb, I missed the  part of the  man page  that explained that
these geometry units are in button units, not pixels.

Hmm, I  didn't   think the 3d  relief   was ugly,  it  looked  like an
improvement to me.

As long as Colorsets  sit in an optional module  they don't  seem like
core  functionality.  Anyone else think Colorsets  should be moved out
of module land before 2.4?

I'm my own X environment, I use 100% bold fonts.

I'll experiment a little more.

The icon box code probably could be generalized to place classes of windows.

One could have  a Piperead driven shell  script that would read a list
of apps/icons to create launchers from and do  the arithmetic to place
them.

I   don't  know how  much   we should encourage    this, icons are for
minimized applications after all.

I feel similarly, although seems interesting.

While the background color is in the right limits, the 3d-border is nice,
but once it is more close to black or white... I wonder, is motif so ugly,
or the included algorithm uses "not-nice" constants?.. Maybe both. :)

How you "boldify" text in man pages or web pages then?
IMHO, there are enough nice fonts (in all variants, normal, bold, italic).

Is not it better to have one transparent FvwmButtons bar with many icons?
Well, it is static, but a script may regenerate it if needed.

	Congratulations, Dominik! This is a most impressive piece of detective
work.

been so tight that I haven't even had time to do an update in a couple

just to see this problem disappear!), but I do try to follow the list

Yes, I think. Sorry, this story begin when I commit
ScriptFvwmSetup95 in the place of ScriptFvwmSetup95.in
(so, building fail and commit commit it). I will remove
it.

--------------B2295ACAD7514C82DCE15086
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I've been meaning to report this for awhile now, but it's now become so
annoying that I must!  :)

To demonstrate this clearly, I provide a "simple form".

DestroyModuleConfig SimpleForm.*
*SimpleForm.WarpPointer
*SimpleForm.Line center
*SimpleForm.Text "$Title"
*SimpleForm.Line center
*SimpleForm.Selection simple multiple
*SimpleForm.Choice REST REST off "Restart Form?"
*SimpleForm.Line expand
*SimpleForm.Button quit "END"
*SimpleForm.Command $(REST?Module FvwmForm SimpleForm. Title=SimpleForm
REST=on)
*SimpleForm.Nop

At a console, have fvwm "Read" that form in, thusly....

Read /path/to/SimpleForm.
(Note: the trailing dot "." is important!)

Then invoke the form via a command like....

Module FvwmForm SimpleForm. Title=SimpleForm REST=on

The Choice button does not appear selected on startup.
Is this a bug? Or just not implemented properly?

TIA

Alex

Me too.  These icons are always buried below a window when I

Well, (2) and (3) are a matter of personal taste.  I don't like
thick lines like the 3d relief (I wouldn't bother if the line
was only one pixel) or bold fonts.  Of course this depends on
your display resolution too.  Perhaps the script should explicitly
set the relief width so that the user can easily change it (don't
ask me which setting).

I can think of a few situations where this would come in handy.
E.g. sometimes I have to start a number of similar shells on different
machines (e.g. windows just doing a ping).  Usually I have to spend
several minutes until all these windows are lined up nicely so that
I can see all their contents.

Well, perhaps this doesn't justify a 'window box' style.  In the end
this is only about initial placement.  You won't want the windows
rearranged when you switch pages.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

This last line of course should read "*SimpleForm.Command Nop"
But I think you'll get the idea!  :-)

I think that when I do the  BUSYCURSOR ifdef commit I send to you, Dominik,
a private message to say that I've do this UngrabEm() move in complex
functions when I do the busy cursor patch. At this time we conclude 
that this move was a good move. I do not remember why we do such
conclusion. I'm far from the machine I used to send to you this
message, but you may take a look to your mail archive and this
may answer the question.

I need to check again, but I think that your commit is consistent
with the busy cursor patch.

Yes, I can remember this very vaguely, but whatever our

Okay.  If we don't have to change anything - excellent.

Perhaps.

I won't be offended if you replace the example I came up with with one

Subject: I believe I've found a bug in PipeRead

There's been a problem itching on me about PipeRead, and I think I
finally figured it was a definate bug.

I've been attempting to make a theme engine, much like that of
fvwm-themes, but using PipeReads instead of Read's and generating files.
Well, come to find out, after vigorous hours of testing, that somehow
there's either a bug, or something I'd need to do to get PipeRead to work
right.

Everytime I Try and PipeRead, not everything gets read, before it starts
dabbling off in other places. Yet, when I generate out files of the same
information, and Read them, the whole system seems to work without any
problems.

Is that normal, or can it be gotten around?

dabbles: to work at anything in an irregular or superficial manner: to
dabble in literature.


The PipeRead command executes the generated commands as it reads them.
It should keep reading until  the there are   no more commands on  the
pipe.

Can you post an example?

It certainly is a revolution.

I agree with your comment, the file is way too big.

I wish you would fold your "QuitVerify" enhancement into
FormFvwmQuitVerify.

The file: modules/FvwmScript/Scripts/system.fvwmrc
doesn't seem to have a purpose.  I don't think you added it.

I don't see why the installation script does all that work
for ImagePath.  All but the users ImagePath should be built in.

I wish this was more integrated into the previous setup form.
I don't see how a new user can decide which one to use.
He can't use both.

The Solaris audioplayer is "audioplay".

It didn't create a ".fvwm2rc" for me.  I already have $FVWM_USERHOME
set to $HOME/.fvwm.

I found this on my console:

Hello,
 
I think it is a good idea to move FvwmTheme into fvwm since
the "good way" to use colors in fvwm is to use FvwmTheme.
If there is a volunteer for doing that I think he may try
to convince Mikhael to remove his negative vote.

But most important from my point of view is that we may try
to do so that FvwmTheme is fully functional for fvwm before 2.4:
currently only fg, bg, hi and sh is used in Title and Border.
If nobody plan to do this I'm ready if there is two votes for
that and no vote against.

No, I said, that I am *not* against. I don't want to vote on this one.

If 2.4 is compatible with 2.2 (is it?), {Title,Button,Border}Style should
be supported; on the other hand they should be dropped after 2.4.
Do you want to redesign and reimplement title/button/border logic now? :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, this is normal :(. I will do a non executable external perl script 
script-fvwm-setup95.pl. It is impossible to write a one line perl 
script in FvwmScript since it is impossible to write { and },
so I use the ascii code but it seems that this does not work on
your machine (I was a quite naive here).

Thanks, for trying sample-95, 
Olivier

Fvwm2 could be made looking MUCH better with support for bloated Pixmaps in
Titles.
Gradient aint enough =)

Yes, the author of kanji support unfortunately seems to have
lost interest in this patch before the work was completed
(He wrote the patch for an old version of fvwm.  I tried to
adapt it for the current versions, but didn't get any help
from him.) So, with the next release (2.4) this option will
probably be removed again.  We still had the vague hope that
someone would volunteer to complete the patch - thus this
option is still enabled).  Sorry if this has mislead you
to think that --enable-kanji actually works.

Personally I'm quite happy with a module.  I can't see any
advantage in having this in the main module other than speed -
and speed is currently no critical factor in FvwmTheme.

See above.

FvwmTheme *is* fully functional.  Fvwm can't handle the
pixmaps provided by FvwmTheme everywhere.  We can't simply put
a pixmap from FvwmTheme on window borders/titles because

 1) Gradients would have to be drawn manually each time the
    title is updated.  This is too slow with the way that
    FvwmTheme (or a reimplementation in the main module) works.
    It will require a major redesign/enhancement of FvwmTheme
    to achieve an acceptable speed.
 2) ...Style can't use stacked pixmaps with FvwmTheme.

I'm absolutely against starting this now.  We really need to
focus on fixing the many bugs in the current cvs.  I promise to
provide an updated to-do list for 2.4 (containing all the bugs
that have queued up in my mail) until the end of the week.

Bye

I'm not good at English.

I'm sorry that this option will be removed at version 2.4. So, I
looked souce. So, I can compile with --enable-kanji. And, I changed
.fvwm2rc .

-------------------------------------
# make sure these fonts exist on your system:
WindowFont "-adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-jis-fixed-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*"
#WindowFont a16
IconFont "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-misc-fixed-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*"
-------------------------------------

So, I can display kanji at Window Title. But I cannot display at Icon
Menu and Root Menu. I don't know that souce files are bad or that
.fvwm2rc is bad, Sorry.

I applied your patch.

If we hear that --enable-kanji works, we will leave the feature in.

If you can, please send more patches.

Well, perhaps I should simply find out the gaps in the implementation
and document appropriately.  There were some places where I didn't
understand the original patch.  I didn't apply the relevant parts,
so the patch is not complete.  But it wouldn't hurt much to leave
this option in if it is clear that the code is not supported.

Probably icon titles are one of the places where the patch
is incomplete.  I can't promise to do anything about it soon,
though.  I hope someday we find the time to do i18n support
properly.

Pretty neat.

My current ImagePath is way too long for your display:

The font in the title bar gets truncated:

The menus refer to "xv" as "xview".  I don't think thats the right name.


I got these on my console:

<<< Thu Apr 13 13:24:46 2000 >>>
' instead.

The "fvwm-menu-xlock" part is my fault, fvwm is not in my path.


In fvwmbuttons I've got a 3x3 grid of mini-icons.
Only the first 2 and the last 3 buttons have mini-icons:

My "biff" application is "SSxbiff".  The style "*biff" would work

ok, that didn't solve the problem either. what solved it was to use ksh
instead of sh, I think our system setup here is a bit crooked

But this is not that GNU test says.

Yes, on this system sh has an internal test (aka [), contradicting with
/bin/test. For example, it has no -e (a nonsense); this creates problems.
I will support this system in the next releases. Thank you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ugh, I was going to suggest a:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmIconMan*transient*dontshow*

until I remembered that FvwmIconMan uses '*' to separate configuration
subparts, which is inconvenient if you're trying to
DestroyModuleConfig. I think this is bad.  FvwmIconMan and
DestroyModuleConfig shouldn't find the same character interesting in
different ways.

In the meantime, you might be able to escape the non-terminating
asterisks, but I just don't know what fvwm does inside of
DestroyModuleConfig.

Ok, about xcolorset and XSysStats, a priori we can expect that all
apps will be in the menus and that all apps in the menus be on the 
path. But, I will do so that that the perl script will parse the
menus for checking that the apps are in the path.
So, Every body can ask for adding any apps in the programs menu!

It will be fine to get a solaris support. I've solaris at work (currently
far from it), but I've never try to add a real "dt*" support in my
config, may be, Dan, you have done this in your machine? If yes can you
send me the relevant part of your config? Especially menu and styles.
When, I begin to try adding such support I've got 3 problems:
- How to detect Solaris? may be a test like [ -d /usr/dt ] ?
- At work, the dt apps (/usr/dt/bin) are not in the path, is this
the default? Is it "universal" to run dt apps as /usr/dt/bin/dt*
- I never succeed to run directly the dt "applications manager",
it is via dtfile I imagine but I never find the good option
(the better I can do is to open dtfile within /usr/dt/...apps.../C)

What are 'bloated' pixmaps?  Do you mean pixmaps that
are stretched to fit the title?  Fvwm already has tiled
pixmaps.  Example from the man page:

  TitleStyle ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) Inactive (TiledPixmap wood.xpm)

Right you are.  I wonder where I copied those icons to?

The only dt app I use is dtcm.
dtfile worked with your config, but I don't normally use it.

/usr/dt will identify CDE on AIX, HP and Solaris.

I don't know what the default is.

I don't like dtlogin.  Everyone using the fvwm environment
has the support staff disable dtlogin which gets rid of dtprofile.

I configure dt apps like this:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/dt/bin
MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/dt/man
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/dt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/ucblib

In the .xinitrc:
xset fp+ /usr/dt/config/xfonts/C

And Linux :-)  There's a Linux port of CDE.

Yes, I think it's the default (at least on HP-UX I'm sure).  The
default user is not supposed to start these from a shell.

Hello,
I've tested your TaskBar config.

One click blank the icon (you see that a mail arrives and so you will see
if a new one arrives). Double click will do the action you want.

I'm unable to reproduce this problem. The tip work normally on my machine
with your config. You say that you have two strange lines and that's all.
This is strange: do you have a black box that "fill" this 2 lines? May be
you can send a little screen shot to the fvwm-workers@fvwm.org mailing
list.

Answer to the following questions may help debugging
- What happen if you use 
*FvwmTaskBarTipsBack white
*FvwmTaskBarTipsFore black
- Do you have the same problem if netscape does not run. 
Say that you can make a test with only an xterm running. 
Netscape use a lot of colors and can cause problems. There are 
solutions to solve this but I do not know them.

Hello,

For *me* sample-95 is finished, I will just fix bugs (only minor
I hope), apply any "simple good" suggestion and finish the CDE 
support.

Any body can add the applications and styles that he wants
since menus and also styles are parsed to check if the apps 
are in the path (please supply a mini-icons in the menu and add 
a MiniIcon style if needed from fvwm_icons). Instructions are 
given in the beginning of the file.

Unfortunately, I've wrote a lot of english ...
Dan can you take a look to ScriptFvwmSetup95.in and to
the beginning and the end of sample-95?
 
Olivier

I'm curious.  I find the word "Taille" (cut?) in all these files:

cd /u/tools/dane/fvwm/version-2_3_16/modules/FvwmScript/Scripts/
grep -ni taille * /dev/null
ScriptFvwmBaseConfig:2:WindowSize 650 405		# Taille
ScriptFvwmBellSetup:2:WindowSize 360 190		# Taille
ScriptFvwmButtons:2:WindowSize 548 95		# Taille
ScriptFvwmDate:2:WindowSize 360 330		# Taille
ScriptFvwmFileBrowser:2:WindowSize 360 340		# Taille
ScriptFvwmFind:2:WindowSize 520 340		# Taille
ScriptFvwmKeyboardSetup:2:WindowSize 360 240		# Taille
ScriptFvwmPointerSetup:2:WindowSize 320 250		# Taille
ScriptFvwmQuit:2:WindowSize 400 265		# Taille
ScriptFvwmScreenDump:2:WindowSize 360 360		# Taille
ScriptFvwmScreenSetup:2:WindowSize 695 400		# Taille
ScriptFvwmSetup95.in:2:WindowSize 610 360		# Taille
grep finished (matches found) at Sun Apr 16 12:19:06

even after looking the word up, I still don't know what its doing
there.  Is it a warning that the window size truncates the display?

I think that the authors of FvwmScript, Frederic Cordier, is french.
Taille means size, I never remove these comments (and even 
propagated it via cut-and-past). Do I understand your question?

 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a

     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.

 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.

 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]

     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.


Bye

>     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]

Perhaps we ought to consider this bug "unreproducible"? I know we
haven't gotten authoritative word back from Ron, but no one ever
managed to reproduce the bug, nor did he ever specify the version he
used. I just reread the thread and both Peter Forman and I failed to
reproduce the bug with various versions of amaya, including the (at
that time) latest version. Just for kicks, I just tried v2.4 on
FreeBSD 4 out of ports and it still works fine, as it always has. I
notice that it *is* one of those naughty apps that positions itself at
0,0.

If we want to track down the bug, perhaps it was related to Digital
Unix's libXm and fvwm's motif capabilities? Haven't there been some
recent fixes to fvwm's motif hinting?

Anyway, without input from Ron, it seems unlikely that anyone will
reproduce this bug.

OC> Answer to the following questions may help debugging

I changed FvwmTaskBarTipsBack and FvwmTaskBarTipsFore as you wrote and
restarted without netscape, tips still don't work though in xcmap I see a
lot of free colors. I don't think it problem is because of lack of colors.
Tips in FvwmPager work ok, on task bar they don't :(

I encountered one more problem with new task bar:

I have *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly in my config. If windows made stiky by style
command, they are shown on task bar on every desk. If I have a window that
is not stiky originally and make it stiky by pressing one of the buttons on
the title bar

Mouse 0		3       A       Stick

and then move to the other desk, it's shown on the screen but not shown on
the task bar.

Thanks in advance.

Yep, This one I can reproduce it. Will take look and try to fix
"all" the deskonly vs sticky bugs ...
Thanks for helping us to debuging fvwm-2.3.x so that fvwm-2.4
will be as bug free as possible.

When I use a menu to cause a motif window to be closed (File|Exit type
things), I typically find that key bindings will cease functioning until
I click the mouse. This happens both with staticly-linked binaries like
Adobe Acrobat Reader and Netscape, as well as dynamically-linked ones
(against lesstif 0.88). Can anyone verify this problem?

I suspect it's got something to do with the order in which windows are
unmapped/destroyed in response to the event triggered in the menu.

The FVWM function CursorMove, as designed, only allows relative movement
of the pointer.  I am looking for an enhancement that will allow the
absolute movement of the cursor, as in "move cursor to (500,200) on the
screen."  This can be useful for positioning transient windows that are
created by keystroke bindings (eg, FvwmIconMan in transient mode).

What should the class and rescource be set to? At present I think we
have:

Module   Name        Icon          Class       Resource

Banner   FvwmBanner  FvwmBanner
DragWell <argv[0]>   <argv[0]> 
Buttons  <alias>     <alias>       FvwmButtons <alias>
Form     <*config>   <*config>
IconBox  <argv[0]>   <argv[0]>     FvwmIconBox <argv[0]>
IconMan	 <*config>   FvwmIconMan   FvwmModule  <alias>
Ident    <argv[0]>   <argv[0]>
Pager    Fvwm Pager  Desk N        FvwmModule  <argv[0]>
Script   <argv[0]>   <script name>
Scroll   <captured>  <captured>
TaskBar  <argv[0]>   <argv[0]>
Wharf    <argv[0]>   <argv[0]>
WinList  <argv[0]>   <argv[0]>

I think I'd like the modules to conform to this:

Name/Icon               Class      Resource
<argv[0]/alias/*config> FvwmModule <module name>

Cheers,
Tim.

Probably a good idea, but not for generic GUI modules (Script, Form, Gtk),
where, the following scheme is better (I may be wrong):

Name/Icon                      Class       Resource
<anything module config sets>  FvwmScript  <config file>

Subject: transient windows do not iconify when their parent's parent is iconified.

Full_Name: Dan Kuchler
Version: 2.2 and 2.3.16
CVS_Date: 
OS: red hat linux 6.0 x86
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (209.24.201.132)


The most obvious way that I can produce this situation is by using 
tcl/tk version 8.3 (or version 8.0)

To reproduce the bug create a series of toplevels which are transient to
their parent.

wish8.0 (or wish8.3)
toplevel .a
toplevel .a.b
toplevel .a.b.c
wm transient .a .
wm transient .a.b .a
wm transient .a.b.c .a.b

Since each of the windows are transient to their parent, I would expect
that if I iconify the main wish window (.) that not only would its child
.a be iconified, but its childs child would be iconified since it is
a transient window and its parent has been iconified.

Expected Results:

So I would expect iconifying . would cause the transient windows .a .a.b
and .a.b.c to all ionify.

Iconifying . would cause .a .a.b and .a.b.c to iconify
Iconifying .a would cause .a.b and .a.b.c to iconify
Iconifying .a.b would cause .a.b.c to iconify.

Currently the following happens:

Iconifying . causes .a to iconify
Iconifying .a cuases .a.b to iconify
Iconifying .a.b causes .a.b.c to iconify.

This seems to work properly on several other window managers (such as
window maker), but not with FVWM

Hi, I noticed that my compiler throws the following errors on make
(gcc as included in FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE):

FvwmCpp.o: In function `cpp_defs':
/home/mikehan/fvwm/modules/FvwmCpp/FvwmCpp.c(.text+0x4d2): warning:

x_pager.c: In function `UpdateWindowShape':
x_pager.c:821: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type

For x_pager.c, the fix appears trivial. The alloc'd memory needs to be
cast when assigned to the pointer:

   if (shape == NULL)

This appears to fix the warning, and I'm blithely assuming it works
the same. As far as the mk[s]temp() complaint, the suggestion to use
mkstemp() sounds good, but I don't know if there's some reason not to
use mkstemp().

Here is the additional output I got using -Wall with the current CVS.

session.c:80: warning: `sent_save_done' defined but not used
bindings.c: In function `ParseBinding':
bindings.c:97: warning: unused variable `i'

Looking at session.c, I'm kind of confused. Am I correct in thinking
that the #ifdef SESSION that begins on line 810 ends on line 1139? If
so, then sent_save_done should be hiding inside an ifdef too.

Again, in bindings.c, 'i' is undefined only without STROKE. Should
that declaration get hidden inside a STROKE_CODE() macro wrapper?

No, inside a STROKE macro.  I'll fix both.

Not all systems have it, for one thing.  You can get about the same
level of security by using open() with O_CREAT|O_EXCL.

Here is a tempfile open function I implemented recently in GNU make;
it should work on all systems.

You need this in configure.in:

  AC_CHECK_FUNCS(mkstemp mktemp fdopen)

Then this will work (switch to ANSI of course for FVWM):

  extern char *mktemp ();
  extern int mkstemp ();

  FILE *
  open_tmpfile(name, template)
       char **name;
       const char *template;
  {
    int fd;

  #if defined HAVE_MKSTEMP || defined HAVE_MKTEMP
  # define TEMPLATE_LEN   strlen (template)
  #else
  # define TEMPLATE_LEN   L_tmpnam
  #endif
    *name = xmalloc (TEMPLATE_LEN + 1);
    strcpy (*name, template);

  #if defined HAVE_MKSTEMP && defined HAVE_FDOPEN
    /* It's safest to use mkstemp(), if we can.  */
    fd = mkstemp (*name);
    if (fd == -1)
      return 0;
    return fdopen (fd, "w");
  #else
  # ifdef HAVE_MKTEMP
    (void) mktemp (*name);
  # else
    (void) tmpnam (*name);
  # endif

  # ifdef HAVE_FDOPEN
    /* Can't use mkstemp(), but guard against a race condition.  */
    fd = open (*name, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY, 0600);
    if (fd == -1)
      return 0;
    return fdopen (fd, "w");
  # else
    /* Not secure, but what can we do?  */
    return fopen (*name, "w");
  # endif
  #endif
  }

It's invoked like this.  I already removed all the VMS/DOS/Windows stuff
the GNU make version has for you :)

  #ifdef P_tmpdir
  # define DEFAULT_TMPDIR    P_tmpdir
  #else
  # define DEFAULT_TMPDIR    "/tmp"
  #endif
  #define DEFAULT_TMPFILE     "FvXXXXXX"

    if ((tmpdir = getenv ("TMPDIR")) == NULL || *tmpdir == '\0')
      tmpdir = DEFAULT_TMPDIR;

    template = (char *) alloca (strlen (tmpdir)
                                + sizeof (DEFAULT_TMPFILE) + 1);
    strcpy (template, tmpdir);

    if (template[strlen (template) - 1] != '/')
      strcat (template, "/");

    strcat (template, DEFAULT_TMPFILE);
    outfile = open_tmpfile (&stdin_nm, template);
    if (outfile == 0)
      pfatal_with_name (_("fopen (temporary file)"));

Easily.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key F11 W SC FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
Key F12 W SC FuncFvwmRestoreFromFullScreen

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
+ I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
+ I WindowId "$w" RecaptureWindow
+ I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmRestoreFromFullScreen
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmRestoreFromFullScreen
+ I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
+ I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press Ctrl-Shift-F11, Ctrl-Shift-F12.
Ok, I agree, it would be more clean with: Style (Id $w) Maximize.

Problems with the functions above:
  * Don't press Ctrl-Shift-F11 twice, you will not be able to restore.
    This is because Maximize after Recapture works differently...
  * Dominik, did you say Recapture is not needed after Style? :-)
    This will not work without it here.
  * If you have other style bindings and you execute them in between
    of Ctrl-Shift-F11/Ctrl-Shift-F12 - small memory leak, see other thread.

---------------------------------- snip --------------------------------------


> If I comment in RecaptureWindow line, it doesn't fully maximize.

No, it can't work.  Styles are only applied when fvwm is idle.
A style change doesn't become active before the function has
completed.  We'll need some function like 'FlushUpdates' that
can be used inside functions to force that styles are applied.

To all: any optinions here?  Should I implement such a
(trivial) command before 2.4?

Don't care about configure options right now.  We have more pressing
issues than this at the moment.

I'd prefer Class=FvwmModule for all modules. Why is the config file name
important?

Start fvwm without config. Open a FvwmConsole and an xterm.
Run (in the console) FvwmAuto twice (this means two times). 
Then play with auto raise between the Console and the term

 => fvwm2 freeze

It seems that there is a bug in the lock on send code.
I suggest that if one look at this bug it can begin to
do so that the EscapeFunc (Ctl-Alt-Escape) unlock 
a lock on send request.

FvwmIconMan Title is broken.
You can try with, say, the sample-95 config :) or any
other config. When no windows have to go in IconMan then
the title is not displayed (or disapear almost at once).

The shadowing colors of the borders are often wrong (or at least they look
really ugly, compared to the previous verions' ones :-) especially when the
"HiddenHandles NoInset" flags are used. (for example: try a border with
color #000080)

Well, if this "no-one@nowhere.com" doesn't read this mailing list
I don't know what to do about it.  Colour sets allow to change
shadow and hilight colours manually.  Apart from that we discussed
all this months ago.  I'd move this bug report to 'not a bug' if
nobody objects.

The colors look reasonable to me.

Unless this person identifies himself I agree, we should ignore it.

Actually, it would be nice if fvwm detected the situations, when
FlushUpdates is needed automatically. Like here with Maximize command.

Another moment, if a user mixed Style and non-Style commands in function,
he probably always wants to have a flush before a first non-Style command.

This is not to say that we actually need (or don't need) this before 2.4.

Because generic modules are only toolkits requiring config (file/alias).
Suppose that all Gnome programs have class "Gnome" and resource "GTK".

I think, it is important to be able to distinguish between practically
different tools. Like "QuitVerify" form and "Talk" form; script for
configuring keyboard and sample-95 setup script; different button bars.

I doubt it is anywhen needed to match against FvwmModule. And it will be
possible to exactly match in the future anyway: Style (Class Fvwm*) ...

Mikhael.

Not eveyone is happy with the new shadow colors but not
everyone was happy with the old way either. I don't expect
any more changes soon. If you really dislike a particular
combination you could switch to using colorsets (man FvwmTheme)
and then you can pick any hilight and shadow colors you like.

It can't.  To find this out fvwm would have to apply the style
(at least for styles that don't entail a redraw).

I just came to the realization of something.

fvwm-config -c is wherever the ./configure --sysconfdir=/blah

Fvwm's default Script's are also placed in that same directory along with
the system.fvwm2rc. I don't think this should be done. The etcdir is used
for configuration, not scripts.

This came to me, while discussing with migo about fvwm-themes, how it
will use fvwm-config -c + /fvwm
Themes also do not belong in the etcdir,. They belong more in the
share/fvwm. Just like scripts and such.  

Almost every distribution uses /etc/X11/fvwm or /etc/X11/fvwm2 for it's
sysconfdir. And Scripts and themes should _never_ be put in a
configuration directory tree. As standard, themes and such would normally
be in the PREFIX/share/software-name, such would be /usr/share/fvwm/ or
/usr/local/share/fvwm (by default compiling method).

I'd like to see what you guys say to this. This is kind of a major issue
in theme-engine creation, and even pure standards.

I am not quoting the original message, because it contains unrelevant (and
sometimes not exact) info. Here is the rewording of the raised problem.

We have in fvwm:
  FVWM_MODULEDIR='${libexecdir}/${PACKAGE}/${VERSION}'
  FVWM_CONFIGDIR='${sysconfdir}/${PACKAGE}'

In FVWM_CONFIGDIR currently we install configs (Config*), scripts
(Script*), and forms (Form*), I think none of them belong to $sysconfdir,
i.e. there is nothing that fvwm may want to install to /etc (if distros
use /etc for ${sysconfdir}).

So the fix is to change the second line to something like:
  FVWM_CONFIGDIR='${datadir}/${PACKAGE}'

where ${datadir} is usually ${prefix}/share or similar.
I will care about this if you all agree with it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This was dealt with at length about a year and a half ago.

I remember well why FVWM_MODULEDIR is this and not another. It is ok.
However, I don't recall reading about FVWM_CONFIGDIR, so I went to
archives: http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/w3glimpse/fvwm?query=sysconfdir

There were no scripts and forms installed in FVWM_CONFIGDIR in 19971208,
so still this old discussion does not explain why they should go to /etc.
Moreover I don't agree that even Config* files should go to /etc.
If distros want to put system.fvwm2rc in /etc (why?), ok, but not Config*.

So I am still quite sure that ${datadir} should be used instead of
${sysconfdir} for FVWM_CONFIGDIR.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, /etc/X11/fvwm2, or similar, is where the system-wide system.fvwm2rc
belongs. it's a configuration file.
However, scripts belong more so in ${datadir}/share/fvwm or similar, for
Scripts, themes, etc, to use as FVWM_CONFIGDIR.
Or heck, even FVWM_DATADIR.

Distributions will not stop using /etc/*. They all make their own
"default" fvwm configuration for menus, style, etc.

Any common Linux, or even UNIX user will agree with me on this, as well.
I already have comments from several people, and below is the comments of
the people:

<Psi-Jack> Hey guys. I have a theoretical evaluation I need to conclude.
etc/* stuff should be configuration information, no? Themes and such
would
be best in share/programname/*? Would anyone disagree with this concept?
<keunsun> Agree
<keunsun> like /usr/share/** or in the users home dir.
<Psi-Jack> I'm trying to explain that to fvwm-workers, and fvwm-themes	
people that same concept, and the fvwm-themes guy totally disagrees for
some
_strange_ reason.
<Psi-Jack> I haven't heard back from fvwm-workers, yet, however. But they
have Scripts* in the etcdir, also, which is bad. :)
<Psi-Jack> keunsun: Heh, the fvwm-themes guy I'm disputing this with
thinks
that every distribution should change their packaging just because he
things
themes belong in etcdir.
<Psi-Jack> muhri: What's your insight, if I may ask? Are you in the same
agreeance as keunsun?
<muhri_> Psi-Jack: definitly, etc dir scripts.. that's awful
<keunsun> Psi-Jack: to think that ANY..let alone every dist. is going to
change for one package is dilusional!
<keunsun> Besides, for themes to be really useable, they should be
editable
by user, and almost everything in the /etc dir. isnt
<Psi-Jack> keunsun: Well, fvwm-themes will use the system-wide themes dir
(presently looking at sysconfdir (ex: /etc/X11/fvwm2/) and $FVWM_USERHOME
(ex: /home/psi-jack/.fvwm/)   My fvwm-themer presently uses fvwm's
PREFIX/share/fvwm (ex: /usr/share/fvwm/) and $HOME/.fvwm
6<Psi-Jack> But.. It puts _me_ through hell, because for anything in the
site-wide themesdir has to be manually literally specified
(/usr/share/fvwm/themes/default/background), instead of just
(themes/background)
<keunsun> Psi-Jack: why would they want to change it? what are they
hoping
to gain by being different?
<keunsun> Psi-Jack: bedsides confusing the hell out of a bunch of people?
<Psi-Jack> keunsun: I don't know. All I can do is suggest _better_
standards. :)
<_popeye_> Psi-Jack : I agree completely.

Don't get me wrong, I don't care where these files go.

I see little difference between system.fvwm2rc and ScriptFvwm*,
they are both config files.

I don't think of ScriptFvwm* as a script, it is not an executable.

I don't know about the Theme files, right now there are no theme
files in fvwm that I know about.

I take it back, my memory must be failing me.
All I see is Steve's comment:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9903/msg00687.html

I don't see any extended discussion.
I don't remember  why we didn't use datadir after that comment,
although I still don't see a difference between system.fvwm2rc
and any of the Form* files.  They contain exactly the same thing.

There was a thread about too many environment variables.

I do see one new file "script-fvwm-setup95.pl" thats almost an
executable, but its not marked executable, and it is read
as data by Perl.

Well, All the stuff in sysconfdir/fvwm are script or form. Form*,
Script*
both use FvwmForm, or FvwmScript. 
Config* could probably be really considered a "Config" file that should
be in etcdir (sysconfdir).

But Script* and Form* technically by standards would not be config
files,
because they are fvwm-native FvwmForm and FvwmScript, and should be in a
shared directory such as FVWM_PREFIX/share/fvwm, instead of
ETCDIR/fvwm..
This would deduct logical good practice to keep them like that.
I'll give you an example: Config files, like system.fvwm2rc, and
fvwm/Config*, belong in ETCDIR/fvwm/, where Script* and Form* belong in
FVWM_PREFIX/share/fvwm. If I keep my sysconfdir as /etc/X11/fvwm, like
Debian, RedHat, or most distros do, then those Scripts and Forms are
eating up my very valuable / partition. I keep my / at 80mb, which is
more than enough for what _should_ be stored in / and /etc. /usr, /var,
and /home are seperate partitions, and /opt, is an optional partition
which some distros, and people, use. I stopped making an /opt, myself,
but once I get a bigger HD, I'll use /opt again.


You see my point? If not, feel free to ask me some questions. I'm all
ears and all answers.

Sorry about that. This is quite honestly the first time I've been playing
an active role in a mailing list. I usually just read them to keep
up-to-date about things.

Well, let me give you another example. Each 0-4096byte files will always
be 4096bytes on HD bigger than 524mb. That's the physical block size of
the HD itself. I don't know many people that still have 524mb or less
HD's just laying around, and using them as their / partitions. ;)

However, to promote the use of a theme engine, and to keep a cleaner
sysconfdir, a DATADIR, like share/fvwm, would be a great idea. That way,
a theme engine (fvwm-themes and fvwm-themer to name two), can use the
DATADIR, instead of the CONFIGDIR.

Hello,
For me the choice between etc/ and share/ is not important.
The important point is the logic that use fvwm to read
configuration files: it first look the FVWM_USERHOME or
to HOME and then if the config file is not found it
look in the fvwm config dir (no exported variable here).
(there is also the complete path but here we found the
config file or we fail!).
There is a gap in my opinion in this procedure. Where
we install complex config system? (as fvwm-themes or
others). To take advantage of the above reading strategy
one want to install it in the fvwm config dir and this
is not "clean" and may cause some problems (we've got
some with fvwm-themes). So, the other alternative is to
install everything in the fvwm user home (and some none root
user must do such a things). Again, this is bad! I can
give some (technical) argument if you want.
The good place for complex config system is a 3rd directory
say share/name-of-the-theme-engine/* (share or pouf this
not really important but share seems good). Then, the "reading"
strategy will insert this new dir between the two others.
For that we can just allows FVWM_USERHOME to be "multidir"
as the Image Path so FVWM_USERHOME can be
        my_personal_stuff:dir_of_the_complex_engine
And every thing will be perfect in a marvelous world.

I don't see either. My point is, nothing in fvwm should be installed in
/etc, even system.fvwm2rc, everything in datadir.

It is trickier. script-fvwm-setup95.pl is only used by ScriptFvwmSetup95,
so it should not be installed in bindir. I think it is ok to put it
together with ScriptFvwmSetup95, perl code is architecture independant and
should not be marked executable to be run.

Mikhael.

Really interesting solution. But many sources will be affected by this
change. I suggest to stop this discussion for now and go step by step,
checking that nothing is broken. I will post tomorrow a patch for voting
implementing old suggestions. After that we can discuss new suggestions.

I learned opinions voiced here in the last several months (plus archives).
I have a working patch, that solves most of the problems discussed.
This patch can be posted on request, it is long, because of renamings.
It does not break anything, at least I don't see what it can break.
I need 2 votes to apply this patch and no votes against.

What this patch does:

All fvwm data, which was in sysconfdir subdir, is now in datadir subdir.
fvwm still tries $sysconfdir/system.fvwm2rc if finds nothing else.

FVWM_USERHOME is renamed to FVWM_USERDIR for consistency, the old variable
name is still supported (but could be removed before 2.4, I suppose).

FVWM_USERDIR now defaults to $HOME/.fvwm not $HOME. FVWM_USERDIR directory
is now created if needed. FVWM_USERDIR variable is now exported for all
subprocesses, not only for modules (just like FVWM_MODULEDIR).

fvwm still searches for $HOME/.fvwm2rc for compatibility; but Read doesn't
specially supports $HOME (I don't think this is needed, but can be added).

This patch does not contradict with the Olivier's suggestion (corrected
by me) to add additional SearchPath to extend FVWM_USERDIR & FVWM_DATADIR.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I know I'm not actually part of this discussion, but which directory is
datadir subdir exactly?

I did enough reading to prove to myself the sysconfdir really is
wrong and we should be using datadir.

Darn, I thought FVWM_USERHOME was consistent with $HOME.

Since we only used FVWM_USERHOME in betas, I don't see a need to support
the old name.

So you would only export FVWM_USERDIR to go back to using $HOME or some
other directory.

I'll vote "yes" so that Dominik can make the deciding vote.

What does this mean?
Are these paths or directories?
I think they have to be directories.

This is true.  At the time, the only way to configure FVWM was through
system.fvwm2rc or $HOME/.fvwm2rc.  When I was doing the autoconfiscation,
I used $sysconfigdir for the system-wide configuration file.

The forms and whatnot came along later.

I think that, to sort this out, one must decide what sort of directory
layout is desirable.  You can choose GNU standards, or the FHS, or
historical layouts from sunos, or some ad-hoc scheme.  Naturally, I'd be
inclined to pick one of the first two, which I believe are compatible, or
mostly so.

The advantage of using the FHS, say, is that you have a document to work
from (http://www.pathname.com/fhs) which already describes where config
files & script files belong.  

Then the hard part: deciding which files qualify as "configuration" files.
To me it is clear that "system.fvwm2rc" qualifies, while theme images, for
example, do not.

Perhaps there ought to be a third option: separate themes and scripts from
configuration files.


Keep up the good work,

If $FVWM_USERDIR is defined, it is used, otherwise it is exported (and
used) to be ~/.fvwm. Exporting is needed to help shell scripts (like
fvwm-*) to know where to put their user config files without guessing.

FVWM_USERDIR and FVWM_DATADIR are directories. Currently they are both
used for searching fvwm files. The new suggestion (not included in
this patch) is to support additional variable $FVWM_SEARCHPATH or a new
fvwm command SearchPath to add additional directories to search for.
So if you define: SearchPath ${HOME}:/usr/local/fvwm, - fvwm and modules
search in: FVWM_USERDIR (i.e. ~/.fvwm), ~, /usr/local/fvwm, FVWM_DATADIR.

Regards,
Mikhael.

That's been my ideas of things. I just couldn't remember where the
standards were, or what they were called. I was thinking of the FHS,
for standardizations, which common distros use FHS and/or GNU blends.

I'd planned to do this as a compromise. I'm just mainly wishing to have
a datadir of some kind that can be set, and used. At present, I have to
make my themer-engine use PREFIX/share/fvwm/*, instead of just from the
* and beyond. Makes for less complication if it could be implemented.

Can you remind me what the problem is? This works for me just like the man
page says, i.e. leaves an xload to be 50x50.

Swallow always forces an app to be 48x48.
MaxSwallow does not force an app to be 48x48 or 64x64, but verifies that 
it's still less than 64x64 and resizes if needed; 50x50 or 20x30 are ok.

If someone wants to get 64x64 he should specify "-g 64x64" or even better
"-g 60x60" to leave 3d look.

Should I change something here or just add this info to the man page?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I compiled 2.3.16 with --enable-kanji. But, FvwmWinList isn't able to
compile.  I make patch.

But, I cannot display Kanji in FvwmWinlist. I don't know FvwmWinList
is but or my .fvwm2rc is but.

Description:
	[Detailed description of the problem, suggestion, or complaint.]

	When creating a WindowList and using the "Function funcname" option,
	the function is only used for the first item in the WindowList. All
	other items use the WindowListFunc function.

	I believe that this is also in the latest snapshot, 20000422.

Repeat-By:
	[Describe the sequence of events that causes the problem
	to occur.]


	In a .fvwm2rc:

	##
	## Make sure the default WindowListFunc be a nop.
	##
	DestroyFunc WindowListFunc

	##
	## This should do what the the default WindowListFunc does.
	##
	AddToFunc TakeMe
	+ I WindowId $0 Iconify off
	+ I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
	+ I WindowId $0 Raise
	+ I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p


	##
	## Create a WindowList
	##
	Mouse 3	R	N	WindowList Function TakeMe


	Start up fvwm2, open some windows, iconify them, and then
	right click on the root window. When the WindowList pops up,
	try selecting different items.

	The function TakeMe will apply only to the first window (item) in
	the list. The other items will do nothing (WindowListFunc).


Fix:
	[Description of how to fix the problem.  If you don't know a
	fix for the problem, don't include this section.]

	It looks like the pointer func is freed and set to null
	inside a for loop in do_windowList. I just removed the
	free and the "func = NULL;" statement and my WindowList's
	*seem* to work ok. It doesn't seem like there's any reason
	to free func inside the for loop. Its value is used in the for loop.
	It's free'd after the for loop anyway and it's not assigned to 
	anywhere in the for loop or before the free after the loop.

Hi, I seem to be having some trouble with FvwmIdent. When invoked
outside of any window context, FvwmIdent is supposed to prompt me with
a crosshair cursor to select the window I want to identify. If I
invoke FvwmIdent with no window having focus, I get: 1) an Ident
window quickly mapped and unmapped, if FvwmIdent was invoked from my
window-ops menu; or 2) the crosshair cursor flashing quickly and
resuming its regular shape, if I run from a keybinding.

Is anyone else seeing anything like this? I'm using ClickToFocus,
ClickToFocusRaisesOff and ClickToFocusPassesClick, if those are
relevant.

No, I can't reproduce this, although tried several times.
I have both menu entry and keybinding to FvwmIdent, both work as expected
with and without a window context. Probably it is configuration specific.

I use SloppyFocus for "*", but have some windows ClickToFocus, and I
experimented only with them.

I guess, you should investigate this problem more.

BTW, I accidentally removed a message from fvwm@ telling about a problem
with iconifying a shaded window, moving it to another page and restoring.
I have tested this several times as well and can't reproduce the problem.
Can someone, please, verify this too and answer to this message?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fair enough. I'll try to determine what config is causing the problem.
Sometimes, when I think I've found a bug, I discover that some new
feature exists or an existing feature no longer exists or there's been
a change to some default behavior...

Okay. I looked harder. It looks like for the problem of root
keybindings, I'd randomly picked the unfortunate binding

Key Escape A C Module FvwmIdent

This doesn't ever appear to work, since the Escape gets passed to
FvwmIdent, cancelling the selection process. Or that's my guess. Other
root key bindings seem to work. For my other problem (invoking from a
menu), it appears to be caused only when you use a key selection in
the menu. Clicking the menu seems to be fine. The following minimalist
config should do it:

AddToMenu Window Ident Module FvwmIdent
Key F1 A N Menu Window

Regardless of focus policy, etc., if you popup the menu from the root
context and attempt to select this item using menu-based key
navigation (space or enter to select), FvwmIdent doesn't wait for you
to select a window. It does work if I assign a hotkey like "&Ident"
and select using "I".

So... after experimenting with FvwmIdent in "crosshair window select
mode" is that escape, space and return all end the selection process.
Escape cancels and space/return mimic Button 1 (select whatever's
under the cursor). Now, this means that in the configs I describe
above (maybe all?), Key Events that selected FvwmIdent to run are
"bleeding" into FvwmIdent's event queue... Can anything be done about
this? I'm chiefly concerned about the case of selecting FvwmIdent out
of a popped-up menu from the root context, using standard fvwm
key-based menu navigation.

Ok, Michael, you are lucky. :) This problem bugged me a lot too (I have
Ctrl-Shift-F10 bound to FvwmIdent, so I needed to hold modifiers to be
able to read FvwmIdent window), but I had no time to take a look.

I didn't fixed Ctrl-Escape starting and immediately canceling crosshair;
this can be done, but this is in the libs and I don't want to touch this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ooh, in the process of testing I forgot that this was bugging me!
Thanks.

I see what you mean. Still, I think it's a bad model that menus appear
to invoke their bound actions on KeyPress yet
fvwmlib_get_target_window() watches KeyReleases. It allows
menu-bindings that cause fvwmlib_get_target_window() to be invoked to
have their KeyRelease events be picked up by the module that was
invoked. I can't imagine this is desirable. It appears that
FvwmDragWell and FvwmScroll also use this function, but no others. Can
we patch this?

Well, I've written a patch and attached it. I tested it against
FvwmIdent and I believe that between this patch and Mikhael's,
FvwmIdent's behavior at start time is correct now.

Subject: Diff to work with Caps/Num/Scroll-Locks
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi,

The 4 diff's below show how fvwm CAN work with CapsLock, NumLock
and ScrollLock, together with Click-to-Focus, at least when running
with an XFree86 server.  The core of the problem is that fvwm naively
treats all "modifer keys" the same; and for reason unkown to me, it
oversteps by grabbing buttons and pointer/key when only the CapsLock
is down.

These "lock keys" are not something the user can speicify in the RC
to setup short-cut commands, so have no interest to fvwm (in fact,
not even to apps, except those that do act on ScrollLock).  A window
manager should not look at them at all.

The "knowledge" shown below about XFree86 keys, isn't back art.
Anyone who cares to look at XFree86 header files can find them.  Hope
your team can pick this up, add lock keys used by other X11 servers
(see patched fvwm.c main() about this), and rid the "fvwm lock-key
syndrome" once and for all.  The diff's are against fvwm-2.2.4 release.

I vote yes for this patch, changing the default user dir to ~/.fvwm
seems to me a very good thing.

So, may be it will be not difficult to add to your patch an optinal 
env variable FVWM_SEARCHPATH which contains only one directory (and
which have to be exported by the user) to add an additional directory 
to search for fvwm. Maybe in this case we have to find an other name.

If this is the case, you may ask for a vote (and no objections) for
adding this feature to your patch?

Fixed in the current cvs. You may want to use a daily snap shot
or wait the next beta (2.3.17).

Oh my, I can hardly take that comparison seriously.  Of the
9 reviewed window managers (not counting older versions), only
twm and xfce are rated 'less configurable' than fvwm.  On the
other hand WindowMaker has a far better rating for 'system
requirements'.  I must be missing something.  Probably they
have to objective criteria for the ratings.

I've spent some time debugging the hang when two FvwmAutos are
started.  It seems to happen when they actually try to raise a
window.  All locking (UNLOCK messages) seems to work ok.  But
then, fvwm hangs in a read() call in events.c (line 2361):

  FD_ZERO(&in_fdset);
  FD_SET(x_fd,&in_fdset);
  /* nothing is done here if fvem was compiled without session support */
  if (sm_fd >= 0)
    FD_SET(sm_fd, &in_fdset);
  FD_ZERO(&out_fdset);
  for(i=0; i<npipes; i++) {
    if(readPipes[i]>=0)
      FD_SET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset);
    if(pipeQueue[i]!= NULL)
      FD_SET(writePipes[i], &out_fdset);
  }

  DBUG("My_XNextEvent","waiting for module input/output");
  XFlush(dpy);
  if (fvwmSelect(fd_width, &in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, timeoutP) > 0) {

    /* Check for module input. */
    for (i=0; i<npipes; i++) {
      if ((readPipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)) {
-->     if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
          HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL);
    } else {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
          KillModule(i);
        }
      }
      if ((writePipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(writePipes[i], &out_fdset)) {
        DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling FlushQueue");
        FlushQueue(i);
      }
    }

So, since the file descriptor has changed, the only explanation I
can think of is that less than sizeof(Window) bytes are available
on the input pipe.  Does this make sense?

Since every packet sent by a module contains a 'window' entry
(sizeof(Window)), there are several explanations:

 1) The module sent trash.
 2) Part of the input has already been read somewhere else.
 3) fvwmSelect lies about the state of the file descriptor.

All of this seems very unlikely to me.  Any better ideas?

Are you *sure* you're using the new code?  In virtual.c,
around line 963 you should see this code:

    for (t = Scr.FvwmRoot.next; t != NULL; t = t->next)
    {
      if (IS_STICKY(t) || (IS_ICONIFIED(t) && IS_ICON_STICKY(t)))
      {
    /* FIXME: domivogt (22-Apr-2000): Fake a 'restack' for sticky window
     * upon desk change.  This is a workaround for a problem in FvwmPager:
     * The pager has a separate 'root' window for each desk.  If the active
     * desk changes, the pager destroys sticky mini windows and creates new
     * ones in the other desktop 'root'.  But the pager can't know where to
     * stack them.  So we have to tell it ecplicitly where they go :-(
     * This should be fixed in the pager, but right now the pager doesn't
     * maintain the stacking order. */
    BroadcastRestackThisWindow(t);
      }
    }

Is it there?  Did you really install the new executable?
You *can't* still have the problem if this code has been
compiled.

Subject: *FvwmPagerGeometry broken?

Full_Name: Shawn Anderson
Version: CVS
CVS_Date: April 21st
OS: PowerPC Linux  2.2.14
X_Server: Xfree86 (Xpmac)
Submission from: (NULL) (158.252.231.133)


  In my .fvwm2rc I use: *FvwmPagerGeometry 49x49-0-0
It used to work great, but since I just CVS updated last
night, FvwmPager starts up in the wrong place(-2-2).

FvwmIdent says:
...
Width:              47
Height:             47
X (current page):   781
Y (current page):   573
Boundary Width:     1
...
Geometry:           15x15-2-2
...

I can reproduce it with only this in my .fvwm2rc:

# .fvwm2rc
*FvwmPagerGeometry      49x49-0-0
AddToFunc   InitFunction
 +  I   Module      FvwmPager *
AddToFunc   RestartFunction
 +  I   Module      FvwmPager *
# end of file.

Does anyone else see this?

Sincerly,
Shawn A.

The random placement seems not to work anymore... for example, if i open
some xterms they all go to the same exact place.

I'm trying to map an input only window because I want to grab the
mouse/keyboard and do X selections (cut/paste).  I haven't looked at
selections yet though.

        fromWin = XCreateWindow( /*Display*/ fromDpy, /*Parent*/ root,
                /*X*/ 0,/*Y*/ 0,
                /*Width*/ 1,/*Height*/ 1, /*BorderWidth*/ 0,
                /*depth*/ 0,
                /*Class*/ InputOnly, /*Visual*/ CopyFromParent,
                /*Valuemask*/ 0,//CWBackPixel | CWOverrideRedirect,
                /*XSetWindowAttributes*/ &xswa);
        XMapWindow( fromDpy,fromWin);
        XFlush(fromDpy);

If I am not running a window manager it works just fine.

For an InputOnly window fvwm 2.2.4 reports,
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 8, EventType: 20

If I have BorderWidth as 1, Class InputOutput it works fine with fvwm.  But
it has a pixel window on the screen.  Any suggestions for the InputOnly
class windows?  Or can I just not use them with fvwm?

I didn't see this problem for some time. Not very reliable, but if there
are no similar reports, remove it. I'll let you know if I see it again.

Yes, I am sure. I would not make this comment without tripple checking
(including watching your added lines in virtual.c). :)

After some investigating, I have find the problem. If you change desks
with Desk command, it really works (around), but if you change desks using
multidesk pager, these lines are not even executed, because it doesn't
pass "if (Scr.CurrentDesk != desk)" check.

This reminds me also about still pending (AFAIK) problem with M_NEW_PAGE
holding an old (or current, whatever) desk number instead of the new one.

Mikhael.

So is that enough votes? It looks like maybe I might want to be able
to commit. At least for silly things like manpage fixes.

You know what you should send to Jason, right? :) It is in cvs.html, BTW.

Is it possible that the same descriptor is appearing twice in the
readPipes[] array? This would mean that the first read would empty the
pipe and the second would then block.

I think the issue is that only in more recent XFree86 builds (maybe
3.2?) have ScrollLock and NumLock become lockable modifiers. The code
you were looking at wasn't aware that there are other lock-type
modifiers, hence it's obsession with CapsLock to the exclusion of the
other, newer(?) locks.

But for some reason doing something quite similar to what you did in
events.c (Handle{Key|Button}Press) apparently causes a massive rise in
X protocol traffic when handling Fvwm bindings. We don't disable the
other locks, as a result. Can someone correct me if I'm getting this
wrong? I only vaguely remember this problem.

In any event, if you don't mean for ScrollLock or NumLock to be
lockable modifiers, it's probably better to use xmodmap to turn off
locking on the modifier. Doing so is documented in the FVWM FAQ.

That's almost exactly what I thought... Though I suppose they mean
*GUI-based* configurability. And I have no idea what they could mean
by windowmaker having fewer reqs: according to me FreeBSD ports
Makefile, it wants ungif, tiff, jpeg, png and PropList, in addition to
Xpm.

In similar news, I notice that fvwm-2.2.2 and olvwm are both shipping
with Solaris8. See:

This is not a bug, but I've fixed this any way.

I think your visual is wrong, try DefaultVisual(fromDpy,
DefaultScreen(fromDpy)) instead.

Yes, it might be something to do with the code at line 415 of x_pager.c:

  if(xneg)
  {
    sizehints.win_gravity = NorthEastGravity;
    window_x = Scr.MyDisplayWidth - window_w + window_x -2;
  }

  if(yneg)
  {
    window_y = Scr.MyDisplayHeight - window_h + window_y -2;
    if(sizehints.win_gravity == NorthEastGravity)
      sizehints.win_gravity = SouthEastGravity;
    else
      sizehints.win_gravity = SouthWestGravity;
  }

Does anyone know what the -2's are doing there?

Cheers,
Tim.

Dominik definitely does not want to vote on this one.
His own words (http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0001/msg00029.html):

	I trust that something sensible will come out of the discussion

I will apply this patch in a moment, since there is a consensus.
BTW, I have tested it with both Setup Form and Setup95 Script.

Excelent, thank you. That's exactly what I've been patiently waiting
for. I have one more suggestion.

fvwm-config -s will report readline, rplay, stroke, xpm, gtk, and sm,
but I think it should also report imlib and gnome, for 100% assurance
of compiled-in features. Gnome is, afterall, different than just GTK+,
and Imlib, if my assumption is correct, adds more graphics support for
fvwm, such as jpg, gif, etc, instead of just xpm (which I'm sure isn't
perfect yet, I tried a png, and didn't work, and this is part of
imlib's internal features...).

Just a suggestion.

Eric Renfro

No, that's not what happens (I checked it with a few fprintf's).
The two instances of FvwmAuto have the module numbers 6 and 7 in
my setup and the read pipe numbers 18 and 20.  The last thing I
see before fvwm blocks is that the select call returns with both
pipes (18 and 20) changed.  The read() call on pipe 18 returns
successfully, but the read() call on pipe 20 blocks for no
apparent reason.

---------- one hour later ----------

Okay, this is what happens:

0) Both FvwmAutos (I'll call them FA1 and FA2 from now)
   deciade at the same time that the focused window must be
   raised.  Both put a 'silent raise' into their pipe.
1) Fvwm enters the module input loop in events.c.
2) Fvwm reads 'silent raise' from FA1's pipe.
3) Fvwm raises the window and puts a M_RAISE_WINDOW packet
   into FA1's pipe.  This type of packet is in FvwmAuto's
   sync mask, thus fvwm waits for an 'UNLOCK' response from
   FA1.
4) FA1 responds with 'UNLOCK'.
5) Fvwm sends the M_RAISE_WINDOW to FA2 and waits for 'UNLOCK'.
6) Fvwm is now in the loop in module_interface.c, lines 1205
   to 1272.
7) FA2 puts 'UNLOCK' into the pipe.
8) Fvwm reads 'silent raise' from FA2's pipe before it can get
   the 'UNLOCK':
     while (HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, module, NULL) != 66);
9) Again, fvwm sends M_RAISE_WINDOW packet to FA1 and gets
   'UNLOCK'.
10) Fvwm sends M_RAISE_WINDOW packet to FA2 and gets the old
    'UNLOCK' that was already queued.  FA2 puts another
    'UNLOCK' into the pipe.
11) Fvwm returns from the HandleModuleInput() call in step 8.
12) In the next pass of the loop, Fvwm reads the expected
    'UNLOCK' from FA2's queue.
13) Fvwm breaks the loop and returns to the loop in events.c.
14) Fvwm tries to read from FA2's queue which is empty now.

==> BANG

When the select call returned that FA2's filedescriptor changed
in the first place, this was because of the 'Silent Raise'. But
this string was eaten up while FA1's input was processed (step 8).
So when fvwm finally got around to read from FA2's pipe, nothing
was left to be read.

One simple but inefficient fix comes to my mind: select()
the module input pipes one by one, not in one big loop.

Another idea:  why do the read pipes block?  The code
in events.c:

  if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
    DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
    HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL);
  } else {
    DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
    KillModule(i);
  }

could be rewritten like this:

  if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
    DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
    HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL);
  } else if (/*error condition*/) {
    DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
    KillModule(i);
  } else {
    /* nothing read, ignore */
  }

There are several places in module_interface.c that would have
to be changed too.

Chris, can you do something about it?

Yup, that's it.  I'll remove it with my next commit.
BTW, I can see this even back in 2.0.38 (the oldest
tarball on my disk).

Breaking the FvwmPagerGeometry resource?  No, honestly, I
have no idea.

Thanks for the bug report.  I can reproduce the problem.
Consider it fixed :-)  Just as an aside note:  the same
happens if you use (un)maximze instead of (un)shade.

Sigh! Why do people think it's a good idea to report bugs

Ulp.  Can we remove magic numbers, please?

  dv> ==> BANG

Well, first I'd like to point out that it's silly (isn't it?) to have
two FvwmAuto modules running, and maybe the thing to do is make it so
that can't happen.

Can a module find out what other modules are running?  I know I should
just go look :-/.  It seems like it would be a useful thing to provide
modules the ability to ask for a list of information about registered
modules.  If so, when FvwmAuto first starts it could ask for this list,
check if there's a different FvwmAuto, and die if so.

Of course, this situation may be reachable in other ways, in which case
we'd obviously need a more generic solution.

  dv> One simple but inefficient fix comes to my mind: select()
  dv> the module input pipes one by one, not in one big loop.

I don't see how this would work: you'd have to have a loop where you
select with no waiting on each read FD at a time, then loop back to the
beginning and start over.  But that's a hard loop and will cause FVWM to
eat all the CPU!  Or, you'd have to give each select a short timeout,
but then the responsiveness of your modules goes incrementally down as
you add more modules, even relatively inactive ones, since each one gets
a little timeslice (and of course, your CPU usage for FVWM still goes
up).  Or, you'd select with no wait, then sleep a little, then start
over, but now you're slowing down all modules (and CPU usage is still
higher).

I think this should be avoided if possible.

  dv> Another idea:  why do the read pipes block?

Well, the harder part is setting the FD for non-blocking reads in the
first place.  Unfortunately the method for doing that isn't as portable
as you might hope, IIRC... I think some older systems can't even do it.
You'd probably need some autoconf support for this.  I played with this
a good bit a couple of years ago in GNU make, I'll see if I can remember
the details.

Ability to check for module uniqueness is good, but should be optional.
Say, using UniqueModule command. All current "event" modules (FvwmAuto,
FvwmBanner, FvwmEvent) are very generic/configurable, i.e. they can be
programmed to execute any arbitrary fvwm function, not only autoraise
windows, or set background images, or play sounds, or all together.

Mikhael.

No, I meant it would be up to the module to determine what to do.  In
other words, fvwm would merely supply the module list, then the module
would decide what to do with it.

FvwmAuto would check for any other module besides itself (the module
list would need to contain uniquifying info, like maybe the pipe FD
numbers) and die if any such existed.

Other modules might do other things (maybe you could write a "module
manager module" :).

FvwmAuto doesn't fit with the rest of the items you list there.  It's
not at all configurable.  I can't see _any_ reason to _ever_ run more
than one.

Unless I'm missing something ...

If there really are reasons to have multiple modules, like for
FvwmEvent, then obviously they wouldn't even bother to check this.

I'll have a look, but won't get a chance to do anything for a few
days. That leaves plenty of time for us to thrash out the problem :-).

I agree with Paul that it doesn't make much sense to have two
FvwmAutos running, but won't there be other cases where important
messages will be thrown away like this? I'd prefer to find a deeper
solution to this rather than a "then don't do that" type fix, at this
stage anyway.

Did you ever read FvwmAuto(1)? :-)
Here are some useful tips.


DestroyFunc RestoreIconified
AddToFunc   RestoreIconified
+ I Current (Iconic) Iconify false

DestroyFunc RegisterFocus
AddToFunc   RegisterFocus
+ I Exec echo "`date +%T` window [$n] focussed" >>/tmp/focus-stats.txt

DestroyFunc RegisterUnfocus
AddToFunc   RegisterUnfocus
+ I Exec echo "`date +%T` window [$n] unfocussed" >>/tmp/focus-stats.txt


Module FvwmAuto 250 Raise Nop
Module FvwmAuto 800 "Function RestoreIconified" Nop
Module FvwmAuto   0 "Function RegisterFocus" "Function RegisterUnfocus"


Unfortunatelly this does not work as expected now, I suppose, because of
syncronization/pipe problems. Try running two FvwmAuto's first.

Mikhael.

 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [fixed; there is a new style and the behaviour is a bit more intuitive]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.

 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]
 54) Find a better solution for raising/lowering of transients.
 55) FvwmGtk can't be killed with 'KillModule'.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.

     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a

 74) To fix: icons are not preserved over a Quit - Start for fvwm
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.

 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set
     is changed (*FvwmPagerColorset).
109) FvwmIconMan titles don't seem to work.
111) Fix position hints not working with menus invoked
     from a menu like this: 'addtomenu foo foo menu foo root c c'
112) Fix desk flipping with
       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.

I think it is.

See my other mail for a detailed analysis of the problem.

Of course you're right, Paul.  The loop would eat up all CPU.  I didn't
mean this 'fix' seriously anyway.

Then, what can we do?  Is it possible to code this approach:

 1) select() for all pipes
 2) handle input from the first changed pipe
 3) remove the changed pipe and all unchanged ones from the set
 4) select() again on the remaining pipes, return immediately if
    no input is available.
 5) repeat 2-5 until no pipes have input

I'm not sure how select() works exactly.

This can happen with other (different) modules too.  Fvwm will
freeze if the following conditions are met:

 1) Two modules send a command at the same time (the commands can
    be different).  The important part is that the select() call
    will report that both module pipes have changed.

     AND

 2) The command from the first module triggers a message from fvwm
    to the second module that is selected by the module's
    SyncMask.

The following modules currently use the SyncMask:

  FvwmAnimate  M_(DE)ICONIFY, M_STRING
  FvwmAuto     M_FOCUS_CHANGE, M_RAISE_WINDOW, M_LOWER_WINDOW
  FvwmGtk      M_STRING
  FvwmIconBox  M_(DE)ICONIFY
  FvwmIconMan  M_(DE)ICONIFY
  FvwmTaskBar  M_(DE)ICONIFY
  FvwmWinList  M_(DE)ICONIFY

As far as I know, only FvwmAuto sends anything to fvwm not
directly caused by user interaction.  Condition (2) can
be fulfilled easily, e.g. by iconifying a window.  The
difficult part is to have input from another module at the
same time.  FvwmConsole may be a good candidate to force
this situation:

 - Paste many lines like 'next iconify toggle' into the
   FvwmConsole window.
 - At the same time repeatedly click on a button in FvwmIconMan
   fast.

Hold on, I'll give it a try...

--------- 5 minutes later ---------

Yup, I get the same problem.  What I did is this:

 - KillModule *
   (to make sure the modules are in the correct order)
 - Open an xemacs window and write
     'next (emacs*) iconify toggle'
   1000 times
 - Start FvwmConsole from a menu (it's important that
   FvwmConsole is started first - order matters).
 - Start FvwmIconMan from a menu.
 - Paste the complete xemacs buffer 10 times into the
   console window.
 - While fvwm is busy (de)iconifying, hit any button in
   FvwmIconMan often.  Once in a while stop doing this
   and watch what happens.

==> Sometimes fvwm stops (de)iconifying.  In this
    situation it is frozen until I press a button in the
    IconMan window to feed the read() call.

The problem with FvwmAuto is that there is nothing the user
can do to wake up the idle module because FvwmAuto doesn't
take user input, only input from fvwm - and fvwm is already
frozen.

BTW, a possible 'solution' could be some kind of heartbeat
from the modules.  FvwmAuto could send a 'Nop' every 5
seconds or so to keep fvwm alive :-)

I hope this is the right list to post this to?

There's been a bug in FvwmTaskBar which can cause fvwm2 to crash (at least, it
often causes 2.2 to crash) and/or behave strangely.

When the the Start Button is pressed, the associated Popup request is sent to
fvwm2 with an aribitary window id as context (non-deterministic -- based on an
uninitialised variable). This means that any window operations you invoke from
that menu have that wrong, probably illegal, context. At least, that's my
interpretation of it!

Really, of course, one wants that menu to be invoked with no context.

I believe the fix is trivial: see the following patch, made against
yesterday's snapshot.

Sorry, try as I might - I can't find a situation where it doesn't work.
There are two places in virtual.c where the MapDesk function is called.
In both places, a BroadcastRestack is sent for all windows.  So, unless
the stacking chain is out of order it can't happen.  Did you really
*lower* the sticky window?  Or did you *raise* other windows above it?
In the latter case, if you switch to a different page and/or desk, the
window may be on top of the windows in the current viewport.  It's only
a bug if the pager doesn't reflect the actual stacking order properly.

Ah, finally I understand what you tried to tell me.  It has nothing
to do with position hints that menus invoked from title buttons are
placed near the button.  This is hard coded.  The bug you saw is that
sometimes menus opened via 'Menu' in a menu are placed adjacent to
the button again, not vice versa.  I have fixed this one.

Hey guys. I'm trying to do a "tab notebook-style"
PushButton/SwallowExec-based FvwmScript, and to initially HideWidget
the external SwallowExec widgets, but it seems that when you have a
SwallowExec widget, it always executes it, and displays it, regardless
of HideWidget id.

In the long run, I'm basically trying to make a "notebook" style tab
system, using button widgets, and have the "Apply" "Reset" etc..
buttons to SendToScript and ReceiveFromScript, or have those buttons in
the Swallowed scripts. Don't know yet.

But here's the problematic code below:

Based on Dominik's description, this should work, shouldn't it? The
synchronous behavior of multiple FvwmAutos shouldn't be relevant if
all your FvwmAutos are running with different delay timings. Did I
misunderstand?

What exactly is the purpose of having synchronous module behavior here
for focus/raise/lower? I'm sort of interested in pursuing the idea of
integrating FvwmAuto into FvwmEvent -- this would require adding delay
timers to FvwmEvent, and ideally should also include the ability to
define multiple actions per event on different timers. But generally
speaking, FvwmEvent provides a pretty nice generic framework for doing
what FvwmAuto does. It can certainly handle the simplest case
scenario of autoraise with zero delay.

Well, after I fixed an allocation bug, this works much better. In fact,
if I replace 800 with 100, all three FvwmAuto's work together well.

In the original form, the second FvwmAuto is ignored, because, I suppose,
of lock-on-raise. FvwmAuto is a bit raise/lower oriented, which makes it
hardier to use for other purposes...

Extending FvwmEvent would be good. But probably using FvwmEvent aliases
with one timeout and one event action may be prefered than "multiple
actions per event on different timers". Seems easier to implement and use.
Of course, this is not at all important before 2.4.

Mikhael.

OK, I've poked around the code a little and digested Dominik's bug
synopsis. In summary: it looks like the root of the problem is the way
that BroadcastPacket(M_RAISE_WINDOW) calls PositiveWrite() for all
modules. PositiveWrite() expects a reply from each descriptor and
therefore destroys the "read-state" of every descriptor as recorded
earlier in My_XNextEvent().

I'll throw out a few clay pigeons for everyone to shoot at:
- we can either try to preserve My_XNextEvent()'s idea of which
  descriptors are still readable, or we can recognise that certain
  functions will trash this information.

- if we can spot when My_XNextEvent()'s readable descriptor set
  (in_fdset) has been invalidated then we could do something like:

  reset:
  if (fvwmSelect(fd_width, &in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, timeoutP) > 0) {
    ...
      HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL);
      if (descriptorsChanged) goto reset;

  This approach is hopefully low-impact, which is good since we're
  aiming for 2.4.

- Having thought about what I've just written, I am now worried that
  this goto approach might make fvwm neglect pipes in readPipes[i]
  with large "i" in favour of pipes with smaller "i". (Did that make
  sense?) Maybe instead we could just call fvwmSelect() again using
  the existing fd_sets and a timeout of zero? This way, we would only
  check that pipes that we thought had data still do have data. We
  would also have to call FD_CLR() for each descriptor:

  if (fvwmSelect(fd_width, &in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, timeoutP) > 0) {

    /* Check for module input. */
    for (i=0; i<npipes; i++) {
      if ((readPipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)) {
        FD_CLR(readPipes[i], &in_fdset);

        if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
          HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL);

          /* reset our idea of which descriptors have data waiting to
             be read, as necessary ...
             Maybe use return code from HandleModuleInput instead of
             this global "descriptors have changed" variable? */
          if (descriptorsChanged &&
              fvwmSelect(fd_width, &in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, 0) <= 0) {
            break;
          }

	} else {
          DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
          KillModule(i);
        }
      }
      if ((writePipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(writePipes[i], &out_fdset)) {
        FD_CLR(writePipes[i], &out_fdset);

        DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling FlushQueue");
        FlushQueue(i);
      }
    } /* for */

- is there any way for a pipe to receive "exceptional" data? If we
  could get the UNLOCK to be notified via select()'s fdset *exceptfds
  argument then the read-state would remain intact. (I have very
  little hope here - the man pages imply that this is more of a
  socket-protocol thing.)

- I was going to look for a solution whereby in_fdset (and out_fdset?)
  aren't invalidated in the first place, but that turns very evil very
  quickly by striking at the root of BroadcastPacket and the SyncMask
  functionality ...

What do people think? How many functions would need to be modified to
support the "descriptors have changed" functionality? Or do you think
I'm barking up totally the wrong tree?

Cheers,
Chris.

I think you've hit the nail on the head.  Something from my dim and
distant networking days is coming back.  It's "out of band" signaling.

Fvwm wants an UNLOCK from every SyncMask message and the current problem
is that it can't get at them until it has processed all the other
messages the module has sent.

The correct solution to this class of problems is for fvwm to wait for
the UNLOCK command without doing anything else and then process any
other module commands in normal order.

We have a choice of ways to do this:

1) don't use the module pipes to pass the UNLOCK message, we could use
an extra pipe (not backwards compatible, extra file descriptors), or
maybe we could use signals.

2) use the module pipes and buffer any commands received until the
UNLOCK, this is similar to the way XLib works, you can look for a
certain event type, other events received are added to the queue and
will be retrieved by the next XNextEvent().

If the signals way is portable and safe I think I'd prefer that, the
sync code could be something like:

	SendMessage();
	SetSig(USR2, interrupt);
	sleep(some_large_timeout);
	SetSig(USR2, ignore);

You could even replace the sleep with a (set cursor to busy, wait for a
timeout or escape key sequence or signal).

Cheers,
Tim.

There is a sendmail running on the mail exchanger for dunno.com so it is

It's necessary to synchronize FvwmAuto and fvwm to avoid race
conditions.  In the past we didn't use the SyncMask for FvwmAuto,
but when the user had Mouse/SloppyFocus, dragging the pointer
across several windows could lead to a random window being raised.
Setting the SyncMask dramatically reduces this risk.

Well, perhaps we should think about integrating FvwmEvent into
the main module (along with FvwmAuto).  With the current module
interface, asynchronous event handling is a pain and often causes
hard to debug race conditions.  Just a thought.

Hello dear fvwm workers,

  is there anything new about this problem ? Shouldn't it belong to
Dominik's TODO list before 2.4 ?

			Yes, unfortunately. When I wrote the
make_new_vpacket code for the GSFR
		I was blithely assuming that everything pointed to by the
CONFIGARGS
		macro was a long, based on this snippet from the old
make_vpacket, where
		it's actually moving the args into the packet:

			  for (; num > 0; --num)
			    *(bp++) = va_arg(ap, unsigned long);


		> Does "make_new_vpacket" handle the conversion of ints to

			No. The purpose of make_new_vpacket was to allow us
to build an
		arbitrary structure which the receiving module would
reference via a
		structure definition in vpacket.h, rather than referencing
variables via
		the old "body[6]" style syntax - all this so we could pass
the new GSFR
		flags structure. So make_new_vpacket just moves in fields
for the length
		you specify, with no notion of data types. The only special
thing it
		does is to round the total packet size up to a multiple of
the size of
		an unsigned long, for the benefit of the sending/receiving
code.

		> I would think that more than FvwmIdentify is going to be

			Much more - everyone that looks at the
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet is
		potentially affected on 64-bit machines, and at least has to
be looked
		at.

			Not quite...

			c/(int)(sizeof(_t->title_g.height))/(unsigned
		long)(sizeof(_t->title_g.height))

		etc.

			The length arguments passed to make_new_vpacket must
be unsigned longs
		- the field-length argument is only used by
make_new_vpacket, it doesn't
		go into the packet.


			The problem is that the fields are getting stuffed
into the packet with
		an incorrect length, which would be easy enough to fix, in
the way you
		suggested above (with my correction). Unfortunately this
would still
		leave us with the problem that everyone expects these fields
to be long
		ints in the packet, and there's no provision for making this
conversion,
		so we'd still have the packet out of sync with what the
modules expect.
		Actually, it would be more so, since all the things that
really are
		longs, and are currently aligned properly, would now be
misaligned as
		viewd by the modules.

			This is true no matter whether the modules use the
old "body[n]"
		technique or use the ConfigWinPacket struct in vpacket.h;
since I was
		stupidly assuming that everything in this packet was a long
(except for
		the new window_flags struct, which was the whole reason for
this
		change), the ConfigWinPacket struct is incorrect as well.

			Unfortunately, since the actual fields are being
passed by pointer
		reference, we can't play games with casting the actual data
args (which
		I believe is what the old make_vpacket did). But something
that has the
		same effect may be the best way to go.

			I'll have to give this some thought. Several things
come to mind that
		we might try.

			1) Change all of the FvwmWindow int items that are
sent in the
		M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet to longs. This would require a
good bit of
		double checking for new type mismatch problems in the core
fvwm code,
		but the packet structure would be back in sync and the
modules should
		not need changing.

			2) Replace the CONFIGARGSNEW macro technique of
invoking
		make_new_vpacket with a bit of code (or wrap the call with a
bit of
		intermediate code) that would convert all the int items to
longs before
		calling make_new_vpacket. This may be the best way to go.

			3) Redefine the make_new_vpacket API so that there
is some way of
		telling it that a particular argument is an int that needs
to be forced
		to a long. I'm not too wild about this one - it could get
really ugly.

			4) Do a major investigation of all the modules that
use
		M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW to see how much trouble it would be to
fix them to
		use the packet as it would be sent with the correction above
to use the
		actual lengths of the int fields. The problem I see with
this approach
		is that it would definitely break the old binary
compatibility that
		several people spent a lot of time and effort to try to
maintain (i.e.,
		the idea was that everything in the packet *before* the new
window_flags
		struct was supposed to continue to look just the way it
always did).

			Now if only I had one of those Alphas to test on....
:-)

Ah. I thought it was something along those lines.

Well... that would involve adding quite a bit of stuff to the core,
wouldn't it? First you need the event handling. Then you need the
"sleep"-type function you get with FvwmAuto.

Ok, this is fixed, FvwmAuto now is only raise/lower oriented if needed.
Though this has nothing to do with the original "read pipes" problem.

Out-of-band messaging would be nice, but I'm not sure how feasible it
is using pipes. Basically, every module would need a second "out of
band" pipe because we would still want to be able to tell which
message was from whom and not have to throw away other messages to
find the one we were interested in. And our solution would need to be
portable too. When I briefly investigated this, it seemed that the
"simplest" way might be to replace pipes with AF_UNIX sockets.

I keep noticing a problem with running gmc and fvwm-cvs. When gmc
loads, it's icons seem to get randomly placed, instead of getting
placed where they're supposed to. Is there a way to fix this?

Hey, in FvwmScript, is there a way to _not_ have WriteToFile print:
\n
#ScriptName,SomeNumbers\n
contents of what WriteToFile prints...\n
#end\n
\n

This is kinda annoying IMHO.

Have you tried enabling UsePPosition for the icons? While you're at
it, you probably want to set them at the bottom layer, maybe layer 2
or something. Maybe the icons set a class or resource so that you can
match the gmc icons and set them to appear properly, too.

I think this should be fixed prior to any 2.4 release. I'm guessing
others agree.

Well, grepping for CONFIGURE I find that about half the modules that
care about M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packets are already using vpacket.h.
Exceptions I see: FvwmIconMan, FvwmIdent, FvwmDebug, FvwmSave,
FvwmSaveDesk. I don't see that it should be too difficult to convert
these to use the ConfigWinPacket struct in libs/vpacket.h. Of course,
there are still non-core modules like FvwmKb (it doesn't care about
CONFIGURE and ADD) and TkGoodStuff.

Personally, I think converting the core modules to refer to vpacket.h
is a good thing no matter what, so I've done an ugly hack in
FvwmIconMan/fvwm.c to make it use vpacket.h and ConfigWinPacket.
Fortunately, Brady had written it so that he'd already setup IconMan
to treat the body as a struct, so conversion was easy. Unfortuantely,
it looks messy because ConfigWinPacket doesn't really "fit in" with
the rest of the code... Still, I compiled it -Wall without trouble and
it seems to work fine. See attachment for the diff -u. If there's
interest, I can go through the other modules and convert them too.
