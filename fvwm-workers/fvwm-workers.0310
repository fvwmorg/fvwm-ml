Done.

Hi all

I found the following problem while writing a perl module. Fvwm version is
2.5.8. Instruction to reproduce:

Fire up fvwm with an empty config. Open a console and start the attached
module like this
Module /path/to/module netscape Netscape
The stuff sent to fvwm when the window is mapped doesn't seem to get
through, i.e. netscape's window decoration stays red. The following echo
command isn't executed either. The send commands at the start of the
script work flawlessly. When I issue the DestroyStyle in a
fvwmconsole afterwards, it works as expected.
By the way, the Netscape version is 4.61.
With other programs (e.g. emacs, xterm), the behavior is quite
inconsistent. Sometimes it works right, sometimes not, without a
conceivable pattern.

I found out that the script functions when it sleeps for a second before
the critical send commands (see the commented out line in the example
script).

Best regards

From: Mrs Serena Jones
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co
ast for nine years before he died in the year
2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a
fter a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia
ns.Since his death I decided not to re-
marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bi
ble is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. D
ollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Hollan
d. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i
s my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to
donate this fund to church or better still a christian individ
ual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruc
t here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund chu
rches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and t
o ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don?t have any child that wil
l inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christi
ans and I don?t want my husband?s hard earned money to be misu
sed by unbelievers. I don?t want a situation where this money
will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whe
re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of th
e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi
cation in this regard because of my health because of the pres
ence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want
them to know about this development. With God all things are p
ossible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the
contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland
. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove
you as the original-
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always
pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoe
ver that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any d
elay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch
or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping
to hearing from you.
N.B-
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL I
N HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'
S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SU
CCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NAME IS PAULSON,PHONE NUMBER IS 00-31-630-854-650.
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Serena Jones

Hi,

I've been playing with FvwmIconMan in transient mode, and I
started thinking that it would be cool to have normal menus have
a similar look, i.e. like several buttons lined up.  I know you
can put a separator between each entry, but it's a hack and the
separators are set at two pixel thickness.

Would it be hard to add this?  I might try it myself, but I'm not
sure where to begin.

Thanks for all the great work,
	- Ian.

Dear Friend,

My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN
DOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea who
seized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruled
from 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of office
and charged with treason, corruption and embezzlement
of over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to
death but fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in
and commuted the sentence to life. We thank God that
he has finally been released though still under house
arrest in the sense of the conditions of his freedom.

During my brother's regime as president of South
Korea, we realized some reasonable amount of money
from various deals that we successfully executed. I
have plans to invest this money for my children=92s
future in real estate and industrial production.

Before my brother was overthrown, I secretly
siphoned the sum of $20,000,000.00 Million USD (Twenty
Million United States dollars) out of Seoul and
deposited the money with a Security Firm that
transports valuable goods and consignments through
diplomatic means.

I am contacting you because I want you to deal with
the Security Firm and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my Foreign Business Partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investments in your country.
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will
not sit on this money when you claim it, rather you
would assist me properly.

I intend to give you 20% of the total money if you can 
assist me claim these from the security company.When I
receive your positive response I will let you know where 
the Security Firm is and the Payment Pin Code to claim 
the money which is very important. What I need is for you 
to indicate your interest that you will assist me by 
receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you 
shall be considered to be the beneficiary of the money. 
The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend 
to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is 
presently in the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Service Company
in Europe.

I cannot do this myself because I am presently living
in a Western European Country and my Status here is
that of a Political Refugee and moreover I do not want
the Government of my Country to know about
the money because they will believe I got the money
from my brother while he was still in office as
President. Once you confirm the receipt of the money,
I would leave where I am presently located and come
over with my Children to your Country to start a new
life with my Family.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring
some estates in your country. For this purpose also,
you shall be my project manager for the properties I
hope to acquire in your country and you will be paid
based on a certain percentage agreed upon by both of
us.

For now, let all our communication be by e-mail
because of the nature of this transaction but for more
details on this transaction you can contact my lawyer
(Bar Harry Fenadez) on this tel number 0031-630-674-930.
It is very important you contact him because he will be
the one to represent me in all legal matters to back this
pending transaction since i cannot move at the momemt. 

Please send me your Telephone and Fax numbers as it
would be better for me to get to you now by any of
this means. This would be for our better peace of mind
before and after these funds are transferred into your
account.

The reason why it took this long to get to you was
because of the Security Firm's agreement with me which
was that my brother must personally sign the Power of
Attorney that would transfer title to the prospective
beneficiary. It was a long wait but it has now paid
off. His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to be
personally involved for security and personal reasons.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

JANG DOO-HWAN

extracted from two(2) various contracts awarded by these committees to two foreign firms for the installation and repair  of Libreville & Portfranco refinery respectively.And the firms have since completed their works in the two refineries in the last regime. And  their original contract sum have since been paid to them.This US 20,000,000 as a result

transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded every arrangement to protect the interest of everyone involved. All modalities for the successful transfer of this fund have been worked out with the Federal Ministry of finance and the Central bank of Gabon to facilitate the remittanceof this money to your designated account.

However,I know that you will be honest enough and will not raise any misgiuding attitude in any aspect of the transaction, very confidential so as not to tarnish the confidence reposed on these officers by the nation financial house and assurance that our money will be given to us if this money enters your account.

I don't see anything that may be a perllib error. It seems like a timing
problem between fvwm and modules. I see (use FvwmGtkDebug) that on the
new window creation fvwm sends packets M_ADD_WINDOW and two M_MAP.
I don't know why it sends two M_MAP-s.

So, it is possible, for example, that if you send DestroyStyle command
between these M_MAP-s, this command is ignored, but it is not ignored
after the second M_MAP. Can you please investigate this?

Alternativelly, can you try to reproduce the problem with FvwmEvent
instead of your own perl-based module?

The EnableOptions argument should be hash, not boolean.
And if the module mask is not explicitelly set, it is guessed from the
defined event handlers (in cvs), so this line may be reduced to just:

  my $module = new FVWM::Module;

Mikhael.

I tried to wait for the second map event - see the attached script - and
it works. I will use the sleep 1 workaround in production code though. Who
knows how long the strange second M_MAP event will stay with us.

Tried this, too, with the following commands:
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Echo
*FvwmEvent: map "map"
Module FvwmEvent

It works, I can actually see both "map"s in the output. This doesn't
surprise me much, if I think about it. If the map event didn't work in
FvwmEvent, somebody would probably have noticed earlier.

Yup, verified this, too.

By the way, no need to cc me, I'm on the list.

But you didn't send any DestroyStyle command in this test.

Surelly, any module (in Perl or not) sees the same events, 2 map events
in our case. This is not the problem, If I understand you, the problem is
that DestroyStyle after the first map is ignored. I don't have your
system and applications, so I may have different timing results.
I actually never was able to reproduce your original problem.

Here is a proper test, please confirm that it has the same problems:

*FvwmEvent-NetscapeTest: Cmd
*FvwmEvent-NetscapeTest: map NetscapeDestroyStyleAndExit

DestroyFunc NetscapeDestroyStyleAndExit
AddToFunc   NetscapeDestroyStyleAndExit
+ I ThisWindow (!Netscape) break
+ I Echo Got M_MAP for Netscape
+ I KillModule FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NetscapeTest
+ I DestroyStyle Netscape

# repeat these 3 commands as many times as needed
Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NetscapeTest
Style Netscape !Borders
Exec exec netscape

If it does not show problems then use the same technique in your script,
create a function at the start and execute it on the first "map".
If it shows the same problem then you can do nothing other than waiting
for the fix in fvwm.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm not sure if this is fvwm bug or something else but I've been seeing this
happen for a while now... if I scroll a page I'm viewing in Mozilla/Firebird
with a window covering a part of it... the page gets distorted like this ...

http://kingsly.net/buggy.png

You can see the normal view here... 

http://kingsly.net/normal.png

When I move the mouse over to any other window(ie., focus shifts).. the
corruption/distortion disappears! 

I'm using fvwm 2.5.7 and XFree 4.2 w/ NVIDIA drivers.(have seen this happen
on plenty of versions of mozilla(upto 1.4) and Firebird 0.61 and older
versions of fvwm 2.5.x too.)

If a part of the window is outside one edge of the screen ... the corruption
extends to the entire page as seen here - http://kingsly.net/edge-bug.png

Looks like a broken gfx driver.  Very similar to the effect I see
with the GeForce 4 MX and the latest vendor driver.

Aha!  That explains everything.  The NVIDIA drivers are notorious
for their low quality, especially with very new (and very old)
cards.  Can't you use the nv driver that comes with XFree?  You
may need to upgrade to XFree 4.3.

FROM:KHIN M. LWIN
E-MAIL:lwinkm01@netscape.net
Dear Sir/Madam,
I apologize for the unexpected nature of this mail. I got your e-mail
address from the Thailand intercontinental peace group.
I am Khin Myint Lwin, 55, Chinese/Burmese, and the leader of the Myanmar
Kyone Yeom Group headquartered in Mong Yawn, Myanmar. We engage in Real
Estate, food processing and the transportation of Chinese, Thai and
Burmese migrant workers to destinations around the globe.
I am writing you from my Yangoon home where I await my appeal case
against a 37 years jail sentence I received for alleged human trafficking,
illegal
sale of gold and running a prostitution ring. I am currently under house
arrest. My appeal hearing is set for December 2003.
These are all trumped-up charges. One of my boats carrying migrant
workers to Singapore last year was hit by waves and sank killing 87
passengers they suspected me of funding the Karen National Liberation Army
(KNLA), a
rebel movement fighting for the rights of the Karen ethnic group in Myanmar.
The government has also seized most of my assets valued at nearly one
Billion dollars ($973,000,000.00) in Myanmar, Thailand and
China.
My wife and three daughters (8,12,14) are now staying with my mother
in-law in Mandalay. They now face a severe disruption in their livelihood
and
the education of my daughters is in jeopardy. This feels me with so much
pain. My wife and daughters are my main concern right now.
I have a cash account deposit I made in the Netherlands, which the
Burmese government didn't know about. When I liquidated my flower and
electronic
companies in the Netherlands in 2002, I deposited the proceeds of Eleven
million dollars ($11,000,000.00) in a securities firm in the Netherlands
while I was negotiating the take-over of a telecom company in Germany.
Right now, I need this money so I could get the best lawyer for my appeal
case coming up in December and most of all get my family out of Myanmar
to a safer country. They face constant harassment from government agents.
I need your assistance to get some of this money through to my wife and
daughters who are in Mandalay. Your responsibility will be to assume the
new ownership of the money. Transfer this money into your own account for
safety
first.
You will keep 20% for your efforts. You will then send my share in bits
as I family to leave Myanmar. I can also get the best lawyer and lobby power
and most possibly be free soonest.
ownership changed to yours. I can do this online and via email. Luckily, I
can monitor the status of my deposit via the Internet with my login info.
When all is done, the company will contact you about your new status. They
will tell you what to do. Most of their transactions can also be done
online. After that, you carry out the directives as explained above.
If you do this, I will be personally grateful to you in many ways. Not
only in the 20% of ($11M) reward you will get, but also when I am free, as I
know I will soon, I will show you what it means to do me a favor.
If you can't, or decide not to, I will understand. Thanks for your attention
anyhow.
Regards,
Khin Myint Lwin

To get the voting finally started, I suggest the following voting
process that tries to take all the concerns into account.
Unless one of the people with commit access voices a veto, I want
to begin the election within one week.

 - Anybody may vote if he or she:
   - submitted a logo
   - was subscribed to the fvwm or fvwm-workers mailing list prior
     to 10-Oct-2003 (regardless of whether he/she is still
     subscribed).
     [to prevent cheating]

 - The election is done in two stages
   [one stage would be better, but I think we would get too few
   votes per logo on average]

 - During the election, no results are published and the logo
   mailing list is closed for all but the contest maintainers.

 - In the first stage:
   - Any number of votes may be cast, but at least 10.
     [to get enough votes in total]
   - The voting period is two weeks.

 - Second stage:
   - The winning 15 logos of the first stage reach the second
     stage.
   - Any number of votes may be cast.
   - The voting period is two weeks.

Ciao

I am quite busy at the moment. So I would like to start the
voting on 15. October.

This is a good idea. How will we check if someone is
subscribed? Do we have access to the subscriber list?

I am not sure about the 10 votes but I have no objections.

Subject: Enhancement: Style to take $w Window ID

Full_Name: Tim Baverstock
Version: 2.4.6 (Debian/Woody)
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux vermillion 2.4.16-k6 #1 Wed Nov 28 10:34:08 EST 2001 i586 unknown
X_Server: XFree86 Version 4.1.0.1 / X Window System
Submission from: (NULL) (62.253.128.6)


I've written a 'stays on top' function (and its antifunction), that
operates on random windows, in much the same way that Sticky operates on
random windows (ie windows with only user-nomination in common).

My problem is that sticky windows are distinctive, but I can't make my
'stays on top' windows visually distinctive. (I'd like to give them a
yellow border.)

Enhancement 1: The following would seem to be a sensible syntax, except
that $w isn't a valid kind of parameter for Style.

AddToFunc GlueWindow
+ I Layer 0 6
+ I Style $w Color purple/yellow
+ I Raise

I imagine the above would be easier than the following suggestion:

Enhancement 2: If keying on $w isn't desireable, perhaps random windows
could be added to arbitrarily named sets (possibly a window could be a
member of multiple sets), so the magical behaviour of Sticky would be more
regular.

Regards,

Tim Baverstock.

This is already possible. In 2.5.8 from cvs use "WindowStyle Colorset 9",
it works better than your suggested "Style $[w.id] Color purple/yellow".

Hi Mikhael,

Thanks for your feedback.

ok, done.

I couldn't actually get Perl to care about this. (ie. it appears
to ignore the version number.) I changed the patch to use 0.51_2 anyway.

Does work for me, but remove quotes too, otherwise it gives a warning.

perl -MX11::Protocol=0.60
Argument "0.51_2" isn't numeric in subroutine entry at - line 1.
X11::Protocol version 0.6 required--this is only version 0.51_2 at ...

That would be great, thanks.

That is a good idea. (to make a v2.0 release before v2.1 release)

> btw, are your changes of X11::protocol in the cpan ? did Stephen answer ?

Stephen has not answered. The FvwmTabs website now links to my own
patched distribution of X11::Protocol.

> if not, are your changes compatibles ? (ie will all  packages 
> that are using x11::protocol work with your package ?)

All changes to X11::Protocol are backwards compatible. Other applications
that use X11::Protocol will not notice/care if the patched version is
installed.

SCoTT. :)

I suggest these colorset usability things:

1) New colorset option "Clear" or "NoEffects" depending on what it does
that removes all effects from a colorset, it may be aproximately
equivalent to:

  Colorset N NoDither, \     # not sure about this one
    Tint, fgTint, bgTint, Alpha, fgAlpha, IconTint, IconAlpha, \
    Plain, NoShape, fg, bg   # not sure about these 4

This is intended to be used in dynamical configurations as in:

  Colorset N Clear, fg .., bg .., VGradient ..  # set completely new colors

I.e. it either resets all effects leaving only fg/bg/image/gradient or
resets everything. Both are ok for me. Probably reseting everything is
preferred. In this case Clear may work like CleanupColorsets just on a
single colorset.

2) It seems to me that whenever I do "Tint color percent" I always want
to do "bgTint color percent" too, otherwise the sh/hi colors look
incorrectly. So I think, "Tint" should also set "bgTint". If someone
really wants the current behaviour (doubtly), he may always reset
"bgTint", i.e. "Tint cyan 20, bgTint". For most of cases bgTint will be
redundant with this proposal.

3) It seems to me that whenever I do "Transparent" or "RootTransparent"
I always want to do "bg average" after that. I remember the last time we
discussed this it was rejected, since it takes time to evaluate average.
However most of users will need to do it anyway, just explicitely.
I think "bg average" should be implicetely set after every background
image/gradient/transparent change.

I think this may be solved nicely in this way. Initially or after "Clear"
or after "bg average", bg is set to be "average"-ed on every background
change, hovewer after explicit bg setting, the auto-averaging is off.

Olivier, please comment.

Regards,
Mikhael.

What about using fvwm functions

AddToFunc SetClearColorset
+ I Colorset $0 ... clearing ...
+ I Colorset $*
 
AddToFunc SetColorsetTint
+ I Colorset $0 Tint $1, bgTint $1

The colorset code is delicate. As we are in feature freeze I am not
very motivated to change some code which seems bug free (for some
minor feature).

I disagree. "bg average" can be very slow and can use a lot of
(dynamical) memory. It can also reduce fvwm usability under certain
situation, e.g., FvwmBacker big bgs => 2 secs or more for switching
between desks (colorset FvwmBacker bg can solve this but you should
have all your bg in memory ...). I think that it is better that the
user set "bg average" itself (there is a "warning" in the man page, he
takes his responsibility).

By the way, I think we should fix this problem: when the bg is big
the average bg colour can be computed on a random subset of points
of the bg.

This is more or less practical except that it is hard to suggest this to
users and they will need this to ensure no previous Tint/Alpha is left.

> + I Colorset $0 Tint $1, bgTint $1

This is not practical at all, Tint is always only one of the several
options, doing it on a separate line does not help to what I try to
achieve, to minimize the syntax for a correct look.

It is very difficult to argue arguments like these, I don't want bugs
myself, but I will try. :)

If we will always need to use such SetClearColorset function and never
the original Colorset command in fvwm-themes or other setups with dozens
of colorsets, then I feel it is not a minor feature, but a misfeature of
Colorset command, leading to an unneeded overhead (calling functions).
It will also lead to flickering, if it is done using 2 Colorset commands
like suggested above. (Yes, it may be done using one Colorset command.)

I feel that having different Tint and bgTing is almost always incorrect,
we should not default to this.

I would like to have both of these things built-in since they seem
essential to me (Clear option and making bgTint redundant).

Having to specify "bg average" explicetely is not very important for me.

I just wanted the novice user not to worry about anything when he
specifies Colorset Transparent. Currently when someone asks about
transparent menus or modules (this happens and will happen all the time),
the correct good looking answer is:

  Colorset 9 RootTransparent, bg average, Tint black 20, bgTint black 20

I hoped, the answer should be (with the same results) just:

  Colorset 9 RootTransparent, Tint black 20

This is more understandable, the previous line is less intuitive.

But again, exlicit "bg average" is not a real problem for me.

Mikhael.

I tried that, it works as expected.

I tested this, too, the script is attached. It fails again. Neither the
DestroyStyle nor the Beep nor the Echo command is executed (as before, the
echo at startup works allright). I tried it it with xterm instead of
netscape, and it turns out that this works *sometimes*. But either all
three commands make it or none of them.
This behavior is the reason why I didn't check DestroyStyle with FvwmEvent
at the first time.

This bug might well be timing-related, as you already conjectured. Maybe
it only shows up on my obsolete system. FYI it's an old PII with Linux
2.2.10 and Xfree86 3.3.4.

Best regards

Jochen

I prefer resetting individual options with the '!' prefix:

  Colorset n !bgTint, !fgAlphaa, ...

@2,3:  This kind of automagically setting options when something
else is used has caused me great pain in the past:

  - The result depends on the order of commands:
      Colorset n Tint x, bgTint y
    is not the same as
      Colorset n bgTint y, Tint x
  - The above is confusing for the user
  - It's often impossible to enhance the featureset without
    breaking compatibility (e.g. see the new focus policy styles).
  - It's much more difficult to change later.

In my eyes, a big fat comment in the man page should do.

The resetting already works if you don't suply an argument in any
option like fgTint (reset to none), fgAlpha (reset to 0), fg (reset to
black), sh (recalculated from bg), fgsh (recalculated from fg+bg).
We don't need to invent new syntax here.

I only want a shortcut "Clear" instead of specifying a dozen of options
like shown above (and in the future we will have more such options).

Such argument would be right if not one fact. In 99% of cases the user
does not want a separate bgTint. Having a separate bgTint is confusing.
It is much less confusing to always do just:

  Colorset n Tint blue 15

and get the needed result. Similarly this removes the tint (and bgTint):

  Colorset n Tint

So I suggest either to remove a separate bgTint option completely or make
it invisible to the user. If you are still not convinced, suppose that in
the future we add shTint and hiTint, and they are not autocalculated,
then it is "Tint red 20, bgTint red 20, shTint red 20, hiTint red 20"
just to tint anything, because the old code "Tint red 20, bgTint red 20"
does not now do what is expected for shadow colors. This is bad.

There are by definition fields (like sh, fgsh or bgTint) that should be
automagically set. The user usually does not worry about sh and fgsh, it
gets them for free. The same should be done with bgTint.

I am now convinced that "Tint" is a bad name and should have been
imageTint from the start.

Images don't have a "shadow" or "hilight" colour, so this can not
happen.

This is wrong.  The sh and fgsh colours are *not* set by
specifying the fg, they just have a well documented *default* in
case they are not specified otherwise.  Automatically setting
bgTint would be quite different as it overwrites user preferences.

There is some similar logic in the menu code, and it's hell to
maintain.  As we can not provide a sensible default for bgTint
(for performance reasons), I am for simply documenting this.  I
mean, if someone is too impatient to read five lines of man page
to correctly configure tinting, there is little we can do.

No, it should be called "ImageOrGradientOrShapeTint" or just "Tint". :)

(I didn't actually check the relation between Tint and Shape.)

This is incorrect, images or gradients placed in a 3d frame (in menus or
modules) do have shadow and hilight colors. Use "bg average" to see that
these colors match the image well.

If you want an example:

  Colorset 40 fg white, bg average, TiledPixmap fvwm_icons/bckgnd1.xpm
  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 40, BorderWidth 3

Now, do this:

  Colorset 40 Tint yellow 20

Note how the shadow/hilight colors do not match the tinted image anymore.
For the correct look you also need (that I try to make redundant):

  Colorset 40 bgTint yellow 20

Sorry, Dominik, you are wrong again. Do "Colorset 1 bg gray" to see that
all of the "sh", "hi" and "fgsh" are recalculated. This is a great thing.
Otherwise the colorsets would be unusable.

I think you mix here the default values with the "reset x if y is set"
logic. The default for Tint and bgTint is always "black 0". Of course
with my suggestion the default for bgTint will be the current Tint value.

It is not hard to maintain. This simbolic code is everything needed:

  if (option == "Tint")
  {
    new_value = argument ? argument : "black 0";
    tint_value = bgTint_value = new_value;
  }

  if (option == "bgTint")
  {
    new_value = argument ? argument : tint_value;
    bgTint_value = new_value;
  }

Nope.  Maybe "AnythingButFgBgShOrHiTint".  I confess that I'm not
deep enough into the tinting code.

But the image still only has a foreground and background colour.
Anyway, we were talking about simple, out-of-the-box setups.
And with the same reasoning you'd have to demand that the "bg"
option is set automatically when the "fg" option is used.  As the
default bg is a light gray, using "fg white" results in an
unusable

Argh!  This has to be changed - there is no excuse for it.  I'm
not against providing the same value as the default (which is
quite easy to code), but overwriting user preferences is bad.

Well, you can only claim it's not hard to maintain because you
have never stared at such code for hours, trying to come up with
an extension that does not change old behaviour and provides new
features at the same time.

After Tint starts to work like I suggest, it could be named
"AnythingButFgTint" or just "Tint".

I will never want to create the "fg" and "bg" dependancy, because there
is a very legitimate reason to set bg and fg independently. There are
literally millions of fg colors that look well on some fixed bg. There
are much-much less sh+hi combinations that look well with some fixed bg
(and they are hard to manually calculate). And there is usually only one
bgTing value looking well with some fixed Tint value.

So, I would not mix this all.

Well, all fvwm-themes versions (3.5 years for now) depend on this feature
that bg overrides sh and hi, it is a very good and well defined feature.
There is no reason to leave the old hi when bg is changed.

The reason for one or another behaviour is to simplify the life of users.
The current behaviours does this. Your suggestion would make it tougher.
It is meaningless for me to _always_ do "bg something, sh, hi" instead of
"bg something". In rare cases when I want a non automatic "sh" I will set
it explicitely, and _never_ use the previous "sh" value.

I can't argue with this.

However I know that the "setting x resets y" is a very natural feature
where appropriate.

I didn't comment on this previously, but there is no problem here.

Currently the following 2 lines are equivalent:

  Colorset 40 sh yellow, bg gray
  Colorset 40 bg gray, sh yellow

I.e. bg resets sh only if it is not specified in the same command.

cool. i'll probably package it as .51.1 or something like that.

 I added a table to the wm-spec main page, I hope it's ok that way. As it's 
currently listing only one WM, please make sure it doesn't feel too lonesome 
there :).

 The details entry is meant rather for us developers, so that if e.g. somebody 
wants to check some problem related to fullscreen windows handling, they can 
just check the table and grep the details file for _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN. 
That is, e.g. for FVWM just saying fvwm/fvwm/ewmh.c is ok.

 BTW - is the wiki not restricted at all? I just created a wiki account, and 
could immediately modify the page.

Then you will have to adapt fvwm-themes to issue something like

  Colorset n fg xyz, sh, hi

instead of

  Colorset n fg xyz

> There is no reason to leave the old hi when bg is changed.

There is, as I already explained:

  Colorset n bg yellow, sh black, hi black

yields a different result than

  Colorset n sh black, hi black, bg yellow

No.  See below.

And of course you don't have to.  You need to reset sh and hi
*only* if you specified them before.

Fvwm history shows that it is almost never appropriate.  It is
usually confusing (order of statements does matter), and hard to
extend (e.g. menu item hilighting logic).  Using defaults that are
calculated on the fly yields better results almost all the time.

_I_ know what to do if you decide to make it harder to use. I know that
fg only resets "fgsh", not "sh" and "hi". I would worry for other users.
They should not be forced to _always_ do "fg xyz, fgsh" instead of just
"fg xyz". Because the old fgsh will look bad with pretty much any new fg
and they can't remember whether they changed fgsh previously in this
colorset or not.

The beginning users want to only change "fg" and "bg" and don't know
about any small details, just know that all details are successfully
recalculated for them. The advanced users in some cases want to use the
autocalculated details and in some cases may want to adjust them.

Wrong, these lines are equivalent. Did you get my message about this?

Your behaviour does not make it easier for static setups.
It makes it both hard and wrong for dynamic setups.

Using the previous value of hi, when the new bg is set is _always_ wrong.
And in the very rare cases when one wants to preserve it, it is possible.

This is not like some global feel setting that you once set and don't
want to change ever (like !MouseFocusClickRaises). This is colors. You
can't say I want to fixate the sh color regardless of other colors. sh is
not independent, it is very dependent on bg.

The current bg-sh behaviour is ideal for users. Did you ever hear someone
complaining?

You can't make any guess about the previous color theme, so you should
ask everyone to modify their colorsets to the new incompatible behaviour.
Note that this modification does not simplify things, it only adds the
redundant resetting of _all_ details (and probably more in the future).

Also note that I am not against reseting of all existing details on the
_complete_ colorset change, this is why I need the Clear option.
However I see no reason to introduce incompatibility with the current
perfect "change of bg changes sh too" behaviour.

I would like you not to use such vague (and non-verifiable) arguments
like "fvwm history shows" or "you have never stared at code for hours".
Because I may say that "fvwm history shows" that the current bg-sh
behavious is the best for the users and I don't understand you wanting
to break it. As for the developers, I thought implementing nice usable
solutions is supposed to be fun regardless of the difficulty.


If you really want to improve fvwm, I will soon sit and compile the
bug/annoyance list. :) Some seen bugs are hard to make reproducible.
And speaking about bugs, Olivier is correct that the current colorset
implementation is more or less bugless given the amount of the new code.

Regards,
Mikhael.

*Sigh*  We discussed that already for bg/sh/hi.  The beginning
user does *not* need to do any of this as he/she won't be changing
fgsh in the first place.

**Sigh**  You're just arguing for the kicks, right?

  Colorset n bg yellow
  Colorset n sh black, hi black

and

  Colorset n sh black, hi black
  Colorset n bg yellow

are *not* equivalent.

Except in the cases where it's right.  See above.

I don't care one bit about the previous theme.  Maintaining
fvwm-themes usability is your problem, not mine.  Don't claim to
be talking about fvwm's usability when you're actually talking
about fvwm-themes, which is irrelevant to me.

Then stop arguing and look at the several examples of code where I
had exactly these problems.  You constantly accuse me of not
reading what you write, yet you are too lazy to even consider what
I am saying, or even follow the pointers I give you.

Sure.  Because you don't do the maintenance

Well, I *you* really want to improve fvwm, why don't you just
*fix* these bugs instead of annoying me with vague hints to bug
lists that you have been to lazy to compile for more than a year.

[snip]

As always, this discussion is pointless.  I will commit the
patches I have in mind soon and end it this way.  You can continue
to worry about fvwm-themes, and I will continue to worry about
predictable, flexible, well documented sytax and behaviour in the
fvwm core.

Over and out

I am happy that they don't work equally. Because in the second case the
user definitelly wants to use the yellow background and recalculate the
sh and bg colors to match yellow.

I am tired to repeat this argument. The "sh" color is not independent
from "bg" by its mere definition. Setting it in the separate line
before the "bg" line and expecting it to work makes no practical sence.

I don't worry about fvwm-themes, it is clean and patching it for the new
behaviour is trivial. It will use Clear anyway (either Olivier or me will
add this option) and everything we discuss here will be irrelevant.
But I worry about users that unlike you change colorsets constantly in
FvwmConsole or similar. Ask them whether they want to specify "bg yellow"
or "bg yellow, fg, sh, fgsh" (and maybe more of these in the future) to
change the bg.

Do you change colorset definitions defined in your configuration? If no,
then why should you worry at all about one or another behaviour
implemented by other developers? I would at least try to find a reason
for it working this way.

If you speak about FocusStyle, it is huge and full of backward
compatibility issues. I don't think comparing FocusStyle with colorsets
is very correct. FocusStyle values are not supposed to be changed often.

I should agree that, yes, I feel you don't listen to my arguments.

I do understand your arguments to make the code clean. I think that
the "setting x resets y" logic does not make the code less clean if
implemented correctly. There are 2 calls of reset_y(), that's all. 
It is much less clean _for_me_ to keep a global flag for y indicating
that y was ever set by a user and have conditions based on it.

Of course, you need such local flag so that "Colorset sh s, bg b" works
equivalently to "Colorset bg b, sh s", so both behaviour implementations
are more or less equivally clean/unclean.

It ends up that for new things (without backward compatibility issues),
we should choose one or another behaviour based on the user needs, not on
the code issues.

The situation is strange.

Tim coded this logic in 1999. Olivier enhanced it to work with fgsh too.
I try my best to convince you it is good. And you yesterday learned about
it and want to break it without asking Tim, Olivier and me.
Very constructive.

Mikhael.

I have PII too, but the more updated software.

After some fidling, I can reproduce the problem with Netscape, but not
with other programs and really sometimes.

I think the problem happens only with modules that send some command
to fvwm and immediatelly terminate themselves. I tried to see whether
I can do anything on the perllib side, and I think that everything
possible is done, the pipes are flushed and properly closed. I will
see later whether something may be done on the fvwm side.

There are 2 solutions for you.

1) Add sleep(5) before terminate(), it should not affect the module
logic.

2) Don't make the module terminate itself, ask fvwm for KillModule.
You may nulify the module mask after doing this if needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Breaking long lines must never change the result of the issued
commands.  All relevant commands that have the potential to
generate very long lines work this way (Style, MenuStyle, Colorset,
BugOpts, ...) and the ones that do not are scheduled for removal
(ButtonStyle, TitleStyle, BorderStyle).  There is one documented
exception in Style:  IconBox and IconGrid, and I am not happy with
it.  We already had mails from confused users because they split
their style lines.

I don't care about a "Clear" option, except that the syntax is
bad.  We have way too many different ways to reset complex user
defined structures already (Styles, MenuStyles, Decors, Functions,
Menus).  Other than that, the intended behaviour is perfectly
acceptable for me.

This is perfectly predictable for the user.  If she just set sh
and hi, then change bg, it's perfectly clear why the old settings
are kept.

I think you are confusing my part in the colour set
implementation.  And, by the way, in the past I have been the only
one who ever worried about syntax, so it comes naturally that I
talk about it in this case too.

You may also look at the menu hilighting code.  Or the MenuStyle
logic when the mwm/fvwm style is set.

I disagree.  Picking a different syntax and slightly different
behaviour for every new feature is short sighted.  The current
state of fvwm syntax shows why:  each command has its of, slightly
deviating syntax.  This makes it hard to learn the language and is
utterly confusing.  I have made some progress towards the ultimate
goal of a unified syntax, but there is a long way to go.  In 3.x,
there is no place for features with extravagant syntax and complex
interactions between separate options.

Some important characteristics of the future syntax are:

 1. Disabling an option always uses the same syntax ("!option")
 2. Same for reinstating the default value (how?)
 3. Same sor enabling an option and providing arguments
 4. Similar features use similar syntax
 5. No hard coded behaviour that can not be changed (e.g. the
    infamous "window loses focus when it is iconified" mis-feature)
 6. No hidden interaction between low level options
 7. No overriding of user preferences
 8. Sets of low level options may be configured by higher level
    convenience options (like "MenuStyle mwm" or
    "Style * SloppyFocus" we have now).

You may not have noticed, but I have been trying to unify the way
the fvwm syntax works in all areas for years.  Apart from the fact
that I was deeply involved in the development of colour sets.

Hi Mikhael,

This question is for you, but others might know the answer too.

How can I get the window Id of the decoration frame added by FVWM?
(via Perl/Tk or X11::Protocol)

To elaborate:
FVWM adds a decoration frame to each toplevel window. I want to know
the window Id of this decoration frame so I can detect 'EnterWindow'
events (to fix a focusing race condition in FvwmTabs).

After reading the Tk::Wm man page I thought $toplevel->wrapper()
would do what I want, but I just get a '0' value.

Any help/pointers muchly appreciated.

SCoTT. :)

It appears to be the great-grandparent of the toplevel window.
I was able to get it with a trio of XQueryTree() calls, but I'm not
sure how portable this is?

The difference between our ideologies is clear.

You see Colorset as a static configuration command, this is why you think
the paragraph above is correct. I see Colorset as dynamical command and
this is why I don't think the paragraph above is correct for Colorset.

Think about this set of 2 ordered commands (I may find a better example):

  XMoveResizeWindow(window)
  XMoveWindow(window)

as opposite to this:

  XMoveWindow(window)
  XMoveResizeWindow(window)

Of course they yield different results. They are designed to.

I guess you will say that then we need 2 kinds of bg, one that resets all
details and one that does not. I think it would be really redundant here.
We should just document that Colorset behaves like script command, not
like configuration command.

I run fvwm for monthes without Restart. As a user I don't remember
whether I ever issued "Colorset 1 sh" after the last restart. Also as a
supporter I can't ever suggest "Colorset 1 bg" on the mailing list,
because I can't make any prediction about what user did previously with
this colorset. I must _always_ suggest "Colorset 1 bg yellow, fg, sh,
fgsh", to reset the old user details. The user very quickly becomes aware
of _all_ possible colorset details and their meaning. There is no
information hiding where it wants to be (one of the computer science
patterns).

I see no problem to have different behaviours for different commands.

I really like the dynamical behaviour of Colorset. The order between
options in one command does not matter. The order between commands may or
may not matter. A bit similar to how Style works. Not the same, sure, but
you may compare the way Style entry "a*" overwrites "ab*" entry defined
in the previous command with the way bg color overwrites sh color defined
in the previous command.

In the spirit of the current behaviour of Colorset the most natural
implementation of Clear for me would be this. This option resets
everything in this colorset that is not specified in the same command.
Just like currently these two commands are equivalent:

  Colorset 5 Tint green 15, bg average, hi gray90

  Colorset 5 hi gray90, bg average, Tint green 15

These two commands should be equivalent too:

  Colorset 5 Clear, fg white, bg average, hi gray90, VGradient ...

  Colorset 5 fg white, hi gray90, bg average, Clear, VGradient ...

Of course I want to hear comments from Olivier first about this.
Maybe he may even implement the Clear option for me. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Take a look at:

  fvwm-perllib --man FVWM::Module::Tk

In the SYNOPSIS example I use $top->wrapper->[0].

I don't know what Tk does, it is very possible that it reparents their
widgets sometimes. I just don't know. I hope GTK+ is more consistent
(you may see its synopsys for the same example too).

Mikhael.

Anyone have any ideas about a syntax for disabling button 2 doing
a menu tear off?

It doesn't look like we have any comands for controlling button
or key action on menus.

It looks like context M (menu) could be used:

Mouse 2 M N TearOff
Mouse 2 M N -

Key BackSpace M N TearOff
Key BackSpace M N -

But that would create a pretty substantial change in the menu code.

Yes - as the menu code is unable to handle normal bindings.  I
once made an attempt to make the menu code able to run
concurrently to the normal event loop.  In the end I concluded
that it's better to dump fvwm and write something new.

I would like to finish the voting sites and start voting as
soon as possible.

Has anyone a solution for this?

Jason, can the lists of subscribed users accessed somehow?
If I had the email addresses I could generate an id for
each address and sent them to the user.

Cheers, Uwe

I'm surprised this works. In a simple test script Perl spewed out
an error on a similar line of code.

In the end I ended up using:

$toplevel->frame();

which gave me what I wanted.

frame() & wrapper() tend to do counter-intuitive things. At least
to my way of thinking.

SCoTT. :)

Hi!

I've now finished a swedish translation of FVWM. It's been filtered
through the sv translation project, so it should now be pretty accurate.
I've attached the translated po-files which were generated from 2.5.7. I
did not however bothered to create and attach diffs for the involved
build files, I hope that's ok.

Regards,

As someone reported recently, snapshots seem to be broken.
The latest one seems to be 20030814.

Jason, can you take a look at this?

The web page has a link to "alpha" versions.
This seems to be the 2.1.0 thru a 2.4.0 version.
I don't think these files server a useful purpose.
Anyone disagree?

Yes, the "alpha" link may be removed from the web.

Done.

Jason,

You may want to remove everything in:

/pub/fvwm/version-2/testing

I don't think there is anything using these files anymore.

You may send "cvs diff -u po/*.po" output to us so we see what was
autogenerated. Then please remove all files marked "M" too.

  rm po/*.{ar,fr}.*
  cvs update

I don't know yet when/why/how these files where regenerated at all.

I want to release 2.5.8 in the end of October, hopefully after adding the
deb package creating procedure.

There are some noisy debug statements that I think should be disabled for
2.5.8. They may be enabled later if needed.

Dominik, can you please take a look?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Since a new release is due soon I just thought I'd test the rpm-dist
option and got this error on my RH9.0 box....

Processing files: fvwm-debuginfo-2.5.8-0.20031022
Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1
rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1
 
RPM build errors:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/awol/cvs/fvwm/rpm'


FYI what I have installed is...

Since I took the time translating this, atleast an answer would be nice.

Sorry for no explicit answer, but the answer was in the Olivier message
from Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2002 22:37:17 -0600

  * I do not think we should try to found translators now. We should
  be under "String" freeze for that. I do not think FvwmTaskBar.pot
  will change, but I think that fvwm.pot will change (in particular the
  "rc" part).

Basically we are not in the ask-for-translations phase yet.

But I will add your translations anyway.

Mikhael.

Apart that these are nice features to have, this was the only way for me
to supress the persistent deadlocks between fvwm and FvwmAnimate
(FvwmAnimate was killed after a long timeout).

So, if you have similar problems with:

  # commands making FvwmAnimate crazy, like:
  All (XTerm) Iconify
  # or some unfortunate configuration reload with a lot of things started

you may solve this now using:

  SendToModule FvwmAnimate push pause
  # commands making FvwmAnimate crazy
  SendToModule FvwmAnimate pop

Mikhael.

Hi Workers,
(BTW, you do good work!)

Here's a "plus" sign button I use as part of a "Mac-like" scheme:

# Large plus symbol
ButtonStyle 5  13 60x20@0 60x40@0 80x40@1 80x60@0 60x60@0 60x80@0 
40x80@0 40x60@1 20x60@0 20x40@1 40x40@1 40x20@1 60x20@1

I've attached a screencap of the titlebar that uses this one and others 
from your site.

Subject: How to create fvwm deb packages from fvwm sources

Anyone with deb tools installed may now create deb packages by issuing:

  make deb-dist

This creates dist from fvwm sources (cvs) and then creates deb package
from this tarball. If you already have the tarball (downloaded the
official tar.gz release or produced it using "make dist"), then it is
possible to skip the dist stage and issue:

  make deb-this

Some arguments like cparams, mparams, release=1, version=2.5.10 may be
passed to make (see Makefile.am for examples). It makes sense to specify
a non current version=x.y.z for "deb-this" only, not for "deb-dist".

This all is fully analogous to "make rpm-dist" and "make rpm-this".

Additionally it is possible to build directly in sources/cvs using:

  make deb-inplace

with the same optional parameters. This is a bit faster, but not as
advisable as "make deb-dist".

To test all this, I executed the following two make-s concurently on the
same cvs tree on my RedHat system:

  wget ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.3.22.tar.gz
  make deb-this version=2.3.22 release=2 fullname="Mikhael Goikhman"

  make deb-dist

And believe me or not but proper deb packages for both 2.3.22 and 2.5.8
were created.

I will take care of releasing deb packages together with rpm packages on
new releases. Thanks to Andrei Mitrofanow who is ready to build the deb
packages. (On Debian system of course.)

Regards,
Mikhael.
