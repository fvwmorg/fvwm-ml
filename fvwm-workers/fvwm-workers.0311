I suggest we start now with the voting and think about that problem
later.  Is there anything to be done before we start?  And who is
going to send out the announcement?

I think that patch is okay.  We'd have to think more about
overriding the built in key bindings, though.

Jason, can you send the list of email addresses to Uwe?

Or, another solution, Uwe creates a scripts that receives a list of
addresses from stdin (one address per line) and sends it to Jason.
Then Jason runs this script on the subscribed user addresses.

So every subscriber gets one email with its own personal voting url.

It may even get 2 emails if we have 2 voting stages.

No announcement is needed in this case, just visit the url and vote.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't see why we couldn't do the keybindings, but I don't think
anyone is complaining about them.

I'm not too sure about the button 2 default though.  Its too easy
to trigger by accident.  (Which has its good and bad points.)

There are 2 issues here. Global menu bindings and item specific bindings.

Defining configurable menu actions is not trivial, a lot of actions
(actually the whole menu language) should be invented, like go to the
title of the current submenu item, or go to +5 items or to the last item,
or go to the next hot item "r", or unpost, or cancel.

I think it may be done without defining such menu actions initially.
The logic may be: check whether this binding matches the Key definition,
if no, then procede to the hard coded bindings.

But I think users want menu item specific bindings, not global menu
bindings. I.e. define 3 (or more) commands in one item, they will be
executed on different mouse buttons/modifiers. This can't be done without
redesigning the menu, currently only one command is defined per item.

I think the problem here is that there is no difference between button
release and click+release. The ultimate configurability would allow to
define an action on either mouse click or click+release or release.
Currently tear off works on either click+release or release of button 2.
For Menu, I would prefer click+release only, but this would disallow
tear off for Popup. I don't know.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fvwm 2.5.8 (built from ports on FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE-p13) seem to be

Thank you. I am going to adapt the php scripts so that only people subscribed to
this lists can vote for logos.

I am going to send a mail containing a personal voting key to all subcribed

Done. I am going to keep the mail address lists private to
avoid missusage.

I extracted 751 uniqe mail addresses from the mailing lists
and for artists. Do you think we need to force voters to
vote for 10 logos or more? If so I have to implement a check
for this. (Almost done :)

If not I would generate the mails for voters tommorow. Is
there a deadline for the voting process? 

Currently the mail to the voters would look like this:

As an extra usability thing, can you please remove the first 3 spaces,
otherwise it is problematic to double click to select the whole word in
some terminal based mailers.

The same here, so the whole line does not exceed 80 chars when possible.

I think (hope) a better English is:

  Here is your personal id for participation in the voting:

  Please enter this id into the web form at:

  Or access the personal voting page directly using this link:

The sender should be a real person with an "@fvwm.org" address to
reduce the spamminess of the mail.  A Reply-To: header can point
back to the list.

Since http links are an important criterion in many spam filters
we should limit ourselves to only one link in the mail and
possibly remove the "http://".

Hi there,

We start the first stage of logo competition  now.  Everyone
subscribed  to  one  of  the  fvwm  mailing  list or who has
submitted a logo for the competition should receive  a  mail
which contains a personal voting id which allows one to vote
for fvwm logos. This id is used to access the voting page.

The first voting stage ends at November 30.

Please vote for the logos in the fvwm logo competition and
help us to find the best logo for fvwm.

Cheers, Uwe

Null pointer looks like is for l_to_v ...

  (gdb) print l_to_v
  $1 = (int *) 0x0
  (gdb) print l_coffset
  $2 = 0
  (gdb) print l_to_v[l_coffset]

It looks to me like you don't have iconv support.
I wasn't able to buid fvwm like that to test a fix.
I tried
  --with-iconv=no \
  --with-iconv-includes=no \
  --with-iconv-library=no \
but still got support.

Did you build this yourself?  Did you get these messages:

configure: warning: ***
configure: warning: *** No iconv() implementation found in C library or libiconv
configure: warning: *** Please install libiconv ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv
configure: warning: ***

Marcus, maybe you should look at this.

If all else fails, edit the config.h manually.  It looks like
iconv is missing in the configure summary.

Try the new --disable-iconf option I just checked in.

The Makefile of the FreeBSD port does not correctly specify
--with-iconv-library. configure thus fails to detect iconv.
Furthermore the Makefile optionally allows fvwm to be built with
iconv support disabled.
I have filed a PR with a patch to correct this, see
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=ports/59032 .
Is it possible for fvwm to work without iconv support? If not
it shouldn't be buildable when iconv is not detected.

Hi there

I also get infinitely flashing window problem (as per incoming/1081 from
Khaled SOUEIDAN).

This only seems to occur when I try to resize an Opera web browser window
(version 7.21 SunoS...it wasn't a problem with the previous version of
Opera).

I'm using : fvwm version 2.5.4
Machine details: SunOS 5.9 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-1000

If it happens, I have to log on from a different machine and kill the
X-session. Just killing the Opera process has no effect.

Thanks

Steve

This has already been fixed in 2.4.17 and 2.5.8.

I hope my testing is good, something isn't right.
I think you'll get the idea:

   --disable-iconv \
   --with-iconv=no \
   --with-iconv-includes=no \
   --with-iconv-library=no \

  With Iconv support?                 no: Explicitly disabled


   --enable-iconv \
   --with-iconv=no \
   --with-iconv-includes=no \
   --with-iconv-library=no \

  With Iconv support?                 system: Explicitly disabled


   --enable-iconv \

  With Iconv support?                 system: Can't find working libiconv

I don't think the message is being set in all cases.

Thanks. I tried 2.5.8 and had different problems (Option windows take an
age to draw), but  2.4.17 seems to be working fine :-)

It would be nice if it worked without iconv.

So far my attempts to work around the missing l_to_v integer
array haven't worked.  (I did disable the free).  But I'm still
getting heap corruption.

I may try again but I'm sure Marcus could fix this faster than
I could.

Yes, it's the problem_iconv variable not being set correctly.

I switch to the workers list.

Really I do not see why we should do nothing about this.  There is no
reason for forcing grabbing for _all_ functions. I already describe
others natural bugs caused by this. I already proposed various
solutions.

Now, attached to this message one of these solutions. It is _not_ the
best solution, however it is a good solution for testing: when the
function is totally immediate fvwm try to grab _fast_ and if grabbing
fail the function is executed anyway.

I use this patch for a long time now without problems (note that I
_need_ such a behavior for my fvwm config).  I will be very interested
to see which type of problems this patch can cause.

Again, I do not see why we should not add a way to force this 
behavior, e.g., with a dummy command
    "grab_fast_and_execute_anyway_if_fail"
as it is totally clear that some functions do not need to grab
the pointer!

Sorry to require you to post the same explanation again.

But my comment was intended to say: Why can't the user explicitelly ask
fvwm to be less reliable (because in fact it will be more relable or more
functional this way, just throwing away all function commands may be more
unreliable in some situations).

It is not critical if another window under the pointer is focused,
although I don't see how this may happen. I would like you to explain me
how a random window may be focused and not the original intended window
_or_ if SloppyFocus is used the window under the cursor, i.e. again the
intended window. But even if this happens it may be ok for the user.

The worst thing I may see is the function has both Focus and Next
commands, then the Next theoretically is not guaranteed to work without
grab (practically I think it will always work, since fvwm executes only
one flow of commands at one time). Still the user knows there is no Next
in his function and he may want to mark the function as grab-less.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Focus corruption in scripts.

Because the side effects are totally unpredictable.

I have iconv installed (as a dependency for other software), but
disabled it for fvwm freebsd port to reduce number of dependencies.

I think Guido explained quite well in another message.

No, i tried it from freebsd port.

Now that i look in the log, yes that message is there.  Since the
build did not fail, i did not care.


I really do not have problem w/ fvwm2 -dev requiring iconv and can
live/build with that.  But... "it would be nice if iconv were not
a requirement".

I will lookup the Guido's patch, and try again by building the port
w/ iconv support.


(Oh, i did find version 2.5.7 somewhere.  I had not deleted it, just
misplaced.  Fvwm2 is much easier to use w/ auto-raise-window feature
than tvtwm due to availability of time delay.)

So, apply the attached patch and explain me how I can reproduce a
problem. We have a list of 100% reproducible real life problems

????

So you say that all fvwm functions need to grab the pointer??
 
By default function execution will not change. We (I) need
to execute certain (totally immediate) function which should not
be aborted because pointer grab fail. What we suggest is something
like:

AddToFunc Foo
+ I NoGrabFailAbort
+ I ...
...

I see no reasons to do not add such a feature as it allows to fixes
various bugs.

In last few episodes: Zero as the value of 'l_to_v', while examining
fvwm core file in gdb, indicated lack of iconv support in fvwm 2.5.8
FreeBSD port, causing fvwm to crash on bringing up a menu.

Now the (semi) conclusion...

It will not be surprise to those who have replied that after pulling
in iconv (correctly), thanks to Guido's patch, fvwm 2.5.8 FreeBSD
port, does not crash anymore.  This message is for the sake of
archive.

Thank you everyone for your help for solving the cause of the crash.

Hi,

i've recently switched to fvwm and am a very happy user now, but i was
missing one feature: window placement under mouse.
I'm using sloppy focus and like to have new windows placed centered
under the mouse pointer. So here's a patch to add the
'UnderMousePlacement' placement mode to fvwm.
Placement is done like this:
1. get the current mouse position, center the window below it
2. if the window goes over the right or bottom screen edge, move it so
it doesn't
3. if the window goes over the left or top screen edge, move it

Does the use of screen_g.x and screen_g.y for left/top ensure that it
also works with xinerama? I don't have a xinerama setup to test that.

Hi Mikhael,

I've got a bug occuring in FvwmTabs which seems to be linked to a
recent change in FVWM perllib.

I'm not too sure what is causing it but the symptoms are that
my toplevels appear to be destroyed before the ON_EXIT handler
is invoked during module restarts. (Actually, it's probably more
accurate to just say that things get screwy before ON_EXIT is
called.)

Do you know of any recent changes that could cause a problem like this?

Any pointers muchly appreciated.

SCoTT. :)

Hi,
	[I am not subscribed to this list, so please CC me on any replies]

	Since the official debian developer has been very reluctant to
 package the 2.5 series, I have decided to package it, and make it
 comply to latest Debian policy. The packages are
 lintian clean, and can be found at:

deb http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/ packages/
deb-src http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/ packages/source/

       These packages were configured as follows (I see no reason not
 to allow rplay and xrender compatibility in fvwm). As you can see
 below, I have included as many of the features as I could.

       manoj

./configure --build i386-linux \
--prefix=/usr\
--sysconfdir=/etc/X11/fvwm\
--libexecdir=/usr/lib\
--mandir=/usr/share/man --with-stroke-library\
--enable-multibyte

FVWM Configuration:

  Version:     2.5.8

  Executables: /usr/bin
  Man pages:   /usr/share/man
  Modules:     /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.8

Hi Mikhael,

After much investigation I tracked down the cause of the bug in
my FvwmTabs module. It was causing my toplevel windows to get destroyed
before the ON_EXIT handler was invoked, as I suspected.

Hi

Since FVWM is currently in feature-freeze before version 2.6.0 is released
I think the patch will have to wait until after that (and the next beta
branch towards 3.0 is started). But it's an interseting patch, and I think
it'll be of use to some people.

You didn't include gdk-imlib. :)

In case you are not aware of it, we provide the deb package from fvwm.org
download page. See also my message on this list from 31 October about
automatical creation of a deb package from the sources.

> --enable-multibyte

This option was removed from 2.5.x.

Mikhael.

Did everyone else get some kind of key for logo voting?

I didn't get one, and I'm subscribed to both the fvwm and fvwm-workers
lists.  Or, do developers not get a vote? :).

	That shall be fixed in tonight's upload. I did not have time
 to update the gdk packages last night (my local mirror did not have
 the requisite packages).

	I am. Please look at the lintian warnings below, there are a
 couple of errors that would keep that package out of Debian proper,
 due to QA. I fixed up the packaging to bring it in line with latest
 policy. 


	Also, I could not find the .dsc and the source package,
 albeit my search on fvwm.org was somewhat cursory.

It would be very cool if you guys put this together so that the packages
were available at Manoj's area so we can get them through APT directly
instead of downloading them and installing them with dpkg -i.

And the fvwm-themes stuff too!!


I guess I'm just spoiled by Debian... I think I need a tshirt with that
on it :).

	I would be happy if people took my patches. Now that I am
 hooked on the 2.5.x branch, I guess I'll always keep a version in
 place on that site (modulo business trips and visiting India sometime
 this winter).

> And the fvwm-themes stuff too!!

	Well, that is the next step. Now that I seem to have a halfway
 decent fvwm setup, I'll try and see if I can package fvwm-themes
 (once I have a nightly cvs-build setup in place for fvwm).

The actual fix was more complex than this.

I tested several extreme cases, but not your case.
Your module may now potentially work differently on exit, so test/fix it.

Send Uwe Pross an email so he can generate a new key for you.
Unfortunately he is away for one and a half week, so it may take
a couple of days.  If you still don't have your key until end of
next week, contact me in private so I can call him on his cell
phone.

Does FVWM support this?

My test app suggests not.

relevant snippet:

print("iw=" . $main->iconwindow() . "\n") if ($main->state() eq 'iconic');

$main->iconwindow() returns undef.

SCoTT. :)

Then you are probably not using an icon window :-)

Just tried, works for me like documented (you get tall greenish icon):

	my $icon = $top->Toplevel(
		-background => "rgb:80/e0/80", -width => 100, -height => 200,
	);
	$top->iconwindow($icon);

Maybe you use both Style Icon and IconOverride? Use NoIconOverride then.

Mikhael.

  AddToFunc func_may_need_pointer_grab
  + I Next (foo) Move $0
  + I All (currentpage, foo) destroy

This function demonstrates a class of functions that always need
to grab the pointer.  Without the grab, CMD_Move is called without
the grab.  Depending on the argument $0 it may or may not enter
__move_loop and establish a grab on the pointer with GRAB_NORMAL
if that fails, CMD_Move is abandoned but function execution
continues.  The next line may now destroy the window refered to by
"Next (foo)" because it was not moved.

With the pointer not being grabbed, any single command in a
function may fail at random and is then skipped with potentially
catastrophic effects (just consider what damage PipeRead may
cause if called improperly).

For this function, it is impossible to predict whether a grab is
needed or not:

  AddToFunc foo
  + I PipeRead some_script

Just to see whether I understand this example.
For this example to show any problem, the following should happen:

  * some app other than fvwm grabs the pointer when the function is
    invoked (pretty unusual situation, I didn't see it often)
  * $0 should be empty, so interactive Move is invoked, since
    non-interactive Move does not requere grab
  * A user intends to move the foo window interactivelly outside
    of the current page (how is it possible?), but he misses this chance

Then I think this example is not very good, because AFAIU
All (currentpage, foo) is almost guaranteed to match foo after
interactive Move.

This shows how difficult (if possible) to create an example that produces
non-requested results. The user requested All destroy and he got it.

I would say the user can't rely on Move to always work, it may fail just
because the parameter is incorrect, or a user canceled the Move using
Escape, or a grab was not acquired. The user may write his function
correctly if he wants to handle all situations, i.e. add Next (foo)
checks to see whether Move worked or not.

For me, it would be better if only one Move fails rather then the entire
function. Although I understand there are potential bad cases. It is just
that we throw away much more good cases than the bad ones.

It would be nice to see a more real life example that would be affected.
Just for my education.

If someone types "PipeRead some_script" command in FvwmConsole or sends
it from another module, then fvwm does not add additional grab, right?
I see no problem if there is a way to ask "foo" to do the same.

Anyway, both of these functions will continue to work just like they do
now with this patch applied, so it still does not explain why the patch
should not be accepted.

I think noone argues that most of the user functions do not require grab.
A typical fvwm-themes configuration has more than 200 functions.

  % fvwm-themes-config -e | grep ^AddToFunc | wc -l
  235

I am not sure about maybe 5 functions, whether they require grab or not
(probably not), but all other 230 functions clearly do not need it. There
are some non-trivial functions with almost all existing fvwm commands
participating overall, still I know for sure they do not require grab.

I see no reason not to allow the user to request ContinueOnGrabFailure.

Just, to avoid additional unrelevant discussion, I mentioned fvwm-themes
as a non-trivial configuration only, I don't want to add
ContinueOnGrabFailure to these 230 functions, although this would
probably be a good idea. The intention is to allow users to add it only
to functions that would be terminated by fvwm completely otherwise.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sure.  I knew you would start to argue about whether what this
example does is usefull or not.

Receiving an UrgencyHint message while the pointer is grabbed is
another example that does not even involve user interaction.

Disagreed.  There are better approaches to circumvent the
UrgencyHint/Ewmh events/Schedule queue problems.

It's just an example that explains why it is impossible to know
beforehand whether the grab is necessary or not.  In the "Move"
example you could have argued that we could add a bit in the
function table that tells whether a function needs a grab or not.

Hm?  According to the patch, if a function with "I" actions only
fails grabbing the pointer, it is simply started without the grab
which opens the floodgates for the described problems.

I don't know about the fvwm-themes functions, but you probably
forget the relation between mouse position and the focus.  The
way the EnterNotify/LeaveNotify handlers work changes drastically
when the pointer is grabbed (i.e. all such events are ignored
while the grab is held).  Without the grab, a random stream of
these events may be read from xlib once the function is done and
cause focus problems or even weird symptoms in combination with
FvwmAuto or FvwmEvent (for example with the autohide setups).
These are mostly random because they depend on what the user does
with the pointer while it is grabbed.

Because in all but the most simple cases, it is extremely hard to
foresee the side effects.

I spoke about the final patch, not the one that was posted (although
the posted one is probably ok too).

In the same message Olivier wrote what the final patch should do:

I suggested to call this "NoGrabFailAbort" as "ContinueOnGrabFailure".

Of course a more correct syntax would be:

  SetFuncProperty Foo ContinueOnGrabFailure

but doing this using a pseudo command is more convenient.

I didn't forget about this, thanks for remainding anyway.

Still most of the functions are simple and executed quickly, they are
pretty much immune against EnterNotify/LeaveNotify events. And the ones
that would be potentially affected usually contain only one command
requiring grab, and this individual command already cares about itself to
receive this grab. Its failure does not add any disaster unless the
function author planned this disaster.

My experience is different. In all but the most unreal cases it is
possible not to grab at all. And we speak about explicit no-grab only.

A function is just a set of commands, if these individual commands are
executed from several bindings or from one module there is no grab, but
still this set of commands is guaranteed to work, because every
individual command is guaranteed to work. It is good we have a kind of
transaction to ensure different commands will work better together.
Now, it would be nice if user is explicitely able to ask to return to the
separate command execution, by this he explicitely asks not to worry
about individual command failure, his function allows this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael,

: I tested several extreme cases, but not your case.
: Your module may now potentially work differently on exit, so test/fix it.

FvwmTabs works fine with this fix.

Thank-you muchly,

: Then you are probably not using an icon window :-)

How can I get the default icon window? (I use a global active focus
policy in FvwmTabs & need to explicitly set the focus to the icon window
when a tab-manager window is iconified.)

>From the Tk::Wm manpage:

I interpret this to mean I'll get a return value of "" if no icon
window is explicitly specified. undef is not "". (Perhaps the man
page doco is wrong?)

I don't think that fiddling with the focus of icons that fvwm creates is
a good thing, but I don't know about the problem.

You may get the FvwmTabs window focused if you send a single "Focus"
command to fvwm with the FvwmTabs window id context. If FvwmTabs is
iconified, then the icon window will get focus. No idea why this may be
needed though.

fvwm does not report to Tk about windows it creates, so Tk only knows
about the windows Tk created itself and suplied as the icon hint, like in
the example I wrote previously.

If you want to know the icon that fvwm uses for a window you should
listen to M_ICON_NAME, M_ICON_FILE and M_DEFAULTICON (and probably to
iconify/deiconify too). Actually the icon id of the icon window is not
reported AFAICS, only the file name, but mini icon id is reported.
See EventNames.pm for the complete information about what is reported.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not to mention "window placement _not_ under mouse", which I prefer.
I get very annoyed when a new window pops up (in belated response to
something I've dispatched ealier) on top of my working window, snatching
the keyboard focus because I like focus-follows-mouse. Ah, wishes:-)
And of course SmartPlacement nearly avoids this occurence. But I would
occasionally like "place the window partly or mostly off-screen if that's
necessary to avoid my mouse".

Hi, Eric.

You posted a patch to support newer GTK+ in FvwmGtk a year ago.
We then discussed it and agreed to improve it as may be seen in this
September 2002 thread named "[PATCH] Add GTK+ 2.0 support to FvwmGtk":

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0209/msg00563.html

Is there any progress with the updated patch?

Would be nice to support both GTK+ 1.x and 2.x versions. Thanks.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Probably doing it another way around is better, start from the clean deb
procedure we provide and suggest its improvements. I think the resulting
deb package is good without any additions as a reference fvwm package for
users of any deb-based distributions, a lot of work was done to polish it.
(Would be nice to actually test other than Debian distributions too.)
Bring your suggestions, of course, if any.

Let's not forget the Olivier's "Setup 95 Wizard" too. :)

It will be very hard to convince me that adding one more setup that is
outdated and was never blessed/supported by fvwm developers into the core
fvwm is a good idea. The problem is any configuration needs maintaining.

I have nothing against an add-on Debian-only package with this setup
included if some Debian people need it.

Yes, my fault.

No, i ran out of spare time around that time, and never got
around to improving it.  Sorry.

Yeah.  I should have some time in a couple weeks.  If no one else
has gotten to it by then, i'll adapt it to your suggestions and
see what else needs to be done with it.

I'm not suggesting we start with the old packaging and remove stuff we
don't need: I'm suggesting we look at the content of the old packaging
and anything we think we need, we implement in the new packaging.  That
could be done by porting the old stuff, or by writing it from scratch.

If we ignore the old package I worry that we'll miss something that was
added for a good reason, then re-learn it the hard way.  Why not take
advantage of the work that was done before, at least enough to
understand what the issues are?

My concern, as I think with most Debian users, is that unlike a Red Hat
system Debian folks generally _DON'T_ install random packages.  Part of
that is a culture thing, since few projects create DEBs, but part of it
is a reaction to the way that lintian, etc. force packages to have some
degree of sanity, similarity, etc.

I'm not in any way saying that the DEBs fvwm creates by default don't do
that, I'm saying that a DEB that's maintained as part of Debian unstable
or experimental or even a developer area will get significantly more use
than a .deb file on the fvwm.org web site.

I'd like to see those two things merge insofar as that's possible.

  mg> Let's not forget the Olivier's "Setup 95 Wizard" too. :)

Indeed; sorry Olivier :).

Yes, that's why we need to have the conversation, to work this out.  One
potential goal might be to get the Debian folk to maintain the Debian
package right in the FVWM distribution itself.

This is, for example, what packages like nfs-utils are doing now: Chip
S. submits patches and builds DEBs more-or-less straight from the
distribution.

Hi,

since FVWM 2.5.7 I also maintain an apt-get'able unofficial unstable 
.deb :) Yesterday I uploaded version 2.5.8.
For instructions and information on my package, see
http://noxa.de/~sbeyer/debian/ ...

I'd suggest a link either on the fvwm download page or on the
http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/deb/ page to alternate FVWM .deb
downloads / apt repositories, for example:
	- Alexander Kotelnikov's
	  http://people.debian.org/~sacha/debian
	- Manoj Srivastava's
	  http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/
	- and mine
	  http://noxa.de/~sbeyer/debian/

...so that Debian users can choose if they want an unofficial unstable
fvwm .deb or build it on their own :)

greets,
sbeyer

PS: I'm new to this list, hope the reply worked with the inserted
"In-Reply-To:" header line taken from the archive.

Sorry for posting this only-tangentially on-topic, but I've been trying
to use the fvwm-themes-users list for 4 days now with no joy :(.

Is that list active?  Whenever I try to subscribe, the confirmation
email never arrives.  I checked my spam filtering and it's just not
there.  Then I tried to send an email to the list, even though I was not
subscribed, and it never showed up.


I need some pointers on ways to customize/personalize the themes; where
should I go for help?


Thanks!

It said that ebay@paulandlesley.org has been successfully subscribed to
FVWM-Themes-users on 24 Nov 2003 19:09:02 -0800.

I will go and approve your message from pausmith@nortelnetworks.com
(and discard 55 spam messages), I don't do this periodically, maybe once
in several months. Please subscribe from pausmith@nortelnetworks.com.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is the one that doesn't work, though.

I then subscribed using a completely separate email address, that I
download via POP, and that one worked so now I'm actually subscribed via
that email address.

But still none of my attempts to subscribe via my normal email addresses
(neither the "real" one nor my gnu.org address) worked.  It's bizarre
because I've subscribed to a number of other lists, even mailman lists,
and it's always worked before...?

It seems like you have some unsuccessful SPAM filter in the middle.
I think I read that spamprobe may discard the first message from any
address, but never the second message. No idea whether this is correct,
but this may explain why you got the logo voting id only on the second
time, so it seems you will be able to get subscrubed on the second time...

Hi Tobias,

I've moved this thread to the fvwm-workers list as the discussion
is a bit technical.

: Changing the SetInputFocus() to 
: "$xServer->SetInputFocus($winId, 'Parent', 'CurrentTime');"
: its all working flawless.

Hmmm, it is interesting that this solves your problem. Earlier versions
of FvwmTabs used to do exactly this, but caused focussing race conditions.
(ie. moving the mouse cursor quickly over a tab-manager & onto another
window would leave the focus on the tab-manager, not the window under
the mouse.)

A side note:
The use of the $tabWin{$tId}{focusTimestamp} was a workaround because
there doesn't appear to be any way to get the timestamp for the
WM_TAKE_FOCUS event. I just use the timestamp from the EnterNotify
event.

: The variables in $tabWin{$tId}{focusTimestamp} does look ok though, but
: i dont have any knowledge about the X11-Protocol. Perhaps you know
: what could be wrong.

Hmmm, the only issue I can think of (that would cause the problem you
describe) is a situation where the XServer (for whatever reason) looks
at the timestamp & decides that it is "old" & ignores the SetInputFocus()
call. (effectively the mechanism used to avoid focussing race conditions.)

ie. suppose in your X server the EnterNotify event is triggered
*before* the WM_TAKE_FOCUS event (which would cause FvwmTabs to
use an "old" timestamp) & in my X server the events are triggered
in the opposite order which would lead to a valid timestamp.

All this is just a hypothesis. It (the hypothesis) needs to be tested.
Let's start with your X server - what version are you using?

Remind me again: this problem only occurs when you switch desks?

: Hopefully i could help you finding the bug.

A good clue! Hopefully we'll get to the bottom of this soon. :)

SCoTT. :)

(As far as i understand the code the EnterNotify does set the timestamp.
That means EnterNotify should be called before WM_TAKE_FOCUS). 

> All this is just a hypothesis. It (the hypothesis) needs to be tested.

I have done the following:


1) Redirected the callback func at
"
$tl->protocol('WM_TAKE_FOCUS', [\&takeFocus, $tId]);
" to a similar with different STDERR output.

In every tried situation there are 2 WM_TAKE_FOCUS first and then 
1 EnterNotify-event.

2 Questions: 
- Why are there 2 WM_TAKE_FOCUS signals ?
- If only EnterNotify does set the timestamp how could the
 WM_TAKE_FOCUS work right now ? 

According to http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#s-4.1.7:
----
Windows with the atom WM_TAKE_FOCUS in their WM_PROTOCOLS property may receive a ClientMessage event from the window manager (as described in section 4.2.8) with WM_TAKE_FOCUS in its data[0] field and a valid timestamp (i.e. not CurrentTime ) in its data[1] field. If they want the focus, they should respond with a SetInputFocus request with its window field set to the window of theirs that last had the input focus or to their default input window, and the time field set to the timestamp in the message. For further information, see section 4.2.7.
----
Cannot this be done instead ? (I dont found examplecode on the web, and dont know much
perl/tk on my own to test it out).


2) 
i commented the WM_TAKE_FOCUS callback func!

The EnterNotify-Event does _work_ if i focus(via mouse) some other
window on current desktop. (situation 1)
---
Got a EnterNotify event: event_y = 741, flags = 2, mode = Normal, event_x = 17, time = 8186630, name = EnterNotify, focus = 0, child = 8389563, event = 8389562, state = 0, detail = Virtual, sequence_number = 1017, root_x = 151, root = 118, same_screen = 1, root_y = 777, code = 7
inside EnterNotify:8186630
inside takeFocus:8186630
---

But if i switch the Desktop (via keyboard)
forth and back, the EnterNotify-Event is triggered but focus not gained. (situation 2)
---
Got a EnterNotify event: event_y = 982, flags = 2, mode = Normal, event_x = 191, time = 8158642, name = EnterNotify, focus = 0, child = 8389563, event = 8389562, state = 8, detail = Virtual, sequence_number = 905, root_x = 325, root = 118, same_screen = 1, root_y = 1018, code = 7
inside EnterNotify:8158642
inside takeFocus:8158642
---


3) I did increment(1) and decrement(2) the timestamp manually.

If i do (1) or (2) with some high number (eg 8000) the focus is
not gained in situation 1! There seems to be some kind of
protection. This could lead to the conclusion that the timestamp
of the EnterNotify-event in situation 2 is too wrong (too old/new)
and therefore got ignored.
Unfortinatly i dont know how to get the "CurrentTime" in perl to
check for differences.

Hi Tobias,

A nice bit of sleuthing! :)

: In every tried situation there are 2 WM_TAKE_FOCUS first and then 
: 1 EnterNotify-event.

Hmmm, I get this sequence of events every time I focus a tab-manager window:
WM_TAKE_FOCUS
WM_TAKE_FOCUS
EnterNotify
WM_TAKE_FOCUS
EnterNotify
WM_TAKE_FOCUS

(Am wondering: how come you get 3 events & I get 6?)

: 2 Questions: 
: - Why are there 2 WM_TAKE_FOCUS signals ?

BIIK - Buggered if I know.

: - If only EnterNotify does set the timestamp how could the
:  WM_TAKE_FOCUS work right now ? 

Yeah, this would be the problem. For some reason I get a WM_TAKE_FOCUS
*after* an EnterNotify event which means I've got a valid timestamp.

: According to http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#s-4.1.7:
: ----
: Windows with the atom WM_TAKE_FOCUS in their WM_PROTOCOLS property may receive a ClientMessage event from the window manager (as described in section 4.2.8) with WM_TAKE_FOCUS in its data[0] field and a valid timestamp (i.e. not CurrentTime ) in its data[1] field.

For further information, see section 4.2.7.
: ----
: Cannot this be done instead ?

This is the workaround I was talking about. Perl/Tk doesn't provide any
way to get the timestamp (ie. data[1]) I posted a question about it on
comp.lang.perl.tk on 8-Nov but noone could help. I think I need to delve
into the Perl/Tk source code.

: The EnterNotify-Event does _work_ if i focus(via mouse) some other
: window on current desktop. (situation 1)
: ---
: Got a EnterNotify event: event_y = 741, flags = 2, mode = Normal, event_x = 17, time = 8186630, name = EnterNotify, focus = 0, child = 8389563, event = 8389562, state = 0, detail = Virtual, sequence_number = 1017, root_x = 151, root = 118, same_screen = 1, root_y = 777, code = 7
: inside EnterNotify:8186630
: inside takeFocus:8186630
: 
: But if i switch the Desktop (via keyboard)
: forth and back, the EnterNotify-Event is triggered but focus not gained. (situation 2)
: ---
: Got a EnterNotify event: event_y = 982, flags = 2, mode = Normal, event_x = 191, time = 8158642, name = EnterNotify, focus = 0, child = 8389563, event = 8389562, state = 8, detail = Virtual, sequence_number = 905, root_x = 325, root = 118, same_screen = 1, root_y = 1018, code = 7
: inside EnterNotify:8158642
: inside takeFocus:8158642

Err, this is contrary to your first statement. (about always getting 2
WM_TAKE_FOCUS events then 1 EventNotify event)

Anyway. In both cases you are getting an EnterNotify event *before*
WM_TAKE_FOCUS (which is good). That suggests that the problem is an old
timestamp, but I don't understand why the timestamp value would be ok
normally but not when you switch desks.

: 3) I did increment(1) and decrement(2) the timestamp manually.
: 
: If i do (1) or (2) with some high number (eg 8000) the focus is
: not gained in situation 1!

I would expect this. If it's too new the X server will probably ignore
it. (events can't occur in the future unless you're Marty McFly) & if
it's too old then the focussing event will have been superceeded.

: This could lead to the conclusion that the timestamp
: of the EnterNotify-event in situation 2 is too wrong (too old/new)
: and therefore got ignored.

If it's too new it's a bug in the X server - ie. unlikely. I think
the problem must be that the timestamp is too old.

: Unfortinatly i dont know how to get the "CurrentTime" in perl to
: check for differences.

Well only the X server knows about the current time of course. You can
query it but by the time you get a response time has passed. :)

: x11-base/xfree-4.3.0-r3 *  (including some gentoo patches :( )

Hmmm, I'm on:
 XFree86 Version 4.3.0 (Red Hat Linux release: 4.3.0-2)

Anyway, the ideal solution would be to be able to get at the timestamp
of the WM_TAKE_FOCUS event. I think I'll delve into the Perl/Tk
source on the w/end & see if I can nut it out.

SCoTT. :)

: - Why are there 2 WM_TAKE_FOCUS signals ?

Actually, I noticed that 1 appears to be triggered on entry to the
window title/border/frame/decoration & the other when the mouse cursor
actually enters the main frame of the tab-manager.

I don't know why there is a distinction.

Well I guess some people call 5pm Friday the weekend.

I posted a patch of the Perl/Tk source on comp.lang.perl.tk to
fix this problem. I'll update FvwmTabs when the patch is accepted.

i just retested it. My sequence is - as said- normaly 
WM_TAKE_FOCUS
WM_TAKE_FOCUS
EnterNotify.

(sometimes it is different. dont know why)

There is no EnterNotify *before* WM_TAKE_FOCUS!

No, because in _this_ test i disabled the WM_TAKE_FOCUS callback. I meant 
that the EnterNotify _alone_ can get the focus in situation 1 but not
in situation 2.

You misunderstood. In all cases there is no EnterNotify *before* WM_TAKE_FOCUS!
(see above)

Conclusion:
We now presume WM_TAKE_FOCUS does not work *before* EnterNotify due to wrong
timestamp. And in all two situations there are (on my computer at least) no 
WM_TAKE_FOCUS directly after EnterNotify.
That would mean only EnterNotify-Event can set the focus (for me).
But in reality EnterNotify does set the focus only in situation 1, but not in 2. 
That means we have 2 ways of fixing the bug:
1) Solve the problem why EnterNotify does not get focus on situation 2 and 
completely disable WM_TAKE_FOCUS.
2) Fix WM_TAKE_FOCUS and live with the additional EnterNotify-Events which do
not work in situation 2.

Yes, that would be the best.
