Yes I am intersested by this file. But the problem is that
currently I do not understand the Purify output. Maybe, it will
be good that someone else take a look at it :)

Hello,
We use a lot FvwmScript in FVWM Themes. We need two very small
features
 * Allows more Widgets (100 -> 1000) and more variables (512 -> 5120)
   The change is almost nothings and do not give Scripts with more
   memeory (~ +40kb)
 * ItemDraw can understand a SingleClick (just a cut and past from
   an other widget)
I've commit the first feature, but I will revert it if some ask it.
For the second I wait some votes ...
Olivier

The problem is I really don't want to use up any more vertical or

easily fit everything I want on one edge of the screen, and I just
_hate_ having to waste extra space either horizontally or vertically for
a second panel/button bar/whatever.

Sigh.

Two things:

Dan, why don't you just run purify with -log-file=<filename> then purify
won't pop up a window.

Oliver, let me see if I can help you with the output a little.  An FMR
stands for free memory read.  What the output is telling you is that in
some file:line memory was read that had been freed, the rest of that
block is the stack trace.  The next section shows you where the memory
was allocated and the last shows you where it was freed.

The second type of error Dan gave you was a UMR (uninitalized memory
read), this often happens if you have a structure but don't make
assignments in all the fields, then pass it to a function that uses all
the fields.  Usually the safest thing to do here is look at where it was
allocated and see if it makes sense to set all aspects of the data type
to some default value.

Hope this helps, at the moment I've got Linux on my desk not Solaris so
I can't purify fvwm without some difficulty, so if you have it well in
hand Dan I'll let you do it.

Brad

Thanks for the Help of every body!
So, I've tried to interpret Purify output for the bindings
code. I think that I've fixed some bugs but not sure that
I've fixed all. Dan can you run again Purify on my last
commit and FVWM Themes and sent me or to the list the output?

PS: I've also take a fast look at the modules interface
URM, I do not see the problem, but it seems that the
core dumps are here or in the menu code ??????????

PS2: I've used --enable-dmalloc on fvwm2 (with the latest 
version of dmalloc) and dmalloc core dump (funny to see
a debugger that core dump). It seems that the core dump
arise when fvwm2 (or a module) used CachePicture 
(libs/Picture.c). Note that dmalloc help to find
memory leaks in FvwmScript.

In line 15 of rpm/Makefile.am there are spaces instead of TAB (the result
of cut'n'paste). Please replace this and try again.

If this doesn't help, cd rpm, comment out several lines in Makefile.am and
do 'make install', repeat this until it succeeds. Please report results.

Mikhael.

My mistake.  To run those Purify tests I had to build on a different
machine.  Somehow I lost the rpm directory in the process.
I re-did the configure step and it works now.

It doesn't need tabs on subseqent rule lines when the preceeding line
ends with a backslash.

Sorry,

OK, this is the 3rd time I've tried to reply to this.  The
first 2 times I lost my connection typing exactly the same
letter.

The GUI is so much fun...
you're right of course.

(The "u" in "you're" was the killer.  I appear to be past it.)

I'm attaching Purify output after the latest commits.
I made 2 runs, the first with my normal config, the second with
fvwm-themes.  The FMRs seem to be gone.

There are a few UMRs (unitialized memory reads).  As Brad correctly
points out, UMRs should be investigated but are often not a problem.
I like to clean them up just so I don't seem them again, but sometimes
it just isn't worth it.

Heres the output:

Olivier,

I am not quite sure what your changes intend to do, but I suspect
the fix for the FMR is a bit counter productive.  Bindings.c was
meant to be a generic file that can also be used by modules, but
now it seems to be hand modified for use by the main module
exclusively. I had a look myself yesterday, and I think the FMR
can be fixed by putting in a "break;" in the loop with the calls
to activate_binding() and RemoveBinding().

Can you please explain what your changes do?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hello,

The difference in libs/Bindings is that now RemoveBinding
return some informations: a part of the removed binding and  
NULL if no bindings are removed. I do not see why this is 
counter productive for a (hypothetical) module that use the
Bindings.c library: the module get some informations (to 
grab/ungrab since the removed binding has disappear). We
may even want to return the complete removed bindings and
fvwm2 (bindings.c) is ready for that.

Why I do that? In the beginning I think like you: just
put a break in the original code. But, MatchBinding
does not say that a bindings will be removed by 
RemoveBinding: it may happen that MatchBinding answer
yes, but RemoveBinding remove no bindings (it is not
clear that this is a bug, it depends on your point
of view ...). Since the main module (fvwm2) needs to know
if the binding had been removed and need informations
on these bindings I've asked RemoveBinding to do the
job (again this may be useful for a poor module).
Moreover, we go through all the bindings only one
time and not two times. I've mad other minor modification,
so that activate_binding is not call when this is not needed
and also prevent an other loop on all the bindings
if (is_binding_removed) { ... }. So before, FVWM
(the metamodule) go through the bindings 3 times and
now only one or two times (two times if this is really 
needed).

Olivier

Hm, originally I thought RemoveBinding() would remove multiple
matching bindings.  In this case the function might have removed
a binding that came later in the list and thus the loop in
bindings.c would have accessed an already deleted binding (hence
the FMR).  But this is not the case.  I guess the problem is
that the loop calls MatchBinding() to determine if a binding
has to be removed, but RemoveBinding() has a different notion
of the binding to remove.  It may delete a different one than
was originally intended.  If this happens to be the binding
after the one we intended to delete, the loop will proceed to
the deleted memory.

I said 'counter productive' because I thought RemoveBinding()
removed multiple bindings but returned only one of them.

I will think again about this problem.  There should probably
be two functions DestroyBinding() and a variant of
RemoveBinding() that simply looks for the binding structure in
the list instead of comparing binding types.

I'm slightly confused by something; I don't know if this is a bug, or
just a "shrug, it's weird but that's the way it works" thing.

If I define an FvwmForm module configuration in my .fvwm2rc file, then I
can just define it no problem.

If I define it in a separate file (e.g., "Module FvwmForm FooForm" then
create ~/.fvwm/FooForm" I have to do a DestroyModuleConfig at the
beginning of the file, else I get one extra copy of my form every time I
invoke it.

This seems like a confusing inconsistency, but I don't really understand
how the module config works.  Why can't the existing config be used
again, as it is in the .fvwm2rc case (or is it)?  Or, why isn't the
DestroyModuleConfig implicit?

Basically, I think it's confusing that you need that DestroyModuleConfig
in one place but not the other.

Thoughts?

Paul,

  First thanks for removing /bin/echo from the forms, your change is
a nice improvement.

  As far as the DestroyModuleConfig:

  All "*" commands  are stored up by fvwm   and passed out  to modules
when the  module requests them.   If you read  .fvwm2rc twice, all the
module commands will double up.  I've taken to starting all my Module,
Function, and Menu definitions with a destroy.

  FvwmForm first  sends a read command for  its alias to fvwm  to make
fvwm read the config in the first  place, Ie. "read FooForm".  As fvwm
encounters  the "*FooForm" commands it gives   them out to the modules
that  have set  the M_SENDCONFIG flag,  and  also stores  them up.  If
there was  no destroy, the second time  the module started, they would
be read again, and 2 sets would be sent.

  If FvwmForm first read the config from fvwm, saw the form definition
and  didn't  send the  read on  subsequent   iterations, then the form
couldn't change definition until restart.

  FvwmForm could read the form defintion directly like FvwmScript does
but I think there is some  advantage to having  the commands pass thru
fvwm.  For example,  there could be other  things in the file  besides
FvwmForm commands.

Dominik,

I think there are some bugs in your bugfix:
Try:
Mouse 1 	T	A	Move
You can move the with with the title bar
Mouse 1 	T	M	Raise
this is no more possible.

As I say when I explain my buhfix, we cannot use
MatchBinding to decide if we are going to remove
a binding (the second binding above match the
first one, and so the first is removed when you
add the second one). It seems to me that the
better way to remove a binding is to use a libs
function which try to remove it using an _exact test_ 
and then answer the removed bindings if the binding 
is removed and null if not (so that the caller can
do things with the removed bindings). I do not 
understand why you do not like this solution (I am 
not a professional of concrete programmation).

An other possibility is to use an other version of
MatchBindings which will test if the binding will
be _really_ removed, but so we have to be always
sure that the test function answer well relatively 
to the remove function (and we have to go 2 times
through all the bindings).

Do you want that I fix your fix of my fix?
I imagine that you prefer to do it.
Olivier

Hm, yes.  Then there should be another version of MatchBinding()
that does exactly the same test as RemoveMatchingBinding().

I dislike it because it allocates memory and forces the caller
to know the exact implementation to delete the returned binding.
Furthermore the RemoveMatchingBinding() function may delete more
than one binding in the future (more than one may match if you
used the IgnoreModifiers command after creating the bindings).

I'll give it a try.

Whoever does the fix, please test with fvwm-themes, most of Mouse bindings
are broken now (this is when I like backup bindings - in keyboard, menus).
To extract mouse bindings used in fvwm-themes, execute:

  fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc | grep '^Mouse'

Mikhael.

Mikhael, I can't test this right now, but I already applied the
patch.  I think Olivier pointed out the problem why the bindings
are broken - and it is already fixed.

If you use glibc-2.1.x there are an intersting paper on memory
debuging at:

http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/aj_debug.html

I try mtrace but it does not seem that this is useful
with fvwm2. Maybe MALLOC_CHECK_ is more interesting:
if you set this variable to 2, then you may hope to
have "better" core dump.

Yes, I think that you fix almost all memory leaks :o)
Before all your commits fvwm2 with fvwm-themes has a
problem of memory: more you switched more fvwm2 used 
memory. Now this is no more the case!

Well, I don't see that compiling with -DMALLOC_CHECK_=2 changes anything.

Ok, after a lot of debugging, I have found the first problem (I fear there
are more problems, since I get other meaningless core dumps in malloc.c).

Consider this minimal fvwm rc file:

  Key F11  A  SM  Module FvwmIdent
  Key F1   A  SM  -
  Key F11  A  SM  -

It will not give core dump for you (otherwise you would not be able to
use fvwm-themes without crashes), but it gives on my second machine, where

% xmodmap -pk | grep F11
     67         0xffbe (F1)     0xffc8 (F11)
     95         0xffc8 (F11)

+++ Allocing key_name=F11, Action=Module FvwmIdent, 65535, 9, keysym=65480
+++ Allocing key_name=F11, Action=Module FvwmIdent, 65535, 9, keysym=65480
*** Matching keycode=67, context=65535, modifiers=9
@@@ Removing (after MatchBindingExactly) key F1, A, SM
--- Freeing  key_name=F11, Action=Module FvwmIdent, 65535, 9
*** Matching keycode=95, context=65535, modifiers=9
@@@ Removing (after MatchBindingExactly) key F11, A, SM
--- Freeing  key_name=F11, Action=Module FvwmIdent, 65535, 9

The last debug line originally contained a garbage, because this Action
was freed twice in FreeBindingStruct(). This is a bug. Freeing Action,
Action2 and Stroke_Seq in FreeBindingStruct() is against AddBinding(),
where only key_name is allocated, but not Action, Action2 and Stroke_Seq.

Just commenting out free() calls in FreeBindingStruct() is not a good fix,
although it fixes this core dump. I think Dominik can do a better fix.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I just found this piece of un-configure'd code in fvwm/colormaps.c:

    if(last_cmap != tmp->attr.colormap
#if defined(sun) && defined(TRUECOLOR_ALWAYS_INSTALLED)
       && !(tmp->attr.depth == 24 && tmp->attr.visual->class == TrueColor)
#endif
        )
    {
      last_cmap = tmp->attr.colormap;
      XInstallColormap(dpy, last_cmap);
    }

Any ideas if/why this is necessary and how we can remove this?
My guess is that the TRUECOLOR_ALWAYS_INSTALLED macro is never
defined anyway.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

        main           [fvwm.c:732]
        _start         [crt1.o]

This UMR was a bit tricky to find, so perhaps someone else is
interested in what caused it.  At first I thought that Purify
was wrong.  It claims that the memory was allocated from
setup_window_structure():

  if (ReuseWin == NULL)
  {
    *ptmp_win = (FvwmWindow *)safemalloc(sizeof(FvwmWindow)); <-- 123
    if (*ptmp_win == (FvwmWindow *)0)
    {
      return False;
    }
  }
  else
  {
    ...
  }

  /*
     ...
  */
  memset(*ptmp_win, '\0', sizeof(FvwmWindow));               <-- 142

But unless safemalloc returns NULL, the whole structure is zeroed out
in line 142.  So the structure - especially the wShaped member - should
be initialised thereafter.  But later it became uninitialised again
when uninitialised data was copied there:


  void setup_style_and_decor(
    FvwmWindow *tmp_win, window_style *pstyle, short *buttons)
  {
    ...
  #ifdef SHAPE
    if (ShapesSupported)
    {
      int xws, yws, xbs, ybs;
      unsigned wws, hws, wbs, hbs;
      int boundingShaped, clipShaped;

      XShapeSelectInput(dpy, tmp_win->w, ShapeNotifyMask);
      XShapeQueryExtents(dpy, tmp_win->w,
                         &boundingShaped, &xws, &yws, &wws, &hws,
                         &clipShaped, &xbs, &ybs, &wbs, &hbs);
      tmp_win->wShaped = boundingShaped;
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    }
  #endif /* SHAPE */

But boundingShaped may not have been set if the XShapeQueryExtents()
call failed - which I assume is exactly what happed.

To avoid similar problems in the future it is important to always
handle return codes of X functions properly.  At least we should never
assume that a function that has a return code will always work.
A few greps revealed several other places in the code with the same
possibility of failure (e.g. with XQueryBestTile()).

Yup, sorry.  I misread it for XrmCombineFileDatabase().

I don't see anything on the list that would get in the way of releasing
our current release as a non-beta.

Hello,
I've got a systematic core dump when I use animated menus 
(popup a menu which need animation and come back to the 
parent menu: core dump).

Here the gdb output:

[olivier@snoopy olivier]$ gdb fvwm2 dmalloc/menu_core

Core was generated by `fvwm2 -f themes-rc'.

I don't see any memory leaks (MLK) in this one, just UMRs.
Sorry its so long.  The beta version of the themes package seems to
have stopped changing the appearance of my windows.  I made quite
a few tries.

I hope its still testing the things we want to test.

I'm running this remotely.  Its unbelievably slow.  Just popping a menu
takes a minute or 2.  My guess is that its the gradients, but thats only
a guess.

Here it is:

Hmm, cvs wrapper script expanded $FVWM_USERDIR and $HOME variables. :)

Its not in CVS.  Maybe it happened on your command line when you did
the commit.  Ie.

cvs commit -m"added --command options; use $HOME/.fvwm"

instead of

cvs commit -m'added --command options; use $HOME/.fvwm'

No, I used -m '$FVWM_USERDIR not $HOME', but I have a cvs wrapper,

  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/fvwm-themes/cvs?rev=1.3&content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=fvwm-themes

which uses ssh when working on fvwm-themes and a default rsh otherwise,
and this script calls exec cvs params. I have already fixed this script.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is that reproducible somehow? If yes, can you make a minimal

Dear FVWM experts,

starting from the latest commits of this week-end, ActivePlacement stopped
working for me. There's a beep and then the window is put in the up left
corner of my screen.

This is my setup:

> cat .fvwm2rc | grep Placement
# WINDOW Placement
# SmartPlacement makes new windows pop-up in blank regions of screen 
Style "*" SmartPlacement
# If SmartPlacement fails, this makes you do it
Style "*" ActivePlacement

Any suggestion ? Thanks in advance !

Best regards,
Giuseppe.

I can't find the macro being defined in any Solaris 2.8 header file.
I don't have access to any SunOs4 machines (Solaris 1.x).
But I've never seen a Solaris machine that wasn't 8 bit anyway.

The TRUECOLOR code is in 2.0.47d, but not in 1.24r.

Oh, here it is:

I just searched all my headers on sunos and solaris and can't seem to find it.  I checked system headers, X11 headers, motif and cde headers.

Dan, you are kidding right. You've never seen better thatn 8 bit?
Anything better than an ultra 1 comes with enough video ram to do 24
bit.  Unless I misread something over the years I thought your work was
providing your Sun's, if that is the case and you aren't on at least an
ultra2 by now I think you should fill out some request forms.

I assume you mean SunOS4. Solaris 2 is SunOS5.

So far I've had Sparc 1+, Sparc IPC, Sparc 2, Sparc  10, and now Ultra
5.  I know newer   Ultra 5's can  be had  with  24 bit, but ours  were
acquired  early  with 8 bit.     The only compensation  is  the 21inch
monitor.

I see after market PCI cards (Raptor GFX-8P) that are 8/24 bit, but
I'd really like one that goes to 1600x1200 before I spend any of
my employers money.

Of course the corporate types really want us  to use PCs  and NT.
Fat chance.

Well, I never said that this is a critical problem to be fixed before 2.4.
I simply report all bugs which I find. I should yet find a time to
report another bunch of problems (i.e. to try to find a minimal rc, better
description etc.), it is in http://fvwm-themes.dhs.org/fvwm-bugs.txt

I want to have a new stable release not less than others, but I am seeing
core dumps from time to time (some were overwritten by other app cores).
It would be nice to at least not have crashes before calling it stable.

> 143) Bug #603 (TaskBar bugs): investigate and possibly fix.

I can't reproduce an initial position problem with AutoStick, but now when
I played with it, if I undefine Geometry and AutoStick -

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar: Geometry
  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar: AutoStick

FvwmTaskBar is started sticky on position +0-3384, i.e. out of screen.

The problem was (and still is) this: when you do a checkpoint in a session
manager, i.e. save a session, fvwm stores a state file, which seems to be
correct. But then when fvwm starts again inside a session manager, this
session is restored and some windows, which change their names dynamically
(like my xterms in the shell's prompt) are placed in a fresh position
instead of restoring their old position. The interesting thing is that
when you save a session several times (usually 2), the problem disappears.

Seems like a syncronization problem, supposedly on add-window time.
I can't say now whether I will have a time to look at it before 2.4,
if not, we can promote this problem to a known bug, i.e. a feature.

I would replace the description of this problem:

158) Sometimes a state is not restored for windows with IS_NAME_CHANGED
     flag set under SM - no match in matchWin().
     [investigate/fix if there is a time]

> 163) Make bzip2 and rpm packages available from our downloads page.

bzip2 packages could be stored together with gzip ones. But rpm's should
be actually maintained. Supposing that I will do this (any taker welcome),
I will do this in the place where I have file permissions, i.e. on
fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net. We can simply link to it, already done.
Or, in case Jason setups an automatical mirror (ftp mirror or using rsync,
I can help with this), we can also have rpm-s on, say:

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/rpm/

with a possible subdirectory structure for versions/distributions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Almost all UMRs in the last Purify log come from the
boundary_width member of the FvwmWindow structure.  Purify always
claims that only the first byte of the integer is initialised and
the remaining three bytes are not.  Example:

****  Purify instrumented fvwm2 (pid 1002)  ****
UMR: Uninitialized memory read:
  * This is occurring while in:
        SetupTitleBar  [borders.c:1104]
        SetupFrame     [borders.c:1546]
        ForceSetupFrame [borders.c:1689]
        apply_window_updates [update.c:206]
        flush_window_updates [update.c:346]
        HandleEvents   [events.c:2408]
        main           [fvwm.c:732]
        _start         [crt1.o]
  * Reading 4 bytes from 0xefffb068 on the stack (3 bytes at 0xefffb069 uninit).
  * Address 0xefffb068 is local variable "xwc" in function SetupTitleBar.

line 1104 in borders.c is this:

      if (xwc.x + xwc.width < w - tmp_win->boundary_width)

boundary_width is initialised from AddWindow() by calling
SelectDecor() which in turn initialises it 100% of the time. If
Probably the value comes from the style that has been read in
AddWindow() via lookup_style(). Again, there is no chance that
lookup_style() fails to initialise these values, which means
that ProcessNewStyle must have written trash into them. Since
the whole style is zeroed in ProcessNewStyle() first, the only
possibility of failure is the sscanf call that (successfully)
reads in the value (via GetSuffiedIntegerArguments()).

So, I see three possible explanations:

 1) Purify is broken
 2) sscanf on Dan's machine is broken
 3) I am missing something

Anybody out there who can shed a light on this?

BTW, I have rewritten some of the involved code, but nothing of
this fixed the UMR.

Bye

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

After fixing a binding core dump (which was a real bug) now core dumps
on my second machine do not occur after the first theme refresh.
But they regularly occur on the second (or third/fifth) reloading.
Most of these core stacks seem to be reasonable.

I read current news about a bad RedHat decision to include gcc-2.96 with
RH-7.0 and how buggy is gcc-2.96 (build 54) included with it.
So I compiled fvwm without -O optimizations and there are no core dumps
any more. Only some core dump of FvwmScript.

On the other hand, fvwm compiled with -O2 using gcc-2.96 (build 33) on my
first machine behaves well - no regular core dumps.

I will investigate this problem more. I think I should try the latest
gcc bug fixes on the second machine.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't think these are new features. More like half fixes, half
improvements of existing functionality. Since this is a workaround for a
problem which caused XFree86-4.0.1 freeze, I would say, just do it.

BTW, the FvwmScript-ScreenSetup included with fvwm consistently freezes
XFree86-4.0.0. This may be the same problem that we had in fvwm-themes,
i.e. widgets out of window. If yes, do you see a workaround. Olivier?

Probably gcc-2.96 is not as bad as it is said, the problem appears to be
in glibc. After upgrading from glibc-2.1.92 to glibc-2.1.94 using the
RedHat Linux 7.0 errata, compiling even with -O3 gives no core dumps.

So, it seems that fvwm with fvwm-themes is problematic on both pure RH-6.2
and pure RH-7.0, since inconsistent core dumps started on my second
machine with RH-6.2 and continued after step-by-step upgrading to RH-7.0
a week ago. I.e. installing new gcc 2.96, recompiling fvwm, getting cores,
installing new glibc 2.1.92, recompiling, XFree86 4.0.1, recompiling.

At least it is solved now. I will think about documenting this somewhere.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I read some where that RH 7 use a "recent" cvs snapshot and that gcc is
named gcc-3.0 (not yet realized)! Any way, RH7 is at the present time
only
a beta.

Can you reproduce such a core dump and send it to the list?

I do not think that there are widgets out of the main window. I
will check again. Can you send me the output of xset -q?
Do Xfree freeze at FvwmScript-ScreenSetup startup or after?
I've made a few clean up, but I do not think that this
will change something.

Hm, this cause the TaskBar (and maybe other modules) to get some
problem of geometry. The taskbar used the border_width to fit 
exactly the screen:

win_border = (int)cfgpacket->border_width;

since now cfgpacket->border_width is short the taskbar is broken.
Of course this is easy to fix:

win_border = (short)cfgpacket->border_width;

But, I am not sure that this is the good fix. It seems
to me that maybe this is a fvwm2 bug ?????????

I think that there is egcs (1.?) with the RH 7 for compiling the kernel.
Do you test it?

I had to remove a fix I made to parameter expansion in May.  The
corresponding ChangeLog entry is probably this one:

2000-05-31  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>
...
    * fvwm/functions.c (ComplexFunction):
    (execute_complex_function):
    (ExecuteFunction):
    fixed parameter expansion with nested complex functions and quoting
    ...

I can't remember what the problem exactly was.  Can somebody
please test this?

The code I removed caused a core dump when the line

  silent"

was executed.  Furthermore it was impossible to use complex
functions with a name that is the name of a builtin function
followed by whitespace.  E.g. you could not call a function
"echo hello" because ExecuteFunction called the "echo" builtin
instead.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Um, the border_width that is sent to the modules was and still
is unsigned long.  Only the way fvwm treats the border/handle
width internally has changed.  Look at libs/vpacket.h:

  typedef struct ConfigWinPacket
  {
  ...
  unsigned long int  border_width;
  ...
  } ConfigWinPacket;

I did not change that.

Argh, I didn't fathom the code was so touchy. You are right,
the modules get trash now. I'll commit a fix.

Now I tried cvs update. And, I look FvwmButtons.c.

However, it write
------------
            XFree(text.value); /* return of XGetWMName() */
            if (XGetWMName(dpy, win, &text)); /* XXX: read again ? */
          {
------------
in it.

But,
------------
            XFree(text.value); /* return of XGetWMName() */
            if (XGetWMName(dpy, win, &text)) /* XXX: read again ? */
          {
------------
Should you describe it in this way?

Hello, fvwm-workers!

I have a small feature-suggestion for fvwm (f this is already implemented
in the development version, please ignore this mail). Anyhow:

I have a few virtual desktops ordered horizontally, which I move between
with Ctrl-Meta-<left/right arrow>. Now, I sometimes work on different
systems over the network (which I like to separate), so I also have two
pages vertically. Like this:
_____________..._____
|1a   |2a   |   Na  |
|_____|_____|...____|
|1b   |2b   |   Nb  |
|_____|_____|...____|

Now, I like to be able to move between the systems (vertically) by
Ctrl-Alt-<up/down arrow>, on the same horizontal desktop (between 1a and
2a). By using normal virtual deskops is hard, and even harder is getting
programs to start on the right deskopts (ie netscape always starts on 2a
OR 2b, depending on which of them one's at). Anyhow, I now use a larger
page (2*height) to get this effect, which mostly works. The problem is,
however:

* When I move up or down, fvwm doesn't remember which window had focus on
the upper or lower page. I guess this is to be expected, as this is the
same "desktop" after all (I just want to simulate two).

Could this (*) be fixed in any way? Sorry for the long mail :-)

I'm guessing this is due to the current parse mods, but from this morning CVS October 12, I get the following error:

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> Illegal mouse button in line 4    A       C       Scroll +0 -100

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> Illegal mouse button in line 5    A       C       Scroll +0 +100

The related lines are
Mouse 4    A       C       Scroll +0 -100
Mouse 5    A       C       Scroll +0 +100


I have a logitech scroll mouse, and this binding would allow me to use
control + the scroll wheel to move up and down pages.

Honestlly I haven't used this feature much, I was just trying to come up
with some binding to use for those buttons.

This started on 5 Oct. My binding is also censored now. :)

  Mouse 8 A A ...  # yes, it actually worked with 4 button+2 wheel mouse

I think the mouse number should not be checked as long as it is integer.
Or maybe NUMBER_OF_MOUSE_BUTTONS should be 10, will this affect something?

Note, it is possible to get big button numbers even with 3 button mice:

  xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 5 9"

Regards,
Mikhael.

If you are speaking about #if 0'ed code, which replaced a space with nil
in a function name, I can't see how this code can be a fix for something,
so I think it could be removed.

While testing some parameter expansion, I see that $* includes a trailing
newline. So it can't be used in the middle of line. It should not do this.

Mikhael.

Supposedly after this commit (unnecessary redraw), there are no enough
redraws when moving across the left page edge. I can reproduce this while
moving just about every app, say xcalc, xterm or yet better FvwmIdent.

X does not support more than 5 mouse buttons anyway.  This is
because there are no bits reserved in the button mask to select
and test button events for more than 5 buttons.  (X.h, look for
"Button1Mask" for example).

Well, this is easy to explain.  Fvwm never supported more than
three mouse buttons.  If bindings a la "Mouse 4" ever worked, this
was clearly a bug.  And there were many other places where this
failed (e.g. with MouseFocusClickRaises).  I cleaned up this mess
so that fvwm and all modules now work with the same number of
mouse buttons and enforced some sanity checks at the same time.
This is what happens now: the sanity checks complain about the
unsupported bindings.  It is no problem however to increase the
number of supported mouse buttons to 5 (in libs/defaults.h).  This
was the reason why I rewrote this anyway.  But there are some side
effects that may not be wanted:

 1) FvwmButtons will need more memory to store its bindings.
    There may be a few other modules with the same problem.
 2) A binding "Mouse 0 ..." will also grab the buttons 4 and 5.
    There may be configs which will break since they assume that
    buttons 4 and 5 are never grabbed.

Well, I don't understand what you mean, but it certainly has
nothing to do with the 'unnecessary redraw' fix.  What I fixed
was the order in which windows are mapped/unmapped when
switching pages.  The old code assumed a window and viewport
width/heigt that was 1 pixel too big, so windows touching the
right or bottom border were mapped/unmapped in the wrong order
(which caused X to first draw windows obscured below them and
the unmap them).

Please elaborate what problem you see.

Yes.

Well I wrote it for a reason, this much is for sure.  It had
something to do with calling complex functions from complex
functions by passing the name of the called function as a
parameter, I think.  I can't remember what quoting had to
do with it.  I am sure there is something in the mail archive.

Yes. I will fix it.

Hi, I'm still alive :-)

I have done some ICCCM reading again in the last days and noted that
the ICCCM2 compliance stuff that I added to fvwm some time ago have one
problem: The manager selection for window managers should be named
WM_Sx instead of WIN_Sx. You can fix that in the sprintf in line 57 of
icccm2.c.

Thanks, Matthias

I notice that fvwm unmaps the frame but not the client window if a
normal (ie noniconified) window is moved to a hidden desk. This is
explicitly forbidden by the ICCCM (section 4.2.5). The alternative
would be to unmap both windows, with the consequence that from the
clients point of view, all windows on hidden desks are in the iconified
state (although their icons will not be visible).

I was wrong, this can't be related to the latest changes. I can reproduce
this problem even with fvwm-2.2.4. And I can't reproduce it at all on my
second machine, so it is probably related to my new X Server.

The problem is that there are no enough refreshes while moving windows
across the left viewport edge. Like in the attached image.

I guess I should debug this problem (missing events?), but not now.
Unless others can reproduce the same problem, probably fvwm is ok here.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've commit this. I've put the code between #ifdef, so I can
come back to the old code if one wants.

No, it was named gcc-2.96 in CVS. The authors do not suggest to use it in
distributions, but I can't say for now it has any problems with C, there
may be compatibility problems with C++ object files though.

It is called kgcc. As I said, the inconsistent core problems are solved
after upgrading from glibc-2.1.92 to glibc-2.1.94. There were real serious
bugs in 2.1.92. I didn't compiled with kgcc, but we should suggest to RH-7
users to upgrade glibc anyway, it fixes some other packages too.

I can't reproduce this again after upgrading glibc.

OS: Debian/GNU Linux woody
X_Server: Xfree86 4.0.1
Submission from: (NULL) (208.138.51.183)


If I am configuring the fvwm source from console, the gnome compile test
fails, but if I run ./configure from inside an xterm, where the DISPLAY
environment variable is set and valid, then the gnome compile test passes.
Correct configuration should not need to depend on having an X display
to connect to during the configuration or build phases.

You are right. This is fixed.

Hm, that doesn't look like an fvwm bug. Fvwm can't do anything about
the contents of the window. Since you said it happens with all
windows, I guess it is an X server problem.

Subject: Gnome startup hangs for 30 seconds

Full_Name: 
Version: 2.3.21
CVS_Date: 
OS: linux 2.4.0-test9
X_Server: 4.0.1
Submission from: (NULL) (24.112.58.26)


When Gnome starts up using fvwm as the window manager, it hangs
for ~30 seconds after fvwm in finished initializing. fvwm is up
and running, since it's menus work, and I can call up an xterm from
my middle button menu. It looks like gnome is waiting for something
from the window manager, which never arrives. I timed the pause, and
it's always about 30 seconds. This leads me to believe that Gnome is
timing out on the wait. I am currently using the latest beta fvwm and
Gnome with X 4.0.1 and the latest beta kernel. I've tried it with
earlier releases of all of these, but this problem is consistent.

	Good luck...

	/\V

Subject: initial automake/autoconf instructions

The sequence to run after an initial cvs checkout given in our cvs.html:

  automake -a
  autoreconf

is not enough. The problem is that automake is called before aclocal.m4
is generated by the second command. All these sequences would be better:

  automake -a
  autoreconf
  automake

Or:

  aclocal
  automake -a
  autoreconf

Or even:

  autoreconf
  automake -a

I will put this into cvs.html. I suggest all to run "aclocal; automake"
in the local cvs directory, just to be sure that all make dependances
(including aclocal.m4 <- acinclude.m4) are set.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Jason, can you manually run aclocal (or autoreconf) in the fvwm directory?
Do you get the same errors or these only happen when executed from cron?

Seems strange that /usr/local/bin/aclocal didn't print the whole error
message. I would add the following in this file before warn in line 319:

  print "Macro missing: ($macro)\n";

This would at least print a problematic macro if any.

Mikhael.

Hello,
Recently, I try to use the XorValue command. The argument
of this command must be an integer which represent a color
in a not user friendly way: it seems to me that we have
to give the color relatively to the red, green, blue masks
(0xf800, 0x7e0, 0x1f in my machine) and the significant bits 
in color specification (6 bits in my machine).
One can imagine an algorithm to transform a color (in the usal
form) to such value (the Xlib can do that immediatly). My first
question is: Do such algorithm depands only on the significant bits 
in color specification? (i.e., do the red, green, blue masks
depends only on the significant bits? are they other paramaters to take
in account?). 
My second question is why we do not have a XorColor command? (as
"in" FvwmAnimate).

Olivier

This command  produces    different effects on   PseudoColor  displays
vs. True color.

On PseudoColor displays, the actual color being Xor'd has no relation
to the final color produced.  The color(s) on the background also contribute
to the random effect.

fvwm2 also has an XorPixmap command.

It would be nice if FvwmAnimate and fvwm were consistent.

Yes, things are exactly the same.

It doesn't help; you get:

Macro missing: ( at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 319, <CONFIGURE> line 6.
aclocal: macro ` at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 320, <CONFIGURE> line 6.

Isn't that odd?  It's as if the macro has a spurious \0 in it.  As usual,
nothing has changed with this machine, there is plenty of disk space, etc.

This has been happening for awhile, I just neglected to report it since its 
so minor and I always assumed I was doing something wrong.  When I login on 
my ultra-5 box I get the obligatory "OpenWindows Welcome" Screen that looks 
something like this,

" Starting the OpenWindows Desktop

     Valkommen till
     .
     .
     [various other languages]
     .

                       SOLARIS
                    CDE Version 1.3 "

My mouse then turns into an hourglass -- all normal thus far.  Then I get a 
place-window icon and a very small window (3pixels x 2pixels approximately). 
  If I simply click, everything proceeds normally (no window is placed, it 
simply vanishes).  If I 'mouse-2' so as to resize this mysterious window in 
hopes of finding out what the heck this window is, I still can't see a title 
-- why is this window showing up (its nothing I'm spawning) ?

I've narrowed down to when this window appears. It only happens if I have 
the following line in my .fvwm2rc file,

  Style "*" ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

Why is this happening ? Is it a bug ?

uname -a   : SunOS dude 5.7 Generic_106541-10 sun4u
fvwm-2.3.+ : fvwm-snap-20000809

Here is a minimal setup:

### .fvwm2rc file ###
# I will place my windows, thank you
Style "*" ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

### .xinitrc file ###
#!/bin/sh
#
# .xinitrc - OpenWindows startup script (used by xdm).
#
$HOME/download/fvwm-0809/bin/fvwm2 > $HOME/.err_xinitrc 2>&1


Thanks for the help in advance.

Full_Name: Robin
Version: 2.3.21
CVS_Date: 
OS: SuSE 7.0
X_Server: XFree86 V4.01
Submission from: (NULL) (213.51.112.30)


At random times the window manger crashes. 
This happnes mostly when i move a window across the screen.
Windows are not draw correctly anymore ore not at all.
Most of the times i'm able to pull a menu and exit that way, but when i
wait
to long, the systems hangs hard and i need a ctrl-alt-backsp.

Always as this happens, when i can pull a menu, i see the menu icons, and
the menu text,
but no borders and no menu backround. So suddenly the desktop menu becomes
transparent.
The menu windows asking for confirmation on exit is not appearing anymore,
i just hit enter.
starting x again can sometimes help, but most of the times fvwm won't work
correctly anymore unless i reboot the system. (cold reboot).

I'm using SuSE linux 7, xfree 4.01, asus v3200 voodoo banshee board, p2
333Mhz
120Mb ram, fvwm 2.3.21 with fvwmbuttons.
I'm running a dual headed config, this works fine with fvwm2. Switching
back
to single screen did not solve the problem. Using kde the problems don't
appear
so i do not expect this to be a hardware problem.

One note.

As I wrote recently, and it is now in cvs.html, the more correct order is
'autoreconf' and then 'automake -a', not vice versa, othervise you end up
with a Makefile without a 'ACLOCAL_M4 = $(top_srcdir)/aclocal.m4' line.

But this only affects dependances later, (configure is not regenerated
when acinclude.m4 is changed), not the initial generation of configure.

So, aclocal always fails to generate aclocal.m4 from acinclude.m4
on this machine for some unknown yet reason,

> autoconf: Undefined macros:
> configure.in:113:dnl AC_SUBST(sm_LIBS)

and configure then can't find macros, which should be in aclocal.m4.

Accourding to 'cvs log aclocal.m4', the file aclocal.m4 was in CVS until
1999/02/27 03:17:55, when Steve (rightfully) removed this autogenerated
file. This, together with an incorrect order of 'autoreconf' & 'automake'
some years ago, which caused a lossage of "configure <- acinclude.m4"
dependance, probably may somehow explain why you didn't have a need
earlier to ever invoke /usr/local/bin/aclocal. This is only my guess.

Am I right that you have perl 4 on the building system?
Can this be a reason for aclocal failure? I can't think of anything else.

If you will not be able to solve this aclocal problem, simply copy the up
to date aclocal.m4 file from your RH 6.2 machine. The correct thing would
be for a developement machine to be able to generate this file.

Mikhael.

I marked this as fixed (on 2000-09-25).
You can get one of October daily snapshots to verify this.

I don't see any possible way in which this could be an FVWM problem.
There is absolutely no way in the world that _anything_ FVWM could do
should be able to mess up your system so badly that restarting X doesn't
even help and you have to reboot your system.  That's one of the huge
advantage of X's client-server architecture.

It sounds to me like something FVWM is doing is tweaking a bug in your X
server, but this is not a bug in FVWM and there's essentially no chance
at all that we can find it from the FVWM side.

I would try going back to XFree86 3.3.6 (if it supports your video
card), or asking on one of the XFree86 lists or newsgroups.

Here is how to reproduce this core dump.

Create a ~/.fvwm/test-styles file with the following content:

Style "*"           BorderWidth 5
Style "Fvwm*"       Title, Sticky
Style "*"           IconBox 10 6 -400 -100
Style "FvwmIconMan" NoTitle, Sticky, BorderWidth 0
DestroyStyle "FvwmIconMan"

Start fvwm without rc file (optionally), open FvwmConsole and execute
'Read test-styles' several times.

With no additional configuration, fvwm should crash on the third Read,
with some existing configuration, it may take some more Read's.

Fixed. The reason was that the icon_boxes member of the style
structure was not set to NULL after the styles were deleted.
Thus, already deleted icon box structures were accessed and
freed again in another pass of simplify_style_list().

Well, it does not seem to be an fvwm bug. What happens is that
there is really some small window being created, and fvwm tries
to place it on the screen. This usually happens without any user
interaction, and if the window dies before it has been decorated,
you will never see the window. If you choose both, active and dumb
placement the user is asked to place the window manually -
although it seems the window vanishes immediately.

Where this curious window comes from is a mystery to me, but it is
probably nothing that is stared by fvwm. Perhaps it is something
your OpenWindows does, or it might be some application that fails
to start up properly. If you can find out its name somehow, you can
give it the RandomPlacement or SmartPlacement style and it will
never show up.

If you add this line at the start of the PlaceWindow() function
in placement.c (in the 2.3.x betas), the window name will be
printed to the console:

  fprintf(stderr,"placing window: '%s'\n", tmp_win->name ? tmp_win->name : "(no name)");

This is the first post I've made, so feel free to lecture
me on the proper use.  These questions are probably a bit remedial,
but please bear with me.

1) I've been debugging my module the old-fashioned way: fprintf() and tail -f.
I've tried attaching gdb to the running process to see where I crash,
but all I get is "Program exited with code 01.".
Is there an easy way to get to the call stack for a module crash?

2) I can track the move of a window with M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW,
but how do I know when the motion is complete?  In other words,
if I wanted to filter out the dragging motion and only get
the final position, how can I discriminate?

You don't get a stack trace because your module seems to have
exited normally, probably with "exit(1);" or "return 1;" somewhere.
Try putting an fprintf at each place where your module exits.  If
it really crashes, you will find a "core" file in the directory
where you started the module. If you find one, run gdb:

  $ gdb <module_executable_name> core

and inside gdb type

  (gdb) where

to get a stack trace. gdb will tell you if the core was really
generated by your module or a different program.

You can't. The proper way to handle this situation is to filter
out all but the last ConfigureNotify event in the queue like this:

  void HandleConfigureNotify(XEvent *Event)
  {
    XEvent etemp;
    while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent(dpy, Event->window, ConfigureNotify, &etemp))
    {
      /* skip previous event */
      memcpy(Event, &etemp, sizeof(XEvent));
      /* give other applications (e.g. the window manager) a chance to run */
      usleep(1);
    }
    /* handle the last event in the queue */
    ...
  } 

(untested)

Bye

There seems to be something wrong with the Oct. chronological archive 
listing.  Could someone take a look and correct it (scroll down and note 
various disconnects, compare that listing with September's); the same 
messages appear multiple times.

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0010/

Just a heads-up..

Full_Name: Jason Gabler
Version: [FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.21 compiled on Sep 15 2000 at 14:27:59

CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS kinabalu 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

X_Server: openwin
Submission from: (NULL) (209.101.239.108)


Using /usr/opewnin/bin/xinit with the version of fvwm2 described above
Java2 VM will not correctly draw many GUI components, especially labels
and pictures.  I have run the same java classes using the same VM
binaries under the same account using different window managers (
including
twm and dtwm ) and not had these problems.  As a side not fvwm seems to 
ingore AWT directions on how to layer Windows ( as oppose to Frames ).

Yep, the archives have gotten busted.  I'll see what I can do to put them
back together.

Can you send an example GUI that demonstrates the problem to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org?

hi you great guys who make my day with fvwm2!

i had a look at your webpage once again, just to see what's going on
there, and i noticed that the screenshot page was quite old. so i
decided to make a snapshot of my current desktop and send it to you. the
fvwm-mailing-list told me to this to your address.

my desktop shows (of course) fvwm2, of which not much is being seen
actually. only the root menu and the decorations are really fvwm-like. i
like gtk so i am using gnome's panels (top and bottom, left hand side).
there's an aterm window using transparency, gqmpeg and netscape, and, of
course, gkrellm running.

for the colors, i used grdb and grdb2fvwm, which takes gnome's colors
and fonts and puts it into my fvwm2rc. it's quite useful, i think.

well, that's it. dan espen told me that you can get along with making
thumbs, so i am sending only the big one, 150k approx. hope it appears
someday :)

btw: do you need someone to update your website?

thanks, =


andr=E9

oops! i forgot! i am using suse 7.0 on a dell latitude laptop.

The core dump is fixed. But Style IconBox is now broken. Seems like it is
often removed instead of be defined.
Here is how to reproduce it on startup. Create ~/.fvwm/test-iconbox:

  Style * IconBox 400 400 -100 -100
  Style XCalc StartIconic
  Exec xcalc
  Exec xcalc

Start fvwm as 'fvwm2 -f test-iconbox'. The default icon box is used
instead of the defined one. The 'Read test-styles' fixes this, but if you
play with Style "*" something, Style "*" IconBox, it is incorrect again.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can handle applying the screenshots.
I am not the only one that does this.

If you have other improvements in mind, let us know.
The fvwm-workers team is always open to new contributors.

well, i don't know, compared to sites like freshmeat.net, fvwm.org looks
quite oldscool. i know, graphics are a waste of bandwith, but, you know
;)

if you like, i could place some kind of redesign (within the next few
MONTHS) on my own page, and you could have a look at it, and, if you
like it, you can have it. what kind of server does fvwm.org run on?
apache? is php there? perl? hmm?

It's apache.  The machine is bog standard RedHat.  The extras aren't there
currently but I can install them if they're needed.

Sounds like a good plan to me.

I admit I prefer the fvwm site to the freshmeat site for a few reasons:

I don't have to scroll to see my way around
I like dark backgrounds

Still, I agree, a bit more graphics and a more sophisticated layout
would help.

The new $. variable enables to create relative and relocatable
configuration trees, as described in:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0005/msg00529.html

There were two positive side effects when implemented this, which seem
more like bug fixes.

1) Since now there is a Read call stack, it was trivial to fix the
old problem reported by Olivier, recursive Read locked-up fvwm.

2) Unlike what mod_initialization.html says, arg 3 of modules instead of
"not guaranteed to point to anything useful" now is guaranteed to point
to the rc file from which the module was invoked. This is an automatical
side effect of these changes.

----------------

Here is an rc file summarizing all 3 topics above.
Save this as ~/.fvwm/test-deep-read and read it by 'Read test-deep-read':

  FvwmPager
  Read $././test-deep-read

This does not lock-up fvwm now. By executing 'ps xww' or similar it is
possible to see arguments of all 40 pagers (the current depth limit).

Regards,
Mikhael.
