I first noticed this with fvwm2.3.29 I beilieve.  Basically I build from CVS then do a make install-strip.  This has always worked fine.  But Now I get

This was done on purpose, not to allow commands started with these 5
letters to be taken as specifiers. If you want to restore this unsupported
old syntax (I don't think this is needed), you may add 5 string
constants ("Click" and so on) in functions.h and check against them.

Mikhael.

The config files coming with SuSE still use that old 'syntax' and
thus many config files will be broken.  I see thre possible
solutions:

 1) Disallow the old syntax completely, enhance fvwm24_convert to
    make all necessary changes and add a comprehensive error
    message explaining the change.
 2) Restore the old behaviour.
 3) Allow multi letter specifiers but print a warning if the token
    is the name of a built in command or a function.

In my eyes, (3) is the best solution to have compatibility *and*
enhanced error checking.

Bye

Yes, I know.  I couldn't make GNOME accept fvwm as a compliant
window manager though, so I ran it from inside fvwm :)

BTW, I see the same problem with gnome-session that I described
for xsm: xosview is started with incorrect options in
gnome-session too.  Not that I really care about it.

(2) is problematic. (3) seems as overhead to me.
I would do either (1) or (4):

4) Allow only 10 case insensitive words, "C", "Click" etc.
   Optionally print an "obsolete syntax" warning on the full word.

I am not against (3) if there is no time penalty for correct specifiers.

Ok, you got me to run my gnome-session from gnome-1.0.55. :)

I have no problem defining window manager entries in gnome-session for
fvwm-2.2 (not session managed), fvwm and fvwm-themes (session managed).

I can see this. I start gmc, and then Logout (using panel) with saving
the current setup (i.e. session). If I logout and save on page (0, 0), on
the next startup desktop icons are ok, but if I do this from page (0, 1),
the desktop (Windows-like) icons disappear while gmc is still running.

I can reproduce this too. If I start 'xosview --net name BarXosview -cpu',
it becomes 'xosview -name BarXosview' on the next startup.

I downloaded xosview, it fiddles with XrmParseCommand, so for any other
program (xsm, gnome-session, fvwm) XGetCommand returns a modified command
line. So it is xosview problem; xosview is also not session aware so it
can't remember its state without the original command line.

Regards,
Mikhael.

A while back these changes were made:

2000-05-05  Mikhael Goikhman  <migo@homemail.com>
	* FvwmCpp/FvwmCpp.c (main): the same missing space as described below
2000-05-05  Brad Giaccio  <bgiaccio@psrw.com>
	* FvwmM4/FvwmM4.c (main):
	fixed a bug created when FVWM_DATADIR was added to m4 options
		-  sprintf(m4_options, "-I '%s'", FVWM_DATADIR);
		+  sprintf(m4_options, "-I '%s' ", FVWM_DATADIR);
	the missing space after the ' caused the next option in the commandline
	to be ignored

cpp on Solaris doesn't like the space after -I.  Every time we use
-I in configure, there is no space.

I think its safe to change it back, so I did.

Yes, it seems that dynamic menus cause this problem. I succed to
reproduce the problem. Try to add at the end of your root menu (or
one of your menu):

+ "A Dyn Menu" Popup a-dyn-menu
+ "A Dyn Menu" Popup a-dyn-menu

AddToMenu a-dyn-menu DynamicPopupAction \
	PipeRead 'echo DestroyMenu a-dyn-menu; echo AddToMenu a-dyn-menu \"xterm\" 
Exec exec xterm'

And popup the above menus. Then in my machine some of my menus
disapear.
It does not seems that there is a memory leak here.

Actually, (3) is trivial to code but costs the time spent
searching for function or command names for long specifiers.

I already comitted the change yesterday.  For one letter
specifiers there is no change to the old stuff and no penalty.

Description:

This doesn't work after the fix for focus on windows that change pages
==
Style * SloppyFocus

DestroyFunc forward
AddToFunc forward I Echo forward
+ I Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50

DestroyFunc backward
AddToFunc backward I Echo backward
+ I Prev (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50

Key KP_Add A N forward
Key KP_Subtract A N backward
==
What happens is that the focus remains in the current window. I think I
see the borders flicker so something may be happening and the the focus
goes back to the current.

Style * ClickToFocus

causes the KP_Add key to move the focus correctly but the pointer is
warped to the old window. The KP_Subtract behaviour remains broken.

Believe it or not, all my mouse and key bindings just stopped
working (except mouse button 3).  A minute ago everything was fine
and then almost all bindings were gone and I had to restart fvwm
(without restarting X).  Any *new* ideas what could have caused
that?  It was definitely not something related to modifiers.

There are two problems.  First, the functions are incorrect.  It
is not guaranteed that
 
  Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus

and

  WarpToWindow 50 50

operate on the same window.  This depends on timing.  Instead you
should use something like this:

  AddToFunc MyFocus
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

  AddToFunc forward
  + I Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) MyFocus

Second, the focus window is set to NULL when the pointer is
grabbed.  I'll elaborate on this in a separate mail.

Triggered by Tim's bug report, I noticed that Scr.Focus is NULL
inside complex functions (which causes the problem with the
Prev command).  There are some commands that operate on the
focused window - which will fail under certain circumstances in
complex functions.  Scr.Focus is set to NULL in misc.c (GrabEm).
I could find the corresponding code even in 2.0.46.  I rewrote
the code and removed the ...Focus members from the screen
structure.  They are now handled locally in focus.c and the
caller has to use access functions to get them.  I hope this
reduces the chance of using these values incorrectly.  But I fear
that said code in misc.c is one big bug.  What would be the
correct way to write this?

    if (!Scr.Focus || do_accept_input_focus(Scr.Focus))
    {
      /* But do not grab if the window does not accept input focus from the
       * window manager */
      if(Scr.PreviousFocus == NULL)
    Scr.PreviousFocus = Scr.Focus;
      DeleteFocus(0);
    }

You commited a change for the problematic (2).
I can do (3) or (4), just tell me which you prefer.

Er, the second patch is lying on my disk at home.  Apparently I
forgot to commit it.

Looks like enough changes have been applied that another Purify
run is called for before 2.4.
Just let me know, and give me a few days, and I'll do it.

As you make changes, give some thought to the test scripts.  See if
you can add something to test what you just changed.

This recent bug with FvwmCpp was surprising, it looks like this hasn't
been working on Solaris for a long time.  I know I never used it before.
I know our test scripts are lacking when it comes to modules.

Creating the test script for FvwmButtons convinced me that FvwmCommand
is a better way to go than the huge config file approach used for
the purify test.  Someday the purify test should be changed over to
FvwmCommand.  (I'm not volunteering right now.)

Ooops, I had tried to simplify my functions to show the bug I am seeing,
I think I simplified things wrong.

Is this correct syntax?
==
Style * SloppyFocus

DestroyFunc my_focus
AddToFunc my_focus 
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50

DestroyFunc my_next
AddToFunc my_next 
+ I Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) my_focus

DestroyFunc my_prev
AddToFunc my_prev 
+ I Prev (!Iconic CurrentDesk) my_focus

Key KP_Add	A	N	my_next
Key KP_Subtract	A	N	my_prev
==
If it is then there is still a bug with KP_Subtract but not with KP_Add.
Interestingly, if you remove the WarpToWindow line KP_Add is broken too.
It may be that the bug you have fixed will fix this, I'll try it on
Friday's snapshot.

Cheers,
Tim.

P.S. I've stumbled across httptunnel, it looks like it will enable me to
get CVS to get through the company firewall. I've asked Jason if he
would consider running an httptunnel server.

You are right.  I'll think about new test cases.

Actually, the purify test was initially only intended as a test
for the overhauled parsing interface.  Back in 2.1.x days I
rewrote the parsers for most commands.  I'd love to have a real
test suite, but every time I try to add some new tests I'm
overwhelmed by the complexity.  For example, a while ago I wanted
to write test cases for window operations vs. various window
states (e.g. a shaded sticky bottom title transient window on page
2 3 of desk 77 w/ restart/move/maximize/...)  Unfortunately found
more than 1.500.000.000 relevant test cases.  And then, you also
have to define the proper behaviour in each of these cases.

Hello,

Try on a window:

Maximize On 80 80
Move w10p w10p
Maximize On 90 90
Move w5p w5p
Maximize Off

Then, the window "disapear": its geometry position is false, something
like 1 page on the left/right/top/bottom for example (not alawys the same).
Do not seems that the numeric value are important in the sequence.

BTW, it seems that fvwm2 does not send a configure message when the
layer of a window change. It is of course (it seems) not a FVWM bug
since no FVWM modules need that. But the layer of a window is one of the
main parameter of the config packets and a module may need that.

BTW2, why there are no FvwmPager: UseListSkip option?

Olivier

I don't know if "wants to" is the right phrase, but I'm willing.

Whenever you think is the right time.  I'll commit another few

I appreciate your level-headedness, and that is the reason why I
try to avoid building releases myself.  Often, wehn I have
finished a bug fixing session I think it is a good idea to make
another release before I go to bed, but most of the time it's a
rather bad idea.

Done.  Feel free to build the release any time you like.

Fixed.  The internal absolute geometry of the window got screwed

Bad news: Friday's snapshot make this fail, nothing happens at all if
you take the WarpToWindow out, if WarpToWindow is included KP_Add works
but KP_Subtract behaves like FlipFocus.

At present, WindowId and Current seem to hard wire CirculateHit
and CirculateHitIcon but explicitly setting their flag values to
1.

I see no problem.  Changes of the used decor are applied
immediately.  However, if you destroy the decor before modifying
it, you have to re apply the decor to all relevant windows with
ChangeDecor.  This is however documented and can not be fixed in a
consistent way.

OK,  I don't think I understood that before.

In order to change decors for all windows you have to use the decor
already used by Style "*" and not destroy it, just keep adding to it.

It seems to work, I'll run more tests.

What was the problem and the fix?

> * fvwm2.1: use bold instead of quotes in "initialization functions" section

That breaks consistency with the rest of the man page.  Names which
can be chosen by the user are always put in double quotes.  Since
function names are usually not predefined by fvwm, the start up
functions have to use the same funt and quoting as other function
names.  So either we back out that change or remove the quoting of
all other function names too.

We would need a way to empty the decor without destroying it a la
the recreate option of DestroyMenu.

I just wrote this option since it was fairly easy to do.  Dan,
could you please review the code I added to CMD_DestroyDecor() to
make sure I did not make any mistakes?

The code had this bug since at least 2.0.38.  But it did not show
up for 'I' functions until recently.  It was always there for the
other specifiers C, H, D and M.  There was some code to prevent
that the window under the pointer gets an EnterNotify event after
an XUngrabPointer, but that never worked.  This additional event
took away to focus from the just focused window again.  I fixed
it by ignoring EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events that are
generated by grabbing or ungrabbing the pointer.  But that does
not prevent the application from handling them and possibly doing
something wrong.

You speak about examples, which is not what I changed.

In the section, which I rewrote 2 years ago, I replaced "InitFunction"
with .B InitFunction and other 6 function names, which are not changable
by a user. I see that StrokeFunc is bold too, I would also add bold to
UrgencyFunc and WindowListFunc for consistency.

Mikhael.

After looking for about 20 minutes, the only thing I see is that
line 1998 is extra since InitFvwmDecor memsets the entire Decor
structure.

I also tested it and it works fine.
I like the idea that we can explicitly clear the decor.

Thanks.

I'm not really concerned about bold or double quotes, only about
consistency.

  (a) All user settable names should bet typeset the same.
  (b) All function names should be typeset the same.
  (c) Some function names are user settable.

 ==>

  (d) Alle function names should be typeset like all user
  settable names.

Not that I care much about readability. There is one minor
reason why I would prefer double quotes over bold and thas
is that bold font is already used excessively in the man
page, so double quoting may be less confusing.

For me bold for the definied term is less confusing than quotes.
I think we may use different styles in the definition and references.
But I don't worry and if you think otherwise, just change it.

Isn't that what you wanted it to do?:

  echo `date +%Y-%m-%d`"  $FVWMRELNAME  <$FVWMRELEMAIL>" > $NCLOG
  echo >> $NCLOG
  echo "	* NEWS, configure.in:" >> $NCLOG
  echo "	changed version to $VRELNUMP" >> $NCLOG
  echo >> $NCLOG

FVWMRELNAME is for the release being created, 2.3.31, and
VRELNUMP is the next release.

Ah, no.  FVWMRELNAME is the name of the person who built the
release.  It shows up in the ChangeLog entry.  The name is not
very good, though :)

Sorry, I thought you forgot to patch fvwm-web.  I always commit
these files even before uploading the tarballs and Jason usually
does not send a notification.  The best solution would be if Jason
made these changes.

Darn, I had a feeling I was doing something wrong there.
I looked around for anything I might have to do this automatically,
the last time I tried, I came up with this:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <pwd.h>                        /* for getpwent */
int main () {
  struct passwd * passwd_ptr;         /* password struct */
  char *comma;
  char  mvs_uname[21];                  /* prgmr name limited to 20 chars */
  passwd_ptr =
    (struct passwd*)getpwuid(getuid()); /* get password struct */
  strncpy(mvs_uname, passwd_ptr->pw_gecos,
          sizeof(mvs_uname));         /* get name */
  mvs_uname[20] = '\0';               /* set max len */
  comma = (char *)strpbrk(mvs_uname, ",");    /* find first comma */
  if (comma != NULL) {                /* If there is a comma */
    *comma = '\0';                    /* change comma to null */
  }
  printf("%s\n", mvs_uname);
}

I think this is doable in Perl, but I don't think shell is any good for
it.

I'll just have to be more careful.

I was out; the files are in place now.  (Weekends, especially in the warm
months, aren't always the best days to get work done.  I'm apt to be
skydiving or off on some other non-computer-related pursuit.  Still, I try
to check at least once a day.)

I could do that, or we could come with some other way of handling the FTP

grep '^[^:]*:[^:]*:'`id|awk -F'[\=\(]' '{print $2}'`: /etc/passwd |
    awk -F: '{print $5}' |
    awk -F, '{print $1}'

    The "grep" selects a line from passwd, "awk -F:" extracts the pw_gecos
field, and "awk -F," truncates everything after first "," (if any).

    All you have to do is assign the result to variable, the only problem is
need in nested backticks.  If memory serves me right, modern shells support
a '$(cmd)' nestable replacement for backticks, but it is supported not on
all platforms (IRIX's & Linux's /bin/sh understand it, Solaris and OSF --
don't).  The problem can be solved by obtaining the inner `` into a variable
first (UID=`id|awk...`) and using the $UID in the grep.

This one is much simpler:

  grep "^`whoami`:" /etc/passwd | cut -f 5 -d ":"

But anyway, since the comment field can contain other information
than the user name, and it's not much effort to set the variable
once manually, it's not worth the effort, I think.

 $ man 5 passwd

   ...
   The  comment  field  is  used by various system utilities,
   such as finger(1).  Three additional values may be present
   in the comment field.  They are

        pri= - set initial value of nice

        umask= - set initial value of umask

        ulimit= - set initial value of ulimit

   These  fields  are  separated from each other and from any
   other comment field by a comma.
   ...

For Emacs/XEmacs users it should be possible to extract the
ChangeLog name and email address from the config file.

Thanks Dominik, the Prev and Next functions are working again.
Unfortunately, I think the bug you fixed that caused the Prev function
to break is back.  If I run the following on an rxvt terminal the focus
remains on the rxvt but the text cursor goes hollow. This seems to
indicate that rxvt doesn't think it has the focus.

DestroyFunc my_unfocus
AddToFunc my_unfocus
+ I MoveToDesk 0 -1
+ I Move 0 0
+ I MoveToDesk 0
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50

Key KP_5        WTSFI   N       my_unfocus

It might only be rxvt that has this problem, xterm works OK but I
occasionally get problems with Synopsys design_analyzer not recognizing
key strokes. I also get problems when de-iconifying from an FvwmIconMan
- the window border highlights but the keyboard focus stays on some
other window (usually a window focussed by the pointer moving over an
FvwmIconMan button)

DestroyFunc my_flipfocus
AddToFunc my_flipfocus I Echo my_flipfocus
+ I Iconify Off
+ I WindowShade Off
+ I Raise
+ I FlipFocus
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50

*FvwmIconMan*Action Select SendCommand FlipFocus
*FvwmIconMan*Action Mouse 1 N SendCommand my_flipfocus

When Prev was broken this worked fine, After the Prev fix the focus is
often on the wrong window even though the border hilight indicates the
de-iconified window should have the focus. SloppyFocus as usual.

Hope this helps,
Tim.

Ah, I remember now, CirculateHit and CirculateHitIcon aren't really
conditions, they control the list of windows to search, The man page
confused me, which is embarrasing since I think I wrote parts of it.

What I would like now is an extra condition: CirculateSkip (and
!CirculateSkip) to
be used to test the CirculateSkip style flag. I only want it for the
WindowId command but it might be simpler to have it in all. If you think
it's too confusing to have CirculateHit and CirculateSkip in the
conditions for Next/Prev/None/Direction then I'll be happy with
WindowListSkip to test the WindowListSkip style flag.

Cheers,
Tim.

None of this works for me.
Not all UNIX systems put an entry in /etc/passwd for

The longer I look into the code the more bugs do I find.  It's
almost a miracle that all this has worked before.  When a window
was moved to another desk or iconified, the window was unfocused
only for some focus models.  Sometimes, the window still had the
focus, for example when unmapped because it was moved to a
different desk.  rxvt notices that it is iconified and assumes
it does not have focus anymore while its main window still has
the focus *although it is unmapped*.  When it's mapped again,
rxvt never gets a new FocusIn event and thus still thinks I does
not have focus.  I fixed this by explicitly taking and giving
focus upon a desk switch or (de)iconify.

Furthermore the iconify code did not handle iconifying trees of
transient windows.  For example, if the main window of an
application was iconified and with it its transients, one of the
now unmapped transients may well have received focus.

This is hopefulle all fixed, but expect new problems showing up.

Bye

    Oops...  You are right -- in case of NIS there will be nothing in the
/etc/passwd.  So, either Dominik's solution should be used (hardwiring in
Emacs config) or something like "finger `whoami`|head -1|..." (the latter
works at least in Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, IRIX and OSF).

Trying to reliably parse out the username from the finger output
isn't so easy:

Login       Name               TTY         Idle    When    Where
dane     Dan Espen             console       3d Thu 11:06 
...

I think you would need to know where the TTY column starts to find
the end of the user name.  None of the implementations I tested use
tabs to separate fields.

I think Perl rather  than emacs would  still be the best solution, but
the problem  isn't big enough to  worry about, I just  have to be more
careful.

I'm running a Java application which pops up a new window corresponding
to a "floating" toolbar.  When I try to pop up the window, I get console
errors from fvwm2, the window comes up without decorations, and a small
bordered window appears in the upper left hand corner.  The errors I see
in the console:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 1, Error 2, EventType: 20

The empty bordered window returns nothing in xprop, and xwininfo -all
returns the following:

Heya folks.

Just noticed that SnapAttraction doesn't do what the man page says..
SnapMode is supposed to be set to All if only one argument is given..
but it doesn't set it which leaves it at whatever it was before
(probably nothing if you just started) ... so here's a fix..

        * fvwm/move_resize.c:
        set SnapMode to icons + windows when no behavior is given like
        the man page says

I think you misread the man page.  It does not state that the
behaviour is overwritten by its default setting if it is left out:

  Calling this command without arguments reinstates the default
  settings.

  ...

  The behavior argument is optional and may be set to one of the
  four following values:

  ...

  The default SnapAttraction setting for behavior is All.

This only implies that the default behaviour is restored if the
command is called with no arguments, not if it's called with one
argument.  The explanation could be a bit more clear, though.

Bye

I see.  I have made a patch that does this:

 "Snapattraction" is equivalent to "Snapattraction 0 All"
 "Snapattraction n" sets the value but does not change the
 behavior.  If no behavior was ever specified, "All" is used.

Well.. then 'Snapattraction 5' still won't do anything which I suppose

Why do you think that?  As I said:

 1) If no behavior was ever specified, "All" is used.
 2) "Snapattraction n" sets the value but does not change the behavior.

==>

An initial "Snapattraction 5" is equivalent to "Snapattraction 5 All".
Try it and you will see :)

Actually, this has nothing to do with it.  The Reply-To field is to be
used in preference to the From: field when emailing the originator of
the message.  That's _all_ it means.  In particular note that Reply-To
in email is _not_ the same thing at all as Followup-To in USENET.

Reply-To is there to help out those whose email infrastructure
"helpfully" rewrites their From: address for them, and/or they want to
use a different address to receive mail than is normally placed in the
From: field.

In short, these two sets of headers:

  From: dominik.vogt@fvwm.org
  Reply-To: dominik.vogt@fvwm.org
  To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

And:

  From: dominik.vogt@fvwm.org
  To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

should be treated identically by your mail agent.

What you need to do is use the "followup to all recipients" feature of
your mail agent, rather than the "reply to author" feature...

Ain't email fun! :).

As someone who has been through this debate more times than I wish to
count, I will point out three things:

1) When making statements of this type, quote chapter and verse.  From
   RFC822:

     4.4.3.  REPLY-TO / RESENT-REPLY-TO

        This field provides a general  mechanism  for  indicating  any
        mailbox(es)  to which responses are to be sent.  Three typical
        uses for this feature can  be  distinguished.   In  the  first
        case,  the  author(s) may not have regular machine-based mail-
        boxes and therefore wish(es) to indicate an alternate  machine
        address.   In  the  second case, an author may wish additional
        persons to be made aware of, or responsible for,  replies.   A
        somewhat  different  use  may be of some help to "text message
        teleconferencing" groups equipped with automatic  distribution
        services:   include the address of that service in the "Reply-
        To" field of all messages  submitted  to  the  teleconference;
        then  participants  can  "reply"  to conference submissions to
        guarantee the correct distribution of any submission of  their
        own.

2) Your interpretation is but one of several.  Interpretation is generally
   by the MUA, unless the replier rewrites the headers manually or the MUA
   prompts.  (The latter is probably the best in light of differing
   interpretations, but many MUAs minimize prompting in an attempt to be
   "user friendly".
 
3) Reply-To: is rather overloaded in a mailing list context.

The latter two points basically mean that if you want to guarantee that you
don't see the kinds of issues that Dominik is seeing, you should munge your
From: header if at all possible and leave Reply-To: alone.

Unfortunately for many of us that's impossible: any local address I put
in my From: is "helpfully" reformatted by sendmail or Exchange rules to
be what you see in this message.  When I typed in and _sent_ this
message, the From: field was:

  From: "Paul D. Smith" <psmith@baynetworks.com>

Of course, our "oh so helpful" mail munging also whacks Reply-To:, not
just From:, so for me the distinction is moot :).

BTW, are you saying you know of mailers that, when given this set of
headers:

  From: dominik.vogt@fvwm.org
  Reply-To: dominik.vogt@fvwm.org
  To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

and a "followup to all recipients" command, send _only_ to the address
in the Reply-To: field?

I've been using email for a _lot_ of years now, including some pretty
broken MUAs, but I've never seen one _that_ broken.

You are probably right.  I always wanted to give people a chance
to reply to me directly if they really know what they are doing,
but in the end it's not what I want in 90% of the cases.  Another
problem is to configure mutt to use the correct from header.

Anyway, I will do the same to the Reply-To: Header since some mail
clients insist on being super clever if its missing and ignore my
munged From: header.

Let's try...

Bye

Some mailers do not have the separate concept of a "group reply".  And,
yes, some obey the Reply-To: header.  If you configure it so, Gnus will use
the Reply-To: header for group replies and the From: header for personal
replies (since that is what you would want when on a list that adds a
Reply-To: header back to itself).

I've been a mailing list manager (Majordomo) author for a bunch of years
now, and I've seen all kinds of MUA behavior and all kinds of user
expectations as well.

When converting *.png files to *.xpm with recent versions of convert

have color names like in the following example fallback.xpm.~1~:

I.e. the color names have 16 digits like "0000000000004047",
four digits each for red, green, and blue, and four additional digits
for the opacity.

fvwm 2.3.30 complains that it cannot read these xpm files.

After removing the 4 digits for the opacity, so that the xpm file
looks like:


--=-=-=
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=fallback.xpm

/* XPM */
static char *magick[] = {
/* columns rows colors chars-per-pixel */
"16 16 16 1",

--=-=-=


fvwm 2.3.30 can read the xpm file.

Is this a problem of fvwm or a problem of "convert" from ImageMagick?

Should either of them be changed?

Its got to be a problem in the xpm library you are using.
Fvwm never parses that stuff itself, it calls xpm library functions
to do that.

You didn't post the message you got.

That seems to be libXpm

mfabian@gregory:~$ ldd /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2
        libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4 (0x40026000)
        libstroke.so.0 => /usr/lib/libstroke.so.0 (0x40035000)
        [...]

which comes with XFree86-4.x. I believe that didn't change.
But the output of 

"ee", "xv", and "display" can display these *.xpm files, but none of
them links against libXpm, so they are probably parsing the xpm files
themselves.

> You didn't post the message you got.

Messages like the following:

I can confirm that it fails for me too, I'm using fvwm from almost current
CVS and libxpm.4.10.  The message I get is:

[FVWM][GetXPMFile]: <<ERROR>> XpmCreatePixmapFromXpmImage failed, rc -4

Then  a little while  after  I got that  fvwm   core dumped with  this
message:

388 Arithmetic Exception(coredump)

I never saw one of those before.
I'm not sure I restarted since my last recompile so I want to see if
I can recreate that part.

The -4 return code comes from the CreateColors routine in the Xpm library
indicating it couldn't do something with the color, I'm not sure what
yet.

I want to get fvwm current and check for new Xpm releases.
The problem does seem to be in the Xpm library.

Later,

When did 4 additional digits for the opacity become part of an
X color name?

On my Solaris system XparseColor fails on a colorname like that.

I have no idea.

So you think I should patch the ImageMagick package to produce
colour names with 12 digits again, like it used to?

If there is no way to tell it to leave the opacity out, go ahead.

I didn't see any version of the xpm library that would handle the
opacity value.  I don't know what you have there.

> which comes with XFree86-4.x. I believe that didn't change.

    As far as I remember, XFree86 4.x includes the same XPM library as was
previously distributed as a sepatate package.

    Quoting the "XPM Manual" (xpm-doc-A4.PS.gz), Chapter 2:

        The Colors section contains as many strings as there are colors, and
        each string is as follows:

        <chars> {<key> <color>}+

        . . .

        Colors can be specified by giving the colorname, a # followed by the
        RGB code in hexadecimal, or a % followed by the HSV code (not
        implemented).

    The X color specification (see X(1) for example) states that "color can
be specified either by an abstract color name, or by a numerical color
specification".  And later:

        A  numerical color specification consists of a color space
        name and a set of values in the following syntax:

            <color_space_name>:<value>/.../<value>

        An RGB Device specification is identified  by  the  prefix
        "rgb:" and has the following syntax:

            rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>

                <red>, <green>, <blue> := h | hh | hhh | hhhh
                h := single hexadecimal digits
                       . . .
       For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB Device
       is supported, but its continued  use  is  not  encouraged.
       The  syntax is an initial sharp sign character followed by
       a numeric specification, in one of the following formats:

            #RGB                      (4 bits each)
            #RRGGBB                   (8 bits each)
            #RRRGGGBBB                (12 bits each)
            #RRRRGGGGBBBB             (16 bits each)

    So, the "opacity" (alpha-channel) is image-magick's invention.  Don't
know if it was discussed in their maillists, but it is definitely a very bad
behaviour to produce non-standard .xpm-files.  They could at least introduce
a different <key>, say, "rgba", and write it together with a regular "c"
color.

    At least "xv" uses its own read/write code for all file formats
including XPM (xvxpm.c).

My placement policy is:

Style "*"           ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement

when I create a window and  there is no empty space  for the window to
be placed in, I get a wireframe.

If focus was in a window when the wireframe appears, I can't use the keyboard
to position or place the window.

I think this just started recently, since I do this a lot.

If there is a container without the Colorset definition, the parent pixmap
background (defined by Colorset in parent) is not used for buttons (unless
the button itself has Colorset definition). IMO, this is incorrect.

Rewording: there is global Colorset, there is container without Colorset,
there is button without Colorset => solid global Colorset bg is used, but
not its Pixmap or XGradient.

To see this, just add a Container around any single button.
It is tricky to do this in Dominik's FvwmButtons sample, because it uses
position coordinates, so replacing a line

  *FvwmButtons: (3x2+6+1, Icon my_move.xpm, Action Move)

with

  *FvwmButtons: (3x2+6+1, Padding 0 0, Container (Columns 1, Rows 1))
  *FvwmButtons: (1x1, Icon my_move.xpm, Action Move)
  *FvwmButtons: (End)
  
does not work.
I would expect this to work, like it works without position coordinates.

I have managed to insert a container by commenting global Rows and Columns
lines and adding one container over all buttons:

  #*FvwmButtons: Rows     5
  #*FvwmButtons: Columns  68
  *FvwmButtons: (Padding 0 0, Container (Columns 68, Rows  5))
  ... all buttons ...
  *FvwmButtons: (End)

This problem is not critical, because there is a workaround - adding an
explicit Colorset in Container.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, this workaround does not give exactly the same result.
With it, a colorset rectangle is limited to a container, while it is
somewhat expected that a container without Colorset would be transparent,
like any non-container buttons without Colorset.

Should this be a feature request?

Mikhael.

Yes, containers do not inherit the colour set from the parent.  We
would probably need an option like 'ParentRelative'.  Colour sets
do not support using parts of a global background inside smaller
rectangles thus faking transparency.

But that's nothing to do before 2.4.

Right.  As long as the window is not overlapped, it is always
considered to be raised already, so every 'raiselower' will lower
it.  This is not easy to fix with the current implementation of
the restacking code.  Some time in the future I'd like to rewrite
that code so that a window and all its transients are treated as
a single window when stacked, thus eliminating the visual effects
there are now (caused by the recursion).  For now, would you
please put this into Jitterbug as a confirmed bug?  The problem
does not look serious enough to touch that code right now.

Bye

Well, that's very hard to debug without the application.  Can I
lay my hands on it somehow?  Could you also try the current beta
release (2.3.31) and see if it still has the same problem?

Hello,
I've started to do a module that implement the "EWMS" for FVWM (e.g.,
at the present time kicker work almost as well with FVWM than with kwin).
A module is probably not the solution but it is at the present time the only
way ... and it will be not very difficult to integrate it in FVWM in the 
future. The module is at the present time in alpha stage (beta for my machine)
and there are no man page (a lot of things are/will be configurable).
So, if someone is interested to test it or want to help he/she can contact me.
Olivier

Do you use animation with your IconMan?
Maybe I've fixed this. You may try a tomorrow snapshot or wait for 2.3.32.

I noticed that moving/resizing window with the keyboard had the
same problem and assumed fixing it would fix the placement problem
too.  Later I forgot to thest the initial setup.  I'll commit the
placement fix in a few minutes.

BTW, I noticed another thing with keyboard moves.  When you issue
any command that needs a window outside of a window context, you
have to select a window to operate on.  But you can't do that
with the keyboard because the DeferExecution function does not
handle keyboard input (at least not with the parameters that it
is usually called with).  But you can neither select a window with
a mouse button for move and resize because releasing the button
ends to operation.  I can't remember if this is a new problem or
if it always has been like this.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Same problem.  The keyboard was not grabbed during the selection.

Hi Dominik,

I couldn't find a way to add this to the bug... I realized that the
problem occurs when we, using Java 2 and the Swing widget kit, set the
visible attribute to false before setting the resizable attribute to
true.  If we call setVisible(false) after calling setResizable(true),
then all is well.

I'll see if I can write a quick and dirty sample app sometime next week
that y'all could run with the Blackdown.org JRE.

Eric

www.fvwm.org still notes 2.3.30 as the latest beta (unlike whats written in 
NEWS FLASH).  The "downloads" page needs to be updated as well to reflect 
the new release (the link is correct, the text is not).

Looks as though some script went awry somewhere.

Just thought I'd mention it.

BTW: whatever happened regarding the contest for a New FVWM logo ?

Some of the submissions ended up in the fvwm icons package.

I've been playing around with sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples.

I recently changed it so that the decor definitions are:

modular,
create their own menu entries,
have a way to undo themselves.

I have a  new version that:

remembers its  setting thru restarts,
uses FvwmCpp to  read decor definitions,
supports system wide and user level decor definitions,
can be included in the default startup with little overhead,
can be turned on and off thru a menu,
could be integrated into fvwm.

This is not a theming engine, there is no gui to create decors.

Attached is the decor driver and 2 decor files.  (I have 5 more decors
but they are all need special icons.)

Re-tried. Now I have XFree-4 server, too; earlier just all libraries.
The same problem still appears - but not every time I start fvwm.
Note that FvwmTheme must be running to see the problem.

In case anyone's interested, I found a useful hack to fvwm is to
make Next and Prev commands match on window id's as well as the other
window properties it matches on.  This allows one to write a module
that implementes a fancier version of window cycling (choosing which
window to switch to) then is possible with just Next and Prev.  The mod to
fvwm/buitins.c is adding the lines:

  {
     char tmpid[200];
     sprintf(tmpid, "%x", fw->w);
     fMatchesName |= (strcmp(mask->name, tmpid) == 0);
  }

to MatchesConditionMask in the appropriate place.

Cheers.

josh

You can simply use the WindowId command instead:

  WindowId 0x12345678 focus

I don't know when this is started, seems recently.
With SloppyFocus and a cursor inside a window, the following

  Key Tab A CM Next Focus

works as usual, but the following

  Key Tab A CM Next FuncFvwmSelectWindow

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmSelectWindow
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmSelectWindow
  + I Focus

now restores a focus to a window under cursor.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm not sure how to reproduce this...

I usually operate the menus entirely thru the keyboard, and
I have most of the hot keys memorized, so I type ahead of the menus.

A few times recently,  I've had the  menus loose  focus and  the focus
reverts back to the window I was in when I started.  I can type in the
window with the menus still visible.

Hi Dominik,

I've included below a sample Java application (source code) that tickles
the bug in fvwm 2.2.5.  I haven't had the time to try this out with the
latest FVWM2 beta version, so I don't know if it works from there.

Eric

Dominik previously said that he wants to remove decors and make the
current TitleStyle, ButtonStyle and BorderStyle to be Style options.

This is the second reason why we don't use decors in fvwm-themes.
The main reason not to use decors is that decors are really redudant if
only one is used at any time, like in your setup.

If this means to add more examples, this is fine.
If "integration" means adding this to ConfigFvwmDefaults, I am against.
If it means adding it to ConfigFvwmSetup, you may do this if you feel
strong about this, but I would not start to add new themability setups.

Creating a functional universal theme framework is not an easy work.
The problems are not limited only to decorations or menustyle; fvwm-themes
gives a unified solution for window decorations, background, bindings,
colors, cursors, globalfeel, menus, menustyle, styles, binding applications
and any new components which may be added without changing a theme engine.
Even a solution for window decorations is more flexible than in this setup,
there are 3 separate components: window buttons, window look, colorsets.
so you may use any decorations with any buttons with any colors (useful).
Or be able to define an order of titlebar buttons (in the next 0.4.3).

> This is not a theming engine, there is no gui to create decors.

This is still a new theming setup, why to add it to FVWM as mandatory?
The plus of this setup is that it's simplier, but it will become complex
once you will want to make it work without glitches for many configs.
The reasons which I see why not to add this themability setup are:

  1) It still requires to comply with some rules in dividing user fvwmrc,
     but it is incompatible and much less functional than fvwm-themes.
  2) It does not use colorsets, so a pager can't reuse colors used in
     decors for mini-window colors. Also should menu (and other) colors
     be changed together with decor colors? Probably, yes.
  3) Many rc files and other resources (like images) are required to be
     installed together with FVWM even if they are never used by a user.
  4) Decors (and menustyles) in this setup are already maintained in
     fvwm-themes, new examples may be added to fvwm-themes as themes.

Several days ago I added decorations for 2 new themes, brushedmetal and
nanogui (in cvs), 2 more will come soon. If you send me decoration examples
of your 5 decors, I or someone else (maybe you) may add more themes.
It is ok if a theme should include more images or other resources.

Mikhael.

I tried to compile and run this, but I get an error:

  luthien: ~ 1 > javac HelloWorldApp.java 
  HelloWorldApp.java:13: Package javax.swing not found in import.
  import javax.swing.*;
         ^
  1 error

I guess I have to install swing here.  Where do I get that (Linux
2.4 PC w/ SuSE 7.1)?

Did you find out whats wrong with the menus?

It seems to me the recent betas aren't creating new problem reports.
If we just fix the problems we know about, I think we can do 2.4.

This problem was several days ago. It is fixed in the current cvs together
with some other similar focus problems I experienced.

P.S. I can only read the mail archives temporarily.

I'm not sure how to reproduce this...

I usually operate the menus entirely thru the keyboard, and
I have most of the hot keys memorized, so I type ahead of the menus.

A few times recently,  I've had the  menus loose  focus and  the focus
reverts back to the window I was in when I started.  I can type in the
window with the menus still visible.

The attached didn't fail until I put in the menustyle information.

Put the pointer near the right edge of the screen, over a window.
Press shift F1, then U, then A.

Can you shed some more light on this?  I wrote an OSX "theme" for
fvwm2 (I sent my code out on this list about six months ago).  Dan
Espen modified it to work with his own "themes" using decor hooks.

I'd be very interested in any other work that has gone into making
fvwm2 look/act more like Aqua/OSX.

Or am I completely misunderstanding your message?

The menus seem to be fixed now.  I'll try to get  in a Purify run this
weekend, use this for a while longer, and then I think we're ready for
2.4.

I'm seeing a problem in the very latest CVS code (and for a week or so
as well), with FvwmAuto (FvwmAuto 500).

This is with rxvt's, but I have no reason to believe it wouldn't happen
with other windows too.

What happens is when I de-iconify (using mouse-2 on an icon, which is
just bound to "Iconify"), if I zoom the cursor to where the window will
appear when de-iconified right after I click it, so that my cursor gets
there before or at the same time as the window appears, then it won't
get focus.  I have to move the mouse to the border, then FVWM "notices"
I'm really in the window and gives it focus.

It doesn't happen in my Gnome session at work (where iconification is to
the Gnome panel) but it's easy to reproduce on my system at home, where
I just use straight FVWM.  I also use FvwmAnimate to animate the
iconification/deiconification; I think that might help show the problem
by making it easier to get the mouse there before the window opens.

I vaguely recall having a similar problem a few months ago, which was
fixed, but now it seems to be back.

Unfortunately I spent all last night reloading Windows98 on my Windows
partition (what a piece of crap!) and didn't have time to track this
down more carefully.

If you can't reproduce it based on the above description I'll play with
it more this weekend.

C'est la vie.  Sorry, we can choose between several unwanted
behaviours here.  The alternative is to screw up functions that
modify the focus but do not move the pointer to the focus window.
Grabbing and releasing the pointer generates EnterNotify and
LeaveNotify events.  These can either be thrown away or used to
transfer focus.  Throwing them away triggers the problem you
describe, using them makes windows take the focus away from
another window in functions under certain circumstances.  Since
there is no way to distinguish between wanted and unwanted events,
I don't know what to do about it.

The older code that worked in this situation broke other things.

Bye

Ugh.  This kind of bites.

Can we quantify more precisely the alternatives?  We know what happens
the way it is now, and it's pretty annoying and happens almost every
time I de-iconify a window.  What exactly is the behavior that breaks
when the code works the other way?

I just tried to recreate this problem and ended up with a core file.

I run FvwmAuto with 200.
I wasn't able to duplicate the problem as Paul described but after a while
with FvwmAuto still running, an rxvt and XEmacs started a battle amongst
themselves over who was going to be on top.  Without the mouse moving at
all they just kept switching places.

After I moved the pointer out of the disputed area, the battle came
to an end.  (I won't mention who won, its not important.)

The next thing I did was run something I'm testing from an rxvt that creates
an rxvt window.  The window opens and closes by itself.  Thats when I got this
core dump:

Just got the core again without FvwmAuto.

Basically, all I do is:

rxvt -e 'diff file1 file2;read'

I also notice that when I start fvwm, the window under the pointer is
not getting focused.

For me, that line just pops up and closes the rxvt immediately.
You can only run a single command with -e, sot a whole script.

I do not get the core dump, but I may have different setup.  The
problem seems to be that the stack ring is corrupted between line
1323 and line 1438 in add_window.c.  A possible candidate may be
the SM code that modifies the stack ring.  Can you have a look,
Dan?

Hm, I tried to debug this, but it does not happen for me.
Furthermore I noticed that my explanation of the problem can not
be correct.  When the window is mapped below the cursor it does
get a normal EnterNotify for me and thus receives focus.  Can you
provide the relevant config lines, please?

I knew this wouldn't work, its just a placeholder until I write
the replacement.  Fortunately for us, it reveals an fvwm problem.

I'm looking.  I don't use session management, its not even compiled
in.

What happens is that the wire frame appears and then it core dumps.

It looks like  fvwm is  handling events with  the  wire frame visible.
Its trying to remove the window before its finished placing it.

Shouldn't the X server be grabbed while the wire frame is visible?

I think Mikhael mistakenly copied this list although I'm
always interested in whats going on in Fvwm Themes.

I think this will help explain what Fvwm Themes is all about:

http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

I'd watch out for lawyers too, only put original work into
things you publish on the web.

Except for the name, decors aren't essential to what it does.
The "decor" files that it reads in can do whatever is wanted as
long as the remove hook undoes it.

I'm drawn to what I created just because it is simple.
I don't see how it will ever become complex, but I could be wrong.
The decors could be complex, but the add and remove hook concept
seems like it could remain as simple as it is.

If it was  added to FVWM  as mandatory, all  that would happen is that
about a 15  additional lines would  be read during startup, a  small
menu would be built, and one read for the users .DecorCurrent would be
done.  If decors hadn't been turned on, nothing else would happen.

Your feedback is exactly what I was looking for.
I'm not sure its a good thing either, or I would have just gone
ahead and committed it.

I'm  not sure its a good  idea to commit it as  an example either, its
a little hard to understand for an example.  I'll have to give some
thought as to what I should do with it vs. fvwm.

I find it perfect for my own use.  My users don't want their entire
configuration revamped, just a little border/menu adjustment.
Most of them are quite happy with the choice of blue marble borders,
or W95 plainness.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts, thats exactly the kind of feedback
I was hoping for.

We usually discuss these topics on fvwm-themes-devel list.
Olivier refers to the latest changes in the fvwm-themes cvs, pre-0.4.3.
Here are screenshots of some of the changes:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/screenshots/full/osx.gif
  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/screenshots/full/brushedmetal.gif
  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/screenshots/full/nanogui.gif

I used your configuration posted more than year ago to initially create
theme osx in fvwm-themes-0.0.5, Olivier and me almost fully rewrote it
since then. Recently I changed buttons to look more like the original.

You may either get cvs version or wait for fvwm-themes-0.4.3 (preferable,
you will be able to define window buttons used and their order too).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Final swing is included with recent java (1.3), so you may upgrade jdk.
I used rpm from Caldera (works well on RedHat, and maybe on SuSE):

  http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/openlinux/ltp/col/install/RPMS/jdk-1.3-11.i386.html
  http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/openlinux/ltp/col/install/RPMS/jre-1.3-11.i386.html

These rpms have all files in /opt/java-1.3/.
  PATH=/opt/java-1.3/bin:$PATH
  JAVA_HOME=/opt/java-1.3

After running this test app: "java -cp . HelloWorldApp" for the first time
the window appears for me, but it disappears shortly on the following runs.
I don't get "*** internal error ***".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Maybe this is related, maybe not.
I got the same problem when I had one small ClickToFocus window which is
mapped on startups after the window under the pointer. To fix this I use:

  Style that_window ClickToFocus, GrabFocusOff  # the order matters

I see the problem, I've got to take a break so I'll look for a solution
later.

In placement.c around line 750 there is this:

      if (GrabEm(CRS_POSITION, GRAB_NORMAL))
      {
	/* Grabbed the pointer - continue */
	MyXGrabServer(dpy);
	if (XGetGeometry(dpy, tmp_win->w, &JunkRoot, &JunkX, &JunkY,
			 (unsigned int *)&DragWidth,
			 (unsigned int *)&DragHeight,
			 &JunkBW,  &JunkDepth) == 0)
        {
	  free((char *)tmp_win);
	  MyXUngrabServer(dpy);
	  return False;
	}
	MyXGrabKeyboard(dpy);
	DragWidth = tmp_win->frame_g.width;

The free is getting executed, so tmp_win  is gone, but subsequent code
still tries to add the window to the stack ring using that structure.

No, the problem appears without any ClickToFocus windows.  I have
fixed this by allowing one EnterNotify caused by XUngrabPointer to
be used right after startup.

Is is grabbed in add_window.c.  The event may have been generated
before the server was grabbed. 

The rxvt behaves a bit random for me.  Two thirds of the times it
vanishes right after mapping, the rest of the times it stays up.
Given the -e option it should always be closed.

I have removed the free() and cleaned up event handling in
moveLoop() a bit.  Although this may prevent the core dump for the
moment, it does not do anything about the disappearing window.

I tried removing the free, and  it left me  with a frame but no window
inside the frame.  I  just tested what  you committed, and it does the
same thing, except it worked right one time.  (The window appeared and
then disappeared.)  But more often, it leaves an empty frame around.
Theres a timing issue to this because add_window does an XGetGeometry
on the window that works, then the one in the placement logic fails.

When the placement logic  can't  find the  window anymore,  it  aborts
processing and returns false.  This eventually gets back to add_window
which sets the variable "do_resize_too"  to false.  I think it  should
be using that  false value as  a signal that the  window  is gone, not
just avoid  resizing it.   I'm   not sure what    else can cause   the
placement logic to return false yet.

This change:

2000-01-01  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>
	* fvwm/placement.c (PlaceWindow):
	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow):
	(setup_window_placement):
	signature of PlaceWindow() changed to return True or False only

changed the return code for PlaceWindow from a 3 value switch to
a true/false switch.

the comment at the top of PlaceWindow still says it returns 3 values
"ok", "ok w. resize" and "window lost".

The way AddWindow handles  the return code, I think  it still  wants 3
values, although our  current problem has to  do with it not  handling
"window lost".

I'm  not  sure what  it should  do either (when  the  window is lost).
Calling destroy_window doesn't seem to be any good.
Any hints?

What I don't understand: how can the window disappear so that fvwm
does not notice?  The MyXGrabServer() call in AddWindow() should
prevent that the window disappears without notice:

  /****** Make sure the client window still exists.  We don't want to leave an

The DestroyNotify should be caught by SubstructureRedirectMask on
the root window, but apparently it isn't.  Maybe if the window
dies before the call to XReparentWindow()?  Then we could add
another check with XGetGeometry() after the XReparentWindow()
call.  If it fails, we still run to the end of the function but
then destroy the window.

Perhaps it would be helpful to add debug output all over the code
to see at which moment the window dies.

With the addition of the code I just added, it seems to be working
now.  I should have thought of letting addwindow finish the add
before trying to destroy the window.  I guess the half added window
was causing problems.

There is still the issue of the bad comments in the placement code
for the return type.
Also the prototype for PlaceWindow has the return type of int, vs
the bool in the code.

1 in 6 children are victimized before the age of 16.

Hello, my name is Jason Colgan and I am writing to you about my father's unique book on child safety.  
 
I hope you don't mind me emailing you, but I found your email address on a website that was related to children, so I figured you would definitely be interested in this.
 
My father, a retired police Captain, authored a children's book using his unique experience with child safety.  My father has investigated, arrested and taken confessions from child molesters, kidnappers, murderers and some of the most dangerous people in the world.  He often spoke and interacted with them before they had the chance to speak with lawyers or others, so he was able to gain an honest understanding of the way they think and the manner in which they victimize children.  
 
My father put his 23 years of experience to work for a good cause and developed a children's book, written in a storybook fashion starring a small family of bunnies.  The book has already caused quite a stir and has been featured in local newspapers and even the news.  Even more important, the people who have purchased the book love it and so do their children.  It truly presents a simplified way to educate your child on matters that are difficult for parents, grandparents, or guardians to discuss.
 
I would like you to learn more about my father's book by visiting www.SafeStory.com
 
If you are curious to see what others think, there is a link on that web site which has some customer opinions and even shows you the write-ups the book has received on Amazon.com.
 
Thank you so much for your time and if you have any questions at all, please email me or call and I would love to answer them!
 
My sincerest thanks,
Jason

P.S. Please email me at jason@jmc1.com or call me anytime. My home phone number is 401-463-2856.

Hello,
I would like to describe something that is strange for me. This
probably a bug.

Say that I use Style "main_win" RaiseTransient,  DontStackTransientParent
if I popup a transient window then it is allways on the top of
its main window (fine). However, I can use the Layer command
(on the main window or on the transient window) to raise the
main_win on the top of the transient window (fine again)

So now I use Style "main_win" RaiseTransient,  StackTransientParent
again if I popup a transient window then it is allways on the top of
its main window. But now:
I cannot change the layer of the transient window to a smaller layer
or a bigger layer: the command is rejected and the layer is set to the
main window. Is this normal?
Change of the layer of the main window work fine (without change
of the layer of the transient).
It seems to me that this is a bug and that if the user change the layer
of a window (transient or not) this should be accepted and the layer
of the other windows in the "transient" group which are mapped should
not change.
Similar problems arise with LowerTransient and StackTransientParent.

Olivier

Yes, I can load all other components of the awol theme, but fvwm2
crashes when I click on the colors component of the awol theme.

How to find out the problematic line?

By running commands line by line from themes/awol/colors in FvwmConsole? :)

Maybe this line crashes your fvwm (other colorset lines are pretty common):

*FvwmTheme: Colorset 16 fg black, bg average, \

Somehow I don't think this stack is useful, fvwm was not compiled with -g.

I believe Tim or Dominik may say more about this
"BUG: (AllocNonlinearGradient): i = 0 ..." message in libs/Graphics.c.

The stack isn't useful because the gradient logic calls abort() causing
the dump.  Check line 316, libs/Graphics.c.

Seems like the wrong thing to do to me, abort() seems pretty drastic for
a drawing logic problem.

If I try to understand it, my head might hurt.

Ok, I'm wrong, its not that hard to understand.

A gradient like this:

  YGradient 400 3 cyan4 100 cyan1 1 cyan4 100 cyan1, NoShape

would print i=0 curpixel 199 seg_end_colors[i] = 199,
the abort   has curpixel   0 seg_end_colors[i] = -2147483648

Mike, can you add this:

    fprintf(stderr,
    "nsegs %d, i %d, curpixel %d, seg_end_colors[i] = %d, npixels %d, n %d\n",
            nsegs, i, curpixel,
            seg_end_colors[i],npixels,n);

to libs/Graphics.c around line 352, just before this:

if (curpixel != seg_end_colors[i])

That might help to identify the gradient and give a clue to whats
happening.

I'be never worked with "alloca()".  Heres what Sun's man page says
about it:

     The alloca() function is machine-, compiler-,  and  most  of
     all, system-dependent. Its use is strongly discouraged.

Any chance alloca could be malfunctioning?

Gives the output:

    nsegs 3, i 0, curpixel 0, seg_end_colors[i] = -2147483648, npixels 128, n -2147483647

By the way, I tried to compile fvwm with "-O0 -g", to produce a better
readable stack as requested by Mikhael Goikhman.  But a fvwm compiled
with "-O0 -g" does *not* crash anymore when loading the awol theme!

This line only doesn't crash my FVWM. As you suggested, I did run
all the commands from themes/awol/colors line by line from FvwmConsole.
FVWM did not crash. But clicking on

   Theme management -> awol -> colors

crashes FVWM.

The number of segments and number of pixels match up with
the YGradient.

Sounds like a possible compiler bug.

Right after line 312:
      seg_end_colors[i] = (int)(color_sum + 0.5);

Add this:
      fprintf(stderr,
              "seg_end_colors %X, color_sum %f, i %d, clen[i] %d"
              " npixels %d, seg_sum %d seg_end_colors[i] %d\n",
              seg_end_colors,color_sum, i, clen[i], npixels, seg_sum,
              seg_end_colors[i]);

On my system I get:

seg_end_colors FFBEC0F8, color_sum 198.507462, i 0, clen[i] 100 npixels 400, seg_sum 201 seg_end_colors[i] 199
seg_end_colors FFBEC0F8, color_sum 200.492538, i 1, clen[i] 1 npixels 400, seg_sum 201 seg_end_colors[i] 200
seg_end_colors FFBEC0F8, color_sum 399.000000, i 2, clen[i] 100 npixels 400, seg_sum 201 seg_end_colors[i] 399
nsegs 3, i 0, curpixel 199, seg_end_colors[i] = 199, npixels 400, n 200
nsegs 3, i 1, curpixel 200, seg_end_colors[i] = 200, npixels 400, n 2
nsegs 3, i 2, curpixel 399, seg_end_colors[i] = 399, npixels 400, n 200

I think this will reveal the problem.

This one looks like a complex gradient with one segment.  I think it got
handled OK.

This doesn't look like the gradient I thought it was.
It has 3 segments, 128 colors, and 1000, 1, 1000 as its respective numbers
of colors.

It means "not a number".

I  think something is going  out of range, but I'm  not well versed in
using floating point math on computers.  Gotta do some reading.

Anyone from FvwmThemes recognize the gradient?

Off topic. You should delete ~/.fvwm/themes* to get the greeting again. :)
This is a good solution to fight the core dump, but I myself in this
situation would run (before running X) one of these:

  % fvwm-themes-config --reset
  % fvwm-themes-config --load colors@cde

Hello
It seems that MouseFocus is broken:
A window with the MouseFocus style loses the focus
only when the cursor leave this window to go to the
root window, but does not lose the focus leave the
window to go to a ClickToFocus or a window which
never receive the focus (e.g., NeverFocus style or
false input wm hints).

Previously a window under the cursor got the focus after Restart,
now there is no focused window. SloppyFocus.

Mike and I exchanged some offline mails.

I still suspect a gcc or libc bug.  I don't see anything wrong

This problem was fixed several days ago.

Sorry, currently the mail archive is more reliable than my own mail.
Next time I will first update cvs even if I don't get cvs messages. :)

Is there any other reason why 2.4 should not be released?

Sometime this week I will try to find time to rerun the Purify tests.
