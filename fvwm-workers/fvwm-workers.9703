This had me scratching my head for a while.  I copied "decor_examples"
into my .fvwm2rc and tried switching  back and forth between 2 decors.
I then noticed  that the upper-right handle  seemed  to have too  many
divisions in it, and some of the other handles were missing.

I finally tracked down the problem.  In the following function, buttons
0 thru 9 are removed:

AddToFunc	"RemoveAllButtons"
+ "I"	Style "*"	NoButton 0, NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 3, \
			NoButton 4, NoButton 5, NoButton 6, NoButton 7, \
			NoButton 8, NoButton 9

The problem is, there are only 8 buttons, 1 thru 8.

The style parsing code doesn't enforce any range  checks on either the
"button" or "nobutton" args, and random bits are flipped.

I   think  it might  be a   good  idea to  fix   the  parsing, and the
"decor_examples" file.

Thanks,

I posted a simple patch for the NoButton 0 problem a while back.  You
should be able to search for it.

Subject: Problem w/ Mouse Resources at Initialization causes X-Server Crash
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I sent out a message a few weeks ago (or was it last week), describing a
problem that I was having with the latest version (and some older versions)
of fvwm and my "beta" version of an X server that runs on the Macintosh.. 
Anyway, I sent a bug report (to the X server company -- White Pine) due to 
the severity of the problem with the X-server (it would crash the X server 
completely 99% of the time).  Anyway, I got back a response today that I 
thought I might pass along to someone here -- in hopes that it might make
sense to somebody :

======== BEGIN EXCERPT ============
The other problem you were seeing with fvwm has also been discovered
inhouse and is fixed for the final release. We duplicated the problem with
fvwm and fvwm92-2. I will download the version you mentioned and see if it's
also repeatable. 

Apparently there is a problem with fvwm that tries to relinguish resource
to the mouse pointer before it takes posession of it which is not a proper
thing to do and causes exodus to crash. Our engineers put a work around
the problem in the final release.
======== END EXCERPT ============

Does this make sense to anyone -- apparently, this doesn't bother all servers!

Anyway, I just wanted to throw this out there...

In the meantime, I read the TO-DO list carefully enought to see, that
special icon treatment there.

By now I have a patch for 2.0.45 for giving Icons specific colors on a
Decor basis.  Unfortunalty it does not default to the corresponding window
colors, but to a set of pre-defined default colors. To change this it
would be a help if the (inactive) window colors would become a Decor too.
It is basically a copy off the 'HiColor' source code.

The syntax for the .fvwm2rc is "IconColor <fore> <back> <hifore> <hiback>"
by now. Maybe it should become "IconStyle Color <fore> <back>" and 
"IconStyle HiColor <hifore> <hiback>"?

Anyway, I append my patch to be applied in the 'fvwm' directory of the
distributed version.  To make use of it you have to add the compiler flag
-DICONCOLOR.

Of course I'd like to hear your opinion.

After a quick look at the code, I found that there is no configuration
option to change cursors.  It seems that you have to change the code at
roughly line 717 of fvwm.c, in function CreateCursors (fvwm version
2.0.43).  In your case, we'd want to change the line:

Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_top_left_arrow);

to:

Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_arrow);

I'll see if I can whip up a patch for a configuration option for
cursors.  It should be pretty simple.

Hmm, before you do read the attached note from Tom Julien. The
feature might already exist, though I haven't tried it yet and I could
find no documentation for the Cursor keyword.

I'm not sure I understand the above exactly, but you can set
the cursor for the root window to be any cursor listed in
X11/cursorfont.h (drop the XC_ prefix) or an xbm image with
xsetroot.  For example, if you wanted an arrow with a SW-NE
orientation, you could add the following to your .xinitrc:

	xsetroot -cursor_name arrow

You can also do this for the different window cursors that
are used with fvwm via the Cursor command in your .fvwmrc.
For example,

	Cursor 6 2

will give you a SW-NE arrow for the cursor used in the menus.

Hope this helps.

I got excited seeing this, so I tried this right away. Sad to say, it
works for some things but not all. For example, right now I'm using
emacs to compose this note. When I move the cursor up to the pull down
menus, i get the usual cursor. When I select the menu item, It
switches to the left-handed one. FvwmButtons, FvwmPager and
FvwmIconBox all continue to use the right hand cursor. I think I would
prefer consistency to switching and a consistent LH one would be the
winner.

Does Chris's patch provide for that consistency?

Folks,

We're not talking about the Xserver's cursor (the one you can change
with xsetroot <blah, blah, blah> that you see on the "root" window.

We're talking about FVWM's cursor...the one you see if you place your
pointer on the FvwmButtons Bar, or on the title bar of an open window.

It's that little arrow-pointing-up-and-left.  
A lefty-cursor would point up-and-right, instead.

At least that's what I was referring to when I said I could use such
a feature.  (FVWM _may_ have other cursors, too, but this is the one
I thought we meant.)

It seems people are taking about all cursors, netscapes's, fvwm's and the
root window's.  

There isn't any way in fvwm2 to change any of fvwm's curors.  When I wanted a
different cursor for my title bar buttons I had to change the code in the
function CreateCursors in fvwm.c.  It would seem like a good idea, and
something twm and maybe fvwm1 do, to let the user specify the cursors to
use.o
Right now there is just a bunch of lines like:
  Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_top_left_arrow);

It should be possible to change the XC_top_left_arrow to something else.


Of course this doesn't solve the problem that fvwm's cursors don't effect
netscape, or xterm, or any other program.  So if you want to mirror all the
arrows you either have to reconfigure every program (which is easier than
it sounds because many programs would be reconfigured by changing one
resource), or change the cursor font.  Changing the cursor font is kind of
a kludge, but would be easiest.

OK, I started a lot of discussion here, but I figure the end issue is
changing the Fvwm cursors.

I just wrote a patch that adds simple cursor configurability to fvwm
with a CursorConfig command.  The patch is against 2.0.43, so it
may be slightly outdated, but it should probably patch fine.

Side note to Chuck:  could you add this, or something similar, to the
distribution?  BTW, I wrote it before I got your message with the
previous patch, so it's not based on it.  It also doesn't do a refresh
of all windows, but that might be a good thing, since you might want
windows to retain their old cursors, i.e.:

AddToFunc Foo
+ I CursorConfig title_cursor arrow
+ I Exec foo
+ I Wait foo
+ I CursorConfig title_cursor gumby

Though that might not be too useful.  Really, the two patches look
almost the same, other than that, and the fact that mine used lookup
tables as opposed to if .. else's.

I neglected to write any docs (sorry) but the syntax is:

CursorConfig <which cursor> <X11 cursor name>

where <which cursor> is one of the names in screen.h (not case
sensitive):  position, title_cursor, default, sys, move, wait, menu,
select, destroy, top, right, bottom, left, top_left, top_right,
bottom_left, or bottom_right.  <X11 cursor name> is one of the names in
<X11/cursorfont.h>, minus the "XC_".

(Patch follows signature.  Note: patch -p2 from the distribution root
is the way to go.)

fvwm1 does allow this.  Snag 1.24r, and check out the man page
and source for a start.

Yes. And for me, the end result is worth it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't apply cleanly to 2.0.45; apparently there
was some code reorganization, and 3 out of 4 hunks failed. But it was
fairly trivial to hand apply, and I updated the patch to 2.0.45
(attached). It applies to vanilla fvwm-2.0.45 using `patch
-p1'. Sorry, I didn't add any documentation, either, though.

I don't need it because I haven't thought about cursors, but it
were nice if you added an option to your patch to use default
X root window cursor for fvwm windows- our system sets normal 
lefty cursor as default on startup and it seems a bit stupid 
that fvwm uses almost same cursor as system but not right so,
it's not same one.

Off the topic cursor, still interesting:

I wrote you some words about our fvwm2 configuration system a couple
of weeks ago. We have been talking about making a de facto fvwm2 
configuration system to allow root modify settings, still alloving
users to modify whatever they want. Those files I said you could 
look at are now obsolete, I've rewritten all our system fvwm files.
It's now about 5x faster than reading M4 parsed files and overall
design is much cleaner. 

My design is simple: /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 is a shell script which 
checks if user has fvwm2 files already installed and installs defaults 
if necessary. All users have directory .fvwm2 and this directory is
created if it doesn't exist. There are following system files:
  menus: defines default menus
  key_bindings: defines default key bindings
  style_templates: defines default decor and style parameters
  styles: defines which decor and style groups to use for each window
  icons: defines icons to use with windows
  iconboxes: defines where to put all icons
  functions: defines all system default function
Users get files menus, key_bindings, styles, icons, functions and fvwmrc
to their new directory .fvwm2 from /usr/local/share/fvwm2/default. fvwm2
script is started to parse $HOME/.fvwm2/fvwmrc, which reads users own
files, and these files read by default system files. User can remove
all files and make his own $HOME/.fvwm2/fvwmrc ignoring all system
defaults, or he can read what he wants from system files and make his
own modifications in .fvwm2 files.

When making this change wanted a new feature to fvwm2. I would like
to define in Fvwm.tmpl a variable for settings files, like 
FvwmSetupDir blaablaa
We have many different unix variants with same fvwm2 setup files and
it's a dirty hack to try to use same setup files from lib dir for
system dependent libraries directory. I suggest we add a new variable
for setup files which defaults to InstallDir/share/fvwm2, whatever
InstallDir is. Maybe we should really have another variable InstallBase
and install all other directories under that, like
InstallDir /usr/local
FvwmBinDir $InstallDir/bin
FvwmDir $InstallDir/lib/fwwm2
FvwmLibDir $InstallDir/lib
FvwmSetupDir $InstallDir/share/fvwm2

As I prepare to have my module parse the .fvwm2rc file to find the IconPath
and PixmapPath settings, may I offer a suggestion:

When requesting configuration info (via Send_ConfigInfo), maybe certain well-
defined fvwm parameters get sent, as well. Such as:

* IconPath
* PixmapPath
* ModulePath

for starters, at least. These are parameters that almost *have* to be set,
anyway. Modules should know where to find the same pool of icons and pixmaps
that fvwm is already using, and while a module can look at it's own argv[0] to
find where it lives, it might want to know any other places that modules might
be hanging out.

In the meantime, I'll be parsing the dot-file...

hello:

i'd like to ask a few questions about patching fvwm and contributions

  a) how do i submit a patch? can anyone do this or do you have to be
     "empowered" or something  :)

  b) does anyone have a patch for "boxed icons" (like DTWM, 4DWm, or
     even AfterStep)? i would like this kind of behavior for my CDE
     emulator and I'm willing to patch fvwm myself, but since I'm not 
     so hot at Xlib programming, it's gonna be some work and i don't
     feel inclined to do so if it's not incorporated in the "official"
     distribution

reason for my last sentence: i made a patch to fvwm to fix the titling
badness when the window is too narrow for the title (to 2.0.43). imagine
my dismay when the patch didn't apply cleanly to 2.0.45. so i would like
that if a patch i make is actually useful to everyone, that it has a
chance of making it into the official distribution (so i don't rewrite
the damn thing when a new release of fvwm comes out)..

hello!

 here's a patch I made to borders.c which makes title clipping a bit
"neater" when the window is too narrow. It's to fvwm-2.0.45. it's
"feature" is when the window is too narrow, the title is clipped at an
intercharacter space instead of wherever it hits the edge of the title
bar.

HI! I have a patch that makes iconified fvwm windows have the NextStep 
Gradient-shaded look (and are thus 64x64 boxes). This patch applies 
cleanly to fvwm 2.0.45 and can be found by following a link from my 
homepage at: 
	http://hepserver.nhn.ou.edu/~spielman/

Chuck: If I modify this patch so it is another icon-style (GradientIcon) 
Would there be any chance that it would be accpeted to the standard 
distribution for 2.0.46? The code is clean and it is no more hack-like 
than any other part of fvwm. (Which doesn't accualy say very much)

Let me start this with explaining my silence over these last couple of
weeks (months?).  I've been super busy both at work and at home, so
I've been forced to basically ignore a lot of email concerning fvwm
(and anything else non-real-work related).

I wish to apologize - I hope no one feels slighted by this, but it has
been necessary.  I do have all of the notes archived locally and I've
been making notes about which ones I need to go back to, consider for
2.0.46, etc.  So hopefully I'll address them all eventually. :)

I did pick up this patch both the first time you posted it and again
when you brought it up again.  I looked at it briefly and it's not too
bad, but I can't guarantee that it'll make it into 2.0.46 (I have to
think about its potential impact to getting 2.1.0 out finially, which
I'd like to do so bigger fixes/changes can be made).

It (or some variant of its idea) will make it in eventually though.

I could just put it in as is right now as a compile time option, but
to do it "right" I'd like to clean things up and have that and the
titlestyle stuff (and eventually the menu code, since someone asked
for that too) all share some gradient code, which is a sizable change
that means it should really wait until after 2.1.0.

Plus, it might not be bad to add some additional code to be able to
specify a specific XPM to use as the icon bg instead of the Gradient,
a way to set the size instead of a fixed 64x64, how any border should
be drawn, how the icon title text box should look, etc.  Uh-oh - this
is begininng to sound like it should be a new config parm, IconStyle.
Well, I guess That'd fit in with this new borderstyle / titlestyle /
decor thing we have going now.  More food for thought anyways...

But, perhaps I could just put it in as a compile time option nearly
'as is' just to keep people happy for now, then fix things up later.
I'll have to think about that some more...

Taken too long to type this...back to the grind...

(Please note headers if replying. This is being sent to multiple mailing lists,

rather than this address, which is just a matter of convenience)

* * *

Version 0.1 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days. In the meantime, the beginnings of a
web page for the package resides at:

	http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm

like the package itself, this page still needs work :-). But it does include
the module manual page, a snapshot of a sample Tk-based application, and will
soon have links to download the module through CPAN sites.

This is an alpha release. Not all planned features are in, not all data
packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
style and overall functionality are still subject to drastic change before
this moves into beta.

>From the README file for 0.1:

X11::Fvwm version 0.1 (alpha 1)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with the Tk extension as your GUI library!

This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is very
highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk (which is
Tk400.202 as of this writing), also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

Hello:

I have finally finished FvwmCDE 0.1; it is a module for fvwm-2.0.45 that
duplicates as closely as possible the look-and-feel (but not
functionality, unfortunately..) of the Common Desktop Environment.

The Web page (and a screenshot) is at:

  http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/FvwmCDE/

You can also get the distribution there (860KB, which is a full source
tree of fvwm-2.045 with my minor patches, plus FvwmCDE itself). You will
also need XForms version 0.84 or 0.85 (the latter preferred) from:

  ftp://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/pub/xforms/test/

There is no documentation as of yet, but I have included a (hopefully
self-explanatory) fvwm2rc. Also, you can wreak wonders on your desktop
with FvwmCDE if you get yourself Kiwi's AfterStep icon collection. I am
using FvwmCDE currently on a 24-bit SGI workstation, and it consumes even
_less_ memory than 4Dwm, plus all Indigo Magic apps still work. And it
looks kewl  :)

Please note the following bugs:

  - startup is slow (have to work on my parser)
  - the parser is fragile; it's supposed to handle embedded pixmap
    filenames like "Net%NetscapeLogo.xpm%scape" but I haven't tested
    this yet.. however, the canonical "Netscape%NetscapeLogo.xpm%"
    works fine.. so don't try to break it!! :)
  - it crashes sometimes when minimized; I don't know if this is an
    FvwmCDE bug or an XForms bug (version 0.85 is a test version)

If there are anymore bugs, please mail me.

Thanks, and enjoy!

Hello:

 I've built FvwmCDE on IRIX 5.3 with XForms-0.85 and it bombs on startup.
So a note for those people who want to use FvwmCDE on SGI boxen: use your
stock IDO CC, _not_ GCC. I don't know what's causing this, but the
executable built with GCC always SIGSEGV's mysteriously while parsing,
while that compiled with the IDO works fine.

 Thanks (see, I already found a bug :)

hello,

 I must apologize for the slowness of the original link I gave.. people
can't bug-test if they can't download it..  :(

here's an alternate URL where you can get it:

  http://www.mozcom.com/~orly/FvwmCDE/

or the original site (ack!)

  http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/FvwmCDE/

Fri Mar 28 18:24:21 MST 1997

Version 0.2 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days.

Information, including downloading links, can be found at:

	http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm

Please note that the download links may take a day or two for CPAN sites to
receive the package from PAUSE.

This is the second alpha release. Not all planned features are in, not all
data packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
style and overall functionality are still subject to drastic change before
this moves into beta. Changes in this version are list below.

>From the README file for 0.2:

X11::Fvwm version 0.2 (alpha 2)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with the Tk extension as your GUI library!

This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is very
highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk (which is
Tk400.202 as of this writing), also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

CREDITS AND LICENSES

This package is copyright (c) 1997 by Randy Ray (randy@byz.org) and may be
distributed under terms of the Artistic License used to cover Perl itself.
See the file Artistic in the distribution of Perl 5.002 or later for details
of copy and distribution terms. All rights reserved.

>From the Changes file for 0.2:

* Changed the invocation of handlers to include a reference to the X11::Fvwm
  object as the first parameter. Otherwise, handlers have no access to the
  object unless the object is global or the handler is created as a closure.

* Removed the Tk references in Fvwm.pm, so that X11::Fvwm acts as a base
  class for the API. Fvwm/Tk.pm (X11::Fvwm::Tk) now is a subclass of X11::Fvwm
  with the new() and eventLoop() methods overloaded. Also adds one new
  instance variable and a method to access it by. This should simplify adding
  other GUI widget sets, such as Xforms.

* Put in some simple default handlers in Fvwm/Defaults.pm (package
  X11::Fvwm::Defaults), that can be used if they meet the developer's needs.
  So far, only M_ERROR seems to lend itself to such a default handling.

* X11::Fvwm, X11::Fvwm::Tk, X11::Fvwm::Defaults and PerlTkWL are all -w and -T
  clean.

* Makefile.PL now handles the demos as *.PL files, which allows them to be
  extracted by perl itself, which results in an invocation line based on
  the user's configuration of perl.  Also checks for a usable version of
  the Tk extension.

The BoxFillMethod member of the FvwmWindow structure seems to be
unused, so the related stuffs can be taken away harmlessly. (Maybe
such a cleanup should be done after 2.1.0, though.)
