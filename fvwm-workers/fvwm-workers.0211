Description:

i just tried fvwm 2.5.4.  with the following minimum custom
configuration file, FvwmPager uses near 100% CPU

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmPager * *

  DeskTopSize  2x2

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPager: *
  *FvwmPager: NoSeparators


...below is some more fvwm version info...

  fvwm 2.5.4 compiled on Nov  1 2002 at 00:34:51
  with support for: ReadLine, XPM, PNG, EWMH hints, Shape, XFT


...the "NoSeparators" option was ok in version 2.5.3.  that is, 
FvwmPager module was not using CPU excessively.

if "NoSeparators" option is not used, then the pager behaves ok.


Repeat-By:

try to use FvwmPager w/ fvwm 2.5.4 w/ above "NoSeparators" option.
hopefully, CPU usage will be close to 100%.

in addition...

  - simple kill doesn't work (to kill FvwmPager), have to send the
    KILL signal.

  - everytime i restarted fvwm, an additional pager would also
    start, w/ evenly distributed (ps(1)) %CPU statistic.

    if total of 2 pagers are spawned, %CPU would show a number
    approx. 50 for each. if total of 5 pagers are spawned (fvwm
    restarted 5 times), each process would have a number approx. 19
    for %CPU (19*5 = 95).

Okay, I have applied the patch with a few changes.

 - Fixed a core dump in fvwm.c (freed .xoff twice and never .yoff)
 - Split the Vector line parsing code into separate functions to
   reduce indentation depth.
 - For consistency with other commands and readability, the suffix
   'p' has to be added to the offset definition, for example

     10+1px10+1p@2
         ^     ^

 - More verbose description in the man page.
 - Reindented and tabified some lines.
 - Added entries in NEWS and AUTHORS.

And a note about sscanf (from the sscanf man page on my Linux
box):  when the "%n" assignment is used, this may add 1 to the
return code on some systems but nothing on others.  Hence, this
code is not portable:

  n = sscanf(s, "%d%n", &x, &offset);
  if (n != 1)
  {
    /* errror */
  }

This is a better (i.e. portable) version:

  ...
  if (n < 1)
  ...

And yes, I know that this bug was in the code before your patch.  I
just mentioned it 

Bye

I have added a new command "RestackTransients" that just collects
the transients above the parent window.  You can use FvwmAuto to
run it automatically when the parent window is entered:

  Style * RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, !StackTransientParent
  FvwmAuto 0 "Silent RestackTransients"

But there is still a problem with lowering the transient:  When
the window is lowered, the pointer enters the window that is now
on top.  If that is the parent window, FvwmAuto triggers
RestackTransients and the transient is immediately raised again.
I'm still thinking about a solution for this problem.

Bye

I really don't think this is what we need. Because you will need to pass
to this external program everything you normally pass to a module for it
to be flexible. At this point this program should be just a module.

Scripts are good when they get an input from other places like filesystem.
Not when they can't be run without fvwm giving them an input.

I am not sure what this means exactly, but this does not help Chris
McCarthy, he wants grouping not sorting.

You don't need to change any fvwm code to implement what Chris wants.
Currently a module that does this using perllib should be about 50 lines.
It will be 30 lines (mostly grouping/sorting entries by class/resource and
printing the main windowlist menu and its submenus) when automatical
trackers will be ready. I will write such module as a test case later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

As I mentioned in another thread, I've already implemented this.
I ported it to the 2.5.4 perllib, which was very straightforward.

Let me know if you want me to post it. I've included a screenshot
of the menu generated.

Is there any info online about the automatic trackers you are
implementing? 

Ric

Actually, I will need to write a lot of small modules in addition to the
current 6 in cvs to test trackers, I may use your module as a test case.

Such info is not even in my head yet. I only know that this should be
somewhat powerful and easy to use and extend. :)

Take a look at TrackerFactory.pm in cvs or ftp.fvwm.org to get some ideas.

My plan is to get some module and see how trackers may help it.
For example, your module may use 3 trackers, WindowList (with "wininfo"
and probably "icons" options), ConfigInfo and PageInfo. Other trackers
may be: Colorsets, GlobalInfo and "stack" option to the WindowList.
Nothing is final at all, even the names "tracker" and "grabber".

You are as the library user may help with ideas and design.
If you want to participate, install cvs.
Just please keep in mind that this is not my first priority for November.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Right.  All the necessary information must be passed to the
script.  This job is partially done by the module interface
already.

Actually, I see no difference between "sorting" and "grouping".

Except the menu code to allow different item text colours.

The thought of moving the WindowList functionality into a simple
script is appealing.  But I suspect that we will never be content
with the limited information that goes over the module interface.

Okay, I see one very important issue here.  On one hand we have
the wish of the users to have more control over the WindowList (or
other features).  On the other hand we have the module interface
and the perl lib.  Now, these two do not fit together very well:

 - The module interface is intended for programmers, not users.
 - You can not rely on a working perl installation.
 - Only few users can program perl scripts (not me).
 - /bin/sh and certain unix commands are available on every
   system.
 - The knowledge of writing shell scripts is much more widespread.

So, in my eyes the "perl module" approach is not for the
typical do-it-yoursef user but for developers and very experienced
users/hackers.  In addition, I won't be able to help people
implementing their perl scripts because I never learned perl (and
I don't want to because of its weird syntax).

The big question is:  how can we provide a powerful do-it-yourself
interface to the intermediate to advanced shell user?

Bye

I think it should follow the same logic as Border/NoBorder (I hope we will
have side border options: !TitleBorder, !SideBorders, !OppositeBorder).

To be honest, I would break compatibility (maybe in 3.0?) and use points
for numbers without suffix and percents for numbers with '%' suffix. I.e.:

  48  - 48 points (currently percents)
  48p - 48 points
  48% - 48 percents (currently not really supported, but it works)

I think, it is good to add support for '%' in our geometry too.

Mikhael.

Actually, the script will not be simple if it should implement all
WindowList options. Especially if this is a shell script.

I fully agree that the module interface is limited, it should be enhanced
and in some cases corrected. Still, it is pretty powerful already.

What is the script interface alternative you suggest?
Does it use 2 pipes, in and out, just like a module?

I know what you want. You want bashlib or maybe zshlib for writting fvwm
modules in sh language. Unfortunately, sh is not a programming language.
It depends on unix utilities that vary on different unices, even sed/awk.
I would like to help writting such library, but it is just impossible.
Contrary to this, you may use perl that works equally on all systems,
even on non-unix.

Writting perl is not needed any more than writting C to use FvwmButtons.

Do you agree to start to use an ancient sh instead of zsh, and non GNU
utilities (I always miss the most useful options)?

>  - The knowledge of writing shell scripts is much more widespread.

Sorry, I can't agree with this one. I am sure more people program C/C++
and Perl than sh. It is also the most ineffective and the less powerful.
I am also sure almost noone can write really portable large shell scripts,
maybe except for autoconf developers. And autoconf developers moved
to perl themselves, because text manipulation in sh is much more obscure.
Automake developers always used perl for processing Makefile.am.

It takes years to become a perl expert, I know.
But I am sure every programmer familar with the module interface may learn
the basics of Perl and OOP to start to use perllib. I am willing to
explain what test modules in tests/perl/module-* do to everyone who wants
to learn.

A solution may be to maintain a powerful module for every task with all
options users may want, so they should just choose the most suitable.
Or a user may get the code and tweak it a bit (replace sort order).

Another solution may be to enable parts of the configuration to be shell
commands (sorting function?). But it still will be a perl or C written
module that just passes the relevant input to a shell script and reads and
incorporates the output. This may be possible for very simple cases only,
and it can't be generic, because the input/output format is very specific.

Mikhael.

Full_Name: Shawn Anderson
Version: fvwm 2.5.5 (from cvs)
CVS_Date: Fri Nov  1 20:08:17 MST 2002
OS: gentoo linux gcc 3.2
X_Server: XFree86 Version 4.2.1
Submission from: (NULL) (166.70.14.106)


start fvwm with no fvwm2rc file.

1) open FvwmConsole
2) Style FvwmConsole TitleAtLeft
   or Style FvwmConsole TitleAtRight
3) Style FvwmConsole font xft:arial
   (or any other font)

after this the titlebar font is not displayed properly. Only the lower half
of the font is visible, and it sorta looks backwards.

I am using xft2, but i think this happens with xft1 also.

If you need any more info, let me know.
thanks,
sa

While renaming thing, could we say "pixels" when we mean "pixels"?
"points" is a printing measure, about 1/72nd of an inch. Since it _is_
a unit of measure, and used in font size specs (yea, even in X11 font
specs), could we avoid the word "points".

Yes, of course, I meant pixels, not points.

Unfortunately, I am unable to reproduce this problem (tried
with 2 "versions" of Xft2/XFree).

Is this problem "new"? Can you try with xft1 (do so that 
fontconfig-config is no more in your path and then ./configure;
make install) ? Any info you think which may help a little bit is
welcome.

Border and NoBorder were okay as long as the whole border was
treated as a single object.  When it gets split into four parts,
is should be Borders and NoBorders.  The struts are four separate
things by design.

I have no objections against an additional '%' suffix.  But the
problem with breaking compatibility here is that it is virtually
impossible to write a script that converts existing configs to the
new syntax.

First and foremost the module interface should be *designed* and
not just export random window information as it is needed.
Especially propagating the whole window flags structure to the
modules is a serious design flaw as it implicitly declares
internal fvwm structures as part fvwm's module interface.  I don't
like that a bit and it regulary forces me to break compatibility.

Yes, but stdin and stdout should suffice.

"shlib", actually.  I always try to avoid zsh and especially bash
specifics when writing shell scripts.

Yes.  The number of portable unix commands is quite limited.
Fortunately, the user does not have to worry about it, only people
writing scripts for public use (i.e. the fvwm developers).

Then how do I write my own sorting algorithm using perllib without
writing perl?

Sure.  See above.

Yes, sure.  But I was talking about users, not programmers.  I am
quite convinced more people are able to write something like

  $ sort -t . -k 2,2 foo  # sort by extension

than writing an equivalent perl script or C program.

Maybe from a point of resource usage, but don't forget ease of use.
(And module interface performance is horrible too.)

shell script :-)

Yes, I don't disagree here.  I am just thinking about an interface
that allows non-programmers to do useful things on their own.

I have to think more about this.  It would not be difficult to
make up an ad hoc interface that prints the available information
into stdin of a shell script, but I wonder how useful it would be.
Let's assume we can access every style flag and each member of the
window structure with

  $[windowstruct_flag.is_transient]
  $[windowstruct_member.layer]
  $[windowstyle_flag.do_start_iconic]
  ...

(I am still thinking about a good solution to do this).  And let
us ignore the problems arising by exporting the whole window
structure as an external interface.

With that, we could add a format string that generates output and
a command that processes it to the WindowList command:

  WindowList CustomSort \
    Format=`$n $w $[page.nx] $[page.ny]` \
    Command=`/bin/sh -c 'sort -t . -k 2,2 | \
     read A B C D; \
     /bin/echo \"$A\t${C}x${D}\" WindowId $w WindowListFunc'`

(Ignore all the portability issues and bugs in the command).
Fvwm would print a line according to the format for each window
and pass that as input to a script.

This must not be necessary on all systems, but it sure is on mine...
And it shouldn't mess anything up on the systems where it is not.

If configure tries to check libXft without -lXrender, the checks fail
on my system.  This patch adds -lXrender to the libs line for Xft.  It
affects three lines in configure.in.

(I'm not subscribed to this list, if you have specific questions or

I just tested FvwmProxy a bit.  I see a few problems that should
be resolved.

 1) I am not using mini icons for the windows.  Yet, the window
    proxies have some space reserved for it:

      +-------------+
      |             |
      |             |
      |    rxvt     |
      |             |
      +-------------+

    Should be

      +-------------+
      |             |
      |    rxvt     |
      |             |
      +-------------+

 2) When there are too many interfering proxies on screen,  some
    of the proxies are moved past the bottom border of the screen
    and are not visible.  Try this:

      $ xterm -geom 10x5-0-0 & xterm -geom 10x5-0-0 & \
      xterm -geom 10x5-0-0 &

 3) If the page is switched while the proxies are shown, the
    proxies are not updated.

I rewrote parts of the module to fix #3, but I'm still having
difficulties to avoid race conditions on a page change and
calculating the proxy positions.  Currently, proxy positions may
overlap on a page change.

Overall, the placement algorithm needs some work.

Bye

The question is why to require a user to write something non trivial as a
new window sorting algorithm instead of just implementing it for a user.
I.e. you (a user) request a new module option, I (maintainer) add it.
Or you add it yourself if this is just several perl lines.

I see only 2 good alternatives, adding a new option (easiest for a user)
and writting a new module (the most powerful).

Options may be configurable, not just boolean flags, see, for example,
"man FvwmIconMan | grep SortWeight".

I can't stop you from doing this. but for me this is not good. :)

  1) a lot of code is added and little is gained (as compared to modules)  
  2) this still does not do grouping (with Nop delimeters or/and submenus) 
  3) a user should spend an effort for parsing complex input in a language 
     not designed for data manipulations
  4) this is not extendible, you patched WindowList command only
  5) the format is too bound to the internal structures to give it to
     a user to parse. Note, the module library parses this for a user and
     gives him already meaningfully named structures.
  6) I think the real working example will be much more complex (even if
     we do not pass hundreds of flags, only window names)

Now, please attention, here is a complete module (will work soon when
trackers are done) that creates WindowList sorted by window class and
shows user defined fields. Try to read it like English.

	$module = new FVWM::Module;

	@windows = $module->grab('WindowList')->windows;
	@windows = sort { $a->res_class cmp $b->res_class } @windows;

	$module->send("DestroyMenu MyWindowList");
	$module->send("AddToMenu   MyWindowList"); 
	foreach $window (@windows)
	{
		$w = $window->win_id;
		$i = $window->icon_name;
		$r = $window->res_name;
		$module->send("+ '$r: $i' WindowId $w Iconify")
	}
	$module->send("Menu MyWindowList");

I don't know what may be simplier than this. You don't need to modify any
fvwm code, because module interface already supplies all the information.

And if you need to create submenus, you just first group windows
by their class, i.e. add this code after the sort line above:

	while (@windows)
	{
		@class_windows = shift @windows;
		$current_class = $class_windows[0]->res_class;
		push @class_windows, shift @windows
			while $current_class eq $windows[0]->res_class;

		# create submenu for @class_windows, like shown above
	}

Any chance you just use perl to write custom modules? :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

In this specific case, because many users want a different sorting
algorithms.

No, it's very little code.  Just one additional option with a bit
of inter process communication.  And I will extend vcariable
expansion independently of any WindowList features anyway.

Not my example, but it's trivial to enhance the script.

But the unix shell command set is exactly designed for that case:
simple filtering and text manipulation tasks.  It's not very
versatile when it comes to multiple line operations, though.

Yes, but please see is as an ad hoc example.  Once I fugre out how
to process style names via a table, the same name can be used
in various features:

   $[Style.Sticky]
   $[State.Sticky]
   Next (Sticky)
   Style foobar Sticky
   ...

Maybe you misunderstand my whole point.  It's not about if *I* can
write such a module (or shell script) or not.  And I do not doubt
that the perllib allows relatively simple access to much of the
internal window information.  My point is that very few people
are able and willing to write your example script.  So, this is
just something we could write for others but can hardly ask them
to write it themselves.  But then it would not help much to reduce
our work spent with maintenance and user support.

Applied, thanks. But do you know why the patch is needed on your
system but not on some others?

Honestly, I'm not sure.  I'm running Red Hat 7.3, I don't know if
maybe you haven't tested it there before...  I know some systems have
=2Epc files for XFT, in which case the .pc file might provide some more
information.  (I don't remember if the configure script for fvwm
looked for .pc files or not.)  Fvwm is not the first package I've had
this problem with; it's possible that many newer distributions use
strict rpaths or something, I don't know.

Sorry that was a non-answer.  :-)

Can you send me your /etc/fonts/fonts.conf file and a screenshot of a
titlebar.  Note that I can reproduce problems with pcf font displayed
with xft (no title at all with vertical titlebar). But I've no problem
with ttf or Type1 fonts.

No, its a different word:
       pallet /'palIt/ n
       1. straw-filled mattress for sleeping on.
       2. large tray or platform for moving loads (by means of slings,
       etc), eg from a lorry into a train or on to a ship, and so save
       handling of separate items.

Yep, probably before the end of the week.

BTW, I get pbs with FvwmProxy on cvs update. I get:

cvs update: in directory modules/FvwmProxy:
cvs update: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: Aucun fichier ou rpertoire de ce type
cvs server: Updating modules/FvwmProxy
cvs update: move away modules/FvwmProxy/.cvsignore; it is in the way
C modules/FvwmProxy/.cvsignore
cvs update: move away modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.1; it is in the way
C modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.1
cvs update: move away modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.c; it is in the way
C modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.c
cvs update: move away modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.h; it is in the way
C modules/FvwmProxy/FvwmProxy.h
cvs update: move away modules/FvwmProxy/Makefile.am; it is in the way
C modules/FvwmProxy/Makefile.am

But, I've no pbs with FvwmProxy compilation.
I tried to rm this directory and cvs update again, but
get the same result. Any idea?

throwing away the whole tree and checking it out from scratch
helps.

ok, i tried it with xft1 and xft2, They both give this problem.
I also tried fvwm-2.5.1 through fvwm-2.5.4, and all of these dont work
properly either. It used to work for me! I will try some more things,
and report back any findings.

attached is a screenhot of this problem.

Full_Name: Nils Goesche
Version: 2.4.12
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.16 and 2.2.19
X_Server: nvidia
Submission from: (NULL) (62.154.173.140)


I am using only a few key binding:

Mainly

Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100000 0
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100000 +0
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100000
Key Down	A	C	Scroll +0   +100000

and some others that I barely use.

I have my machine running all the time, and don't log out for weeks on end
(just lock the screen).  Every once in a while, though, fvwm loses the key
bindings!  Everything works, just not the key bindings anymore.  What's
more, restarting fvwm via the menu doesn't help -- I have to log out and
log in again (i.e. restart the fvwm process) to get back my key bindings. 
Unfortunately, I have not the slightest idea what triggers this -- but it
will always happen -- sometimes after a few hours, sometimes after a few
days, but I always lose my key bindings after a while.  Strange.

Nils

Hi!

There is some problem with FvwmButtons and transparency it used to work fine
with 2.5.3 but it's broken after that.

Previously I used to have "Pixmap none" and it worked fine... but now there
is all kinds of weirdness.. sometimes the module doesn't show up on screen
though it shows up in the output of "ps" and if I exclude it from
WindowListSkip it shows up there too.. and it moves the mouse somewhere near
the postion of the buttons if they were visible but I can't see it on screen.
(There are no invisible buttons there either, clicking there brings up the
root-menu) (Every once in a while the windows would get drawn and work
properly... but it is not replicatable!  :-)

I tried adding a colorset to see if that helps.. it helped ensure that 
the buttons appeared all the time but it caused some other weirdness .. the
buttons retain the contents/image of any window that was moved over it as the
background instead of being transparent.

This is the colorset definition I'm using.

Colorset 6 Plain, NoShape,  Transparent

Any tips/suggestions ? or more details needed ?

Kingsly

This happens, because you removed modules/FvwmProxy/CVS/ directory.
Here is a correct way to recreate such subdirectory:

  rm -r FvwmProxy
  cvs update -d FvwmProxy

Or just "cvs update FvwmProxy" if you have a good ~/.cvsrc.

Regards,
Mikhael.

In the FAQ, question 0.1:

.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse
     bindings stop working.  What can I do?

A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See
   Q 5.5 for more details.

I think its getting better.

I still need to do more work on the wording.

The formulas are really hard for the average user to understand.
For example:

fvwm can use any color cube of the form RxGxB with 2 <= R <= 6, R = G,
R-1 =< B <= R and B >= 2.

I think they might be better expressed in words, or works and
the formula.

Its still hard to figure out which option to use.

Is it possible to associate each option with QT, GTK, gradients,
plain old X applications?  It says QT and GTK use cubes, but
it doesn't say which cube.

Can you send me your FvwmButtons config (the one with "Pixmap none")
with the icons you use if possible.

hello,
I was messing around with Fft.c and I kind of fixed my problem.
I'm sure this isn't the proper fix, because the text is still
upside down (style * TitleAtRight, RightTitleRotatedCCW is
doing what RightTitleRotatedCW is supposed to do.) and the
text is still not aligned properly by one or two pixels when 
there is no shadow defined...

Doh!  That might well be it, I use the num pad quite often.  Thanks

configure fails to use -R/opt/sfw/lib even though
"--with-imlib-prefix=/opt/sfw/lib" is specified on Solaris 9, so the IMLIB
test fails.

I'm using gcc 2.95.3 on a Sun Ultra 10 with Solaris 9.

yesterday, but it never arrived to the list :-(.

I tried fvwm-2.5.1 to fvwm-2.5.4 and th xft1 and 2, they all have

If I apply the patch the text is not displayed well at all on my
machine.  Maybe there is a problem with freetype2.  What is the
version of freetype2 do you use?  (package version and freetype-config
--version which is different from the package version).  A typical pb
with freetype2 is that it is possible that your system has 2 freetype2
libs installed (one from XFree and the other one from a freetype2
package ...).

Also, Xft2/fontconfig is a recent library. I suggest you use the
latest version of this package (http://fontconfig.org). You say you
have pbs with Xft1. But which version of Xft1 do you use? There
is two Xft 1 library :o/ the one from XFree-4.2.x and the one from
fcpackage.

Finally, do you use a multi-head X setup?

"prefix" means the imlib installation prefix, not the library directory.

Try:

  --with-imlib-prefix=/opt/sfw

And please ensure you have a good $imlib_prefix/bin/imlib-config script.

Mikhael.

I'm jealous, I've yet to find any version of imlib that will build
on a Solaris system.  I could ask my admins to install the /opt/sfw
stuff, but what fun would that be.

Oh yeah, I had a point.
None of these "xxxx-config" things work correctly in Solaris.
I've modified them to add the -R flag where needed.  For example,
gtk-config:

glib_libs="-L/opt/public/lib -R/opt/public/lib -lgmodule -lglib -ldl"
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and so on.

X was built with this in my host.def.

#define UseFreetype2           YES

/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.3.1

hmm, so I have three versions?  9.1.3, 2.1.2 and 6.3.1 interesting.

I just reinstalled my linux distribution (yesterday), So right now
I just have the xft1 from xfree86 4.2.1. In my previous installation,
I didnt try xft1 from fcpackage, but i did try xft2 from it.
(fcpackage.2_0).

I'll let you know if I figure out anything.

Ok, this is the problem. It seems that there are changes in
freetype which cause the pbs. fvwm is ok with 2.1.0 but not
with 2.1.2 (do not try yet 2.1.1). Now we should know if
this a bug or a new feature of 2.1.2. Any way I will fix the
problem in the next few days.

Hi Mikhael

I've added optional page and desk-level resolution and some
documentation to the script. I've attached it here.

As far as I understand it the trackers will make most of the stuff
I've done in handlers redundant. Is that correct?

Will do this later.

Ditto on November :-)  But I'll take a look when I get a bit of time.


A bug in my script ... sticky windows are only listed on the desk
where they originated (were made sticky). This is not a problem
when changing page, as there seems to be a M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet
sent for each window in that case and I set the desk from that handler.
But these packets are not send for a change desk event. Why is that?
I could probably get round this by doing a Send_Windowlist when
M_NEW_DESK is caught, but that seems clunky :-)

=head1 AUTHOR

  Ric Lister <http://cns.georgetown.edu/~ric/>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Substitute for fvwm builtin WindowList, but written in Perl
  and easy to customize. Unlike FvwmIconMan or FvwmWinlist the
  module does not draw its own window, but instead creates a
  fvwm menu and asks fvwm to pop it up.

  By defining a set of regular expressions in @show, windows may
  be sorted into sections based on the regexp matching their
  title.

  Similarly, matches in @dontshow will be excluded from the list.

  Any windows not matching an element of @show or @dontshow will
  be placed in the last section of the menu.

=head1 USAGE

  Place this in e.g. your .fvwm2rc StartFunction
    
    Module FvwmLister

  Invoke the menu from .fvwmrc like this, for example:
    
    Key Menu A N SendToModule FvwmLister Root c c

  The arguments are any valid Menu arguments.

  Set module options, e.g.:

    *FvwmLister: Show ^Galeon|^Netscape
    *FvwmLister: Show ^emacs

  will define two sections containing respectively browsers, and emacs.
  Number of sections is unlimited. The strings are perl regular
  expressions that will be evaluated in m// context. See perlre(1).

  Similarly:

    *FvwmLister: DontShow ^Fvwm
    *FvwmLister: DontShow ^gkrellm

  will cause the menu to ignore windows with title beginning Fvwm or
  gkrellm.

  Other options:
    
    *FvwmLister: OnlyIconic {on|off}    ## show only iconified windows
    *FvwmLister: MiniIcon {0|1|2}       ## show mini icon: 0=never,
                                        ## 1=always, 2=icon windows only
    *FvwmLister: AllDesks {on|off}      ## show windows from all desks
    *FvwmLister: AllPages {on|off}      ## show windows from all pages
    *FvwmLister: ShowPosition {on|off}  ## show window position in ()
    *FvwmLister: Maxlen 32              ## max length in chars of entry
    *FvwmLister: Menu foobar            ## name of menu to popup
    *FvwmLister: MenuStyle foobarstyle  ## name of MenuStyle to apply
    *FvwmLister: Debug {-1,0,1,...}     ## level of debug info output

I am thinking about an incompatible change in the Next and Prev
commands.  The other conditional commands that start looking for a
new window from the currently focused window already work this
way:

 - When the conditional command is run without a context window,
   it takes the focus window as a reference point.
 - If it is run with a context window, that is used instead of
   the focus window.

This allows many wonderful things, for example:

  Next Next Focus
  WindowId ... Next Focus

but breaks certain setups.  It might affect actions bound to a
window menu item (although I can't think of anything that would
require running Next or Prev) and nested complex functions:

  AddToFunc foo
  + I Next bar

  AddToFunc bar
  + I echo $w
  + I Next echo $w

I need this especially in FvwmProxy to to keep its own idea of a
selected window and to run some conditional commands on it.  This
is a hypothetical FvwmProxy setup I have in mind:

  Key Tab A M circulate_proxy_window Next
  Key Tab A SM circulate_proxy_window Prev

  AddToFunc circulate_proxy_window
  + I SendToModule FvwmProxy $0 (CurrentPage) select_proxy_window

  AddToFunc select_proxy_window
  + I SendToModule FvwmProxy Select $w

It should work like this:

 - User presses Alt-Tab.
 - Fvwm sends "Next (CurrentPage) select_proxy_window" to
   FvwmProxy.
 - FvwmProxy sets the context window and passes the string back
   to fvwm.
 - Fvwm runs the command and replies with "Select <new window id>"
 - FvwmProxy selects the given window.

Sometimes after a page change, the decorations of one of my
windows are not drawn.  I have observer this several times with a
normal window (the decorations are just transparent until they are
redrawn) and a window with "HandleWidth 1, NoTitle" (thin white
border around the window).  The windows were not new windows and
had been drawn properly before.

As the decorations are drawn into the window background X should
draw them automatically without help from fvwm.  I can think of
two explanations:

 1) Fvwm sets a "None" background pixmap somewhere but does not
    draw the boder afterwards.
 2) The X server runs out of memory, kicks out the backgorund
    pixmap and generates an Expose event.  I believe that can not
    happen, but I am not entirely sure.

Please, everybody, keep your eyes open for this problem in the
latest snapshots and try to find a reliable way to reproduce it.

If a non-resizable JDialog is created, the dialog becomes super huge (32000
x 32000 pixels).  If the JDialog is made resizable the problem goes away.

This problem occurs on our boot CD running linux at 640x480 resolution.

Sample Code:

import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.EmptyBorder;
import java.awt.BorderLayout;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.io.*;

public class FVWMDbg extends JDialog
{
   public FVWMDbg(JFrame f)
   {
      super(f, "Title", true);
      this.getContentPane().add(new JButton("Hello World!"));
      this.setResizable(false);
      this.pack();
   }

   public static void main(String argv[])
   {
      JFrame f = new JFrame();
      FVWMDbg r = new FVWMDbg(f);
      f.setSize(200,200);
      f.setVisible(true);
      r.setVisible(true);

Nice, it is already pretty configurable. I see several possible
enhancements, not urgent though. And it is persistent. I thought
more about a transient module (yes, slower), this may be an option.

FvwmLister is a really good name for me, but maybe FvwmWindowLister?
You would probably prefer FvwmRichardLister, but this is close enough. :)

I will also reformat it to be more like FvwmPerl.

Yes, in theory your module will not need to handle any of your current 13
fvwm events itself, except for M_STRING commands. It will just load 3
trackers instead. In practive, for now M_ICONIFY/M_DEICONIFY will be
needed too until perllib may reliably parse window flags (Sticky/Iconic)
given in M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW.

There will be a lot of decisions to make for trackers and you may help.
Just to give you another idea. A user may implement his own trackers.
For example, "ColorsetForcer", something that verifies that bg of Colorset
5 is always "green" or synchronizes 2 colorsets when one is changed.
Another example may be "VisibleWindows" that forces windows to never be
fully off the screen. Then a user may reuse these user defined trackers
in his numerous modules by adding this (only the first line is needed):

  my $tracker = $module->track("VisibleWindows", offset => 10);
  print "Recovered old window: $_\n" foreach $tracker->recovered;
  $tracker->trap(sub { print "Recovered new window: $_[0]\n"; });

Or a one time tracker that recovers the lost windows only once:

  my $grabber = $module->grab("VisibleWindows", offset => 10);
  print "Recovered old window: $_\n" foreach $grabber->recovered;

As you see, this implementation not only recovers windows internally (by
sending Move commands), but also optionally reports about such windows.
The problem is to decide what is the synchronous part (when these calls
return) and what is asynchronous. This is individual for every tracker.
There is no any problem if different trackers or a user himself decide to
listen to the same packets. Trackers are fully transparent for a user,
they just do their work (in your case they automatically collect an info).

I have no debts that M_NEW_PAGE / M_NEW_DESK are inconsistent and pretty
unusable sometimes. The sooner we unite these to one M_NEW_DESK_PAGE the
better. A side note, the PageInfo tracker API will probably not be changed
when such packet change happens, just its internal implementation.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I originally coded it as transient, and that was acceptably
fast on a 600MHz PIII. I never tried it on a really slow machine.
Persistent just seemed a neater solution for some reason, maybe because
I use the menu all the time as an alternative to using up screen
space on iconman or icons. The nice thing about using a fvwm menu
is the automatic keybindings, so I do Menu G to find my galeon
windows, for example.

Yeah, it was just a play on my name :-) It might be nice to name it
something like FvwmPerlWinList or something very descriptive.
FvwmWindowLister is too similar to FvwmWinList.

Fine.

This seems very cool. I'll take a look at the stuff in CVS in a
couple of days and see if I have any useful input for you.

Log message:
* Preserve the matrix when rotating Xft fonts
* Use a more perfectioned method for loading font with Xft/Fc. This
method allows some sanity checks.
* Move the computation of the good "y" for drawing text into Flocale.
* Use the "max" ascent, descent and height for font metric (in the place
of the "min" one's). This allows text as p to be not drawn out of
its "box" with certain fonts
* New option "Locale" to PrintInfo Command for informations on the
locale and the font (not yet totally finished).
* The doc for this option

The following menu double-click-action worked in 2.5.0 but stopped
working with upgrade to 2.5.4:

  DestroyFunc Terminal
  AddToFunc   Terminal
    + I Exec exec xterm $*

  Key Super_R  A N  Menu Hosts-Popup Root c c Function Terminal

The menu is fine otherwise.

Thanks

FvwmPager crashes when the  number of  windows is superior to  127,
when switching depth desks.

to reproduce, open a pager like this one :
+               "pager 0 3"  Module  FvwmPager 0 3 

open 128 windows, and switch from desks.
the pager will crash.

(yeah, i'm using that much windows)

I can comfirm the problem.  I probably will not fix it before the
big menu code rewrite I am planning.

I don't know. Maybe practically such change will be almost invisible.
But then Next can't be used for anything relable. I.e. to have something
relable one should use either one or another form instead of "Next":

  NoWindow Next    # relatively to the focussed window (the current Next)
  ThisWindow Next  # relatively to the context window if any
  Current Next     # just as unrelable as the proposed Next

Maybe just to have 2 Next commands, so that a single command would be
needed instead of a prefixed command? I.e. introduce ThisNext (or maybe
NextWindow) that like ThisWindow does nothing if there is no context.
I don't say "no", I just try to think.

A simplier example would be any Next in root menu and that root menu bound
to WTSF contexts. Such menu would work a bit differently that it is now.
With NeverFocus or ClickToFocus windows. In the end I don't much care if
there is a way to force one or another meaning (using prefixes).

Mikhael.

Is there a specific reason why almost nothing in the utils
directory is being installed or even distributed anymore?
Specifically, I see no reason to exclude

  build_dev.sh
  configure_dev.sh
  rebuild_dev.sh

form the distribution (not sure if they ever were in there).  And
the man page references the scripts

  fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh
  fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh

as an example for dynamic menu actions (which was the only reason
they were written - not the functionality they provide).  They
should both be distributed and installed, regardless of any
feelings whether shell or perl scripts are the "right thing".

Did you ever notice that "Direction" already works this way?  It
*is* reliable because nobody ever thinks of using it outside a
window context.  I am hoping for the same with Next/Prev.

I thought about that too, but on one hand it looks like a silly
thing to do as other commands have proven to work well with the
new logic.  And on the other hand it duplicated code and
maintenance work for no good reason.  Of course it is a dangerous
thing to do.

I still can not think of a reason why one should have this in a
root or window menu (or any other menu).

Some time ago I divided it to 2 directories, installed and uninstalled.
Only scripts in bin/ are installed and they all have consistent names.

I think you simply forgot to add them to DIST when added these scripts.
I never felt a need to include them, because they are mostly for cvs
users anyway.

The right thing here is to include them into distribution since they are
referenced from the man page. But I don't think anything that is currently
in utils/ should be installed, if you feel differently, move it to bin/.

Actually, if the only reason is to give an example as you correctly
pointed, they should not be installed to /usr/bin (or similar $bindir).
1) They may be be distributed and a link in the man page to
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/utils/ may be given.
2) Or they may be installed to $docdir (I hope to add it later anyway)
together with README, INSTALL.fvwm etc.. Currently this may be $datadir.

If any of this is a good solution to you, they should not be in bin/,
but in utils/.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Theoretically yes, but they should still be installed for
backward compatibility.  People may rely on the being installed.
(But I'm not sure wheter they were installed in previous
versions).

Well, it's all just theory unless we try it out.  I will commit a
patch.

One related thing I do not understand from the top of my head.
The following commands generate the following output:

  next echo $w
  next next echo $w
  next next echo $$w
  next next echo $$$$$w

    [FVWM][Echo]: 0x1a00020

  next next echo $$$w
  next next echo $$$$w
  next next echo $$$$$$w

    [FVWM][Echo]: 0xa00002

  next next echo $$$$$$$w

    [FVWM][Echo]: $w

This is what I would have expected:

  fid = first window id
  sid = second window id
  -> = "expands/evaluates to"

  next echo $w -> 0xfid
  next next echo $w -> next echo 0xfid -> 0xfid
  next next echo $$w -> next echo $w -> 0xsid
  next next echo $$$w -> next echo $0xfid -> 0xfid
  next next echo $$$$w -> next echo $$w -> $w
  next next echo $$$$$w -> next echo $$0xfid -> $0xfid
  next next echo $$$$$$w -> next echo $$$w -> $0xsid
  next next echo $$$$$$$w -> next echo $$$0xfid -> $0xfid

Sigh, the mysteries of parameter expansion.

I don't think they were ever installed, maybe during several days between
2.3.1 and 2.3.2:

Sun May  9 02:43:02 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* utils/Makefile.am: don't install fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh until
	we have some consensus on _where_ to put it.

They are not distributed since 2.3.7, I think.

As for me, I prefer simply to give an url. Run for example:

  fvwm-perllib man tutorial

There is a link to test modules. they are not even distributed,
although it is pretty difficult to learn perllib without them.

Regards,
Mikhael.

if you want to use the RPM, you need to install:

readline2.2.1-2.2.1-4.i386.rpm (from RedHat 7.3, for example)

(i.e. a readline package including libreadline.so.3)

and find a libstroke package. you can have a look here:

http://speakeasy.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/cooker/contrib/RPMS/libstroke0-0.=
5.1-2mdk.i586.html

good luck !

regards,
Giuseppe.

I must have missed it back then.  Personally, I see no problem
installing them in bindir.

I am not sure this is a wise decision.  Not everyone has net
internet access.  As they seem to serve documentation purposes
only, they should be installed somewhere in docdir.

I see a serious problem in doing this. It is one thing to give an example
of creating user's menus and another to suggest a user to use these
scripts and rely on them later. Do you want quantity or quality?
Maybe we should in addition install into everyone's /usr/bin a C version
and an awk version that do opendir and print all files, just to show that
users may do it in these languages too?

No, we need to support one very configurable script, so most of the users
would just use it and not think about recreating such script themselves.
Let's do what we agreed to, distribute and possible install to docdir.

Maybe later I will see good reasons to distribute these files. Nowadays
every programmer has an internet, at least a web.

Well, I think we will never agree on this.  My foremost goal is
portability.  I just can't make myself to see "internet access"
and perl as being available everywhere all the time.  People are
struggling with routing, dial in problems and dead links every
day.

If you think it bloats the tarball and the installation we can
make another cvs module "fvwm-docs" that contains the supporting
documentation.

Sorry for the delay. Yes the formula sentence is horrible.  Maybe a
list of color limit should be given: 2, 4, 8 (regular grey), 9 (2x2x2
cc + 1 grey), 2x (3x3x3 cc plus x grey level), 61 (the "visual"
palette), 71 (4x4x4 cc + 13 grey levels, current XFree cvs default),
13x (5x5x5 + x grey), 216 (6x6x6 cc) and 244 (6x6x6 + 28 grey,
XFree-4.2.x default).

I think the only solution is: try it and/or ask advice to the
fvwm mailing list.

Yes maybe I will try to write something.

GTK and QT apps which allows color limitation can use any color cube
of the form "RxGxB with 2 <= R <= 6, R = G, > R-1 =< B <= R and B >=
2".

My point is very clear. If you think fvwm-menu-directory is not portable,
you may rewrite it using sh or C. You may even use the same man page
as available now. But I don't think installing anything else into bindir
that is much less configurable and without documentation is a good thing.
I wrote some rules that I would like we follow for files installed into
every user's /usr/bin (or similar). These scripts fail on all rules.

For me perl in 2002 is a standard unix tool just like awk was in 1990.
I don't remember any report saying a user can't use fvwm-menu-* scripts
or even fvwm-themes because they don't have perl. So this is a non issue.

The programming language is not important for me as long as the mainainer
agrees to maintain its script for a long time (that is I am ready to).
The functionality and configurability is what is important to me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

To keep quality and consistency I follow these rules for our files
installed into bindir. I would like others to follow them too.

1) We have a special bin/ subdirectory for programs installed to bindir.

2) We don't install any program to bindir that does not have a man page.

3) We don't install any program to bindir without --help and --version.

4) The programs in the system's bindir should not have any extension.

   Extensions like .sh or .pl are good for files without +x permissions
   so that a user could know what interpretter to run on these files.
   Additional reasoning:
   My /usr/bin has 2002 files. From 280 sh/bash scripts only 11 are *.sh.

5) The programs should have the "fvwm-" prefix for consistency.

   Additional reasoning:
   My /usr/bin has 242 files in the dash form like "gnome-bug" and 
   and only 95 files in the underscore form like "pg_dump".

I think many projects follow these rules. They lead to a better user
experience.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, I find a menu to be very useful too. I usually don't use FvwmIconMan
even though I tried to use it, I find pager to be very useful and if there
are a lot of windows WindowList with SortByClass may help to identify them
quickly if you use good mini icons.

Hmm...

I returned to this message to say that I added the module and discovered
that I somehow missed anything except for the first page of this message.
I had a slow internet connection when I first read this message.

So, what should we do now when I coded it everywhere as FvwmWindowLister?
For me this name hints that it is a transient listing, so it's a good name.

At least here I guessed your answer correctly. :)

Ok, I did a lot of small changes, every change has its reason, take a look.

The module still misses some configurability like sorting, automatical
grouping, submenus, configurable format, class/resource/name resolution).
But it is a good start to test future trackers.

On the fvwm home page there is a section for example buttons where you can
contribute button examples.
So I made an example using the new pixel offset feature:

--------------------------------------------------------------

This features a big square that's fixed 3 pixels from edge of the button
(button 2), a small square centred and 4 by 4 pixels, and a bar vertically
centred 4 pixels thick and filling the space horisontally with a 3 pixel
space on each side.

Ofcourse this requires the latest CVS version for this to work, so perhaps
it's not yet ready for the web...

This patch creates a number of compiler warnings when not
compiling with Xft.  For example, the FftPatternGetMatrix() has a
return code that is hard coded to 0 in the .h file.  gcc complains
about a "warning: statement with no effect".  I have comitted a
quick patch to suppress the warning.  But all function calls that
have a return code should *really* check it and react
appropriately.  Even if it's just something like

  if (!FftPatternAddMatrix(...))
  {
    /* ignore error */
  }

I think those two options should either be removed or just change
if gnome/ewmh hints are used by default.  Opinions?

I am going to rename a number of styles and commands that were
introduced in 2.5.  These are the general rules I follow when
renaming, removing changing features:

  
  Features that were in any stable release:

    - Must be kept for compatibility if possible at all.

  Features that are new to the current development series:

    - Can be changed, removed or renamed without mentioning it in
      the documentation.
      [Reason:  otherwise, development would become too difficult
      and the documentation confusing]
    - Such a change should be mentioned on the mailing list.
    - The change is documented in the ChangeLog.
    - Any entries in the NEWS about the feature are rewritten so
      that it looks like the feature was originally written in the
      new form.
      [Reason:  The NEWS finally becomes the ANNOUNCE for the next
      stable release.  The risk of posting incorrect information
      is too high.  The NEWS should reflect the current state, not
      document the changes (use ChangeLog).]

A bit off topic:  a rule of thumb for new features:

  - *Every* new keyword (command name, style name, option of a
    command etc.) must appear in the NEWS.

This is the list of changes I am going to make:

  Commands

    EWMHBaseStrut -> EWMHBaseStruts

      There are always four struts, hence the plural.

    DesktopName -> DeskName

      Some commands use "desk" and other "desktop".  This should be
      cleaned up for 3.0, but not now.

  Styles

    Border -> Borders

      For future extensions treating all the borders separately.

    NoBorder -> remove

      I do not use negative style names anymore.  In the future, I
      intend to remove them all and replace them with !stylename.


    PlacementOverlapPenalties -> MinOverlapPlacementPenalties
    PlacementOverlapPercentPenalties
    -> MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties

      For consistency with the placement style names.

Bye

And "-h", "-?" and "-V" please.  In the long run I would like to

Although I don't see rule 5 as mandatory, it is still better to
follow some rules than to let chaos reign.  One should also point
out that only programs should be installed into bindir that are
useful when they are exectued from a command line.  Programs that
do not fulfill this criterion belong into libexecdir.

This is what I think it should look like for the current programs:

And while we are defining rules, I think every new script or
program should follow the GNU coding standards with respect to
handling and naming command line options, default options and the
output of the -V/--version option.  We can save a lot of trouble
by using getopt_long() (yes, I know it's not portable - we need
the getopt source file in the distribution).  I even have a nice
template for option parsing with getopt.

P.S.:  I have just removed all the "-blabla" options from
fvwm-root.  They were all introduced after 2.5.0 and can thus be
removed without notice before 2.6.

I am going to rename a number of styles and commands that were
introduced in 2.5.  These are the general rules I follow when
renaming, removing changing features:

  
  Features that were in any stable release:

    - Must be kept for compatibility if possible at all.

  Features that are new to the current development series:

    - Can be changed, removed or renamed without mentioning it in
      the documentation.
      [Reason:  otherwise, development would become too difficult
      and the documentation confusing]
    - Such a change should be mentioned on the mailing list.
    - The change is documented in the ChangeLog.
    - Any entries in the NEWS about the feature are rewritten so
      that it looks like the feature was originally written in the
      new form.
      [Reason:  The NEWS finally becomes the ANNOUNCE for the next
      stable release.  The risk of posting incorrect information
      is too high.  The NEWS should reflect the current state, not
      document the changes (use ChangeLog).]

A bit off topic:  a rule of thumb for new features:

  - *Every* new keyword (command name, style name, option of a
    command etc.) must appear in the NEWS.

This is the list of changes I am going to make:

  Commands

    EWMHBaseStrut -> EWMHBaseStruts

      There are always four struts, hence the plural.

    DesktopName -> DeskName

      Some commands use "desk" and other "desktop".  This should be
      cleaned up for 3.0, but not now.

  Styles

    Border -> Borders

      For future extensions treating all the borders separately.

    NoBorder -> remove

      I do not use negative style names anymore.  In the future, I
      intend to remove them all and replace them with !stylename.


    PlacementOverlapPenalties -> MinOverlapPlacementPenalties
    PlacementOverlapPercentPenalties
    -> MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties

      For consistency with the placement style names.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Can I ask you not to rename it?

  1) We have DesktopSize command, DesktopName is just a complement
  2) EWMH uses the DESKTOP_NAME concept and atom name IIRC
  3) We advertise (at least I) the DesktopName command since 2.5.0
  4) I really hoped to use this command in fvwm-themes, now I will not be
     able for some time, because 2.5.4 uses DesktopName and not DeskName

Regards,
Mikhael.

The simple solution would be to use both names.

I think -V is a historical casus and it should better be -v, but let it
be -V... But not -?, it is not even inputable in many shells, should be
escaped as -\?.

I am not sure where did you get such crazy idea. :))

libexecdir is for loadable modules, it is specifically designed _not_ to
be in $PATH, because it is hardcoded into the main executable and used when
a module is loaded.

All of the scripts above are designed to be run from the command line and
to be in $PATH. Actually, fvwm-perllib _must_ be in $PATH otherwise no
user modules in perl, at least the ones that do not harcode anything, will
work (ok, they may use fvwm-config instead, but they don't). I am not
speaking about reading man pages like "fvwm-perllib man".

All of fvwm-menu-* scripts are a standard way in fvwm starting from 2.4.0
to achieve four different tasks, like providing the KDE/GNOME integration
support, building all kinds of directory and web headlines menus and
designed to work under PipeRead, so they should be in $PATH.

I think it is a good opportunity to remove quantize_pixmaps and xselection
all together. In any case they should not be installed into bindir, so
should not be in bin/.

Actually supporting the -version form would not harm. I saw many shell
scripts do it, for example our own autogenerated ./configure. Before you
removed it, most (if not all) our bindir programs supported both variants.
But this is not very important.

Nah, I'll just describe what it needs.

Reminds me, I think I have a screenshot in my inbox too.

Lets see, stain some furniture or write some web stuff...

See my other thread.  We won't get it consistent right now without
duplicating the names, so this has to wait until the big 3.0
interface clean up.

As far as I know, -v is traditionally reserved for --verbose and
-V for --version.  I'll look that up.

Well. personally I've never even thought of using -?, but it was
an old standard variant of -h that is preferredly used today.
Anyway, I agree with Dan that every unknow option should print the
usage message.

Yes, they are run from the command line, but it makes no sense to
run them outside fvwm context.  I guess one could fight lengthy
flame wars about the question if that qualifies them for bindir
or the "pure" path via fvwm-config/libexecdir should be taken.

Whatever, I'll shut up now, especially I really couldn't care less
what gets installed where.  My only concern here is not breaking
things that worked in the past.

No, it doesn't hurt, but on the other hand they *will* be removed
*everywhere* in 3.0.  So, if we don't add them now, we have one
tool less to worry about later.

Actually, the offset patch gets problematic when the window gets
very small.  I don't know what to do about it, though.

Yes. Actually I only thought about the "static" size of the buttons
(determined by font size typically) and didn't think about the fact that
buttons can shrink horizontally. Maybe there could be an option to set the
minimum size of windows so that the buttons "fits" (mwm does something
like this, I tried and I could make an xterm less than 32 pixels wide
there. This might be hardcoded though...)
A problem could be that buttons can be added/removed dynamically.

As the return code was not used and my compiler did not complaint I
was lazy to add the definition of the type of the return code.

I beg to differ here. Well, not entirely, but slightly.

My personal opinion is that a program should _always_ emit the usage
listing if it gets a bad option. The GNU behaviour of "bad option, tell
them to run with --help" enrages me. It is only sensible for programs
with very many options; most programs' usage listing will happily fit
on a single 24 lines screen.

With that preamble, in my shells I expect to be able to go

	foo -?

to most programs and get a usage message _because_ -? is not a valid
option. And I insist on my shells letting me type an unescaped -?,
and take care not to make stupidly named -* files.

So, what's I'm asking here is that:
	- whether you implement an actual -? option doesn't
	  bug me, provided that _any_ bad option elicits the
	  full usage string
	- if you do implement -?, I request that it definitely
	  emits a usage message

Besides, on most keyboards "-" doesn't need shift, and "_" does.

Third, I propose prompt action on legislation extending and reforming the
state's asset seizure law. The current law, which is a valuable tool for law
enforcement in its fight against drug criminals, is set to expire on January
1st. This law provides over $30 million a year to law enforcement agencies,
and should be quickly renewed.	- Kathy Brown

In focus,c

change:	if (!FP_IS_LENIENT(FW_FOCUS_POLICY(fw)) && !focus_does_accept_input_focus(fw) &&  sf != NULL && sf->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk)

to:	if (!FP_IS_LENIENT(FW_FOCUS_POLICY(fw)) && !focus_does_accept_input_focus(fw) && (sf == NULL || sf->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk))

Turns out theres a problem new to 2.5.4 (w or w/o my above fix) that didnt exist in 2.5.3.

xview secondary selections cause focus to change.

Bring up 2 xview (eg textedit) windows (1 and 2).
Type some text in window 2.
Click into window 1.
Hold down Paste (L8) and select some text from window 2.
Release Paste key,
Selected text will get copied to window 1..
Window 1 should keep focus (which 2.5.3 does).
In 2.5.4, window 2 gets focus upon release.

I have a textk app that also allows 2ndary edits.
It's also seeing a switching of focus i believe between key_down and
key_up.

You know, zsh and tcsh by default give you an error on unescaped -?.

It is good that you said GNU tells to print 2 lines only in this case,
so I don't need to add more than several paragraphs of reasonings. :)

I am against dumping the whole usage (that is usually more than 24 lines
since all my programs are very configurable) every time a user makes a
typo. A user wants to see that "option -X is not supported", he does not
need to go several screens up to determine whether this option means
"show usage" or it is unrecognized or maybe needs an additional argument.
The only correct way to handle a bad option is to print 2 lines:

  program: unrecognized option '-o'   (or: missing file argument after -o)
  Run --help to get the list of all recognized options.

A user knows what he does if he specified -o option, he wants the result
now. Or to see the diagnostic error line to know what he did wrong. He is
not interested in anything forced like copyright/license/--version/--help.
(In fact, IMHO the only place for copyrights is the man page and sources.)

And I would prefer these two lines to be dumped to stderr like gcc does it
and not stdout like gnome-terminal does it. Because stdout should contain
the result of the program's run designed to be parsable/piped, an error
option should not damage the expectations of the following piped program.
It is ok for me that --help is dumped to stdout like GNU says, because in
this case the usage screens are the output of the program, i.e. parsable.

> 	- if you do implement -?, I request that it definitely
> 	  emits a usage message

I will add the -? alias to all my scripts for everyone to be happy. :)
It's a matter of adding 2 characters "|?" to a perl script or a module.

In any case, I would not blindly follow all GNU "standards", only the
reasonable ones. Even GNU projects do not follow all of them.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fixed.  The problem occured after a recapture and possibly a
restart (I did not try with restart).

The proper solution - in my eyes - is to print the
"unknown option xyz" message *after* the usage message.  If the
verbose message is too long it should omit the lengthy
explanation.  And of course only the one letter options belong
into the usage line.  For example:

  $ foobar -z
  usage: foobar [-a] [-b] [-c] ... [-x] [-y]   <- one to two lines
  foobar: unknown option -z
  1 $ <-- return code 1

and

  $ foobar --help
  usage: foobar [-a] [-b] [-c] ... [-x] [-y]   <- many lines
    -a: explanation of option a
    -b: explanation of option b
    ...
    -x: explanation of option x
    -y: explanation of option y
  0 $ <-- return code 0

I think this is a good solution in between.  I have committed a
patch that cleans up the chaos in the fvwm executable and the man
page and uses this style.  Take a look and tell me what you think.
Try "fvwm -x" and "fvwm --help".

Neither would I.  But standardizing option names and usage
messages is one of the useful things.

The man page mentions an option --visual-palette which does not
exist.  On the other hand there is an undocumented option
--named-palette.

Hey, careful!  One more work and I'll rename the executable to
fvwm.exe ;-)  Actually, I use extensions only to mark executables
that are just hacks and do not have production quality.

Okay, this is my last attempt to get these xview issues resolved.
Please understand that I can not spend roughly a quarter of my
fvwm time trying to guess what you actually mean with your bug
reports.

I could not reproduce a single problem you reported in the last
few weeks, and I tried long and hard - several hours.  When I ask
you for configuration snippets and detailed instructions I almost
never get an answer.  When I ask you questions about the bug
reports I almost never get an answer.  When I make a patch and ask
if it helped to fix the problem, I rarely get an answer.  Instead,
the same problems are reported again and again after a while with
no additional information.  For example, you posted that patch
more than a year ago, and I explained why it will not be applied
and asked for further information which I never got.

Please understand that I can not continue to spend this much time
with your bug reports.  Their quality and your responsiveness has
to improve for me to work efficiently.

Now my last attempt to get feedback on the individual problems:

1) Send me your full configuration file and all icons that are
   necessary to demonstrate below problems.  Also, please state
   the command line which you use to start fvwm and the exact fvwm
   version in each bug report.

2) "My mozilla icon which used to be white is now grey."
   Again:  Is that and application provided icon or one set in
   fvwm?  I need at least the exact mozilla vertsion and that icon
   if it is a separate file.  This may be a side effect of the
   color limit rewrite and may already have changed since then.

3) You wrote:

> Start an xview application (cmdtool/textedit).
> Unfocus it, iconify it and reopen it using the windowlist menu
> (alternatively,  Rester) Click into the xview app. May want to use multiple

   Both work perfectly for me with.  I need your configuration file.

4) "... the icons in to left corner upon Restart is back.  Once
   opened tho, icons obey iconbox upon iconifying."

   I need the configuration file, a specific application
   (preferredly *not* an xview application), and exact
   instructions ("click here, move mouse there, ...").

5) You wrote:

   - My keyboard does not have an L8 or Paste key.
   - I tried to bind XK_L8 to the F8 key.  Now, when I press that
     key in the textedit window, the text cursor disappears.
     Nothing else happens.  I have no idea how cut and paste works
     in textedit, what key I would have to press to cut a
     selection.  How am I supposed to mark text in window 2?  With
     keystrokes?  Or button presses?  I need instructions that an
     idiot can understand.
   - Is there another, mor mundane key that should have the same 
     effect as the Paste key?
   - What is a "secondary edit"?
   - What is a "secondary selection?"
   - How to I make a "secondary selection"?
   - Please do not assume that anybody is able to use xview
     applications.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

P.S.:  Can someone please forward this mail to Elliot just in case
my mails are lost on the way?

Ah yes this is a miss print. The good name is --visual-palette.
But now I cannot change the option as -v will be not ok for the
short option.
The short option should be -vp ??

No, short options must have only a single letter.  Just take any
letter you like, perhaps -P or whatever.

If a short usage line helps, it may be added. But usually a usage line
with dozens of unrelated options (especially a one letter ones and without
description) only distracts an attention from the actual error message.
I am pretty happy with how programs in bin/ handle the situations.
(BTW, it always bugged me that "fvwm-bug --help" tried to send an email.)

Hmm, I don't like too much short names. If it is a unix command that is
run often short names help, fvwm is not run often by hand. I would only
support long names except for the backward compatibility (-d, -f, -s).
You see we already ran out of letters, this is not really necessary.
Do you think a usage line like this helps to understand anything:

fvwm (2.5.5): usage: fvwm [-d display] [-D] [-f cfgfile] [-c cmd] [-s] [-V] [-h | -?] [-r] [-i client-id] [-F sm_file] [-I vis-id | -C vis-class] [-l colors [-L] [-A] [-S] [-N]]

See also 'xv -reuse', can you understand what was a problem? Hardly, but
at least it uses long descriptive option names. Long names are good.
But I just let you decide what should be the option list of fvwm itself.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm a zsh user myself, and turn that behaviour off. I consider it a sop to

For long usage messages, I agree. For short (eg up to, say, 12 lines?) I'd

Well, my gcc only complains because I always compile with
"-Wall -Werror".  Unless you have a specific reason not to - for
example system header files with warnings - I suggest you do the
same.  But it is really not a big issue.  I would not have
mentioned it hadn't I made a big effort to check return codes of
all X calls in the core and lib a while ago.

Actually, I had already written a line about xv as a bad example
but removed it :-)  That is why the short usage message lists only
the short options.  It allows you to check which option letters
are available - no more:

 - If you made a typo or forgot the exact option letter, you can
   quickly check which ones are available.
 - If the user has no idea what the options do (s)he needs more
   verbose output anyway and should use "--help".

Okay, I will commit a cleaned up version.  It cuts down the list
of short options that is printed to the ones that are interesting
when trying to get it run.  It should be readable enough and
usefull too.

I have completed much of the new functionality in FvwmProxy that
is necessary to make it an Alt-Tab replacement.  Please take a
look at the current CVS code.  The man page is not updated yet,
but here is a sample config:

------------------------------ snip -----------------------------

key f2 a n SendToModule FvwmProxy hide
key f3 a n SendToModule FvwmProxy abort
key f4 a n Current FvwmProxy_Mark
key f5 a n FvwmProxy_Circulate next (currentpage)
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmProxy
------------------------------ snip -----------------------------

F1: Show the proxy windows.
F2: Hide the proxy windows and run the default action on the
    selected window.
F3: Abort the proxy windows.
F4: Select the currently focused window.
F5: Cycle selection to the next window.

The commands that do the actual work can be found in the file
ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults (istalled to datadir).

--

It's still missing a way to hide the proxies when a key is
released and tracking the pointer to select windows.

So what should be the final name?
My current preference is FvwmWindowLabels or FvwmProxyLabels.
But anything from the 6 names above and one in the subject are ok too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

.fvwm2rc is listed at end.

Secondary selections are selections w/ the mouse made while a Paste or
Delete key is held down.  During this time (key held down), a mouse click
should not cause a change in focus.  2.5.3 and prior didnt not cause change
in focus. 2.5.4 does.

> Bring up 2 xview (eg textedit) windows (1 and 2).
> Type some text in window 2.
> Click into window 1.
> Hold down Paste (L8) or Delete (L10)
  Select via mouse some text from window 2.
> Release Paste key,
> Selected text will get copied to window 1..
> Window 1 should keep focus (which 2.5.3 does).
> In 2.5.4, window 2 gets focus upon mouse click .

You can try this on any set of windows, even xterm.
The xterms won't do the copying that xview does, but you can watch the
window focusing.
Notice which window gets the active colors w/ each step.
Compare 2.5.3 w/ 2.5.4.

ie.
Start 2 xterms
Click into one xterm.
Hold down your L8 equivalent
WHile holding down L8 equivalent, left click mouse in other wondow.
2.5.3 will not do focus change (note titlebar colors).
2.5.4 will     do focus change on mpuse click..

--------------------------------------------------
focus.c

<<
change:	if (!FP_IS_LENIENT(FW_FOCUS_POLICY(fw)) && !focus_does_accept_input_focus(fw) &&  sf != NULL && sf->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk)

to:	if (!FP_IS_LENIENT(FW_FOCUS_POLICY(fw)) && !focus_does_accept_input_focus(fw) && (sf == NULL || sf->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk))
>>

This isnt the 1st patch i sent for the xview focus problem.
That was too crude. This was the more refined one i sent.

Only xview icons and all xview icons have this behavior.
It has to be a Restart without arguements.

Our configure automatically add -Wall if gcc is detected (I add this a
few months ago). So, I always compile with -Wall. Moreover, I use a
"colored" gcc so it is rare that I miss a gcc warning. My gcc does not
complaint if I do not care of the return code of FftPatternGetMatrix().
But it complaint (warning: statement with no effect) with:

#define foo(a) 0

foo(0);

I do not recompile without XFT each time I change Fft.c, my
machine is (dramatically) too slow.

It seems that there is a problem with the list of windows which should
has a proxy window. If I start FvwmProxy on a given page it works as
expected on this page. But If a go on an other page or/and desk (with
the proxy windows mapped or not) the windows shown by FvwmProxy are
not updated.

Hi,

this is what I've done to check out fvwm:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm

cd fvwm

after that, have you followed the recipe in utils/configure_dev.sh ?

i.e.

aclocal ; autoheader ; automake --add-missing ; autoreconf
configure

BTW, these are not documented in the 'CVS Procedures' page 
(http://www.fvwm.org/cvs.html)

I hope this will help.

regards,
Giuseppe.

PS
I've added 'fvwm-workers' in Cc:

I see now why our gcc are not agree on -Wall.
Why -Wno-implicit-int has been added to the CFLAGS if gcc is detected??

I think there was a discussion about more options for stipled stitles.
I was thinking of a Style option to remove the "stipledness" of sticky
windows (since there is an option to get stipled for all windows).
Has anyone thought about this? I guess I could "make a go" at this, if
there is interest.
(must take a look at how Styles work first...)

The side effect I'm seeing to this patch is the Key command is now
PointerKey.  I'm using sloppy focus and without the patch if my cursor
is over the root desktop and a window is in focus the key action
immediately affects the focused window, with the patch it askes me for
a window to click on.

Possibly there is some other solution to the problem without this
adverse side effect?

That will be surely part of the "conditional styles" rewrite that
is planned for 3.0.

I just downloaded the cvs snapshot and found you switched to 8-space
tab indentation, which was the worst thing I could have imagined :-)
Ah well, I suppose indentation styles are a bit of a religious war ...

I think you broke the drawminiicon option, but I don't know this idiom:

    $foo = 0 + !!$1;


Otherwise, I like all the changes you made.

I've added title/icon/class/resource matching with a syntax like:

  *FvwmWindowLister: Show resource = Galeon|Navigator|mozilla-bin

You can get the new version at:

  http://cns.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/FvwmWindowLister

I even added emacs mode settings for your indentation style :-)

It is only a temporary shortcoming.  I am just writing a patch for

Well, feel free to commit any patches.  After all it's your module

Can you elaborate on the problem?  THe XClearWindow() is necessary
in case a transparent colour set is used.

I see.  Whatever this cut/paste action is supposed to do, it does
absulutely nothing for me.

Finally, I think I understand what your problem is.  How am I
supposed to know that you have configured your paste key as a
*modifier* key?  The behaviour you describe is 100% correct, exect
for modifier key.  I can take care of this.

With that patch:

   If the window that is supposed to receive focus is an xview
   window.

AND

   No window has the focus yet.

THEN

  The window will not get focused.

That is just plain wrong.  You will be unable to focus any
xview window unless you focus another findow first.  In order to
fix a problem, I have to see it first.

Sigh!  You cut out all the relevant parts from the config.  With
the one you sent, icons are *supposed* to appear in the top left
corner.

A few days ago, I tried to duplicate the textedit icon restart
problem.  I couldn't get the icon to go to the upper left corner,
but on a restart, fvwm put the textedit icon into the area of the
screen that I use as an iconbox, and then put another icon right
on top of it.

Your recent icon placement patch fixed that.

It was a really weird problem.  Textedit windows have a leading
space in their window name:

  " Text Editor ..."

When you restart fvwm with "Restart", this is saved as

  "[WM_NAME]  Text Editor ..."

in the session restart file.  When it is read back, the leading
space is stripped from the name.  Hence, fvwm does not find the
window in the restart file, can not read the old icon position and
kicks off the normal icon placement code.  I fixed the leading
space problem, but fvwm still trusts the window title blindly when
parsing the session restart file.  I guess that can be exploited
to cause a lot of funny problems.

And a second problem was that when a window provided its own icon
window, it was just dumped at 0 0 upon a restart and not moved to
the position that was stored in the window structure.

> Your recent icon placement patch fixed that.

I hope so.

Open FvwmPager (any config or no config, I think).
Play with different DesktopSize values.

The geometry remains the same, so some space on the bottom and the right
does not belong to any subwindow and thus not exposed.

The 2.4.x pager works correctly, it changes its geometry proportionally.

Regards,
Mikhael.

With that patch:
   If the window that is supposed to receive focus is an xview
   window.
AND
   No window has the focus yet.
THEN
  The window will not get focused.
That is just plain wrong.  You will be unable to focus any
xview window unless you focus another findow first.  In order to
fix a problem, I have to see it first.

Hmmmm.....Ive been using this and havent had any focus problem.
The xview window does have (sf == NULL) and appears to want a return of
FALSE.

FVWMIdent says Glabally Active, Input Field False, WM_TAKE_FOCUS Present.

Heres what xmodmap says about the key:

    KeyCode	Keysym (Keysym)	...
    Value  	Value   (Name) 	...

     80    	0xffcf (F18)	0xffcf (F18)	0x1005ff74 (SunPaste)	


The output of xmodmap -pm references F18:

shift       Shift_L (0x6a),  Shift_R (0x75)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x7e)
control     Control_L (0x53)
mod1        Meta_L (0x7f),  Meta_R (0x81)
mod2        Mode_switch (0x14)
mod3        Num_Lock (0x69)
mod4        Alt_L (0x1a)
mod5        F13 (0x20),  F18 (0x50),  F20 (0x68)

I think that does make it a modifier...
At first I was sure it wasn't.

I found a problem with windows that doesn't support resizing.

When using tear-off menus in Motif and GTK+ the window resize operation is
prohibited.
But still the maximise option in my window menu is available.
In Motif it just beeps when selected, in GTK+ it moves the window to the
upper left corner (maybe this is a bug in GTK+).
Also I assigned:

Style Menu	NoButton 2, NoButton 4, NoHandles, FixedSize

to get the same behaviour for the tear-offs in TK. But these are even
possible to maximise, although not resizable (as expevted).

I have a function assinged for maximising in the window menu. But the
behaviour is the same if I invoke "Maximize" from FvwmConsole so I don't
think this is the problem.

I've added configurable menu formatting to FvwmWindowLister
and removed the DrawPosition and DrawMiniIcon options.

It's at

  http://cns.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/FvwmWindowLister

Let me know if there's a better way to submit this stuff.

Cheers

Key release bindings are now implemented.  They don't work too
well as many applications refuse to take keyboard input while such
a key is held down.  That somewhat limits the possibilities of
FvwmProxy as an Alt-Tab replacement.  Try this config:

------------------------------- snip -----------------------------
*FvwmProxy: Colorset 0
*FvwmProxy: SelectColorset 1
Colorset 1 fg red, bg green

Key -Meta_L A A SendToModule FvwmProxy hide
Key Tab A M ShowProxy Next
Key Tab A SM ShowProxy Prev

AddToFunc ShowProxy
+ I SendToModule FvwmProxy show
+ I FvwmProxy_Circulate $0 (currentpage)

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I FvwmProxy
------------------------------- snip -----------------------------

I know there is a problem with the release key binding ("-Meta_L")
when a menu is brought up and navigated with the keyboard while
the proxies are shown.  I'm not sure about the correct fix yet.

Bye

Yes, I know this problem.  The application does not tell the wm
that it does not want to be maximized.  It simply assumes that
setting min size = max size is equivalent, but it's not in fvwm.
I'm not sure if the EWMH provides a "do not maximize" hint.  In
general it's not a good idea to add some heuristics to guess if
an application wants to maximizable or not.  A while ago I
extended the concept of the maximized state to a secondary
geometry that is not necessarily related to the window size.
(See MoveMaximize command et. al.).  I'd say it's better to let
the user choose if (s)he maximizes the window or not.

Hi,

There seems to be a problem with window focusing with the mouse
inside a window.

Minimal config:
---8< --- >8---
Style "*" SloppyFocus

AddToFunc Raise-and-Focus "I"  Focus
+  "I"  Raise

Key Tab  A M  Next (!iconic !Shaded CurrentScreen CurrentPage "*") Raise-and-Focus
---8< --- >8---

This used to work fine just a few days ago. I think it stopped
working when Next and Prev commands started looking at the
context window. So, I don't know if it is supposed to work this
way, and if there's a woraround.

This might be the CVS log of where it stopped working:
---8< --- >8---
2002-11-07  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>
    * fvwm/conditional.c (Circulate):
    (circulate_cmd):
    Next and Prev commands begin looking at the context window, if any
---8< --- >8---

The problem is:

         1################1
         #                #
         #                #
         #      2---------#------2
         #      |    *    #      |
         1################1      |
                |                |
                |                |
                |                |
                2----------------2

The window (1) is focused and raised.
The other window (2) is below it and is partially obscured.
The mouse pointer (*) is at a place where they overlap.

Now, my minimal config works fine. It works as it should even if
the pointer is on the root window, outside both the windows.

The trouble starts when the mouse pointer is inside one of the
windows. As in,

         1################1
         #                #
         #   *            #
         #      2---------#------2
         #      |         #      |
         1################1      |
                |                |
                |                |
                |                |
                2----------------2


Window (1) is focused, raised and has the pointer.
Window (2) is below it.

If I press Alt + Tab once, window 2 (rightly) gets focused and
raised. But, if I press it once more, window 1, the one the
pointer is in does not get focused. I'm sure it has something to
do with the context window (which I assume is the one the pointer
is in).

Thanks for any clarification,
Arvind

I will comment on your other message later.
It is more convenient to get unified patches against FvwmWindowLister.in,
and not autogenerated FvwmWindowLister. Something like:

  cvs diff -u FvwmWindowLister.in >FvwmWindowLister.patch

or just (if you have a good .cvsrc):

  cvs diff >FvwmWindowLister.patch

Mikhael.

Currently M_NEW_PAGE has the following 4-th and 5-th arguments:

  max_left_top_virtual_x
  max_left_top_virtual_y

As FvwmOldDebug.c says, several years ago such arguments did not exist.
These may be only useful in a pager and indead only FvwmPager uses them.
These values are not very useful in other modules and speaking strictly
FvwmPager also just needs to know how may whole pages a desktop has and
to evaluate max_left_top coordinates itself (instead of the other way).

So I want to replace these 2 values with another 4 that would be useful
in all modules especially non C modules without an obvious DisplayWidth:

  vp_width       (viewport size in pixels; is page_width a better name?)
  vp_height
  total_pages_x  (DesktopSize; is desktop_size_x a better name?)
  total_pages_y

I will adjust FvwmPager and module documentation to these changes.
Any comments before I do this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Window flags is the most problematic structure passed to modules.

Several years ago we moved from passing one-word flags (32 bits) in
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW and M_ADD_WINDOW to the whole window_flags structure,
currently 11 words! (but this depends on a compiler). Although it is easy
to maintain it is not useful and portable for 2 reasons.

First, previously it was not important that modules and fvwm itself
were compiled using the same compiler using the exactly same options.
Moreover it was possible to run modules from other versions (compiled
differently), because module protocol was not dependant on a compiler.
Additionally, window_flags were available to any module, not just the
ones linked with libfvwm, i.e. not just C or other compiled modules.

I wanted to implement window_flags parsing (about 250 flags) in perllib,
but then though it is just imposible, because (I think) even gcc stores
bitfield sub-structures differently with word align option or without it,
and I am not a big fun for compiling anything at the perllib build time.
I think a better solution is to transmit only compiler independent
arguments in the module interface.

A lot of flags are pretty internal and a module should not rely on them.
On the other hand there are some pretty known window flags (mostly the
ones that have equivalent window commands or style options) that may be
of general use, like sticky, iconified, maximized, shaded, placed_by_fvwm
and so on.

I am not against passing the whole window_flags (although it is big), but
since they may be changed at any time relying on them in modules is bad.
I want to define the most useful 32 (or 64) window flags and compose one
word from them, similarly to what we do with M_OLD_CONFIGURE_WINDOW now.
What do you think should be the most useful window flags? I guess, ewmh
flags should be included otherwise ewmh arguments passed in the same packet
would be not very useful. Probably the user defined states (32) should be
transmitted in another word too. Any thoughts?

Regards,
Mikhael.

That works in CVS.  I guess that tarball was built while I was checking
in my changes.

script.y had this code:

  foo *some_func()
  {
    if (...)
    {
      ...
      return something;
    }
    else
    {
      return NULL;
      *s = 0;
    }
  }

This generates a compiler warning:

  script.y: In function `Depile':
  script.y:132: warning: control reaches end of non-void function

Olivier, are you sure your gcc works correctly.  You said you
compile with -Wall, so you should have seen this warning/bug.  I
had a problem with gcc a while ago.  When I compiled with
"-Wall -Werror -g" I got no warnings at all, but with
"-Wall -Werror -g -O2" it worked fine.  Are you sure you are not
running into a similar problem?  Can you post one of your compiler
commands?  Mine look like this:

  $ make CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror -g -O2" bindings.o
  source='bindings.c' object='bindings.o' libtool=no \
  depfile='.deps/bindings.Po' tmpdepfile='.deps/bindings.TPo' \
  depmode=gcc /bin/sh ../depcomp \
  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../libs
  -I/usr/include/freetype2  -I/usr/X11R6/include   -I/usr/include
  -DFVWM_MODULEDIR=\"/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.5.5\"
  -DFVWM_DATADIR=\"/usr/local/share/fvwm\"

I am surprised by the warning description. A more natural warning
will be something like "code after end of function". I get the
warning if, say, I remove "return NULL".

Note that the code you fix in script.c is there since an eternity
I think. At least it is in 2.4. So, the question why you do not
get such a warning before?

I (want to) compile like this:

	$ make

which gives:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../..  -I/opt/X11R6-cvs/include \
-I/opt/X11R6-cvs/include/freetype2 -I/opt/X11R6-cvs/include \
-I/opt/X11R6-cvs/include -I/opt/X11R6-cvs/include -I/usr/local/include/fribidi \
-DFVWM_DATADIR=\"/opt/fvwm/share/fvwm\" \
-g -O2 -Wall -Wno-implicit-int -c script.c
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

as I have a colored gcc I rarely miss a warning. But, as I say in a
previous mail I do not know why "-Wno-implicit-int" has been added.
So sometime I miss an implicit int declaration. I would like to
remove this "-Wno-implicit-int" (and we may add an option, --developer,
to configure, which adds -Werror if gcc is the compiler)

Tim I think that you added "-Wno-implicit-int". Why?

Some kinds of warnings are not found unless you compile with
optimization.  Enabling the optimizer allows the compiler to look much
more deeply at your code, and that can enable it to discover problems
that can't be found by a simple one-pass compilation.

The most common such warnings are for unused variable: without
optimization on the compiler doesn't know enough about your code to
realize that a variable is never used; only with optimization turned on
will it keep enough state throughout the function to deliver that
warning.

Note that the level of optimization doesn't matter; even -O is good
enough to find the extra warnings (but -O2 is the most common, and so
best-tested, level of optimization in GCC).


FYI.  BTW, all of the above applies to GCC only; other compilers
obviously may have different behavior.

Heck!  Why isn't that mentioned in the gcc info page?!  So I can't
have debuggable code and many important warnings at the same time?
What really pisses me off during debugging sessions is when gcc
optimizes local variables away.

You mean like this:

     because they require data flow information that is computed only

Yep.  I agree it's a drag--I've often felt that the -O0 flag or
something should have a side-effect of doing the optimization warning
checks, but then not actually optimizing the resulting code.

Actually I'm not sure about "many important warnings"; I think the only
two warnings which are enabled only for optimization are uninitialized
variables (which is certainly important, I grant you) and "nonvolatile
automatic variables being changed by longjmp"... which is rarely
useful.

I misspoke last time about the unused variables: those are warned even
without -O.  It's the uninitialized variables that aren't warned unless
you enable -O.

Sorry, I somehow missed that paragraph.  I just can't operate info

these warnings ;-)

OK, I thought that might be the case. I'm not really familiar with
cvs and autoconf but it seems pretty straightforward.

When an application supplies it's own window as an icon (for example
XJewel), the style IconSize has no effect.
I guess this is known problem, since this feature (IconSize) is quite new.
Just thought to point this out just incase...

Application-provided icon windows are purposely not resized by
IconSize because the application may need the window to be a certain
size.  The window could provide more than just an icon, so resizing
may adversely affect the application's functionality.

There is a quick note about application-provided icons in the fvwm man
page.

Wouldn't it be possible to use the same technique as with
swallowed windows in FvwmButtons?
Just a thought. (Those icons break the nice symmetry :-) )

You may want my "man" script, which presents info as one of the choices
for manual pages. More to the point, it parses info files and turns them
into a single flat text document, which of course you browse with your
pager as with ordinary manual entries. It's certainly made info accessable
for me. To be sure, there are no hyperlinks, but the link targets _are_
presented in the text, and the your pager's search function should find
them fairly well.

Just FYI. Cheers,

Info is quite accessible if you spend a few minutes learning the
command set--there are only about 10 keys :).

In particular, the "s" (search) and "i" (index lookup) are critically
important to know.  Once you know these you can do more with Info that
you can do with either man pages or HTML.

yes,

aren't there lots of possible desktops... because I can set my
viewport to look at anywhere I want within my desktop (ex-
overlooking two pages).

I don't think that it's very consistent with the other information
being sent with M_NEW_PAGE. I could recieve:
vp_width/height == probably screen resolution
vp_x/y COULD == (123,321)... in which case:
total_pages_x/y == nothing useful what-so-ever.

If you ask me:
M_NEW_PAGE should contain ONLY vp_x/y
M_CONFIG_INFO should contain vp_width/height, and either
max_possible_x/y OR DesktopSize (which I think it already does).

It seems a little like fvwm sits on the fence regarding whether
consider pages as something that can overlap or not. I would say that
a "viewport" could have any possible top-left x/y... and that "pages"
are viewports that do not overlap each other.

am I making sense?

if I comment out the if statments at line 500 and 585 it compiles fine.

I think I found a bug.

I used the following command to arrange icons (taken from the man-page):
All (CurrentPage Iconic) PlaceAgain Icon

I first iconified 3 windows (have IconFill left bottom set), then I moved
the 2 rightmost icons from their positions. Then a applyied the above
command.
Now the labels of the 2 moved icons moved back to their original positions
but the the pixmaps stayed at the same positions.

I use a CVS version from Nov 1.

total_pages_x/y may be not useful for FvwmWindowLister, but useful for
FvwmPager.

Currently when DesktopSize command is issued _or_ a page is switched a
single M_NEW_PAGE is sent carrying all changes. I don't want to change
this, because it seems to be convenient for all modules, not just a pager.
Of course, a more static info (that is mostly not changed) may be moved to
M_CONFIG_INFO, but M_NEW_PAGE is sent rarely, so it is not very important.
This may be done later when all packets are redesigned, I don't like, for
example, that M_CONFIG_INFO unites module configuration lines and global
constants instead of having 2 different packets. I don't like M_NEW_DESK.

As I said, if you will use the PageInfo tracker, you will not need to know
whether it internally listens to M_NEW_PAGE, M_NEW_DESK or M_CONFIG_INFO.

I use this terminology, viewport is something more general than a page.

I really don't want to rant about the interface of info here.  Let
it suffice to say that I absolutely *hate* hierarchical documents.
And info operates a bit like vi, a bit like lynx and a bit like
emacs, but not quite.  That totally confuses me.

On my new redhat 8.0 system I got exactly the same errors (from current
cvs) until I installed the libstroke package from tarball source, then
it compiles fine! I suspect there's only a problem if you don't have
libstroke.

This is not really correct. I don't use 8-spaces, I use one tab. Unlike
our C code that requires TAB to be 8 spaces, our perl code is properly
structured to allow any TAB size. Use 4 spaces for TAB if you like this,
I use 3 or 8. Just please remember to write a properly structured code
(no spaces for indentation, no tabs in the middle of line) not to break
this TAB size freedom. I know, it is difficult with emacs...

It only veryfies that $foo ends up to be a number (you compare this with
numbers later, right?). But I forgot this is not a boolean (may be "2" as
well). I will fix this.

I don't think these are the right settings, they insert 4 spaces.
In fact, I think the only way to configure emacs to do anything useful
is to disable auto-indentation and insert real tabs on tab press.

Mikhael.

As explained Mikhael the MinHeight does not dictate the height of the
title bar's.

Rational: if you use XxX Pixmap buttons you can set MinHeight to
X+something to be sure that your buttons will be not truncated with
any font. If you use Height X+something you may have pbs with your
title with "big" font.

as shown in the screen shot (22 kB, fvwm 2.5.4) below...

  http://www103.pair.com/parv/tmp/shot-fvwm-2.5.4-menu.png


...triangles are painted either in "Background" or "HilightBack"
colors, not in "Foreground" or "ActiveFore".  following is what
produced the menu style...

  MenuStyle  *  TrianglesSolid
  MenuStyle  *  Foreground white, Background red4, Greyed rgb:f0/0/0
  MenuStyle  *  ActiveFore black, HilightBack grey75
  MenuStyle  *  MenuFace HGradient 512 5 rgb:60/0/0 20 rgb:80/0/0 40 rgb:a0/0/0 20 rgb:80/0/0 10 rgb:60/0/0 10 black
  MenuStyle  *  Hilight3DThickness -2


...i had to use gradient otherwise red (triangle) on red
(background) is rather hard to see.


could it be possible either to paint the triangles w/ the
"Foreground" & "ActiveFore" colors as appropriate, or to provide
means to specify color(s) for triangle?

otherwise, indication of a sub menu is easily missed.  below is the
screen shot (52 kB, fvwm 2.4.4) showing triangles painted in
foreground colors...

  http://www103.pair.com/parv/comp/graphic.comp/shot-fvwm2-4-4-colors.png


...and from configuration file...

  http://www103.pair.com/parv/comp/unix/cf/fvwm/fvwm-2.cf--old


...menu style is similar to above...

  MenuStyle  *  Foreground white, Background red4
  MenuStyle  *  ActiveFore black, HilightBack white, Greyed red
  MenuStyle  *  TrianglesSolid, Hilight3DThick

OK, I think I understand what you mean. Use one tab for indentation, then
the programmer can choose to have their editor display tabs as
equivalent to whatever number of spaces they prefer. I agree this
is good and will switch to using this.

I think it ought to be straightforward with emacs once I figure it out.

Don't worry, that option has gone away, replaced by the choice of
%M or %m in ItemFormat.

I'm confused as to what is happening. I screwed up the mode
settings, but they should have made emacs display the tabs as
equivalent to 8 spaces not 4. The file I put up definitely has
single tabs for indentation. Could it have got corrupted somewhere?

Anyway, I've got some more changes to add after the weekend. I'll
send those as a patch against CVS and it will hopefully be right
this time.

Thanks for the help.

Good point.  A little harder to implement, but might be worth
considering in the future.

Yep.
I looked a little at the code.
MWM does someting like this, clipping the window into a frame.
And I guess since you work at Sun you have some familiarty with dtwm.

Pardon if I made some spellingmistakes (after 2 litres of beer :-) )

| Yes, please!  That's exactly what I need!

Start here:

	http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/css/index.html#s-text-info2x

and get the info2man.tar.gz file and also fetch:

	http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/scripts/man

which is the script itself. You then add the info dirs to your $MANPATH
and go. It may have a few dependencies on my environment which I'd be
happy to iron out, so let me know if it gives you trouble. In particular
it expects the envvar $OS to be "linux" on linux systems (well, actually
groff-based systems). Hmm, I see there's now an nroff on my redhat box, so
maybe you won't need the groff incantation at all.

I would second that hierachical remark - I also really hate limping
through HOWTO web documents which are typically presented in pieces :-(
And I generally want a big document in the pager my fingers know.

Finally, I think I understand what your problem is.  How am I
supposed to know that you have configured your paste key as a
*modifier* key?  The behaviour you describe is 100% correct, exect
for modifier key.  I can take care of this.
>>

I was prinf'ing around in events.c

In 2.5.4, all mouse left button clicks (didnt try middle/right) cause
fvwmSelect() to return, thus i believe always triggering a focus change
event.

In 2.5.3, mouse clicks in the window having focus dont cause fvwmSelect() to return. Also, mouse clicks while L8 is held down dont cause fvwmSelect() to return.

fvwmSelect is in libs/fvwmsignal.c

Hello,

I would like to implement Colorset in title bar's. I would
like to implement MultiColorset too.

Is this reasonable:

Add:
	
	Colorset cset [alpha]

to the {Add}TitleStyle, {Add}ButtonStyle and BorderStyle
command. These commands will apply the colorset cset background
on the Title bar, button bar and border with the given alpha.

Add:

	MultiColorset \
		Main cset [alpha] \
		LeftMain cset [alha]
		... etc ... as MultiPixmap

to TitleStyle.

Any comments?

Olivier

I did not immediatelly understand what alpha is good for. But I think I
understand it. Any new Add*Style adds a colorset layer.

The initial starting background may be a solid bg from "Style Colorset".
But this is not very good for defining transparent titles/buttons/borders.
I think it is acceptable, instead, to say that the first colorset should
be fully destructive, i.e. its alpha is discarded.

Similarly MultiColorset may be destructive, i.e. no alpha in the mandatory
Main/LeftMain/RightMain. Other MultiColorset parts may have alpha relative
to Main. There are also stretch arguments.

MultiPixmap may be removed in favor of MultiColorset if this simplifies
the code (I think, yes).

Seems good for me, one should just distinguish between internal alphas in
the colorset definition and the external alpha in the colorset usage.

We probably should add different settings for different windows later.
Similarly to FocusStyle. I.e.: [Add]TitleStyle XTerm <current_parameters>.
Then we may remove decors. But this is really not for now.

As for BorderStyle, I think it is not very simple if you want to get nice
results. It may have MultiColorset too with different colorsets for corner
(to be mirrored) and horizontal and/or vertical parts (to be mirrored and
tiled). This may wait.

Seems a lot of work. Good luck. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Right now I get a compilation error (actually a make-error) with the code
from CVS. Any idea when the code will be in a working state?

I get the following error:

Making all in FvwmProxy

make[3]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.

I changed the FvwmProxy source files, but not the make/config files.
Can I assume you have a recent checkout and did the reconfig/etc commands?

Hmmm.  Hmm.  What does your modules/FvwmProxy/Makefile look like?
Can anyone else reproduce this?

Sure, I reproduced it last week when I first built after FvwmProxy
was added.

:)

It happens when you do a CVS update followed by a make
instead of using the configure_dev.sh shell.
Various things make reconfiguring necessary,
new modules is one example.

Yep. After running utils/configure_dev.sh building works fine.

Mikhael, do you have the time to add the patch?

Hello

With GCC 3.2 latest CVS version gives the following error:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../libs  -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/freetype2 -I/usr/include -I/usr/X11R6/include     -I/usr/X11R6/include              -DFVWM_MODULEDIR=\"/home/lazy/local//libexec/fvwm/2.5.5\"    -DFVWM_DATADIR=\"/home/lazy/local//share/fvwm\"         -DFVWM_CONFDIR=\"/home/lazy/local//etc\"        -DFVWM_COLORSET_PRIVATE=1 -g -O2 -Wall -Wno-implicit-int -c borders.c

The actuall problem and a quick solution see in the patch file
( it's only one line in a function ). Patched version seems to be working
correctly.
I didn't send the GCC bug, as I don't know the true origin of the problem.

My system is ppc:
Linux navi 2.4.19-r6 #14 Tue Nov 5 13:36:38 EST 2002 ppc  745/755 GNU/Linux
I don't know if there is a simillar problem on x86 machines.

Well, this seems to be ppc dependent, not (just) GCC 3.2, so you should

I would really like to find a gcc option to turn these warnings off.
We can't do anything about them until *-config owners "fix" their scripts.
I don't know where to find the gcc-3.2 switch to turn them off.

~X is not the same as 0 ^ X. It is hovewer the same as ~0 ^ X, I think.
But I am not sure your gcc will not die on this too.

Why? Any way Transparent will be not supported for title bar's.
RootTransprent will work.

Colorset 1 bg blue, fg white, RootTransparent
Style * Colorset 1
TitleStyle Inactive Colorset 1 30

will give a blue inactive title bar "textured" with the root background.

Colorset 1 bg blue, fg white, RootTransparent
Style * Colorset 1
TitleStyle Inactive Colorset 1

will give a root transparent title bar.

I think that this will add unnecessary complication in the code.
Moreover these "Style Colorset" (and "Style Color") will be used
for the fg/text and relief. This is a bit problematic ...

In fact I do not see why we should have any mandatory "type" in the
Multi* option. We have a solid "common" bg from "Style Colorset" and we
draw over it. I will see.

Yes, stretching maybe problematic. For example "LeftText a_grad_cs".
Maybe I will add a "width" argument (e.g., 20p). Also, maybe,
we can add XPixmap and YPixmap Colorset option.

I do not know, maybe the two code can be merged.

Suzanne any opinion?

Any way I will first implement Colorset and the MultiPixmap code will
help a lot for MultiColorset.

Maybe this is not so difficult. But what do you do with a window

Yes why not. Note that there are no AddBorderStyle cmd so no alpha
here.

Maybe not so lot of work. At least for TitleStyle and ButtonStyle
Colorset. Updating the Colorset and the RootColorset may lead to some
complication (do not know yet).  The borders code is really clean :o)

No, first the "Style BorderColorset" should be applied and then the
BorderStyle Colorset should be applied with a possible alpha.

I thought Transparent may be supported too. If only RootTransparent is
supported, it's not very important whether to have a solid bg base or not.

It is not very clean that both "Style Colorset" and TitleStyle colorsets
are used (and different colorset properties are ignored). On the other
hand maybe having an external base simplifies TitleStyle, I don't know.

The problem is that the solid bg base is almost never useful for titlebars
designed using MultiPixmap. Instead, having the Main colorset as the base
for all other parts may be very useful.

I think we agree that the resulting TitleStyle has only one optional
MultiColorset, but several optional Colorset-s, so in AddTitleStyle
MultiColorset and Colorset work differently.

I think we need to rotate a colorset when different titlebar positions are
used (depending on one or another TitleRotatedCW options). So XPixmap and
YPixmap (if I understand them correctly) are not needed, at least now.

I also don't leave the idea to call all "Pixmap" in the user configuration
"Image" one day. :)

I would not discuss now backward compatibility issues. But if TitleStyle
is physically (not nessesarily using the syntax) moved to window's Style,
the main non conflicting syntax should be TitleStyle * Inactive <params>.
I don't think this is needed for 2.6, but we will see.

TitleStyle/ButtonStyle/BorderStyle were always considered difficult to be
converted to colorsets. If it is not difficult for you, fine. :)

Well, I suggest you do send the gcc bug report and switch to a
working gcc version in the mean time (2.95.x4 is the last that I
know is working reliably).  We can do little about the problem
other than this.

Running "make" can not handle when new Makefiles have to be
generated for the first time.  You need to run automake manually
to get them.

Well, I won't stop you doing it, but are you all aware that the
whole code is going to be thrown away, probably next year?  As I
said before, I think no new functionality should be added to the
{Button,Title,Border}Stlye commands anymore.  My estimation is
that at least 50% of the code doing this will be just thrown away
and on the other hand makes the big decoration rewrite much more
complicated.

Can you describe what the exact problem was?  The background is
set by the DrawProxyBackground function() into the window
backgorund.  After that, clearing the windows forces the X server
to redraw the window and the background becomes visible.  Using
XFillRectangle has two disadvantages.  First, it draws in the
foreground which requires communication with the X server to keep
it drawn properly.  Second, XFillRectangle paints over the
background from the colour set, for example covering a
transparent background.

mouse selection).
- Cleaned up option parsing (use ParseToggleArgument() to scan for boolead
options instead of strcmp).
- Put window title in center of proxy when no mini icon was defined for a
specific window.
* Do not send M_CONFIGURE_NOTIFY when the window did not move in __move_loop().

I had to back out that patch.  It painted over the colour set
background and disabled all colour set decorations other than a
solid, single colour background.

No, it just wasn't mentioned in the Makefile.am so it didn't get packaged
into the snapshot.  The next snapshot should be OK.

If you really want the file today, let me know and I'll send you a copy,
or you can get it out of CVS.

Mikhael/Olivier, were you able to reproduce the problem ?  In other
words, is it core-dumping for you as well ?  I'm very curious and
anxious to know what it was/is :-)

Does it show you the background color of the select colorset when
the proxy is selected?  If so, help me figure out what I've got set up
wrong.

Does everyone actually want the proxies to be auto-selected by moving the mouse
over them and not even clicking them?  I found it really annoying, but I'd be
willing to put it up for a vote.

Ok.

I suppose.  Less uniform, though.

Oops.

Yes, it more or less core dumps on me when a new xterm with some arabic
text that you sent (or any its substring) is launched or when it is moved.
I simply used some random "*-iso10646-1" font, not the one you sent.
I use fribidi-0.10.1 which does not have fribidi_boolean definition.

Although if you take a look at my "#if 0" it would seem like the problem
is in your code, it is possible that the problem is in FBidi.c or fribidi.
Something is not allocated enough. I tried to increase all allocations in
FBidi and replace alloca, but it still core dumps with your code enabled.
Since your code simply replaces some characters, the only reason I may
think about is you use some unicode character that makes fribidi unhappy.
I may take a look at this later. Or maybe you may fix it yourself.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Luckily fribidi (fribidi.sf.net) is rather easy to download and compile :-)
BTW, the patch was against 0.10.4 (current release version).

As was noted - I've tried the same exact code outside of fvwm and it
worked flawlessly on thousands of examples (entire directories worth
of files) without any issues.  I will certainly stare at it again
but without the ability to generate a controlled failure (ie. not
having my entire session disappear on me :-) and without me knowing
or having Xnest (or equivalent), I'm more likely to keep asking for
help (ouch).  Could something within fvwm's own code be getting rubbed
the wrong way ?

:o)

I do not want to wait 3 years or more before to see colorset in
TitleStyle for a stable release. I do not believe on estimation about
fvwm code, I believe on written code (or on code that are going to be
written). At least 3 times "conditional style" stop me to implement
some stuff. Now I see that conditional style will not be in 2.6 (fine)
and that we do not have even style by Id (which is IMO a must for
2.6).

Moreover, I do not see the problem with the {Button,Title,Border}Style
commands. There are dramatically powerful (yes there are some odd
things, there are missing feature and yes I will add maybe some). The
only real pb I see is that they are not fvwm Style and this pbs is not
really a drawing pbs.

BTW, here my 2.6 todo list (optimistic).

- Colorset in {Button,Title,Border}Style
- A type of "gettext" support in config file
- Better key/mouse binding in the Pager
- minimal randr support (XFree-4.3 will have a functional randr for
resizing and rotation)
- Style by Id (maybe Dominik)
- Icon background (maybe Dominik)
- bug fix, testing, bug fix, testing, bug fix ........

I've no 3.0 todo list. I will begin to think to 3.0 when 2.6.?
will be released :o)

I'm implementing a few new options for the FvwmIconBox to allow to decide
if iconified/uniconified window's labels are drawn with or without a
relief and an option to disabled "(" and ")" around the titles of
iconified windows.

I need some feedback on names:

IconifiedHasLabelRelief

takes an argument with a value of "True" or "False" to enable/disable the
drawing of reliefs for iconified windows.

UnIconifiedHasLabelRelief

the same for uniconified windows

and

IconifiedHasNormalTitle

disables () around title for an iconified window.
Maybe this should also have a boolean argument?

You underestimate the problem. User1 may have fribidi-0.9.0, User2 may
have fribidi-0.10.1 and User3 may have fribidi-0.10.4. fvwm should be
built successfully for all of them. It is only that User1 should get no
Bidi support while 2 others should get this support. So we can't start to
use any new fribidi features without also changing configure.in to work
correctly for User2 and UserN. In theory "make" should never fail.

I launched another X (this is safe with XFree86-4.2) from another virtual
console with fvwm running no config or a minimal config. I don't think you
need the exact commands to do this, but I may send you.

Maybe. But I would try to narrow the "#if 0" code even more so that there
is still no problem.

You may already do this if you define colorsets for iconified and
normal windows with hi=sh=bg.

If you still insist on having these options, I would do it similarly to:

  NormalTitleRelief width
  IconifiedTitleRelief width

where 0 means no relief, positive means "raised", negative means
"lowered" relief of that width.

NoIconifiedParentheses?

You are absolutely correct; I wasn't thinking of that - my bad.  As a
workaround we/fvwm could require 0.10.4+ (akin to xpm's minimum library
requirements, etc).  Chances are whomever wants Bidi support, he/she
would be more than willing to install a newer version of the library.
I'm sure there are issues with that over simplification, but its a
thought :-)  Mucking with autotools is never fun.

I primarily have access to a Sun running solaris, thus I'm afraid its
not much of an option.

That would be interesting to see.  Ideally it would be wonderful to
simply run fvwm and this code under a debugger and single step around
for a better feel for what is causing it to go into the weeds.  In any
regard, I'm all ears :-)

Thanks a heap for the help and attention to this issue.

How about running your debugger/fvwm in a screen session?  You can
then connect to that screen session once X is started up and work from
there, and if it bombs out you can restart X and connect to the
crashed session for some post-mortem analysis.

It is possible to think here in functions/types, not in versions. I ported
the code to at least fribidi-0.10.1 by replacing fribidi_boolean.
Otherwise I would need to add fribidi_boolean to the test program in
configure.in (instead of requiring 0.10.4, or is it 0.10.3 or 0.10.5?),
Of course when fribidi will provide the shaping support internally, we
will add this new function to the test program. But currently I see no
reason to require 0.10.4.

If you don't want your windows to go down, just verify that X does not go
down. This may be achieved if you start fvwm in the background using "&"
and xterm in the foreground in ~/.xinitrc, so that you may recompile and
launch another fvwm from this (or another) xterm.

I've not the time now. If Mikhael does not solve the pbs

I'm all for it. I don't think MultiPixmap does anything that couldn't be done
with properly applied multiple colorsets, and MultiColorset would probably do
more (e.g. transparency).

i have just started using FvwmWinList non-transiently (in addition
to core WinList command).  it brings back the memory of using
(t)vtwm.  best of all, it doesn't get in the way once minimized or
shaded.

now the problem...  after the first fvwm start, FvwmWinList doesn't
grow when additional windows are opened.  only those seem to be
listed which were started before the start of fvwm.

after re-starting fvwm, FvwmWinList module seem to recognize windows
opened after fvwm's first start & adjusts the list accordingly.  it
also behaves when windows are closed.

so my question is why FvwmWinList behave the way it does?  IOW, why
doesn't FvwmWinList recognizes new windows opened after fvwm's first
start (w/o the need of re-start)?

Yes, good suggestion. Thanks!

I also had some plans to enable reliefs for the icons themselfs also.
And then adding window frames (like mwm).
I think this will require adding some more coloursets (maybe allow
different coloursets for label and icon background, so that you can have
only the lables highlighting for example. And maybe 2 colursets for the
"window frame", this should probably use the same colourset as normal
windows per default...)
And I also looked at doing this for the ordinary icons. I need to figure
out how to draw into the background of the icon window, they seem to use
private visuals, I need to study up on this...

Yes, it does.  Without your config I can't say what goes wrong.

I just thought it was a better default.  Of course you can still
disable it in your personal config.

That had nothing to do with FvwmProxy.

Can you post a minimal config file and step by step instructions,

If you speak about ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults, it is only an example
configuration, it may include anything to help a user to understand the
usage, but it is not going to be included (read forced) for everyone,
just like we don't include any configuration for our 30 other modules.

I suppose Dominik only temporarily forced this file for everyone.

Mikhael.

We already have a Colorset and a HilightColorset style.  I won't
say anything against using more parts of the colour set in the
window decorations.  But why does it have to be in the BuggyStyle
commands?

Well, if we don't stop adding things, we won't have 2.6 anytime
soon.  Remember that 2.6 was planned as a quick follow-up to 2.4
to add some nifty functionality before the big clean up.

They are also horribly inflexible (all configs are global), buggy
(leaking memory) and unintuitive (*weird* syntax).

Wow!  I already mentioned that I want to put 2.6 into feature
freeze no later than 31st of December, did I?

My list looks like this:

 - Clean up tear-off menus (a huge task)
 - bug fix, testing, bug fix, testing, bug fix ........

In my eyes, adding the "Style by Id" thing would delay the next
stable release by at least a year.

I am not so sure.  Cryptic codes in integers are consusing to the
user and not self explaining.  I would add the additional code to
have options with specific names for reversed reliefs.

Actually, no.  In the case of FvwmProxy, I wanted to provide a
neat interface for module/fvwm communication.  We can hardly
expect that a normal user can write this on her own or copy it
from the man page.  Think of it as part of the deafult interface.

  ----------------------- snip ---------------------
  AddToFunc FvwmProxyShowFunc
  + I UnsetEnv FvwmProxy_S
  
  ...
  
  AddToFunc FvwmProxy_Mark
  + I SendToModule FvwmProxy mark $w
  
  AddToFunc FvwmProxy_Circulate
  + I WindowId $[FvwmProxy_S] $0 $1 FvwmProxy_Mark
  + I CondCase (Error) $0 $1 FvwmProxy_Mark
  ----------------------- snip ---------------------

But that does not mean I want this for every module.

As much as one likes some module (FvwmAnimate, FvwmBanner, FvwmTheme,
FvwmBacker, FvwmProxy) fvwm should be able to start naked without
requiring/configuring anything like this. The more configuration we force
for everyone the more an experienced user should undo for his own setup.

It is also unexpecting that the man page says something about the defaults
and a user gets something different. If FvwmProxy can't work without
defining some functions, it should ask fvwm to create them, but if these
functions are optional and configurable, one example implementation should
not be forced for everyone. I think the good solution is to mention in
the man page that to get one predefined FvwmProxy configuration a user
may include 2 lines to his config (but do not force these lines for him):

  Read ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults
  AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmProxy

That's exactly what we have in the fvwm core already.  Some
documented defaults just come from ConfigFvwmDefaults and do not
work when executed without it.  The idea is to hard code only the
settings that are absolutely necessary and rely on a proper
installation to get the rest.

That does not work.  A module can not guess what fvwm has already
defined.

It is only the default.  With the same reasoning, FvwmAuto should
not provide a default behaviour (raise on focus), and neither
FvwmAudio, FvwmWinList, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIconBox and
probably other modules that I am missing.  I postulate that every
module should come with a default configuration that allows using
the module.  In case of FvwmProxy you will still have to set up
some key or mouse bindings, but that should be all.

To be usable for anybody but experts, FvwmProxy *needs* that
configuration.  I would have hard coded it into FvwmProxy, but it
needs interaction with fvwm.  Of course not everybody needs these
functions, but on the other hand not everybody needs
WindowListFunc or UrgencyFunc either.  Unfortunately these configs
have to be executed at startup in order to not overwrite user
modified functions.

Umm, the whole thing is quite the lot.  I'm digging through it now.
Maybe it has something to do with some Style * ops.

I wanted the defaults to be optimum setup.  That's why I tried to put
press/release Alt into the defaults, sort of like how WinList Alt-Tab
is in ConfigFvwmDefaults.  It shouldn't hurt when you don't use
FvwmProxy and it does something other than absolutely nothing when
FvwmProxy is run without any user config.

When I press Alt, my mouse is all over the place: move window, resize window, etc.
I don't want whatever window proxy I happened to swing over last to pop forward
after I finish resizing some other window.  If the whole point of swinging my mouse
over the proxy was to raise the window, I can press left mouse when I get there.

Now, maybe we should have config functions for selection by various mouse buttons like
we have for a Hide after a Next/Prev.  Right now it's hard coded to raise/lower.
I guess that would be like:
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click1  Raise
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click3  Lower

fvwm-snap-20021119 fixes the xview "Paste/L8 changes focus" problem.


I still needed to make this change to focus.c to make xview take the focus
on a mouse click (clicktofocus).

xview Icons hiding in top corner on Restart also seems to have been cured.

now, un-shade the FvwmWinList, note the listing.  any new open

But it does hurt everyone. Try a mere:

  Key -Alt_L A A Nop

and see how Alt stops to work in xterm.
Actually I managed to make no keyboard work at all after this command and
some manipulations, only Restart using a mouse helped.

I don't worry about the exact FvwmProxy defaults as long as they are
private to a module.

First of all ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults is incorrect, it should include
DestroyFunc and DestroyModuleConfig to be ready to be included twice.

Second, I don't think the way you took is the best one. There are more
clean ways without requiring anything to be defined for every user.
And more intuitive for a user to define.

If we take FvwmEvent as an example you require now to include a file
that defines 40 functions (as the number of events) that look like:

  # this is the default for FvwmEvent callbacks, but a user may change it
  AddToFunc FvwmEvent_new_page
  + I echo new_page

  AddToFunc FvwmEvent_add_window
  + I echo add_window $w

Compare this to the way FvwmEvent works now, which is better?
I really hope you understand my point, because I don't want to expand it.
What is the reason to have AbortCommand if you don't expect a user to use
it to change the defaults? Here is how I would solve it.

The module keeps the default commands internally, if he needs a function
(this is not really needed, but anyway) such function with a name like
_FvwmProxyDefaultAbortFunc may be created on FvwmProxy startup, the names
of these functions don't need to be documented, because a user should not
use them (they will be overridden). Instead a user should define his own
function or maybe just include the full command inline:

  *FvwmProxy: HideCommand UnsetEnv FvwmProxy_S
  *FvwmProxy: MarkCommand WindowListFunc $w
  *FvwmProxy: AbortCommand MyAbortFunc

The default callbacks should be hardcoded in FvwmProxy.c.

Another possible solution/addition would be to have something like
*FvwmProxy: UseDominiksDefaults  that sets alternative defaults.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ah, ok.  I guess I don't use Alt constructs except for the WM.
Let's see ... ok, I guess I've locked out the Alt key.

For the other issue, if there is a Config default, which it's sounding like
there shouldn't, I feel the default EnterSelect should be false.

Part of the question was, for people interested in what the defaults are,
what should they be?  But everyone should be interested in making/following
precedence on how things are configured, ie. is the Action syntax a good
or bad thing?  It looks good to me.

I've just implemented the FvwmProxy Action command for Click(1|2|3),
pending checkin.

I vote that we don't run ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults by default and
let any defaulting live in the .c file itself.  I'm not quite sure
how to turn it off.

So then, what is ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults for, a sample that's redundant with
the man page?  Should I get rid of the things that have .c defaults?

I'm not really sure what FvwmProxy_Circulate does.  I don't think I'm using it.
All the other config Funcs seem to support it except SelectFunc, which I guess
I am using.

For consistancy, couldn't we just use the Action syntax, something like:

AddToFunc MySelectFunc
+ I WindowId $w Iconify off
+ I WindowId $w FlipFocus
+ I WindowId $w Raise
+ I WindowId $w WarpToWindow 50 50

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  MySelectFunc

I'm not sure about "Iconify off", since FvwmProxy current ignores all
iconified windows anyhow.

Also, I figured out the background problem.  The background was only properly
reconfigured with the use of MarkProxy().  Since I wasn't using the Mark
script functions, I guess I never marked.  So, I switched Next/Prev to
reuse the same functionality as the Mark.

One little question about Next/Prev, spcecifically to where it continues
relative to where it left off on a previous Show.  I had it so that it
starts back on the last selected proxy and then moves on from there.
But looking at an MS box, I see the first Alt-Tab moves on to the next window
immediately.  Is this the preferred functionality (convention vs. my intuition)?

The original purpose of  the ConfigFvwm files  for modules was for use
by the Setup Form.  (Accessed thru "Menu MenuFvwmRoot".)

The form puts a copy of the file(s) into the users $HOME/.fvwm directory
for customizing and creates a .fvwm2rc that contains Read commands
for the config files.

I'd just like to point out that the new redhat 8.0 has separated the rpm
--build option into it's own rpmbuild binary, and thus make rpm-dist
fails when trying to build rpm's of fvwm on a redhat 8.0 machine unless
the Makefile has been edited to reflect this change.

[snip]

As there was too much discussion to answer everything explicitly,
let me explain the logic behind the current FvwmProxy setup.

1) ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults contains essential configuratios that
   are meant to make the module usable for a beginner.  It is
   *never* included twice and thus the functions do not have to be
   destroyed.  Exactly like everything in ConfigFvwmDefaults.

2) In the design I have in mind, FvwmProxy does *nothing* by
   itself.  Every action is configurable via complex functions.
   There are no hard coded function defaults like "Click button 1
   = Raise".  Instead, there is a set of functions that are called
   at various times:

   Called by FvwmProxy:
   
     FvwmProxyShowFunc:
       executed when the windows are initially shown

     FvwmProxyHideFunc:
       executed when the windows are removed (implies execution of
       FvwmProxySelectFunc)

     FvwmProxyAbortFunc:
       executed when the the windows are removed

     FvwmProxyMarkFunc:
       executed when a window is hilighted

     FvwmProxySelectFunc:
       executed when a window is selected; same default as
       WindowListFunc

   These functions are *meant* to be modified by an intermediate
   user.  They are *not* hidden internal FvwmProxy settings but
   the correct place to configure module actions.  Why?  FvwmProxy
   needs to store the notion of a selected window in fvwm memory.
   This is necessary to make use of the conditional window
   selection commands.

   When we add different actions for the various mouse buttons,
   they should use FvwmProxyMarkFunc.  If that is not enough, add
   more "Mark" functions, a la FvwmProxyMark2Func, ...Mark3Func
   etc.  The idea is to keep all action definitions in the same
   place.

   The normal user is *not* supposed to use the
   "*FvwmProxy: ...Command" to configure FvwmProxy.  She should
   add lines to the complex functions instead.

   Called by the user (convenience functions to ease writing
   the config):

     FvwmProxy_Mark:
       mark a window, triggered by fvwm, e.g. by
         key f1 a s FvwmProxy_Mark $FvwmProxy_S

     FvwmProxy_Circulate:
       Use any of the usual window selection commands to mark the
       next window.  For example:
         key f2 a s FvwmProxy_Circulate Next (currentpage)
       The idea is that fvwm does the window selection and just
       tells FvwmProxy what to do next.  This obsoletes the "Next"
       and "Prev" logic built into FvwmProxy.

   These are convenience functions only.  It makes little sense to
   modify them.

3) Overriding any settings at module startup is evil.  It will
   *really* annoy users.  Never do this.  The only time settings
   may be forced is before the config file is read.  I agree that
   it's not such a hot idea to force configs that are used by
   perhaps 10% of the users.  It's just that I can't think of a
   method to trigger reading the defaults when either the module
   is started for the first time, any FvwmProxy config line is
   encountered or any of the default config is modiufied.

4) Comparing FvwmProxy with FvwmEvent.  That comparison is not
   valid.  After all, FvwmEvent is a module that is meant for
   various magic and scripting tasks.  Only experts should try
   using it without assistance.  FvwmProxy is quite the opposite.
   It is a high-level, user friendly GUI module that is supposed
   to come with usable and sensible defaults.  Even a beginner
   should be able to make good use of it.  Hence it requires a
   nice default configuration.  Just writing it in the man page
   and telling the user to cut and paste is not good enough.

5) About the individual defaults:  The defaults should be chosen
   in a way that allows a user to do something useful with
   FvwmProxy with the bare minimum of adding two configuration
   lines:

     AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmProxy
     Mouse 1 R M SendToModule FvwmProxy Show

   Then:

     (M-Click1):   Show proxies
     (Move mouse): Select a proxy with visual feedback
     (Click1):     Raise the window and hide the proxies
   
   And perhaps:

     (Click2):     Lower the window
     (Click3):     Something

   (I know there is still way to go before this works).  Of course
   we can discuss about the proper defaults, but the module should
   be usable with a minimal configuration.

6) Hard coding the defaults.  I think they should not be hard
   coded in the FvwmProxy executable because some require complex
   functions and some do not.  This makes configuring it a pain.
   For example, if you have this default:

     *FvwmProxy: MarkCommand <something>

   And the user wants to add "Focus", she has to issue:

     AddToFunc MyFvwmProxyRaiseFocus
     + I <something>
     + I Focus

     *FvwmProxyMarkCommand: Function MyFvwmProxyRaiseFocus

   Note that the user has to look up the current default in the
   man page first and add them manually to the new function.  With
   the current code she can just say:

     AddToFunc FvwmProxyMarkFunc
     + I Focus

   It is shorter and easier to use.  You do not have to look up
   any defaults in the man page.

7) My recommendations on the implementation of some new/current
   features:

     Next/Prev command:

       Remove them.  With the FvwmProxy_Circulate function they
       are no longer necessary.  Fvwm does a much better job of
       selecting windows as it is mobre versatile and has more
       available information.

     Click button <n> actions:

       Implement them just like the "Mark" command.  Add resources
       *FvwmProxy: Click<n>Command and default to 

         *FvwmProxy: Click1Command Function FvwmProxyClick1Func
         AddToFunc FvwmProxyClick1Func
         + I Raise

         *FvwmProxy: Click2Command Function FvwmProxyClick2Func
         AddToFunc FvwmProxyClick2Func
         + I Lower

         ...

   Overall, ad as little functionality to FvwmProxy as possible.
   Fvwm has most of the code anyway, so program the actual
   behaviour into complex functions.  This reduces maintenance of
   the module dramatically.

8) The initial idea behind ConfigFvwmDefaults was *not* to include
   them from the setup script.  The idea was to take the
   non-critical default settings from the fvwm source code and put
   them in a file that can be modified by the sysadmin.  I don't
   know what the other ConfigFvwm... files are good for, though.

--

To summarize the crucial point of the discussion:

What Mikhael does not like (correct me if I am wrong) is that
configuration lines (the contents of ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults) that
use up cpu and memory are forced upon every user.  I do not like
that either.  Present a reliable method to only include these
defaults only when FvwmProxy is actually used and I will use it.
Otherwise we have to weigh resource consumption against ease of
use.  I tend to prefer usability here, but I am not decided yet.

Bye

I still need a way to reproduce this.  The descriptions you posted

Because replacement for {Button,Title,Border}Stlye commands will lead
to interminable discussion which will end after the feature freeze.
I think this is in the 3.0 todo. Moreover, {Button,Title,Border}Style
are widely used

BTW, there is this in the man page:

	This command is deprecated and will be  removed  in
        the  future.

in the top of the {Button,Title,Border}Style commands. It seems
to me that "deprecated" means that these commands should not be
used. No? If yes which commands can do the same job?

Yes, I know. I think it is a very good date. Maybe the feature
freeze for modules can be delayed a bit. As I say this list
is optimistic. I will have to make some choice.

Or you sure that this will be so difficult. I do not ask for
conditional style.

Style * HilightColorset

Okay, that won't give us the MultiColorset things, but I don't
think they are this important for 2.6.  The advantage is that we
can keep the code unmodified in 3.0.

Well, I know most of the time it is that I just make the
decisions, chiefly because we lose interest in the discussions and
nobody cares too much about the outcome.  But I really think it
would be good to communicate more about strategy.  We (you, me and
Mikhael) seem to have orthogonal goals in many aspects.

Yes, absolutely sure.  It is very disruptive and requires a full
fledged rewrite of the style code - unless we hack up some
temporary syntax that is dumped in 3.0.

After a Restart, clicking into an xview window, the window wont take focus.
Holding down shift will allow cview to take focus and things will work after that till some other event operation (including Restart) causes it to break again.

For starters, what I'm looking to configure is quite different.
But that's good.  If we can get a couple fairly diverse setups going,
that should hopefully make it better prepared for whatever people will want
to throw at it.

My vision is such:
Hold Alt:
	proxies appear, no iconized or listskip windows
Press mouse buttons on proxies repeatly:
	browse through windows by raising and lowering them
Release Alt:
	proxies go away

Since I have no title bars, Alt also gives me a quick look at what
I've got, and whether my VIM files are modified or not.  Even with
title bars, this would show all the obscured titles too. I'll tap
Alt just for it's own sake.

To me, alt-tab is secondary.  While I'll certainly set it up, it's
not really in my habit.  With my tiny HH keyboard, I can move my mouse
nearly without lifting my wrist.  Alt-tab-tab-tab just takes more time
and attention.

The Config file looks very manacing, but I'll concede that you win on the
ability to use core Next/Prev functions.  Not really because of the code
redundancy issue, but by configurability.  I'll just have to make sure the
ordering is something reasonable (left-to-right?), not seemingly arbitrary
like the creation order.  I'd like to trim it down some.

First of all, I don't think there should be a default FvwmProxySelectFunc.
What if I don't want to raise or I don't want the mouse to move.
Then I have to DestroyFunc and start from scratch.  Undoing defaults
sounds very distasteful.
Can we just have FvwmProxy call FvwmProxyMarkFunc with a special ID
(is 0 used?) when ever Show/Hide/Abort is called?  Then we could drop
those three, at least the default UnsetEnv calls.  We might need something
more in the Circulate function.

The simple properties I added are the same as internal defaults, so we can
dump those.

As for the syntactic sugar, I kinda like

AddToFunc MySelect
+ I WindowId $w Raise
+ I WindowId $w WarpToWindow 50 50

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  Function MySelect

over an implied function to add to.  Is my recent infatuation with
the Action syntax misplaced?

Referencing the previous email:
2) I don't see WindowListFunc in ConfigFvwmWinList or it's man page.
Not in the man page for FvwmWindowLister either.  I hope that isn't
the convention we intend to follow.

3)  Unless I'm missing something, no one is suggesting overriding
user settings.  I think things like width should have defaults in
the module if no one has set it in any config.  I don't see any good
reason for simple properties in the ConfigProxy file.

4) If the default behavior is to do nothing, then I don't really
see any problem with supplying a cut&paste in the man page.
I'd much prefer that to a config file the naive user may not enen know about.
I really want to trim down the demonstrated config so that it isn't
a big deal.

5) If we agreed on everything, we wouldn't need .rc files at all.
But this is way different than my vision.  For one thing, I usually
have very little exposed root window.  I want to tap a key instead of
waving the mouse around searching for a bit of background.
But I think it'll take more than 2 or 3 of us to determine a sample
of the fvwm community.  If my case is absurd to the majority, I'll
have no problem being a carefully configured odd case, as long as I
actually can configure it.

6) Mouse actions should have defaults.  This is how WinList does it
and it seems to work fine.  Now for FvwmProxy_Circulate, I'm guessing
most people need to cut&paste the keyboard config explicitly if they want
to use Alt-Tab anyhow, so what's two more lines?
Since you have to start from scratch anyhow if you want to remove any
part of the default, I'd much prefer to very clearly spell out the
default in the man page and people can build their own versus manipulating
through additions to something they don't see.  What if the naive user is
assumming that FvwmProxyMarkFunc is a blank placeholder or don't realize
that the AddToFunc doesn't clear the elusive defaults.

7a) Ok, as long as Next order is reasonable and we can make
FvwmProxy_Circulate into something pretty.

7b) Conceptually, yes, but I would prefer following syntax by precendent:

*FvwmProxy: Action Click1 Raise

8) I don't think I added any Module without reading the man page first.
I'd lean towards just the man page.  Now if there's a global .fvwm2rc
that the sysadmin can edit, by all means.  I would be surprised if this
happens much.  I expect two groups.  Either nearly all defaults or tweak
every detail, all on a per-user basis.  Personally, I don't know anyone
using fvwm2 who isn't a compulsive tweaker.  Defaulters probably just stay
with KDE (not that I want to alienate the curious).

FYI:
Ive changed my windowlist.c to separate my apps by class (assuming theu were
already sorted by class).  Feel free to apply somehow to official code if
you wish.

eg:

app1 title 1
app1 title 2
------------
app2 whatever
app3 whatever
app4 whatever
------------
app5 title 3
app5 title 4
app5 title 5
------------
app6 title 6
app6 title 7


code:  not pretty but good enough for my porpoises.

// my new code - this goes before the AddToMenu that adds app to menu
int  classcnt = 0;
if (!ii || strcmp(windowList[ii-1]->class.res_class, t->class.res_class)) {  // different app
  if (classcnt || !strcmp(windowList[ii+1]->class.res_class, t->class.res_class))
    AddToMenu(mr, NULL, NULL, False, False, False);
  classcnt = 0;
} else classcnt++;

// this is the AddToMenu that adds app to menu
AddToMenu(
	mr, t_hot, tfunc, False, False, False);

an update ... i just noticed that a restart doesn't make
FvwmWinList to add new windows when it's shaded.

back to pre FvwmWinList days...

I've fiddled a little with the core Next/Prev and am a little surprised
by it's behavior.

Next seems to proceed through the windows, but not in any predictable order
and not even in a consistant order.  It seems to change order even when I
haven't moved any windows.

Prev only seems to flip between the current window and some other window
(last focused, maybe).  It is not the reverse of Next.

Direction seemed promising but it doesn't hit everything.  It skips right
past windows that are closer in the direction specified but farther in
the overall distance.  If some windows can't be hit, that makes it pretty
worthless.  And it doesn't loop around.

Unless someone can point out how I've misused these, this seems to oppose
my condition that Next/Prev displayed reasonable behavior.

I suppose we can keep the proxy Next/Prev and have circulate call
those if the user so desires.  It does make the value of circulate
appear a little weaker considering the potential confusion of the
Config file issue.

Or maybe we need an option or alternative to Direction to be "next in
the given direction only considering that primary axis or next in the opposing
axis if other windows have the same location along the primary axis".  That's
what FvwmProxy is doing now.  By the way, this is 35 lines of code, so
I wouldn't neccessarily get too excited about potential redundancy.

Also, there's no condition !WindowListSkip, although AcceptsFocus seems to
do the trick, at least with the one skipped window I have.

i just tried FvwmIconMan which also displays same behaviour: list
isn't updated while the module's window is shaded.

Next and Prev order are based on the creation order or the order
in which windows were focused, depending on the focus policy.  The
latter is the usua "Alt-Tab" behaviour.

Sounds wrong.  I have to check this.  Worked for me last time I
tried... No, still works for me.

I use Direction all the day with just N/S/E/W and I can always hit
any window.  But of course that depends on the page layout.

Yes, I think we should have some command that just scans windows
from left to right and top to bottom (configurable).  For example

  # "next" replacement
  ScanWindow Right Down (CurrentPage) ...
  # "prev" replacement
  ScanWindow Left Up (CurrentPage) ...

Essentially, this is just a different scoring algorithm for the
Direction code.

Unfortunately these things have the habit to grow out of control.
Changes are good that patches will soon get committed that add the
other conditional commands with additional options, etc.  Just take
a look at all the different options that FvwmWinList, FvwmTaskBar,
FvwmIconMan, WindowList etc. take.  They could all benefit from
the same window selection options :-/

Yeah, I prefer to use "Alt-cursorkey" with the Direction command
too.  It's much faster and more intuitive.

Actually, that is why I put this all in the defaults file.  The
normal user should not have to worry about it but can just add his
commands to the predefined functions.  Except the select function
that is.  It is currently just a copy of WindowListFunc.

Then terminate the proxy session with the "Abort" command instead
of "Hide".

The env var must be already set when the Circulate function is
called.  The stored window id is taken as the starting point for
the conditional command.  The env var is used to communicate the
currently hilighted window to fvwm so the circulation commands can
work with it.

It's just a duplicate of the equivalent

  *FvwmProxy: SelectCommand Function MySelect

we don't need it twice.

Too much to doo in too little time.  We document everything, but

Mikhael suggested that.

Right.  The "*FvwmProxy: ..." lines do not need to be in there.

The point is that the average user should be able to use the
module without worrying about configs at all.  And just think of
the default config file as the built-in default in a separate
file.  The situation is no different if the defaults are hard
coded, except that you then can not change the defaults easily as
a sysadmin.

Well, as a user, I would understand what

  key f1 x y someaction

does, but I would not understand why I need

  AddToFunc foobar
  + I SetEnv FvwmProxy_S $w

The latter is not user friendly.

Of course this will all be explained in detail in the man page,
with clear instructions what to do if you want to start from
scratch.  By the way, the naive user can safely assume that
FvwmProxyMarkFunc is an 'empty' placeholder that has some internal
logic to make sure the ...Circulate function can be used.

I don't think it needs to be pretty.  Simply explain the interface
in the man page.  It is quite easy to understand.

Keep in mind that we want to make using fvwm easier in the future.

I gave FvwmProxy a shot... and this config had me running 'KillModule
FvwmProxy' before you can say "emacs". Binding something to the Alt
key makes zero sense to me.

Learn about new colorset features from the man pages of fvwm and FvwmTheme
(but don't really use this module in 2.5.x). And NEWS, of course.

No round corners (or even colorsets) in titlebars in 2.5.4 yet.

Just a note, several browsers, editors and other programs use
Alt-cursorkeys.

Of course, this can't be important when we want to own the _whole_
Alt button. :-)

Jason wants "Action Select" syntax to be _instead_ of SelectCommand
syntax. For me either one may work.

I will mention that WindowListFunc is used in FvwmWindowLister.

I am not quite sure what does this mean. I would never suggest to override

Ohh...

Dominik, let's continue with the same meaning of all our Config* files.
They are examples, so they should include one example "*FvwmProxy: ..."
configuration. If you want to force some file to be executed (although
you should first describe why this is needed at all), name it differently.

I am a bit disappointed why you still insist on the module defaults to be
defined in a file that uses fvwm functions that should be read on the fvwm
startup. It is so clear to me that this is a plain wrong design.

I am not speaking about missing DestroyFunc in this file, I am not
speaking about this file removed by an accident and a module staying
without defaults. I am speaking about 3 things, each of which would
warrant we don't continue with this bad design.

  1) Loading essential module configuration when fvwm is loaded is not
     different than loading part of IE when Windows is loaded even if a
     user never uses IE, but only Mozilla, Netscape or Opera.
     This may not a very fair comparision, but this is what happens.

  2) By adding several functions as an essential part of the module they
     become the part of the module. Now the question is this. What should
     a user do to change the defaults? To use HideCommand or to change
     FvwmProxyHideFunc? Both are the parts of the module and both are used
     to define the "hide" action.

  3) Suppose a user decided not to use HideCommand and to change
     FvwmProxyHideFunc. Now he does not have any default, he can't revert
     to the default behaviour, because the defaults are not hardcoded.
     The module knows nothing about its own defaults, so it can't restore
     them by a user request.

I already posted a solution to this. There are defaults hardcoded in
FvwmProxy.c, so the following command may restore the default:

  *FvwmProxy: HideCommand

There are no functions that a user should destroy and recreate. Not even
FvwmProxySelectFunc, it's not needed, because unlike WindowListFunc there
is SelectCommand (or Action Select) here. He simply uses, say:

  *FvwmProxy: SelectCommand WindowListFunc $w

If you want several sets of defaults there is an option or a dynamical
command that sets (by a user request) several predefined actions at once.

Actually, I think the design should be even simplier. There is no global
state using SetEnv, the marked window is just stored in the module, then
instead of "FvwmProxy_Circulate Next (CurrentPage)" a user just uses:

  SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate Next (CurrentPage)

and the module resends "Next (CurrentPage) SendToModule FvwmProxy $$w"
with the marked window context (or null context if no marked window).

Then I don't see a reason to have ShowCommand, HideCommand, AbortCommand
and MarkCommand at all, there is nothing useful to configure here.

No, let me rephrase.  Let's say I only wanted Select to raise and I didn't
want it to move the mouse.  Or the other way around.  If I didn't want
anything at all, well yeah, I can abort.  But I might want a subset of the
"suggested" Select plus a little of my own choosing.  Personally, I like
'WarpToWindow 50 50' better than 'WarpToWindow 5p 5p'. In this particular
case, I can just tack it on and you never notice the first one.
But generally, that won't always work, like if I wanted 'don't raise'.

Hmm, my understanding of fvwm conditionals is pretty much nothing.
So by "can I" I really mean can I.  I'm guessing ...

	AddToFunc FvwmProxy_Circulate
	+ I WindowId $[FvwmProxy_S] $0 $1 FvwmProxy_Mark
	+ I CondCase (Error) $0 $1 FvwmProxy_Mark

means on the given window do $0..., if that fails because the var is undefined,
then do a $0... without any context.

I propose this be modified so that it also checks that the FvwmProxy_S is not
some special case.  Hmm, if I write a windowid of None to fvwm, what do I get
for $w.  If that doesn't fly, we can send it rootwindow since it will never
really get a proxy.  So,

if(id is undefined OR id == rootwindow) do non-specific $0...
else WindowId $[FvwmProxy_S] $0...

In that case we can dump those three functions, right?

No, I meant just one.  I was saying that I liked the Action syntax that
I saw in other modules and thought it was prettier then a lot of
SetThisCommand, SetThatCommand.

For the FvwmProxy_Circulate, I see the point, but I still lean towards
cut&paste over obscurity.

Do you have objection to pulling the Select config out and letting the
user define it all himself, with some manpage guidance?

FvwmProxy_Circulate and FvwmProxyMarkFunc, maybe.  I guess that includes
FvwmProxy_Mark, which is just simplifying FvwmProxy_Circulate.
Would you even mention them in the man page, or just tell people to
define their Select function, mouse actions and key bindings.

The external state env-variable still has me a little agitated.  There's gotta
be a better way to use the real Next (or from the addendum response,
the proposed ScanWindow).

I like the idea to distill off all the functionailty that the core
can supply.  That's good.  But something's still a little amiss.

As for Direction, take three big windows dividing the screen in thirds left
to right.  Add a little small window on the bottom, centered about 2 thirds
to the right.  Doing Direction East from the second big window goes to the
third big window, completely ignoring the little window.  With Next/Prev,
even if Prev was the reverse of Next, creation order tweaked by focus
order is pretty much the appearance of random.

On the Alt key, I'm wondering why Alt-anything is not passed through
if fvwm uses the Alt.  Is it policy that anything fvwm uses is never
passed through but other fvwm bindings can still use alt-something if
Alt is used.  If so, all this should be optional.  There's no logical reason
why if some fvwm module is spying the alt state why any mundane X app
shouldn't be seeing their Alt sequences.  And if there is a conflict, maybe
it's probably better that they both occur and I can say "oops, better fix
that" then to be banging on my keyboard because the menu shortcuts on
my WP never do what the manual says.

TODO, in my view:
Have a revelation on how to use core Next/Prev/ScanWindow without env var
Add ScanWindow to fvwm core
Investigate why Alt blocking occurs in fvwm core, maybe add optionality
Modify man page to use a less intrusive sample config (not mine, it sounds)

You lost other features vs the {Toggeled}{Active,Inactive}{Up,Down}
state and Buttons "bg". (Also you will be not able to get a gradient
textured with the root background :o)

An other risk is that user will style use {Button,Title,Border}Style
and do not switch to Colorset config (MultiPixmap).  On the other
hand, I am agree that using Style {Hilight}{Border}Colorset have some
advantages.  At present time I've implemented Colorset title bar's with
{Button,Title,Border}Style. I may change this. 

Mikhael an opinion?

One point is:

TitleStyle blabla Colorset 2
ButtonStyle all blabla -- UseTitleStyle

Colorset 2 a Hgradient

if we follow the current TitleStyle heuristic this is equivalent to

TitleStyle blabla Colorset 2
ButtonStyle blabla Colorset 2

which is totally stupid. What I've done is with

TitleStyle blabla Colorset 2
ButtonStyle all blabla -- UseTitleStyle

the gradient is applied/computed to/for the full window bar
(title & buttons).

Similary with

BorderStyle blabla Colorset 2
TitleStyle blabla -- UseBorderStyle
ButtonStyle all blabla -- UseBorderStyle

the gradient is applied/computed to/for the full window frame.
Moreover, 

BorderStyle blabla Colorset 2

IMO this is the resonable way to set the border with a colorset.

So, {Hilight}{Border}Colorset will be more natural but will
depends on some {Button,Title,Border}Style ...

Agree. I think I/we have time problems. 3.0 will be a good

Really, I will be very very happy to see Style by Id in 2.6.
I vote fort he "temporary syntax", but you decide on this
point.

Off topic:  what are actually the plans for that module?  I
thought we had agreed on *recuding* the number of window listing
modules.  Now it just looks like we get another of these modules
without the internal WindowList going away (?)

You said something about letting FvwmProxy install these defaults
and put a warning in the man page that they are overwritten each
time the module is started.

ConfigFvwmDefaults is no example, it is an essential part of fvwm
startup to provide the defaults documented in the man page.
Before this file was added, the lines were hard coded in fvwm.c.
ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults works exactly the same.

Sure, this would all work, and almost nobody would be able to use
FvwmProxy because it can be configured only by experts.  Enough
said, do what you want with the module, I will retire from any
further module design.

Then you have to do the same you have to do if you don't like the

This can only be done by an external program.  Fvwm has no way
to compare strings.

They are there mostly for completeness.  If any of the FvwmProxy
internal actions is represented by a complex function, all others
should be too.

Yes, actually I have strong objections agains forcing the user to
cut-and-paste.  That excludes at least 90% of all users from ever
using that module.  Just consider this:  you install a new program
you want to try and see it you can use it.  But when you start it
for the first time is print out a message:

  The developers of xyw could not agree on a sensible default
  behaviour.  Please follow the instructions in the man page to
  write a configuration file, then run xyz again.

I don't know what you would do, but I would immediately deinstall
the program and forget about it within five minutes.

As Mikhael suggested, it is possible to do without the external
state variable.  But only at the cost of sending twice as many
module messages:

  With SetEnv:

    "Mark xyz" -> module
    "Function FvwmProxyMarkFunc" -> fvwm

  Without SetEnv:

    "Next (currentpage)" -> module
    "Next (currentpage)" -> fvwm
    "Mark xyz" -> module
    "Function FvwmProxyMarkFunc" -> fvwm

As the module interface is extremely slow, I weigh performance
over a nice configuration here.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable way to pass it.  When you
press a key with a binding, fvwm automatically grabs control of
the keyboard.  This takes away the focus from the application that
had it before.  Many applications refuse to process keyboard input
when they do not have the focus.  You can't do anything about this
in fvwm.

I am perfectly aware why it happens - I just don't know what to do
about it.  The problem is that fvwm needs to grab the keyboard
while waiting for a key release.  Now, when a menu is opened, all
key presses are rerouted to the menu and the main loop never
notices that the key was released.

FvwmWindowLister currently does grouping by regular expressions.
It has a configurable format like "%m%n%t%t(+%x+%y) - Desk %d".
It will do submenus optionaly and other configurable things.
I think it may be easily supported. WindowList should not go away.

I just said that some private function _FvwmProxyPrivateFunc that should
not be described in the man page may be overwritten if such function is
needed (it is not needed). :)

You are right, sorry, it is already called ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults and not
ConfigFvwmProxy like other example configurations.

Actually it may be just "Next (CurrentPage) SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark",
because M_STRING already contains the context window as the first
argument.

In my suggestion there are no *Command options and no functions, just
SelectCommand or as Jason suggested "Action Select".
ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults file is not needed.

Please describe the functionality that would be missing. I don't see any.
Both "FvwmProxy_Circulate Next (CurrentPage)" and "SendToModule FvwmProxy
Circulate Next (CurrentPage)" are equally intuitive (or not intuitive) for
a user.

Reducing the number of configurable actions limits flexibility
severely.  When you don't have a "Mark" command, the module
response must be hard coded.  The same is true for any actions
that should be run when the proxies are closed or aborted.

I never said functionality would be missing.  I said inexperienced
users will not be able to run FvwmProxy.  Exactly like they are
not able to run FvwmEvent, FvwmForm, FvwmScript or FvwmButtons.

The config just too complex.

In this case I don't think that hardcoding the hide/show/mark/abort
functionality is bad or will reduce any functionality. But maybe I am
missing some usage. This is why I would like you to describe any missing
practical (not theoretical) usage if this configurablity is dropped.

My intend is not to make FvwmProxy harder to use or configure or be less
functional. Quite an opposite.

Mikhael.

I think FvwmForm is an exception.
The 4 example forms should be easy for any user
to run.  Making minor modifications shouldn't be too hard either.

Creating additional forms is pretty hard, which is probably your
point.  No argument there.

At http://www.goof.com/pcg/fvwm-menu/, I've put an exmaple fvwm2 menu and
corresponding rc code. 

There is also a self-documenting screenshot of my desktop + the full
.wmrc, which features XineramaSls, a really old fvwm config incrementally
updated to fvwm2 over the years. The config tries to implement the
following:

- clean and reasonably fast (ok, gradients crept in over time ;)
- the active window must be very visible
- lots of vortual desktops, overlaps reduced to the minimum
- no unnecessary clutter, large terminals
- syslog on root-window using root-tail

Hope you find this useful...

Full_Name: Tom Jones
Version: 2.4.11 - 2.4.13
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 8
X_Server: Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (128.16.10.151)


Dragging a window off the top-right or bottom-left corners of the screen
causes an immediate crash of fvwm. This is with a fvwm compiled with gcc
2.95.2 under Solaris 8. 

The problem is only exhibited under Solaris 8. Using the same binaries
under 9, the problem doesn't occur. The problem also doesn't occur under
Solaris 7 (using binaries compiled under Solaris 7). Under 8, the problem
is perfectly reproducible.

The machines on which this bug was noticed are a SunBlade 100s. When trying
it on a SPARCstation 20 (which is not an ultra), this problem does not
occur.

You can drag windows off the top-left and bottom-right corners just fine.

The problem occurs with all configuration files we've tried, and it also
occurs in the absence of any configuration file.

The behaviour is identical in both versions of fvwm that I've tried: 2.4.11
and 2.4.13.

The last few lines of configure's output was:

FVWM Configuration:

  Version:     2.4.11

  Executables: /opt/UCLCSxcontrib/bin
  Man pages:   /opt/UCLCSxcontrib/man
  Modules:     /opt/UCLCSxcontrib/libexec/fvwm/2.4.11
  Data files:  /opt/UCLCSxcontrib/share/fvwm

  With GNOME Window Manager hints?   yes
  With GTK support for FvwmGtk?      no: Failed to detect GTK, see
config.log
  With Multibyte support?            no: Use --enable-multibyte to enable
  With ReadLine sup. in FvwmConsole? yes
  With RPlay support in FvwmEvent?   no: Can't find working librplay
  With Shaped window support?        yes
  With Session Management support?   yes
  With Stroke support?               no: Can't find working libstroke
  With Xinerama support?             no: Failed to detect libXinerama
  With XPM support?                  no: Can't find working libXpm

I'll stop there for now in case you already know what the problem is, but
I'm happy to do a more detailed bug report if not.

 thanks,
  Tom.

Let's assume we have mark, unmark, hide, show, abort and select
commands (note that an unmark action does not exist yet).  Let's
further assume the user wants:

  Alt-Tab:  mark* next window, unmark* last window
  -Alt:  Select currently marked window, close proxies.

  * mark = bring window to the top of the top level layer
    unmark = lower window to default layer

With the predefined functions in ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults (plus
the hypothetical unmark function):

  key tab a m FvwmProxy_Circulate Next (currentpage)
  key -Meta a a SendToModule FvwmProxy Hide
  AddToFunc FvwmProxyMarkFunc
  + I Raise
  + I Layer <some options>
  AddToFunc FvwmProxyUnmarkFunc
  + I Layer <some options>

Note that the user only needs some knowledge about key bindings
(basics) and how to add something to an existing functions (also
basics).  Even a beginner should understand most of the config -
perhaps not the SendToModule part (which may be hidden in another
function FvwmProxy_Hide).

With hard coded defaults:

  key tab a m My_Circulate Next (currentpage)
  key -Meta a a SendToModule FvwmProxy Hide
  *FvwmProxy: MarkCommand Function MyMarkFunc
  *FvwmProxy: UnmarkCommand Function MyUnmarkFunc
  AddToFunc MyMarkFunc
  + I SetEnv FvwmProxy_S $w
  + I Raise
  + I Layer <some options>
  AddToFunc MyUnmarkFunc
  + I Layer <some options>
  AddToFunc My_Mark
  + I SendToModule FvwmProxy mark $w
  AddToFunc My_Circulate
  + I WindowId $[FvwmProxy_S] $0 $1 My_Mark
  + I CondCase (Error) $0 $1 My_Mark

You see the difference?  In the latter case the user has to worry
about the internal communication between fvwm and the module which
makes it very difficult to understand.  Even I get confused by the
complexity.  With that, the user has to learn how to write
complete fvwm functions, configure a module, read the man page and
copy the contents of the default functions into her config file.
At the same time she will hopefully not get confused by all the
abstract stuff from the documentation.

And just imagine what happens when you try to join the _Mark and
the _Circulate functions into a singe one.  I had to split them
because they require no less than *seven* '$' characters before
the 'w'.

Things may become a bit easier without keeping the marked window
id in fvwm, but also slower.

I'd really welcome a way that allows to have a nifty, easy to
understand default configuration and not requiring to enforce the
config at fvwm startup for every user.  It's okay if configuring
the module becomes rather complex when doing tricky things.  The
most inexperienced user should be able to

 - add something to select and mark easily
 - hide and show the proxies without configuring more than a key
   or mouse binding.

Can you compile fvwm with debug symbols enabled and fetch us a stack
trace?  With gcc/gdb:

   $ make CFLAGS="-g"

to build and then run and crash fvwm, locate the core file and run

  $ gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

Others may help out with the instructions for the SOlaris compiler
and debugger.

It seems like you don't get or ignore my suggestion. With it your
configuration above is as trivial as:

  Key Tab A M SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate Next (CurrentPage)
  Key -Meta A A SendToModule FvwmProxy Hide

This is enough for most of the users.

And if you think it makes sense to do something else (except for
hilightling the proxy) on the "mark", the module may still have 2 options
MarkCommand and UnmarkCommand (that are by default Nop).

  *FvwmProxy: MarkCommand Layer +1
  *FvwmProxy: UnmarkCommand Layer -1

Mikhael.

So, this would mean that Circulate implies a Show if not shown.
That's fine by me.  These two lines are easy to explain on the man page.

I really like this how clean this looks.  How slow is "slow" for using two
messages vs one?  I don't want to neglect older HW, for which fvwm lightness
is even more appealing.  Even if each message takes 100ms, we're only going
from one to two.  I remember in another module I was prototyping, I was
streaming tons of move commands, perhaps a dozen for each step of a mouse
drag.  I would naively expect that a couple messages would be less time than
it takes to redraw two proxies.

So does this scenario mean no FvwmProxyDefaults, or is Action Select set
to a secret _FvwmProxyDefault which is not generally appended to, but outright
replaced.  So I might have, for my unpopular config, something like


Key Alt_L       A   N   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Show
Key -Alt_L      A   A   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Hide
Key Escape      A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Abort
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Next (CurrentPage)
Key Tab         A   SM  SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Prev (CurrentPage)

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  MySelect

AddToFunc MySelect
+ I WindowId $w Raise
+ I WindowId $w WarpToWindow 50 50


I would probably use a condition more like (AcceptsFocus,CurrentDesk,!Sticky),
but that's just me.  Or I guess that would be CirculateHit, which I'll try.
And I would like to use ScanWindow East South and ScanWindow West North instead
of Next/Prev, given that ScanWindow is approved for inclusion to the core.

The Action syntax gives us a neat little internal table of defaults which
may be the equivalent of

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  Function _FvwmProxySelectDefault
*FvwmProxy: Action  Mark    Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  UnMark  Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click1  Raise
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click2  Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click3  Lower

Do we need the reactionary Actions Show and Hide if the config is the one
feeding us those in the first place?

Instead of _FvwmProxySelectDefault, we can define the conglomeration of
commands into the hard defaults.  Is there a one-liner syntax like:

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  Iconify off; FlipFocus; Raise; WarpToWindow 5p 5p

So, this would mean that Circulate implies a Show if not shown.
That's fine by me.  These two lines are easy to explain on the man page.

I really like this how clean this looks.  How slow is "slow" for using two
messages vs one?  I don't want to neglect older HW, for which fvwm lightness
is even more appealing.  Even if each message takes 100ms, we're only going
from one to two.  I remember in another module I was prototyping, I was
streaming tons of move commands, perhaps a dozen for each step of a mouse
drag.  I would naively expect that a couple messages would be less time than
it takes to redraw two proxies.

So does this scenario mean no FvwmProxyDefaults, or is Action Select set
to a secret _FvwmProxyDefault which is not generally appended to, but outright
replaced.  So I might have, for my unpopular config, something like


Key Alt_L       A   N   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Show
Key -Alt_L      A   A   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Hide
Key Escape      A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Abort
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Next (CurrentPage)
Key Tab         A   SM  SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Prev (CurrentPage)

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  MySelect

AddToFunc MySelect
+ I WindowId $w Raise
+ I WindowId $w WarpToWindow 50 50


I would probably use a condition more like (AcceptsFocus,CurrentDesk,!Sticky),
but that's just me.  Or I guess that would be CirculateHit, which I'll try.
And I would like to use ScanWindow East South and ScanWindow West North instead
of Next/Prev, given that ScanWindow is approved for inclusion to the core.

The Action syntax gives us a neat little internal table of defaults which
may be the equivalent of

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  Function _FvwmProxySelectDefault
*FvwmProxy: Action  Mark    Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  UnMark  Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click1  Raise
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click2  Nop
*FvwmProxy: Action  Click3  Lower

Do we need the reactionary Actions Show and Hide if the config is the one
feeding us those in the first place?

Instead of _FvwmProxySelectDefault, we can define the conglomeration of
commands into the hard defaults.  Is there a one-liner syntax like:

*FvwmProxy: Action  Select  Iconify off; FlipFocus; Raise; WarpToWindow 5p 5p

I don't think it is slow. Probably 100 bytes transfered over already open
pipes vus 50 bytes transfered plus expanding and executing a complex
function. A slowness should not be an argument here.

You may consider to do it this way instead:

  *FvwmProxy: Action  Select  WindowListFunc $w
  *FvwmProxy: Action  Mark
  *FvwmProxy: Action  UnMark

Actually [this is off topic] I think WindowListFunc was not designed well.
It should not get a window id as the first parameter, but should be
executed in a window context. Then all conditionals like ThisWindow should
work nicely if needed. Its default definition would be:

  AddToFunc WindowListFunc
  + I Iconify off
  + I FlipFocus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 5p 5p

that is much more intuitive than the current:

  AddToFunc WindowListFunc
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p

The modules should send "Silent WindowListFunc" with the window context.
I don't know whether it's good to change the WindowListFunc interface now.
I would try to do this even this means those who redefined the default
WindowListFunc, should do it again.

I don't think there is a real need for Show/Hide/Abort callbacks and even
Mark/UnMark. But I don't care here.

This is exactly WindowListFunc. I think WindowListFunc is a good default
for Select and it does not require any hidden _FvwmProxySelectDefault.

Mikhael.

Take a look at this screenshot (1Mb, sorry):

  http://fvwm.sourceforge.net/tmp/migo-desktop-20021122.png

I didn't polish it, just a quick hack. Looks nice.

The TitleStyle command (executed once) is slow, probably takes a second
or two, but a window creation and a window moving are surprizingly fast.

I didn't get an idea yet where fg is taken from, probably a bug.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Form Style {Hilight}Colorset. But there is maybe a bug with
Style {Hilight}BorderColorset and Title fg colors. I will
check.

I've written a mod to Direction where you can prefix the arg with Cycle,
like CycleEast and CycleWest.  With this option, all windows that meet
the conditional are guaranteed to eventually be hit and when there
is no "next" window it loops around to the worst match.  The primary
axis takes precedence and the cross axis is only used to break ties.

I'm having some real problems with conditionals.  If I use CirculateHit
or CurrentPage, I get no success, ever.  Any hints will help, but I'll
look into it more before I start complaining.  For now, !Sticky gets rid
of my pager and such.

Currently, my test config looks like:

Key Alt_L       A   N   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Show
Key -Alt_L      A   A   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Hide
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Direction CycleEast (!Sticky) SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark
Key Tab         A   SM  SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate Direction CycleWest (!Sticky) SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark

On my working copy, ConfigFvwmProxyDefaults is completely commented out.

Should I
	a. leave off the SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark and have FvwmProxy.c magically tack it on
	b. use some standard FvwmProxyMark (and get back into the ProxyDefault issue)
	c. leave it like this and hope people call the mark

I'd lean for a, but it's a little late to think straight.

Oh, the WindowListFunc and the $w,  I'd be happy to strip the arg off,
but we'll need some general buy-in first.

The config is 6 lines in the screenshot itself, should work with any theme
and "fvwm-root -r" background. Together with:

  ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle flat

Actually, I wanted to say that Colorset commands are slow a bit, but it is
ok, since they copy a huge image into memory. With simple backgrounds it
is fast. TitleStyle commands are relatevely fast, but it depends on a
number of windows. I think it should fly with a better CPU/memory/video.

Just repeated with the same and other backgrounds, the fg in
{Hilight}Colorset is black, but it is replaced everywhere with white now.
Yesterday it was gray or brown. I don't know.
{Hilight}{Border}Colorset fg is not used, anyway it is not white.

Another problem. Move a window, cancel a movement using the second mouse
button or Escape, the title is restored ok, but not buttons and borders.
They are restored on any focus/unfocus.

I like it very much. As I said the window movement is very fast and it is
almost smooth, but not exactly smooth. Try to move a window horizontally
from left to right or right to left. The image noticeably trembles.
Our perfect opaque Move for statical decorations becomes not perfect for
pseudo transparent ones. I wonder whether it is possible to use some
technique to make it perfectly smooth even it will use more CPU.

Mikhael.

I think Next and Prev with FlipFocus are broken, I saw it sometimes,
especially Prev. I will try to make a good bug report later.

You may do (a) and then if anyone ever wants it, add CirculateNoMark.
Or add both Circulate and CirculateMark now. It's your decision.

Actually, maybe just use another name for it (like WindowListFunction
or WindowListSelectFunc) when interface is changed, so it will not stop
working if a user redefined it. Any working suggestion is welcome.

When I click on the background the expected menu window (which should list
the currently open windows) pops up, but it is BLANK!

I have the same Linux distribution on several desktops and laptops, but 
this bug happens on only one station, namely a Powerspec 8260 distributed
by Microcenter. I wonder what it could depend on. Everything else works
perfectly.

and tinted. Be award that if you do not specify a bg colour then, in
addition the average colour of the image is computed (very slow).

I will fix these soon. Thanks for testing and point out pbs.

Some improvement is possible (and will be done). But I do not think
that it is possible to get smooth opaque move. We should redraw
with pseudo-transparent as we do not redraw at all with static
decoration ...

With both suggestions in-hand, I tried to run a debugger on fvwm while
running it (I've never done such a thing) and needless to say it was
a major pain with lots of freezing and rebooting, etc.  In short, I
didn't get anywhere.

I do have a possible idea of what is happening.  Mikhael/Olivier, this
might make sense to you guys more than others :-) so let me know if you
want further detail off the list.  I added a continuous assignment to a
Form-B glyph right above the first '#if 0' in the FBidiJoin.c file (say
to 0xFED3) and that failed.  Which leads me to believe that unicode
conversion within fvwm is failing (this would also explain why the same
code doesn't fail outside fvwm).  Does this make sense or ring any
bells ?  In other words, a glyph value of 0x0641 is fine where as 0xFED3
seems to trigger memory stomping - the difference there is how UTF-8 is
represnted and converted (are all UTF-8's within fvwm represented as
4-bytes since that could be the max size ? The difference in the example
noted above it 2-bytes vs. 3-bytes).  Am I barking up the wrong tree :-) ?

BTW: for those not familiar with UTF-8, here's a bit of light reading.

Version: 2.5.4, fvwm-snap-20021122

OS: Mandrake Linux 8.1, kernel 2.4.18
X_Server: 4.1.0
Submission from: (NULL) (64.185.2.4)


When using FvwmEvent with esd/esdplay, I sometimes get two sounds (slightly
asynchronous) for one event.  Invoking FvwmEvent in FvwmAudio compatibility
mode seems to fix this problem --- that is, I can't reproduce it when in
FvwmAudio compatibility mode.  The following is from my .fvwm2rc file when
using FvwmEvent

########
AddToFunc StartFunction
+       I       Module FvwmEvent
*FvwmEvent:     Cmd "Exec esdplay"
########

Adding a ``*FvwmEvent:    Delay 5'' doesn't help.  When in FvwmAudio
compatibility mode, I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file

########
AddToFunc StartFunction
+       I       Module FvwmAudio

*FvwmAudio:     Cmd esdplay
########

If you need more details let me know.  Thanks.

I have a suggestion.

When placing the file .fvwm2rc inside the directory .fvwm, I think it
would seem more natural to allow the name fvwm2rc or fvwmrc (without . ),
since this is inside a hidden directory.

I think we had a slight majority (1.5 vus 0 against) for using
~/.fvwm/main file name. :)  And 0.5 for ~/.fvwm/config.

name it whatever you want & use the -f option to pass the file
name...

  fvwm -f fvwm-config-name-that-you-desire

I just did a commit on a small core mod and some larger proxy changes.

The code czars may want to take look at fvwm/conditional.c to make sure
I didn't wreck the Direction command.  I'm pretty sure the non-cycle
code path is hardly even touched.

I did not edit the fvwm2 man page yet.  I'll update it if the changes
are welcomed.

Proxy has changed noticably based on the blend of suggestions I've gotten.
I updated the man page, but we may want to replace the sample to something
more palatable to the average user.  Suggestions welcome.

I'll look at the functionality later.  But in the mean time some
rules of the road you should follow when you edit files in the
core that I maintain (conditionals.c):

  * Please always add all the names of the functions you touched
    in the ChangeLog.
  * 8 spaces per tab
  * no more than 79 characters per line
  * please keep the formatting style of the existing code (e.g.
    placement of spaces)
  * give flags a meaningful name, beginning with a modal verb,
    e.g. "do_forward" instead of "forward"
  * When you use the constants True and False only use them with
    variables of type Bool and never assume they have a specific.
    value.  The code below is problematic at best:

      int ordered = (forward == (cross < best_cross));

    Instead it should be

      ordered = (!!do_forward == (cross < best_cross));

Overall I would prefer to move the new functionality into a
separate function.

That is not the point here.  Redrawing is done by the X server
which can handle any amount of incoming data at any speed.

Then perhaps you should do some profiling of the module interface.
Its performance is horrible.  The performance of this one module
isn't this interesting here, but it adds to the overall
communication.  Thus it further increases the chance of pipe
overflows and modules being killed due to timeouts.  My machine is
certainly not slow, but it does have these problems when I start
more than just a few modules.

Overwriting configs that may have been set by the user is a

Actually, the proper key name is Meta_L unless you have set up
your X server in a non standard way.

No, that does not work in other modules and it does not work in
this.  Fvwm does not guarantee to execute these commans in a
single batch.  Other things might be done in between.  For
example, the focus might be switched.

I think that is no valid reason for recycling WindowListFunc in
FvwmProxy by default.  It should still has its own copy of the
function for readability.

Actually, I chose an example that needs two commands as the mark
function on purpose.  Then, your approach does not work anymore
and you are back at writing the horrible complex functions I
posted.

This approach does work well and it is less horrible than others.
A user is not limited to any function name, he may reuse his own
functions like MyRaiseOn and MyRaiseOff if he wants.

Only if a user decides that internal Next/Prev are not good for him.
In the default situation there is the same number of messages.

fvwm should also be capable to perform such simple task as calling the
Next function and sending the window id to a module. If it is not capable
it just pointless to discuss any module communication at all regardless of
the number of requests (1 or 2) from a module.

Agree that a module communication should be improved in the core.

We never spoke about overriding user configs, only for supplying a default
when no user config (Action Select in this case) was supplied.

I didn't change anything like this myself and here are my results:

% xmodmap -pm -pk | egrep 'Meta|Alt'
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
     64         0xffe9 (Alt_L)  0xffe7 (Meta_L)
    113         0xffea (Alt_R)  0xffe8 (Meta_R)

If we already have a global function WindowListFunc, it is consistent to
use it as the default for all window list modules, not just the core.
(And it is actually used in at least 3 modules now).

The FvwmProxy man page should explain how to set the Select action.
Having something different to define (another global function) instead
of configuring the Select action is confusing.

Overall, I like how clean it is now. Of course I agree with your notes
about complying with the common code style.

By the way, this does not work at all.  How would FvwmProxy know
about the window that was matched with "Next"?  The correct line
is this:

  Key Tab A M SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate Next (CurrentPage) SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark $$$$$$$w

Please take a look at the "Key Tab ..." line above and say that
again.

I find forcing the user to fiddle with commands like

As I said, the internal Next and Prev will be removed as they are
a pointless duplication of code.  And when you originally posted
your example you said that FvwmProxy would echo the command sent
to it to fvwm.

Fvwm should have a stable module interface, but it doesn't.
Unless we rewrite it, we have to live with the limitations.

Oh, come on, the design is very clean, you just don't like it.
It's goal is to make module configuration as simple as possible.

Let me rephrase:  Overwriting *any* configs that may have been set
by the user is unacceptable.  Users will hate it, maintainers will
hate it.

It's not a window list module.

Thank you!  This is exactly what my approach prevents for a
beginner.  For a beginner, there is never a reason to change the
configured module action.  Instead, the complex function is
changed.  With the function-less default, a function has to be
used in addition to the moduele resource almost immediately for
any non-standard use.

> Overall, I like how clean it is now.

Well, I don't like it at all as it's user unfriendly and
unnecessarily wastes resources.  But I think I said that before.

Oh, and with the current design it's difficult to bind "Abort" to
a mouse button.  You'd have to say

  *FvwmProxy: Action Click2 SendToModule FvwmProxy Abort

Ugly.

It works because M_STRING packet contains the context window id as the
first parameter. Definitely, it is not the first module using the current
window context in fvwm->module and module->fvwm communication.

As you wish: It is clean and less horrible than others.
Like the man page states, it is:

  Key Tab A M SendToModule FvwmProxy Circulate Next (CurrentPage)

I can't agree here. It is intuitive to send commands to modules, like
start, stop, show, hide. We just should worry these commands are clean.

I don't think Next and Prev should be removed, they are just an intuitive
notion to move to the next proxy using some method, say, left to right.
But it is really not important for me whether you want to remove anything
in the code as long as the interface is the same (read: clean) as now.

I said this about the Circulate messages only.

I think Jason understood me. Together with the idea that the user should
not worry about something that a module should worry about, i.e. adding
the actual command to be recent back: "SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark".

So it is better not to have something than to have it in a spaghetti form.

Most of the things you do in the core I like very much.

But here the design is not clean and makes a module configuration complex.
If the authors of FvwmEvent, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIconBox,
FvwmWinList, FvwmAuto that all enable for a user to configure callbacks
would use your approach we would now have dozens of global functions like
FvwmAutoRaiseFunc, FvwmEventNewDeskFunc or FvwmTaskBarClick1Func.

FvwmForm, FvwmGtk, FvwmButtons and FvwmBacker also have many callbacks,
but noone thought to use global functions FvwmFormExecuteThisWhenConfirmed
or FvwmFormExecuteThisWhenCanceled.

Did you ever think that FvwmProxy like half of our other modules may
support aliases? So it is possible to run 2 modules and configure one
configuration for one set of keys and another for another set of keys.
Then it is immediately clear that global functions like FvwmProxyMarkFunc
or FvwmAutoRaiseFunc are bad.

There are much better solutions that are used in other modules.

Actually the proper solution for this is to be able to send to fvwm a
bunch of commands. I thought about this for some time. If a module sends
a string that contains more than one line, fvwm should create an anonymous
function for these commands and execute it. Or to execute them like within
Read/PipeRead.

It keeps an internal window list and applies some actions to windows.
Just like FvwmWindowLister is a window list module although it does not
show a permanently visible list of windows.

See above how other modules solved this.

Looks acceptably good and modular to me.
It is possible to make it shorter:

  *FvwmProxy: InternalAction Click2 Abort

But I am not sure adding alternative ways to achieve one thing is needed.

Full_Name: Todd Allen
Version: 2.4.13
CVS_Date: 
OS: RedHat linux 8.0 / kernel 2.4.18-18.8.0
X_Server: XFree86 4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (208.248.32.211)


This problem happens with a 2-headed display.  I'm not using Xinerama, so
the two heads are separate screens, :0.0 and :0.1.  The former is on the
left, and the latter is on the right.  Each screen has its own, separate
fvwm process.  And each screen also has its own virtual screen which is
larger than the screen's physical geometry.

A new window comes into being (from a new xterm) on :0.1.  It requires
manual placement.  

With some windows, I would slam them up against the left edge of the
screen, knowing that, with fvwm 2.2.5 at least, the mouse cursor would stop
there, and I'd get my window with a X coordinate of 0.  With 2.4.13, the
mouse cursor, instead of stopping at the left edge of screen :0.1, escapes
from screen :0.1 and starts moving around on screen :0.0.  The window
outline of the new window stays back on screen :0.1 and ceases to move.  If
I click while the mouse cursor is still on screen :0.0, it seems like it
takes whatever point I clicked there and places my window at the
corresponding point on screen :0.1.

With the current arrangement, I can try to finesse it by just getting the
mouse cursor close to the left edge.  But if I overshoot, my cursor ends up
on the wrong screen and way over near its right edge, when I really wanted
to be at the left edge of the original screen.  As a result, if I click
there, my window ends up at completely different place than I intended.

I'd like a way to get the functionality that was present in 2.2.5 back:
just don't let the mouse cursor escape from the current screen while doing
manual placement on that screen, especially since the window sure isn't
going to escape from the current screen.  Instead, just refuse to let the
mouse cursor progress past the edge and onto a different screen.

Incidentally, I tried this same example with 2.4.6, too, and it had a
different (mis)behavior.  When the mouse cursor reached the left edge of
:0.1, it would stay on screen :0.1, but switch it to a different area of
the virtual desktop.  Strangely, too.  If I was at the left edge of the
virtual desktop as well as the screen, it would switch to show me an area
to the far right of the virtual desktop.  Presumably that was fixed between
2.4.6 and 2.4.13.  I just mention it because I want to be clear that I'm
NOT implying it should revert to that behavior.

Whoa, I see it now.  Appending "SendToModule FvwmProxy Mark" is
hard coded.  You're not serious about this, are you?  What if the
user wants to do something else but just send "Mark"?  This
severly limits the kinds of functions that can be bound to
FvwmProxy actions.

Well, perhaps you should think a bit about who does 90% of the
maintenance.  We go happily about adding redundant functionality
(just the though of what is happening with FvwmWindowLister makes
me angry).  And in the end I do almost all the maintenance.

Yes, exactly.  And on the other hand we wouldn't have users
constantly whining "I want double clicks in module xyz", "why
can't I just bind any abc to module FvwmFoo".  Now tell me, what
is bad about global functions?  They simply work better than the
feeble attempts to fake them inside the modules.

It works out for FvwmProxy because it's an extension of the core,
that does nothing on its own.

Yes, I actually thought about it.  On one hand, running it twice
make absolutely zero sense, on the other hand, as I said before,
configuration becomes complex as soon as you run it in a
non-standard way.

> There are much better solutions that are used in other modules.

The only two modules that I can think of that have a clean
configuration syntax are FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 and the other modules
that don't accept module config lines.

The command line parser does not allow to separate multiple
commands and will never do so because it just wasn't planned.
Many commands just take the rest of the line and treat it as if it
all belonged to the current command.  The right solution is and has
always been to use complex functions.  That's what they were
designed for.

The module interface is already unstable at best.  Adding even
more features that require synchronization is not a good idea.
Fvwm already freezes way too often because of deadlocks with the
modules.

I don't know how you would work with it, but I would never use the
WindowListFunc with FvwmProxy because it works totally different
that the other window listing modules.  (I chose a copy of
WindowListFunc only to not have to worry about it for a moment).

Yes, I know how other modules solved this:  they didn't.  They are

Well, if that is your opinion, I think I am maybe working on the
wrong window manager.  I am struggling hard to improve fvwm's
usability and to clean up the most screwed interfaces, and all I
ever hear is that the current state is nice and changing it is
useless.  Fvwm will never grow beyond it's "flexible maybe, but
too hard to configure" image this way.

Huh?  Who is adding alternative ways to what?

This is just an addendum to msg 963.

No sooner did I send this off, that I noticed a related odd behavior.  :)

If my mouse cursor is, for example, on screen :0.1, and a new window
appears on screen :0.0, the mouse cursor changes into its "manual placement
shape".  But it remains on screen :0.1, and the window outline shows up on
screen :0.0 at location +0+0.  In previous versions of fvwm, it would haul
the mouse pointer over onto to screen :0.0 where the window was going to
be.  And I think that was good.  I'm mentioning it because hauling the
mouse cursor onto the screen where the new window is going during manual
placement seems closely related to keeping it there during manual
placement.

Hello,

I would like to add Native Language Support to fvwm by using gnu
gettext.

This should go as follow:

1 - Add checking for gnu gettext (in the libc or in an external
lib libintl). This concerns configure.in & acinclude.m4 and some
Makefile.am. These leads to some usual changes plus some strange
gettext hack.

2 - Adding a new directory po/ which comes from the gettext package and
modifying it for our use. Developer will be able to add catalogs (fr,
de, ...etc) set the C files where some string needs translation and
generate "po" files for translation. After translation, developers
generate the ".(g)mo" binary files from the .mo one's. So all these
po/(g)mo files will be on cvs and in the dist (no autogeneration).
make will do "nothing" and make install will just install the
(g)mo files. So users do not need the gettext package (only a recent
glibc or the good intl lib). Developers (which want to manage the
po/ directory) should use the same version of gettext
(last stable 0.11.5).

The good news is that it will be possible to --disable-nls and to
restrict the "catalogs" to install (using the LINGUAS env
variable). The bad news is that there is a few autoconf non standard
things to do. For example, the po/ directory do not has a Makefile.am
but a Makefile.in.in :o/ and the autogeneration of the Makefile is
strange. The gettext authors also suggest to add the intl lib in the
source to provide NLS support for those which does not have a recent
glibc or libintl. I do not think this is a good idea. For more info:
info gettext. 

3 - add the usual library warping stuff (FGettext.h and FGettext.c)

4 - replace the string (in the C code) of the form 

	"to_be_translated"

that we want to translate by:

       _("to_be_translated")

(needs some small workaround).

At this point we should decide which strings we want to translate.
Do we want to translate fvwm_msg (I do not think so, at least now)?
Do we want to translate fvwm options related msg (I think yes)?
Do we want to translate the "screen msg" (yes)?

5. Add a new "extended variable":
 
    $[gt.String]

where String is an arbitrary (ASCII) string. If the string "String"
can be found in the fvwm catalog replace $[gt.String] by its
translation. If not replace $[gt.String] by "String".

6. At this point we can use 5 for some of our samples (rc and Form).
This will gives translation for some words which are used in
a wm config and 5. will be more useful.
A problem is that it seems that xgettext is no able to properly
extract the strings to translate from a fvwm config file. We should
write a tool (in perl) that can build a "pot" file from a set of fvwm
config file.

7. A new fvwm command 

    LocalCatalogs dir [domain]

(better name welcome) which will look for translation into
an aditionnal set of "user" catalogs:

    dir/LL/LC_MESSAGES/domain.mo

with domain=fvwm by default. This maybe useful for project
as fvwm-themes or for administrator.

8. Do somthing special for FvwmScript


Objection? Comments?
I've already done 1 to 5 (at the experimentation level).

I think I will not continue this thread anymore, because the arguments
are the same and it seems they do not help. Here is the last attempt.

Please take a look at another messages where we with Jason discuss just
this. There are several solutions. One is Circulate and CirculateMark.

Why not to make it convenient and easy for a user that in most of cases
wants just marking? And if he wants something else, he don't need to use
FvwmProxy with Circulate for this.

I don't think we should fight here.

I really like how we with Olivier solve everything in fvwm-themes.
It sometimes happens (very rarely, but still) that we don't agree on
something. Then we keep both solutions. One that he maintains and one
that I maintain. You don't maintain fvwm-menu-* scripts or perllib or
FvwmWindowLister, FvwmPerl and from now on FvwmDebug and FvwmGtkDebug.
So why should you ever be angry if some users and developers are really
happy to have these things?

No, all the modules above do not make feeble attempts to fake them inside.
They simply allow a user to use any function name he wants, not any
hardcoded name.

Global functions are evil for modules.

  * problems with name cluttering
  * monolithics vus modularity
  * problems who and when defines/redefines such functions
  * having hundreds of functions for modules that a user does not use
  * this disallows more than one implementation of a module

Functions are designed to combine commands, not to write module
configurations. Functions may be bound to module callbacks if a user wants
to combine several commands, but global functions should not be forced.
Otherwise we get one big spaghetti that may seem to be "manageble" for
simple setups, but not for more complex/configurable/dynamical setups.

Everything may work with global functions. This does not mean it is the
best solution. I prefer to keep it consistent with how other modules work.
Without inventing any new syntax using specially named global functions.

Of course if you make it depend on global functions it makes zero sense
to run it twice. A user has no a chance.

Without a fully functional alternative, it is pointless to say that you
don't like all 25 modules that use configuration now.

Then every single module should do the redundant work that fvwm may do.
A module should just send several commands without worrying about
creating any function:

  SendText("Beep\nNext (xcalc) Close");

and fvwm should create an anonymous function or run a stream just like
it does now it with Pipe/PipeRead.

fvwm should not do any synchronization with a module to execute
all commands passed in one string.

FvwmProxy was designed as a possible WindowList replacement.
A user usually wants the same function in both when a window is selected.
But, anyway, this is only a default that works well.

First, this is not true. I mostly like all your work on the core.
But when you say that some things are screwed (like SendToModule as the

But what is your own solution here for 2.6.0? This one:

  *FvwmProxy: Click2DoesAbort

? Or maybe this:

  Function SetFvwmProxyAbortingProxiesOnClick2

with this global function defined in the Defaults file?

I really understand your feelings. But let's postphone this discussion for
3.0. You will see I am the less conservative person ever. The only thing I
worry about is a good extendible design, everyone benefits from it, users
and developers.

Dominik, I am a very reasonable man, you may easily make me fight for your
own design, just present a good one. If I disagree so loudly it means this
design is really bad in my eyes and it worths to look at my arguments.

Mikhael.

Please note I didn't update the cvs for your latest commit yet.

It is the same config I mentioned earlier with the first 3 lines added.
Save it in ~/.fvwm/transdecors:

  Colorset 1 fg red   # you may have "bg red" instead, it does not matter
  Style * Colorset 1, HilightColorset 1
  PipeRead 'fvwm-root -r `fvwm-config -d`/themes/metal/images/background/metal-tile.xpm'
  Colorset 41 RootTransparent buffer, tint cyan 15
  Colorset 42 RootTransparent buffer, tint red 15
  BorderStyle Active Colorset 41 -- flat
  BorderStyle Inactive Colorset 42 -- flat
  TitleStyle Active Colorset 41 -- flat
  TitleStyle Inactive Colorset 42 -- flat
  ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle flat

Now start 'fvwm -f transdecors' using another X (don't restart with it!).
Start any number of windows.
I see cyan fg everywhere, not red or black (if you didn't define fg).

Now do "Restart" or "Restart fvwm -f transdecors". It core dumps.

My first reaction for including this was negative. But when I think more
about it, users in euro-asian (and other) countries should like this.
I predict a lack of translation maintainers, but this should not be a
reason not to have it. I may maintain 2 languages, but I prefer someone
else to do this if possible. :)

I will add fvwm-config --fvwm-localedir or similar.

Is it possible to have something like  msg = _(msg);  in fvwm_msg
itself? If yes, it may be done. We don't need to actually translate
every string (or any string) if I understand it correctly.

Ok.

Seems very useful, without this I would be less enthusiastic.
Just a note, String should be able to contain '\n' and '\]'...

I don't think we need to translate our samples. And if we translate them
I can't see how it is possible to create a list of messages automatically.
It is an AI job to decide whether "red" should be translated or not.
This is not needed, IMHO. Also try this:

  perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /"([^"]+)"/' file1 file2

LocalePath? Similar to our other *Path commands.

  LocalePath /usr/share/locale;fvwm:+:/opt/fvwm/locale

Both dir and domain may be optional if there is ";".
Dir defaults to $datadir/fvwm/locale.

Hmm, I see what you mean. :)

I just thought about how it is possible to add the gettext support to
perllib and I see a pretty good solution.

Maybe not. fvwm makes some UTF-8 conversions (others are done by
iconv). I am not sure that these conversions are safe in certain
case. I should take a look.

Hi

I just saw Mikhail's great transparency thing and tried it with today's
CVS version, and I must say: Cool! :)

But: How can I apply the transparency to my menues? I tried several
things, like

MenuStyle * MenuFace colorset 41   
[FVWM][menustyle_parse_face]: <<ERROR>> unknown style colorset: colorset
41

and 

MenuStyle * MenuFace UseDecor Clean
[FVWM][menustyle_parse_face]: <<ERROR>> unknown style UseDecor: UseDecor
Clean

and so on, but always without success.

Any hint?

TIA

Andr

This is futile.  You don't even listen to my concerns about
usability, do you?

Get real.  Nobody is answering bug reports regularly except me,
regardless of the module they are found in.  I am extremely
unhappy with all the redundant and a lot of the new code that
appeared in the last year.  Maintenance now eats up more than 90%
of my time and I hardly ever get around coding something useful.
I must confess that I am close to quitting fvwm maintenance and
either concentrate solely on new features or begin from scratch.

If you say so.  Not that it makes any difference regarding memory
or speed.

Nonsense.  As I said - I do not know how often - configuration
just becomes complex in this case.  To get a different config for
a second invocation, it's back to cut and paste from the man page.

I disagree, and I will not allow anything like this into the core

I say that because fvwm's usability is a catastrophe.

Very funny, but not quite related to what I proposed.

I don't think I will see a 3.0 release.  With what has happened
since 2.4, I think it's useless even to try cleaning things up.
The task has grow so immensely that I can not believe I ever find
enough time to to this.  I don't even get around finishing the
things I started after 2.4.

Ever considered to take a look at the MenuStyle entry in the man page? :)

The syntax is:

  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6, GreyedColorset 7

  Colorset 5 RootTransparent, bg .., fg .., Tint ..

In decoration colorsets you seem to need "RootTransparent buffer" instead.
If you have enough memory, I suggest to always use "buffer", this makes
things much faster, in colorset 5 in particular.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, if we do not setup a gettext infrastructure we will be sure to

When I say "translate our sample" it just means to replace certain
strings as
 
	+ I "Programs" Popup MenuProgram

by

	+ I "$[gt.Programs]"  Popup MenuProgram

then we should be able to extract only the String which appear
as $[gt.String] from our rc sample:

	perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /\[gt\.(.*)\]/' file1 file2

(is this ok in all situation?).

The special thing is to just add gettext support to FvwmScript.
As fvwm read the config for the modules, modules will do
not need gettext support. Only FvwmScript and FvwmTaskBar need
it (I think).

With a big root pixmap this will be very slow. One thing that slow
down colorset loading is that if you use a pixmap and you do not
specify a bg colour, then bg is set to average by default. I do not
know if this default is good. One thing that we can do is to limit the
number of pixels for the computation of the average colors: just
used at most 76800 pixels of the image. What do you think?

I am still unable to reproduce any fg colour pbs.

It is not so slow. If we disable the bg average default what will be
the default, gray? I am not against this, but I think "bg average" is ok.
277*277=76800 pixels from the middle of the image? I don't know.

So you correctly get it red (or black)?
With this configuration it is always cyan (rgb:00/ff/ff) for me.
Even icon title fg.

The following is ok in all reasonable situations:

	perl -ne 's/\[gt\.((\\.|.)+?)\]/print "$1\n"/ge' file1 file2

i.e. with something like:

	+ I $[gt.Programs] Exec xmessage $[gt.\[Error\] Can't read file]

$[gt.Programs] properly adds quotes, so should not be placed in quotes.

The options you are looking for is MenuColorset, ActiveColorset
and GreyedColorset.

I had to remove this bug report.
There is insufficient information provided to figure this out.

Is the menu is full size, but just one color? perhaps you have
the foreground and background set to the same color.
Or perhaps color allocation is failing, if you have a limited color
map.

If you are still having a problem, send more details to

fvwm@fvwm.org

you don't have to subscribe to the list, we will copy you
on the response.

What information would you need? Fact is this is such an unusual bug that I
cannot make a working hypothesis---and then who knows how much information
will be enough?
Thanks

I think the menu you are refering to is the WindowList.
Is it?

Is the menu full size?  Ie. if there are more windows, the window
should get larger.  Does it?

What color is it?

Do you have a limited colormap?  (Type xdpyinfo, post the output.)

Yes, seems to be fixed. But now I get another core dump that I didn't.
If I point to any icon title that should be expanded, it core dumps!
Short texts in icon titles are ok, since there is no expanding.

I hope the fact that it started only today/yesturday helps.
I do _not_ use any transparency when this happens or even E root.
Tell me if this info is not enough.

I am writing this to sour out my thoughts.  Should you feel the
urge to reply, *please* reply to the mailing list, not to me in
private.

--

This is my view of the current state of affairs:

 Fact 1: Fvwm maintenance and looking after the mailing lists eats
         up the majority of my time available for fvwm work.  My
         inbox is notoriously overflowing (> 400 mails right now)
         and I long begun avoiding to read email at home because
         of the sheer amount of open bug reports that have to be
         resolved before moving on to developing.

 Fect 2: I feel like I am doing all the maintenance alone.

 Fact 3: I am becoming very frustrated by fvwm's design - or
         better: the absence of a design.

 Fact 4: I am very frustrated by our inability to write something
         usable and ituitive, not just powerful.  

 Fact 5: I begin to hate the time spent with fvwm development.

Please do not argue with me about these facts - that is what I
think.

--

Apart from other obvious conclusions I could draw from above
facts, I am toying with the thought of starting a new project that
combines the virtues of fvwm (lean, fast, flexible, modular) with
a solid design that somewhat resembles the idea of a policy free
microkernel as in Hurd.

The bare kernel would tackle only the most basic tasks like
sending and receiving events, providing a generic event interface
to the various extensions, relaying messages between the
extensions.  It might not even be aware of the windows.

Anything else would go into the extensions.  Some examples are:

 - Managing Xlib calls.
 - Managing the window structure.
 - Layout of window reparenting structure.
 - Layout of window decorations.
 - Handling of icons.
 - Font handling.
 - Handling X events.
 - Handling various hints (GNOME, EWMH, OpenView, XWM...Hints)
 - Command language shell.
 - Modules (pager, window lists etc.).
 - Moving windows.
 - Resizing windows.
 - Handling the input focus.
 - Menus.
 - Managing permissions.
 ...

The idea is that everything that happens in the wm is translated
to a kind of internal event and sent to the core.  The core
relays the events to the appropriate extensions so that they can
do whatever is appropriate.

None of the extensions are mandatory.  For example, if you do not
want window decorations and menus, you just do not load the
corresponding extensions.  The bare core does little more than
relaying events, defining the event types and informing X that a
window manager is running.  By the design of the iterfaces
(extensions do not know about each other) any extension can be
omitted or exchanged by a different one implementing a different
policy.  For example, there can be a number of extensions handling
window placement policies.  This allows to run the window manager
as a minimal program that just distributes the input focus among
the windows, or in mega-bloat-mode, loading every possible
extension.  Unused extensions do not even need to be compiled.

Other core ideas:

 - There is no module interface.  Modules are just normal
   extensions.
 - There is no built-in configuration language.  A command shell
   can be implemented to translate syntax into events.
 - There is no more distinction between window styles and states.

Some consequences of the design:

 - The source of the events is transparent to the extensions.
   Thus, the flow of events could be recorded and replayed later
   without the window manager even noticing.  A simple /bin/sh
   script could move and resize windows as the user would with the
   mouse, or provide EWMH icon hints, or cause windows to redraw
   by faking X events etc.
 - The client generating input can be chosen freely.  In this
   respect, there is no difference between keyboard shortcuts,
   menus, "modules", a shell or perl script, the X server, and so
   on.
 - Any event source can be controlled in detail.  It is easy to
   distinguish between requests from the program, a user action,
   a default "style" provided by the user etc.  It is equally easy
   to control which action is allowed and which isn't.

Some problems to solve:

 - Efficient core-extension and extension-extension communication.
 - Dynamic loading of extension hierarchies.
 - Dynamic management of window, desk, menu and other structures.
 - Dynamic extension of the command shell/command language.
 - Hiding the X server from the extensions.
 ...

anything.

I think that patch has to be backed out.  I can't think of a way
to make it work reliably with a radical redesign of fvwm.

I think that should just be documented.  Shaded windows can not
resize themselves as this causes a lot of trouble.

They're working perfectly for me.  I map alt-press and alt-release
and I can still do alt-f, etc in my browser.

man fvwm2 already says:
	Note:  Some  X servers do not support KeyRelease events.  Selec-
	tOnRelease does not work on such a machine.

Can't we just say that the -Key bindings are also not supported on some
machines?  I think we're getting closer to a pretty refined FvwmProxy
and I'd hate to throw all that away (or have to go back to polling).

Do key release bindings have any negative effect on anyone who
is not using them?

come through, did it got trapped in the spam filter?

I made a patch that adds the following options to FvwmIconBox.

*FvwmIconBox: NoIconifiedParenthese

Turns off the parenthesis around the titles of iconified windows.

*FvwmIconBox: NormalTitleRelief num

Sets the width of the relief for the title of uniconified windows (0 no
relief).

*FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleRelief num 

Same for iconified windows.

I didn't implement inverted reliefs (as someone suggested), I could add
this also, if it's considered a useful feature.

PS: The first time I sent this it didn't get to the list. Then I gzipped
the patch. was it trapped in the spam-filter?

Hello,

I have fvwm-2.4.13.
It seems to me that numeric keypad is ignored, this is what I tried:

1) In XF86Config commented out 
#  Option       "XkbLayout" "cz"
to make sure only US keyboard layout is turned on

2) my .xinitrc has the only line
exec fvwm2

3) I wrote only these two lines in my .fvwm2rc
Key KP_1           A       CM      Exec exec xterm
Key 2           A       CM      Exec exec rxvt

By pressing Alt+Ctrl+2 (not numeric) I can start rxvt
But I am unable to start xterm any way. I tried to run
xev
and it confirmes that the key I am pressing on numeric
keypad really is KP_1.

On the console I get error message
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: KP_1

Does KP_number have a different name?
Thank you,
Jan Martinek

Yes, I should check the fg code.

That is just after:

I made a patch that adds the following options to FvwmIconBox.

*FvwmIconBox: NoIconifiedParenthese

Turns off the parenthesis around the titles of iconified windows.

*FvwmIconBox: NormalTitleRelief num

Sets the width of the relief for the title of uniconified windows (0 no
relief).

*FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleRelief num 

Same for iconified windows.

I didn't implement inverted reliefs (as someone suggested), I could add
this also, if it's considered a useful feature.

Can you try again with my last commit? Maybe the fg colours

No, I see no difference.

I can't reproduce core dump now. But this does not mean much.

Here is the history. Yesterday I ran fvwm from yesterday that core dumped
when any title is expanded. X initially exited and I started X again (so it
can't be because of global root pixmap). I did: while true; do fvwm..; done
Since I always use icons, I point to icon titles from my habbits, it core
dumped several times for me, but today it didn't (even without your latest
commit). With this commit I also can't reproduce a core dump now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

For several days now I see this nasty problem.

I have a lot of windows on 4 desks and 2x2 pages. I restart from non desk
0, say desk 1, and undecorated windows from the same page and any desk
appear on the visual page during Restart, then fvwm changes desk and only
the windows that were initially on that desk (and page) are reparented.
Other windows (from desk 0 at least) stay as unmanaged on top of all
managed ones.

This is "solved" by doing Restart from desk 0. But then the previously
unmanaged windows end up on Page 0 0 or in some invisible place.

Can someone reproduce this or should I give more specific instructions?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fvwm already uses:

raised/sunk/flat

since this controls width, its a bit like borderwidth.

Maybe

*FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleBorder flat|raised|sunk
*FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleBorderWidth num

I do not answer because I have no opinion. If you want I can
remove these options. I am not the "author" of the GNOME
code.

Well, it's not a question of wanting or not wanting, but
eliminating feature selection via configure.  We have *way* too
many unnecessary configure options again.

With the attached config (please no discussion about whether the
config should look like this - it works), when a window is not
iconified, a brown rectangle is drawn where the mini icon should
appear in the windows buttons, left of the title.  Works fine with
2.4.

I think this is the same or a similar problem as the crash that
Bob Vloon found.  The faulty code is this (xmanager.c,
iconify_box(), appeared between 2.5.2 and 2.5.3):

	if (FMiniIconsSupported && man->draw_icons && win->pic.picture)
	{
		if (iconified == 0 && man->draw_icons != 2)
		{
			XFillRectangle (
				theDisplay, man->theWindow,
-->				man->backContext[contextId],
				g->icon_x, g->icon_y, g->icon_w,
				g->icon_h);
		}
		else
	...

The man->backContext[contextId] GC is "None" when it is called.

Filling the place where the icon appears with a solid colour is
just plain wrong as it negates any effort to achieve transparency
or gradient effects.

I wanted to look at the binding.c build problem, but I can not
even run aclocal:

  $ aclocal
  aclocal: configure.in: : macro `AM_PATH_PROG_WITH_TEST' not found in
  library
  aclocal: configure.in: : macro `AM_PATH_PROG_WITH_TEST' not found in

Log message:
* Fix for compilation without stroke.  FYI:  Variables declared with the
STROKE_CODE macro must be declared last.  Without STROKE defined,

STROKE_CODE(int i);

becomes

int j;

This does not compile because its a declaration after a code statement.

Yes, but then it's not indented correctly.

Yes, it should not be forgotten.

I think it should be replaced with a new command line utility fvwm-exec.
I would like to find a way to do it without FvwmCommandS similarly to how
fvwm-root tells fvwm it changed a root image. I may check whether it is
possible to communicate using X dirrectly and, if yes, will do it later.

fvwm-commands is a good name too since it will read multiple commands
either from a file (-f file) or stdin (unless -c "cmd" option is given).
Which name do you prefer: fvwm-commands, fvwm-command, fvwm-cmd,
fvwm-send, fvwm-exec? I prefer fvwm-exec or fvwm-commands.

Later we may add an fvwm command RemoteCommands on|off|restricted.
The default may be "restricted" that disables Exec, PipeRead and modules
with "/" in the path. But on the other hand it may be confusing that Read
is allowed and PipeRead is not, so other default would be ok for me too.

If the default is "on" then, in addition to removing FvwmCommand/,
FvwmConsole may be removed as well (it is just "xterm -name FvwmConsole
-e fvwm-exec").

Regards,
Mikhael.

Scripting by using roundtrips to the X server?  I don't think that
is a good idea.  On one hand it is far slower than even the
current module interface.  And on the other hand it creates a lot
of problems with permissions and opens even more security holes.

If Mozilla/Netscape is any example, I agree with Dominik, its horribly
slow.

I hate breaking  compatibilty, more than I  dislike inconsistency.   If
you change the name, please consider providing a link to the old name.

I agree that FvwmCommand is a security exposure.  Users should
only use it when they have their environment under control.  Its good
that it needs to be explicitly turned on.

I have a question about these:

 18) Split style lists into 5 (resource, class, icon, name, id).
 19) Styles get applied in the above order.
 20) Split each style list into two (one with wildcards, one without).

The current way style commands work is that the last one given takes
precedence.  Won't 20 and possibly 18 and 19 break that?
Won't that be too hard for a user to understand?


On another subject, I'm pretty sure I heard (read|saw) Dominik make some
comment about modules using stdin/stdout instead of the FDs that they
use now.  I guess that would kill off that array of longs being
passed, instead plain text commands could be passed to the module.
Possibly modules could be tested outside Fvwm.  It sounds like
a great idea to me, but it didn't make the todo list.

Maybe it doesn't belong on the todo list, Dominik has said that
the pipes are too slow.  I haven't seen that myself, FvwmAnimate
seems to be very responsive.


On a similar note, theres this:

  6) Change FvwmCommand to use the socket and readline, remove FvwmCommandS.

This is sockets  instead of X properties.   Doesn't  X use  pipes when
$DISPLAY is not a host name (:0.0), for performance reasons?

I think the other 2 choices are shared memory semaphores and dlopen.

Shared memory can be fast (I don't have numbers), but when I configured
XSun to use it, it didn't make any noticeable difference.  I have run
into applications that can't get enough shared memory and I've needed
root access to get past that problem.

I think the dlopen APIs would be as fast as we could get, but I'd
guess they would cause portability problems.

The communication should not be done using X, only a notification of such
communication. I think it is better than sending a signal, because this
requires knowing a process number. After a notification the comminication
may be initialized just like now, using local pipes in /tmp or similar.
Then nothing will be changed regarding security.

Yes, if any of FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS/FvwmConsole are to be removed,
they will be replaced with wrappers in 2.6.x. I don't want to remove them
at this point. I want to try to implement fvwm-exec first and then think
whether something is redundant.

Ok, the default may be "off" until we define a better way.
A better way may be to have it "on" for the same local user.

Mikhael.

I already wanted to report both of these, but you fixed it. Nice.
Actually, for me it was xterm with S or E gravity travelling to the NW
after Quit/Start.

No, the name is correct.  The error message means that the key
symbol is not bound to any key at the time the binding line is
processed.  "xmodmap -pke" should not list KP_1 anywhere (unless
the keymap is changed after fvwm already started up).

I don't have cview.  Does that happen with textedit too?

I can see that if the pointer is over the window after a restart,
it does not take the focus upon the first click but only on the
second one.  Is that your problem?  If not, I need *precise*
instructions.  The instructions are still too vague.  I need step
by step instructions:  when and how are applications created (from
a menu, a shell, ...) where are they placed (do they overlap),
which window is above which, which window has the focus when you
restart, how you restart (the precise command of menu entry),
where the pointer is when you restart and where it is when the
windows get decorated.

> Style * ClickToFocus

ClickToFocus is *really* not supported for xview windows.  You
should rather use NeverFocus for them, e.g.

  Style textedit NeverFocus

The one problem I see goes away when using NeverFocus.

What are the events you get multiple times?   It may be necessary
to filter some events, for example when you a raise a windoe with
its transients, you get one event for each window that was raised,
not just one.  I can hardly believe it does not show the same
behaviour as it is virtually the same code being executed.

happens w/ textedit.

Always happens....have never had a Restart that didnt cause focus problems.

I see that it takes a shift-click to get focus initially.
W/ the Lenience switch however, i'd see the bahavior you saw instead.

...and indeed it works.


Thanx

BTW, any chanv
ce of windowlist going to a user=specified menu format instead
of canned format switches?

For instance, i editted my windowlist.c to be the equivalent of...

%h  %i %p %c %n

h - hotkey
i - iconic (iconic ? "I" : " ")
p - page
c - class
n - name

No way.  I don't see what you describe, with or without lenience.
Maybe it's something in your xview libraries (?).

There is some work going on with the new FvwmWindowLister module.
Personally I hope it will replace the whole WindowList command one
day.  It is a perl script and thus extensible much more easily.
Hopefully it will provide a much more flexible interface than
WindowList does now.

It was a bug in the task bar.  I have fixed it now.  For a
temporary workaround, remove the WindowListSkip style and then
immediately set it again (I did not try whis, but it should work).

  Style FvwmButtons WindowListHit

Dan, I updated the ANNOUNCE file for 2.4.14.  I am not sure if you
forgot to update it or wanted that I do it, but I guess you have
already tagged the sources, so it will not be part of the tarball
as it should.  But I think we can live with that.

Bye

Olivier, 'FlocaleUtf8ToUnicodeStr2b' in libs/Flocale.c (lines 160-192)
looks rather suspect since it assumes all resultant unicode bytes will
occupy 2 bytes; am I reading that correctly ?  I tried man'ing the
various Xlib functions and got overwhelmed.  You might want to take a
peek at vim-6.1+ (vim.sf.net - note mbyte.c, function = utf_ptr2char).

Let me know if I can help in anyway.

Thanks.

Ah, no.  If your X server works like mine, the config above states
that the KP_# keys can be accessed with shift held down, not
num-lock.  Actually, I don't know exactly how you have to
configure your Xmodmap for this.  Perhaps someone else can provide
a snippet of his configuration.

Oops, sorry, I typed this yesterday, but forgot to send it:


The command parses and works OK for me.
However, I've never been happy with the default keymaps and
I do use modmap to make this change:

keycode 119=End KP_1

Yes, this function is suspect. It converts (char *)UTF-8 into
(XChar2b *)USC-2. It is used under this situation only when the
user uses an iso10646-1 font and does not use an UTF-8 locale.

Oh, yes! That was my problem. I did not press the shift key
and wrongly expected that numlock does this job instead.
Thank you for advice and sorry for bothering.

There would be no 3d effect at all, just a border.

I implemented relief widths so that the title is "padded out" to the
maximum size of the reliefs for iconified and non iconified windows.
So I think it would be a bit confusing to have "flat" as an option.
Say I define:

FvwmIconBox: NormalTitleRelief   0
FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleRelief 2

then this would be equivalent to setting a flat border of 2 pixels for
uniconified windows.

I think I would prefer options:

FvwmIconBox: NormalTitleInvertedRelief
FvwmIconBox: IconifiedTitleInvertedRelief

No and it should not. UTF-8 is not UCS-4. Do I miss somthing?

Ok, I've found the problem. FBidiConvert assume that the "in" string
and the "out" string have the same length. This is the case until you
joint. With joint what may happen is:

  UTF-8 src string have length 34 (as char *)
  --> convert into UCS-4, the string has length 20 (as char32 *)
  --> apply bidi algo, the string has length 20 (as char32 *)
  --> apply joint algo, the string has length 20 (as char32 *)
  --> convert back to UTF-8, the string has length 40 (as char *)

    ----> core dump

the length of the returned string (visual_str) should be computed
after the joint algo is performed. BTW, fribidi should know the length
of the result of fribidi_unicode_to_charset before you call it, this
is a very very strange way to implement a converter!!

So we need the function:

  USC4UTF8Length(Char32 *str): return the length of an UCS-4 string
                               considered as an UTF-8 string

and also the following function will be useful (to allocate
logical_unicode_str at exact size):

  UTF8USC4Length(unsigned char *str): return the length of an utf-8 string
                                      considered as an USC-4 string

a simple workaround is to replace  

	visual_str = (char *)safemalloc((str_len + 1) * sizeof(char));

by

	visual_str = (char *)safemalloc((4*str_len + 1) * sizeof(char));

I do not have the time to write down the fix in the next 5 days (at
least two others thing todo before: IconMan and LocalePath).

Mikhael, Nadim ?

Because FvwmEvent is already dying when this event arrives and may
not have to time to play it before it is killed.

Does it happen with any application, or only with specific ones?

Are you *sure* you do not have another FvwmEvent running?  That
would explain everything.

If you can't figure it out alone, strip down your sonfig file as
much as possible so that it still happens and post it to the list.

They parse it in the same way, but in audio mode the Cmd is run as
in a shell and in FvwmEvent mode it is sent to fvwm.  That is why
you nee to use Exec in front of the command line.  But otherwise
it is the same.

As I use to say:  there are no stupid questions, only stupid
answers. :-)
