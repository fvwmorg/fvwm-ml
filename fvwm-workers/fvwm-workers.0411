I see where the problem is.  Traditionally, we never bothered to
set the modifier states on faked motion and keyboard events.  This
erases the initial Alt state since one of my recent patches.

Fixed with my next commit.

This functionality is already implemented.

Ok, so I've done it. Conditional commands now understand doubled '*',
'?' and '|' as escaped chars.
I've made also $[w.name:pattern] filter.

I've tested it, and don't see any problems with it.

I suspected you'll say that. I don't think I can do anything to change
this, so maybe from the other side: what is needed to release 2.6? ;-)

I'd realy like to see this Name/IconName/Class/Resource/AnyName syntax.

So I'm moving this thread to fvwm-workers, because here is my next patch
atached adding discussed here new functionality.

True. I forgot that we discussed the commited code in that thread.

Hmm, you didn't do what I meant. :)

I meant a filter that may be applied to any variable, i.e.

  $[w.iconname:pattern]
  $[HOME:pattern]

This escapes all special chars like "*" to be suitable for conditions.

I didn't see the whole code, just the diff, but it seems that your
$[w.name:pattern] is done incorrectly. IIRC, there should be 2 parts, one
that estimates the resulting string length and one that generates the
expanded string content. You should not really allocate the string space
yourself. For the "pattern" filter you may double the string length as an
estimation. But there is no support for filters yet, it should be added.

Possible filters would be:

  $[VAR]             - expanded to: 'My %^&* window'
  $[VAR:dquote]      - expanded to: "My %^&* window"
  $[VAR:noquote]     - expanded to: My %^&* window
  $[VAR:pattern]     - expanded to: 'My %^&** window'
  $[VAR:menu]        - expanded to: 'My %%^&* window'

Testing, testing and fixing bugs in the bug system and todo-2.6.

I want to see it too. But I want to see 2.6 even stronger.

I will support inclusion of the patch for these condition options if
his authors also does something from todo-2.6.

Mikhael.

Submission from: (NULL) (66.188.40.113)


FVWM seems to eat any click that triggers a WM_TAKE_FOCUS event for
Nautilus' desktop window-- This gives the effect that nautilus' desktop
behaves like it's in !FPPassFocusClick mode, regardless of whether or not
this style is set.

Also, in Sloppy Focus mode, the desktop will never receive focus. (by
comparison, in Metacity the desktop will receive focus if explicitly
clicked)

Hi there,

Please find below a mail from the creator of a fvwm

Subject: Creation of an Fvwm Forum
X-Spam-Score: 0.9 (/)

Dear mister Pross,

I don't really know how to start this off, so I'll just plunge into it
straight away: I have started a forum (or Bulletin Board if you prefer)
for Fvwm. I had a couple of reasons for doing this, which I'll detail
below, which you can skip if you think I'm ranting too much (my
apoligies if I am).


Well, the first and most obvious reason is that there was no Fvwm Forum
before I started this project, but that doesn't say why we'd need one
anyway, the Fvwm community has lots of other ways of communicating:
there's the mailinglists, the wiki and the IRC channel, so why would we
need a forum? I'll start with comparing the advantages of forums to each
of the above mentioned forms of communication.

A Wiki is a great way to generate community driven up-to-date
communication, but it obviously lacks any real communication between the
participants themselves, further a Wiki provides answers and doesn't
allow for user questions.

I'm no big fan of mailinglists, they lack every decent form of layout in
their messages and their searchability is about nonexistant.

If we're talking about IRC we can just forget about searching, unless
you want to search through 2Mb of IRC logs just to find that answer you
heard someday to the problem you think you have today.

So I think forums have the following qualities:
 - they are easily searchable
 - they maintain community interaction while at the same time allowing
for the building of some sort of a "knowledge base", script/function
resource, or just by being a FAQ on it's own.
 - they have a nice and easily usable layout.


So I wondered if it would be possible to add a link to the forum from
the main Fvwm site, the url is http://fvwm.lair.be .

I'd be most grateful if you could help with this, I see this as my
chance to do something back for the community that has helped me a lot
already. Please don't hesistate to contact me me about any questions,
suggestions or remarks you might have at this point.

With kind regards,

Bert Geens

Well, look's like I haven't understood you indeed.
And even worse: to get what you've said, much bigger change than I thought =
is
needed... :-(

In the meantime I've found a problem with this double char escaping
algoritm. If we use '**' to get literal match for '*' and '*' to match
any string, then there is no posibility to match strings like:
'One*', 'Two*', 'Three*' with a wildcard pattern.
So I've thought that we should change escaping character to some
non-special one (eg. '\'), and use '\*' for literal '*' match, and of
course '\\' for '\'. I know this will add new special character, but I
don't see any other solution.

The code for variable expanding is a little strange. There are 2
functions. One for simple variables (like n), and one expanding extended
variables (like w.name). First function calls second two times:
- first it only check output length, and allocates memmory for it
- at the second call it actually copy output to the allocated memory.
That's why I decided to use 'static char*' buffer.
Nevertheless it's not needed there, because we should do filtering in
another function. ;-)

So now I see filter support have to be added first. ;-)

If using current fvwm can be treated as testing, then I do that every
day... ;-)
For fixing bugs - I'm afraid my programming skills are insufficient. :-(

I understand, and try to do something to speed up 2.6 release... ;-)

While you're on the topic of updating links, I noticed that the page
referenced to "Glen Lee Edwards" is dead. Some gooling revealed his page
to now be here:

http://research.cmis.csiro.au/gjw/xwindows/

I quite like this page -- he has to be the only user of Fvwm to make use
of all ten buttons on the title bar. :) Very colourful.

Dear Mr/Mrs,

Alpen-Antique GmbH was founded in 1896 year and since that time our company
successfully participated in antique items distribution all over the Central
Europe. After opening our website our goods became subject of new customers?
interest from all over the world, especially from Australia and New Zealand.

We started new campaign selling our goods on-line, but we faced new difficulties
connected with payment delivery delays to our account, because of international
wire transfers usual 5 business days delay. A decision was made to hire sales
representatives capable to receiving payments from the same area where are
the customers located.
At this moment we run sales representatives hiring campaign and are glad
to propose you this position. You?re welcome to be our representative. Please
visit our webpage www.alpenantique.com/partner.htm describing all aspects
of this opportunity and if you?re interested - please send us an email to
job@alpenantique.com and you will be sent an application form. If you have
any additional questions - don?t hesitate to contact us at info@alpenantique.com
and we?ll try to help you for sure.

Best regards,
Karl Schallmeiner,
Alpen-Antique GmbH
job@alpenantique.com

Hi folks,

Attached you can find a patch for fvwm to make configure detect 
gdk-imlib 1.9.14. I can't verify it with an older version of
gdk-imlib, but since no source file in the current snapshot
includes Imlib.h, I would assume it is safe.

The change requires to rebuild configure.


Regards

Harri

Hi all
I'm planning to customize the Start Menu on the taskbar based on fvwm
2.4.18.The thing I would like to do is:

when people left-mouse-click on the Start Menu, fvwm will look for
certain place on local disk for some certain files, and spawn the menu
on the fly according to the lookup result.

Could you please advise which files/functions I should look into? And
how can I look into a running FVWM for what call-chains are performed
when certain event happens? The more detailed is more appreciated^_^

thanks for your help
David Sun

I've moved this problem to "unreproducible".
The action with the button not activating is a feature.
Using the Form FvwmForm-Defaults, you can change buttons
so they activate on a press.

I could not reproduce the button with two labels.

If you have questions about this, respond to fvwm-workers.

Bug report:

Full_Name: Sergey Prohorenko
Version: 2.5.7
CVS_Date: 
OS: Debian Unstable
X_Server: x-window-system_4.2.1-12.1
Submission from: (NULL) (212.44.95.112)


The form is called using:
*FvwmButtons(1x1, Title Logout, Icon 48x48-gnome/window-destroy.xpm, Action
`Module FvwmForm FvwmForm-QuitVerify`) 
(Using modified Debian-blue setup from
http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/debian-blue/?topic_id=929)

So, after QuitVerify form appears, I press any button (Logout for example)
with left mouse button and then, not releasing it, move mouse cursor
outside the form button. And when it returns to "unpressed" state, text on
it becomes distorted, as if the old one hasn't been cleared. That is, two
labels, one on top of the other, are displayed.
I did not test it with other FvwmForm forms/buttons.

fvwm 2.5.7 is self-compiled using hand-tuned debian build rules (just some
minor tweaking).

I've closed this problem as "not a bug".


I found this comment in the keysymdef.h from the current Xorg release:


! The definitions here should match <X11/XF86keysym.h>
XF86AudioLowerVolume	:1008FF11


Therefore I am closing this problem.  The header file should be
updated, not the Fvwm man page.

Subject: XF86 custom keysyms are also usable

Full_Name: Emmanuel Thom..
Version: 2.4.x and 2.5.x
CVS_Date: 
OS: fedora core 1, kernel 2.6
X_Server: XFree86 4.3
Submission from: (NULL) (152.81.8.127)


Excerpt from the fvwm man page:

Key Keyname Context Modifiers Function
       [...]
       The Keyname is one of the entries from
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h,
       with the leading XK_ omitted.
       [...]

This is correct, but under XFree86, it turns out that the XF86
vendor-specific keysyms also work. These are defined in
/usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h (or, as far as Xlib is concerned, in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB). For example, I have successfully set up the
following binding:

Key XF86AudioLowerVolume        A A Function MMK "AudioLowerVolume"

This means that when you read along the lines of XF86keysym.h,
XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume should really be read as XF86AudioLowerVolume ; the
XK_ prefix isn't in XKeysymDB.

Of course, this is only possibly useful if the running X server does
generate such keysyms, which require some configuration work.

In short, I suggest augmenting the quoted sentence above by  the
following:

        Under XFree86, you can also use any of the keysyms listed in
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB. You are responsible of having your X
        server generating such events.

thanks for your advice, unfortuantely, my target machine is too
size-limited to have perl. I have achieved the purpose by playing with
the FvwmTaskBar code which get called when the "Start" button is pressed

This can't be in keysymdef.h ; it's in XKeysymDB. XKeysymDB is a better
reference to look into, IMHO, when looking for keysyms.

The point is that not only the entries from keysymdef.h can be used, but
also those from XF86keysym.h (with XK_ stripped out in the middle) ; The
alternative I suggest is to direct the user to XKeysymDB instead, which
contains all possible keysyms with correct spelling.

Note that as the man page currently contains no reference to XKeysymDB,
it's not obvious that one should look into it.

I think you missed my point.

=46rom the header file, I surmised that the X developers mean to keep
XKeysymDB and keysymdef.h in sync.

It looks like they've failed.  What you have is a bug in X, not
in Fvwm.

I believe removing the XK_ from the middle is also a bug.

This whole thing with X keysyms is bad enough (using a header file
as documentation).  It shouldn't get any worse than it is.

(Just my opinion.)

Sorry, the man page for xmodmap explains it this way:

   The KEYSYMNAME on the left hand side is translated
   into matching keycodes used to perform the  corre=AD
   sponding  set of keycode expressions.  The list of
   keysym names may  be  found  in  the  header  file
   <X11/keysymdef.h>  (without the XK_ prefix) or the
   keysym   database    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB.
   Note  that if the same keysym is bound to multiple
   keys, the expression is executed for each matching
   keycode.

They still refer to an XK_ prefix, but it looks like
having 2 files to refer to is intentional.

I'll update the man page.

Hello devs, great work on fvwm.


	I was wondering what the future of shape masking in Fvwm will
	be. I've noticed a few things about it currently that don't sit
	well with me, and I wondered if anyone was still working on this
	portion of fvwm and of course, if they were willing to take some
	suggestions:

 1.   Shape masking doesn't work in title bars as of yet, although you
	can use pixmaps to shape yourself some rounded (or otherwise
	different) corners, if you don't use pixmaps you are left with
	no choices.

 2.  Shape masking ruins the effect borders have in Fvwm. Example: I
	make a shape mask for my menu and when I bring up the menu I
	have shaped	corners, the problem is, the border around the menu
	window is cut off where the shaping happens.  Will it ever be
	possible for the border to follow the contour of the shape mask?

Thanks in advance,
-Evan
