I am using fvwm 2.5.8.  The man page lists..

  StartIconic
  StartNormal
  StartsOnPage
  StartsLowered


...among other Start* style options.  My question is why is a 's'
missing from "StartIconic" or "StartNormal"?

Implementing the new focus styles was very confusing for me.  It
was hard to determine the default behaviour for all the old focus
styles and keep compatibility with them.  Can anybody tell me
exactly what fvwm-2.4.x did for

  MouseFocus
  SloppyFocus
  ClickToFocus

with an otherwise empty config file?

I guess because nobody cared about style name consistency in the
past.  New styles just popped up now and then without anybody
looking at their names.

Hi!

I'm writing because this entry

       Recapture
              This  command  is obsolete and should not be
              used anymore.  Should you want to  do  some=AD
              thing  specific  that  you cannot do without
              it, please report this to  the  fvwm-workers
              mailing  list (fvwm-workers@fvwm.org).  This
              command will be removed at some point in the
              future.   Please read the note at the end of
              the section DELAYED EXECUTION OF COMMANDS to
              learn  about how to avoid the Recapture com=AD
              mand.

in the man page of `fvwm2'

	$ fvwm -version
	fvwm 2.5.7 compiled on Sep 23 2003 at 23:03:38

told me to do so. Actually I'm not using `Recapture' - though this
also worked - but `RecaptureWindow'. I'll try a description of the
problem I had where only `RecaptureWindow' seems to be a solution.

I have a `fvwm2' setup where the mouse is more or less obsolete.
Everything is controlled by keys. I defined a special "window manager
key" as modifier 5 and in combination with other keys I can do
everything necessary. In particular switching the focus between
windows on a virtual desktop is controlled by keys.

This setup worked perfectly for years but now there is a strange
behavior with current Mozilla 1.4 (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;
en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030821). On one of my virtual desktop lives
Mozilla. Strange things happen when I have more than one Mozilla
window open and I try to switch focus from one window to the next by
the appropriate key combination. Most of the time the first switch
works but later switches *seem* to switch the focus - i.e. `fvwm2'
updates the window decoration accordingly - but when I press a key
like CursorDown or PageUp it actually *goes* to the window which had
the focus before that window. In other words: For `fvwm2' the focus
has switched while for Mozilla it stayed in the old window. If I then
switch the focus to the next window the window decoration is updated
to indicate having focus but the focus actually moves to the previous
window. This stays this way for further focus switches. This way the
focus of Mozilla is always one window behind the window `fvwm2'
considers focused.

I can remedy the effect when I click into the Mozilla window but this
is of course what I'm trying to prevent with my keyboard control
setup.

I experimented a lot with various things but nothing worked well. The
only thing which actually changed at least something was playing
around with the `Layer' command. Also the focus switched to the right
window when I manually gave `RaiseLower' two times. Finally I found
`RecaptureWindow' and this did what I need - though it's ugly.

I can't see this behavior with any other application before or now so
I guess it has to do more with Mozilla than anything else. Also
Mozilla 0.9.4 did not show this behavior before.

I included some excerpts from my `fvwm2rc' so you can experiment if
you like. If necessary I can send the complete `fvwm2rc' but only by
private mail.

If this mail goes to a mailing list: I'm not on this list. I'm ready
to reply to questions but note that you need to contact me directly.

Recent messages in fvwm@fvwm.org seem to indicate there is some known
focus problem in Mozilla 1.4 and related browsers.

Here are some config hints.

The last lines are better be written using $*.  Of course this can't be
done in StepWarp, in which case you should be aware of parameters like
!"My Spaced Name".

Only one name may be used in conditions. I.e. !"FvwmPager" is ignored,
since there is already non-option name !"*Buttons". Maybe instead you want
to use something like !Sticky or !CirculateHit (default for Prev/Next).

The functions WarpId and DeiconifyWarp may be written as:

  AddToFunc Warp
  + I Focus
  + I RaiseCur

  AddToFunc DeiconifyWarp
  + I Iconify off
  + I Warp

[the rest is skipped]

I happen to have a 2.4.6 lying around. I just verified that the default
for all three styles is to keep the windowlist in last-focused order,
i. e. FlipFocus like behavior.

I already started this topic several times in the past, but it seems
noone else worries about this. I worry, so I will implement this soon.
In short, ".fvwm2rc" name has 3 small problems as explained in todo-2.6.

I suggested either ~/.fvwm/main or ~/.fvwm/config variants in the past.
The second one seems to be the most intuitive. Also ~/.*/main does not
return anything for me, and ~/.*/config returns 12 application config
files in my home directory.

Currently fvwm searches for the starting config file in 5 places, I will
add 2 more places, i.e. $FVWM_USERDIR/config and $FVWM_DATADIR/config.
Some places (like ~/.fvwm2rc in $HOME) should be removed, either before
or after 2.6.0. Of course, ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc should stay for some years.

Another thing I will do later is to go throw all zillions places
containing the string ".fvwm2rc" and replace it with "~/.fvwm/config".
This way we will be completely free from "2" in our file names.

Note that ~/.fvwm/config is designed to be the final fvwm config file.
A user may already dispatch it if he really wants, like:

  Test (Version 2.5.*) Read config-2.5
  Test (Version 2.6.*) Read config-2.6

Regards,
Mikhael.

In my eyes, it might be better to do this with 3.0 in order to do
all the disrupting changes in one release.  Users get the feeling
we are constantly breaking compatibility if we do such changes in
small doses.  Other than that, I have no strong opinion about the
issue.

~/.fvwm/config is better

After - namely for 3.0 (i.e. 2.6.1 ?).

Dito.  It shouldn't be called .fvwm2rc once 3.0 is on the way.

I'm not sure this is wise at the moment.  Too many people are reading
documentation that comes from a different version.  They may be
utterly confused if they miss that fact.  As ugly as it may be, I
suggest to write both, .fvwm2rc and .fvwm/config, until 3.0.

By the way, this should definitely allow things like

  Test (Version [>|<|>=|<=] 2.5.7) ...

Dear all,

      I have just put online a survey addressing the topic of "leadership
in the open-source environment". Basically, my objective is to
identify the personal conceptions of good leadership that reside in
the minds of the contributors, in terms of leaders' _behaviors_ and
_characteristics_.

What is a good open-source project leader, from the
contributor's point of view? To what extent, those personal believes are
shared among developers? Can the contributor's national cultural belonging
and level of experience in contributing to open-source projects explain such
differences in their idea of what a good leader is?

I would really appreciate your participation to the survey! Contribution
(*completely* anonymous) consists in rating a list of statements that may be
used to describe the behaviors of an open-source leader. It will take around
ten minutes - there aren't any "time-consuming" open ended questions;)

Following, the link to the survey:

http://freeonlinesurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?id=52191

If you are interested, I will not miss to email you a link to the
final report, when ready ;) (approx, a couple of months from now)

Thank you in advance, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have
any questions or comments :)

My argument is that I don't think we will have 3.0 in less than three
years, and it would be nice to have the clean solution now. As described,
it does not break compatibility, just prepares a user in advance.
As for the future, it is possible that there will be 2.8, or maybe 3.0
will be mostly backward compatible (like 2.6 is), it can't be predicted.

This may be added.

A bigger problem is that currently $[cond.rc]  (should it be renamed?)
is always Match outside of functions, so TestRc (!Match) never works.
This is a bit problematic for dispatchers, they may want to have "else".

I think it could be done in 2.7.1 as well.  In any case, as long
as it's optional in the 2.x series, I have no problem with the
change.

Due to the several concurrent sources of input (user interaction,
modules, X events and the Schedule queue), a lot of scripting does
not work when done outside functions.  FvwmIconMan has that
problem in its button action syntax.  Module input in general is
problematic.  The Repeat and "+" commands can be dangerous too,
probably other commands that I missed too.  But I don't know what
we could possibly do about it.

I suggested a solution to all these problems some time ago.

Currently we have some globals (like last_return_code, last_added_item).
These should be local to every module pipe. This way all commands from
one FvwmConsole do not conflict with commands from another FvwmConsole.

The initial start config commands, X event commands and Schedule commands
all should have their own allocation of this inter-command state data and
should never affect the state of each other and of module pipes.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can't reproduce this, but I have a suspicion.  It may be related
to the new window movement method detection code.  To evaluate the
situation, I need more information.

 1. Try using this style:

      Style * MoveByProgramMethod IgnoreGravity

    If I am right, the problem should go away.

 2. When shading or unshading the window, fvwm prints a lot of
    debug messages on the console, e.g.

      s 831/112 -31936/-32655, g 835/134 -31932/-32633: --- not detected
      0x08138de0 'Licq (255773845)'
      s 831/112  0/ 0, g 835/134  4/22: +++ travelling traditional 0x08138de0
      'Licq (255773845)'

    I need all that output (separately for shade and unshade)

 3. Finally I need the whole config file.  There are a number of
    styles that can affect this.

Handling X events is easy since they never refer to each other.

But still, at the moment there is no way to reliably issue
sequences of commands with Schedule.  I've been thinking about
some kind of inline function definition for a while, e.g. instead
of

  destroyfunc foo
  addtofunc foo
  + i do this
  + i do that

it might look like this:

  inline "do this" "do that" ...

Fvwm would translate that automatically into an anonymous function
and execute it.  Passing arguments and quoting will be problematic,
though.

Jason,

  Personally I doubt we'll be able to deal with the millions
of variations on these auto-responses.  This virus will just have
to run its course.

  For my personal account I need auto-responses to come in but I am
giving them a couple of points:

body MY_AUTO_RESP /automated response/
describe MY_AUTO_RESP Auto Responder
score MY_AUTO_RESP 2

I hope there still be a way to specify the path to the configuration
file like the way -f option currently allows (fvwm 2.5.8) to
specify.  Otherwise, i am indifferent about the issue.

Fixed.  I always though ClickToFocus ordered the window list by
creation time.  But if this ever was the case, it was changed
before 2.4.0.

Hello:

Tired of overpaying 20-30 cents per click at Overture and Google AdWords? 
If you are sick of it, then how does a rate of half a cent per click sound?? 

Try targeted visitors for only half a penny at the new pay-per-click search engine!

Hi All,

* CLASS & RESOURCE DYNAMIC CONTEXTS

Well i guess the cat's out of the bag.
My idea was to implement Class & Resource specific contexts.
Thus allowing class/res. specific bindings.

I got stalled when designing a suitable data structure for storing
the bindings -- this requires a lot of source code in contrast to
the compiled in version i hacked up earlier. Either way, this was the
syntax we decided on (for an example FvwmTabs key binding):

FvwmContext FvwmTabs C "FvwmTabs"
[ set the FvwmTabs context to match windows with class name matching
"FvwmTabs" ]

Key Tab (FvwmTabs) C Function NextTab
[ Any windows matching the FvwmTabs context parse this binding,
all others simply ignore it -- i.e. Mozilla still gets the Ctrl-Tab ]

I would be very interested in current fvwm hackers' views on this
feature and its feasibility. I would be happy to do most of the code
myself, but obviously experienced fvwm-ers will have valuable advice
when extensively modifying the code tree.

Mostly, a nicely compatible/similar data structure for keeping these
bindings (similar to current bindings structure) is the stumbling block.

Alternatively, a compilable version using currently unreserved context
letters can be provided with a few changes by myself if this change is
too major/not feasible. e.g.
Key Tab X C Function NextTab
(Where CONTEXT_X="FvwmTabs" is in defines.h)

Let me know what you think.

Craig

I was discussing with someone on #fvwm about the condition "Iconifiable".
Then it hit me I never implemented "Style WindowShadable" and the
correspodning style.
What's the opinion, I guess it should be there for consistency, but it's
not urgent for me, since I don't need it. Should this be postponed to
post-2.6?

Hello:

Do you know that you can process credit card payments for less? 
Compare your current rates to the ones we are offering!
Your will be surprised because our rates are always lower. Why? Because they are negotiable!

Please contact me at accept@toturnto.com (THIS EMAIL ONLY!).

Best,

Without the above Style line added... I was getting the following line when
the licq window was being displayed/expanded.

s 1429/ 14 -31338/-32753, g 1430/ 15 -31337/-32752: +++ near border icccm 0x0814c468 'Licq (Schattenjger)'

No output while shading..

With the style added there are no messages at all.

The config is very ugly.. way too many "Read"s and even some files that are
not used. You can find the whole config directory tarball here
http://kingsly.net/kj-fvwm.tar.gz

If it makes your job easier, Here is a list of all the Style statements
used...

http://kingsly.net/styles.txt

(The only styles definitions left out are the ones for some fvwmbuttons based
desktop launcher icons.. which have the following definition.
Style $0Launch HandleWidth 0, NoTitle, Sticky, StaysOnBottom, ClickToFocus, WindowListSkip )

  I know there's no good reason to stick this in beofre 2.6, but it's
a simple enough patch, can it be committed for inclusion after 2.6?

  I have an FvwmIconMan inside of FvwmButtons.  I was changing the
"Frame" definition for various buttons, and wanted to change the
relief width on the buttons in FvwmIconMan, and was suprised to find
there was no way to do that.  They're just 2.  Always 2.

  So, I fixed this.  They still default to two, but I added a
"ReliefThickness" keyword to FvwmIconMan.  You can set it to 0,
as another way to get flat buttons, or to a positive integer to
have the button-reliefs be that many pixels wide/thick.  I don't
know why you can't make it negative to get the equivalent of "Reverse"
buttons, but that doesn't work.  I don't think it's important to
fix, but I'd be happy for anyone else to fix it.

  Again, the default after this patch will be the same.  2 pixels.
But you can now change it.  (I've set mine to 1).

  Thanks.  Let me know when this can get checked in, and when
that change will hit a release.  Much appriciated.

                                - Chris

Could you also post the zoomed in pixel-by-pixel graph images for all the
small images (both before and after the change) ?

TIA

There's a link "bigger" that features xmag-like shots.

But the shadow differs from MWM :-)
And you should use these button styles if you want the perfect emulation:

ButtonStyle 1 3 0+4px50+1p@0 100-5px50+1p@0 100-5px50-2p@0
AddButtonStyle 1 3 0+4px50+1p@1 0+4px50-2p@1 100-5px50-2p@1
ButtonStyle 2 3 0+4px100-5p@0 100-5px100-5p@0 100-5px0+4p@0
AddButtonStyle 2 3 0+4px100-5p@1 0+4px0+4p@1 100-5px0+4p@1
ButtonStyle 4 3 50-2px50+1p@0 50+1px50+1p@0 50+1px50-2p@0
AddButtonStyle 4 3 50-2px50+1p@1 50-2px50-2p@1 50+1px50-2p@1

i did notice the shadow colors and the buttons. i figured i would only
change stuff in the source that couldn't be adjusted in the config file.
colorsets and those buttons would take it all the way.

I meant something like this http://helloworld.sh/wm/mwm-full.png

But I think this is what I wanted to point out(I don't read/write
vector-ese! )

Does this make the dot and the vertical bar to be 2x2 and 2x7
pixels(excluding the 1 pixel border) in length ?

Personally I prefer the current form of the buttons 3x3 and 3x9!

Yes, depending on the font size, using a font the same height as on the
screenshot (helvetica 12 currently on my desktop).

Using the above setup (or simimlar) the dot is always the same size
regardless of the font size (or rather titlebar height), if you want that.
(similarly the bar is a fixed width and a fixed number of pixels from the
edge at the left and right, and similar for the sqaure).

1) Style * FVWMBorder

Personally, I like your change to the left-bottom 7x7 corner of the
border, this makes it more symmetric to the right-top corner. I think I
mentioned this to Dominik some years ago when he designed the current
look, but these several pixels were not changed.

But I dislike your changes to 4 handles (on the bottom and the right
borders), this makes the borders asymmetrical. I like the current look.

(Yes, I remember that old proprietary WMs like 4Dwm had less bold handles
similar to the ones on the bottom+right sides after your change.)

Sorry, I don't like your changes to the window button's 3d-ness either.

2) Style * MWMBorder

I don't think any of the looks is perfect (I like symmetry here for some
reason), but the current look that is more symmetric is more pleasant to
me. Not that I am against to have a better simulation. Just an opinion.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

Find attached a patch to FVWM to define key-bindings on individual
windows. (Previously, a key binding had to be defined for ALL windows
or NONE.)

Example .fvwm2rc syntax:

=== BEGIN ===

AddToFunc CtrlTab
+ I Current (FvwmTabs) Function NextTab
+ I Current (!FvwmTabs) SendKeyEvent current

Key Tab A C Function CtrlTab

=== END ===

Here, Ctrl-Tab in an FvwmTabs window will perform a 'NextTab' operation
but in all other windows the Ctrl-Tab keypress is passed through untouched.
(ie. is treated as if there were no FVWM key binding for Ctrl-Tab.)

The patch involves the addition of a new keyword - SendKeyEvent
which basically allows the intercepted key event to be sent through
to a specified window. I hope to generalise SendKeyEvent to be able to
send ANY key event in the near future. (Maybe call it FakeKeypress?)

If this patch is applied I am happy to update the doco.

Comments/criticism most welcome.

SCoTTie! :)

Jason,

I always thought posting to fvwm-announce was restricted to the
people with CVS commit access.  If this isn't the case, could you
please configure majordomo this way?

Ciao

I've committed a patch.

Yes, I think the handles should be independent of the border and
not try to merge into it.

With buttons, there is always the problem that if you arrange them
in a grid, you get a one pixel thick solid line, either vertically
or horizontally (or both).  Currently, we don't have that line
with TitleAt{Top,Bottom}, but with TitleAt{Left,Right}.

I don't care about perfect emulation that nobody will notice.  The
borders should look good.

I'd like to add a way to disable any operation by the user or the
program anyway:

  - Forbid operations by user interaction.
  - Forbid operations using plain X (iconify, move, resize).
  - Override MWM hints.
  - Ignore EWMH hints and protocols.
  - Ignore GNOME hints and protocols.

Only a few operations can be controlled yet.

Such a permission system needs to be designed carefully and can
not be part of 2.6.0.

   Hey there.  Any feedback on this?  Dominik: I see you're committing
things that aren't bug fixes, so that means you're accepting
new functionality for the post-2.6 work?  Any issue with checking
in this patch?

   Thanks...

                             - Chris

I'm not quite happy with this patch for several reasons.

1) Generating keyboard events out of sequence can totally confuse
   applications or fvwm itself.  In your example, you hold down
   Ctrl and tap tha Tab key.  The modifier mask has the bit for
   the Ctrl key set.  Now the event is passed on, but when it is
   processed by fvwm or the receiving application, the real
   modifier mask may have already changed.  This can lead to
   erratic behaviour.  For example, an application may wait for a
   KeyRelease event that will never come.

2) It suffers from the same problems as the FakeClick command.
   Apart from #1 above, it's impossible to determine to which
   window the event has to be sent.  There is no guarantee that
   the top level client window is able to handle key events.

I'm not saying the patch is useless.  It would be nice to further
improve it to a clone of FakeClick that can replay key and
modifier press and release events and send them to arbitrary
windows (not just client windows).  But a future FakeKey command
has to be marked as a debug command to "use at own risk" like
FakeClick.

I'll accept a patch that duplicates the FakeClick syntax (or
better: unifies both commands to use the same core loop).

The application-specific-bindings problem, however, can only be
solved in a different way.  The binding syntax and code can be
enhanced to allow window selection similar to the Style command.

(Side note to Mikhael and Olivier:  see why I want a unified
syntax for Style + WindowStyle?  If we had a single style target
spec syntax, it could easily be applied to the binding commands
too.  Instead, we now need new commands WindowKey, WindowMouse and
WindowPointerKey).

You don't need this function and it does not copy the event you
think it does.  See below.

Just make a copy of exc->x.etrigger:

  e = *(exc->x.etrigger);

You are not really interested in the last event received by fvwm
but in the event that triggered the function.  I know, the whole
FEvent.[ch] and execcontext.[ch] code should be documented ...

Use FvwmStringToKeysym() from libs/Bindings.h instead.  It does
some extra things to normalize the returned KeySym.

The patch looks nice and simple, and I think I will apply it.  My
only concern is that it does not do any boundary checks.  It
should:

 - Check for negative and zero thickness.
 - Limit the thickness to what fits in a button (you do not want
   to allow relief thickness 25000 in a button that is 10 pixels
   high).

Hi there, I'm a pretty noisy advocate of fvwm among Gentoo Linux users
and one of the questions/comments I seem to keep getting is that when
aterm terminals are being moved opaquely, they have a really noticable
"Flicker"...I can see this as well, but as aterm is the only application
I've ever seen it with and it works fine with rxvt (from which aterm is
derived), it must be an aterm bug.

Apparently it looks okay with fluxbox, so they must do some
aterm-detection magic (cheating :). Trying to demonstrate this to some
people I was going to use the FlickeringMoveWorkaround BugOpt, but I
can't seem to make it work..browsing the source, I cant even see how its
supposed to work.

and an xev window confirms that it still gets ConfigureNotify's while 
being moved, no matter what setting it has.

Shouldnt there be some sort of check in SendConfigureNotify()?

maybe like this:

$ cvs diff fvwm/events.c

No, the code belongs in move_resize.c.  It was there before, but
seems to have been removed accidentally at some time between 2.3.8
and 2.4.5.  Just add

  && !Scr.bo.DisableConfigureNotify

in the conditions around the two SendConfigureNotify() calls in
move_resize.c, or use the latest code from CVS.

Hi Dominik,

Thanks for the feedback, muchly appreciated.

Yep.

I'm not sure what you mean. If the modifier mask changes that implies
another event is generated. Are you just saying that the associated
KeyRelease event never gets sent to the application?

>    This can lead to

Yes, I get the feeling that modifying FVWM to allow KeyRelease events to
get through would be a challenging hack at best. Is this a fair synopsis?

I guess it would involve remembering which KeyPress events FVWM lets
through & adding some sort of handler to KeyRelease events to check
if there's an associated KeyPress event that got sent through. If
there is, send the KeyRelease event through & "forget" the KeyPress
event.

Agreed.

I can do that.

Can you please elaborate?

On a slight tangent, do you know how I can get the modifier state
from the string name of a keysym?

SCoTTie! :)

Yes, and in addition, when the event is received, the modifier
mask may differ from the actual state of the modifiers.  Some code
in fvwm relies on an accurate modifier mask to work correctly, and
other programs maybe too.

I already tried that and failed since if a module or application
grabs the keyboard, fvwm never gets the Key... events.

Something like

  Key (rxvt) TSIF N do_something

The binding code would make sure that only the proper keys and
buttonms are grabbed for such windows.  Currently, all keys and
buttons with bindings attached are grabbed on all windows.

:-P

Look at the AddBinding() function in libs/Bindings.c.  Basically,
given a specific keycode, you just try all possible modifier
entries (max. 9) in the Xmodmap and see if they yield the desired
keysym.  The problem is that only the two entries in the modifier
map have a fixed meaning (0 = no modifier, 1 = shift).  All others
are undefined and can not be queried from the X server, as far as
I know.

You can not do much more than allowing the user to specify the
modifiers and keycodes in addition to keysyms.  The switch that
gueasses the modifier mask in AddWindow() could be extracted and
put into a new function for general use.

Why would the modifier mask be wrong? I understand the modifier
mask to be set to whatever Shift/Ctrl/Alt/etc keys are pressed when
the (say) Tab key is pressed.

good night!

SCoTTie! :)

Because there is no guarantee these modifiers are still pressed
when the new event is processed.  Normally, it is guaranteed that
if an application freezes key event processing and then queries
the current keyboard state, it gets the same modifier mask as in
the event that initiated the freeze.  That's not the case here.

Thanks, that works even better. I think i'll leave this option on

   Reasonable.  I can add some boundary-checking.

   I didn't want to do this, because I thought that those were
reasonable.  Zero works, and behaves as you would expect.  It
makes the button "flat".  Do you want me to explicitly disallow
this method of making the button flat, so that it must be done
as a button style?

   As to negative, that doesn't work as expected, but I would've
expected that to act as "Reverse" causes, and if it worked should
be valid.  I also asked for any help in figuring out why that
doesn't work.  Do you want me to just ignore it, so that if you
want them sunken, you must Reverse either icon or normal?  This
prevents you from being able to reverse all states, correct?
What if someone wanted to do that?

   Right.  This is reasonable.  I'll take a look at how to do
this...

   Can do.  :-)  Thanks for the policy statement.

I don't really care whether it's possible or not.  But if the
thickness is 0, RelieveRectangle() should never be called.

RelieveRectangle() eventually calls do_relieve_rectangle() from
libs/Graphics.c.  This function does nothing for line_width <= 0.
It's easy to change by adding this piece of code at the beginning
of the function:

  if (line_width < 0)
  {
    GC tmpgc;

    line_width = -line_width;
    tmpgc = ReliefGC;
    ReliefGC = ShadowGC;
    ShadowGC = tmpgc;
  }

I wouldn't mind to add this to your patch.

FROM THE DESK OF BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
MR.JACK KOFFI
BANQUE INTERNATIONALE DE L'AFRIQUE DE L'OUEST
ABIDJAN, COTE D, IVOIRE.
+225 0795 3161.

Dear Friend,

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of Banque internationale de Abidjan (BIAO).I am writing following the impressive information based on this transaction,assuring me of your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $11.5m million US dollars ,eleven million five hundred thousand U.S dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the whole life of the passengers on board.Since we got this information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is upon this discovery in my department that I have decided to make this businness proposal to you and for you to act as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don`t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained uncliamed after four years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Ivoirien cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a
foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 55% would be for me.There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter ,Trusting to hear from you
immediately.
(+225 07953161)

Yours faithfully,
JACK KOFFI.
(BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER)

N/B.my intention of writing you through email is because I belive it is very confidential.

   Hi.  I'm running a solaris 8 system, with the installed
openwin X server, and fvwm-root is failing with a shared
memory error on my machine.

   I looked into it, and it's a error returned from shmget()
somewhere in the X libraries.  The X error being displayed
is:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private 
resource denied)
   Major opcode of failed request:  131 (MIT-SHM)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  1 (X_ShmAttach)
   Serial number of failed request:  10
   Current serial number in output stream:  11

   Looking at the system calls, it appears that shmget()
is returning EINVAL when it's being called to create
a 5+ MB memory segment.  In reading documentation,
I see that the "system default" maximum size for shared
memory is 1MB.  I realize my fvwm-root is trying to ask for
a little over 5MB, but, doing some math, even a 1024x768
screen at 16-bit pixmap-depth will produce an X Pixmap that
is 1.5MB in size.

   Perhaps there should be another way to load this?  Is
this just a solaris bogosity?  Can we interact with the
MIT-SHM extension directly to check on things?

                             - Chris

I want fvwm to apply a new style when the title of my xterm changes.
So I put this in my .fvwm2rc:

  Module FvwmEvent
  *FvwmEvent: window_name RecaptureWindow

to no avail.  When the title of a window changes, the window begins to
flicker and is unusable.  Is this a bug?   How can I achieve the effect
I want?

It is sad that I have to ask.  What do you think about allowing
only members to post on the fvwm mailing lists in the future?  The
amount of spam has got out of control.

There are two mistakes here.  First, the module should not be
started directly in the .fvwm2rc but in the StartFunction.
Second, you're starting FvwmEvent before it is configured (note
that order does not matter when using StartFunction, but it *does*
matter in the .fvwm2rc fil).  Try this:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent
  *FvwmEvent: window_name RecaptureWindow

Yes, definitely.  Relying exclusively on shared memory is a bad
thing, not only because some (all) implementations have limits on
the size of shared memory that can be allocated in one chunk, but
also because the total amount of shared memory is limited (usually
less than the total available memory on the system).

I'm all for it. Best would be if the list were modified (non-member
posts need approval to get through), but that takes time which people
tend not to have... :-)

Thanks for the tip.  I changed my .fvwm2rc to match your stuff above.
FvwmEvent still didn't work, though.   I needed to add 

  *FvwmEvent:  Delay 5

to prevent the recapture from falling into (what seems to be) an
infinite loop.  Does the Recapture function generate window_name
events?

Yes.  When a window is (re)captured, the various ...name events
are sent.

We need ReStyle (or StyleAgain or ReStyleWindow) command that reevaluates
the context window style (no name events should be sent). Absense of such
command is one of the main reasons why RecaptuteWindow can't be removed.

Probably having Style option AutoReStyleOnNameChange would solve the
Carl's problem better, this is a pretty reasonable feature.

Mikhael.

This is much much less convenient than just subscribing, then post

Since I applied the SA rule that I posted, nothing has gotten thru

Requiring subscription is OK with me if it will help others.

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IS UNTENABLE

 

By re-analysing Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment and the ideal experiment from which the uncertainty principle is derived, it is actually found that the uncertainty principle can not be obtained from them. It is therefore found to be untenable. 

Key words: 
uncertainty principle; Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment; ideal experiment 

Ideal Experiment 1

                 Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment


A free electron sits directly beneath the center of the microscope's lens (please see AIP page http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08b.htm or diagram below) . The circular lens forms a cone of angle 2A from the electron. The electron is then illuminated from the left by gamma rays--high energy light which has the shortest wavelength. These yield the highest resolution, for according to a principle of wave optics, the microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

However, in quantum mechanics, where a light wave can act like a particle, a gamma ray striking an electron gives it a kick. At the moment the light is diffracted by the electron into the microscope lens, the electron is thrust to the right. To be observed by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A. In quantum mechanics, the gamma ray carries momentum as if it were a particle. The total momentum p is related to the wavelength by the formula, 

p = h / L, where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

In the extreme case of diffraction of the gamma ray to the right edge of the lens, the total momentum would be the sum of the electron's momentum P'x in the x direction and the gamma ray's momentum in the x direction: 

P' x + (h sinA) / L', where L' is the wavelength of the deflected gamma ray. 

In the other extreme, the observed gamma ray recoils backward, just hitting the left edge of the lens. In this case, the total momentum in the x direction is: 

P''x - (h sinA) / L''. 

The final x momentum in each case must equal the initial x momentum, since momentum is conserved. Therefore, the final x momenta are equal to each other: 

P'x + (h sinA) / L' = P''x - (h sinA) / L'' (3) 

If A is small, then the wavelengths are approximately the same, 

L' ~ L" ~ L. So we have 

P''x - P'x = dPx ~ 2h sinA / L (4) 

Since dx = L/(2 sinA), we obtain a reciprocal relationship between the minimum uncertainty in the measured position, dx, of the electron along the x axis and the uncertainty in its momentum, dPx, in the x direction: 

dPx ~ h / dx or dPx dx ~ h. (5) 

For more than minimum uncertainty, the "greater than" sign may added. 

Except for the factor of 4pi and an equal sign, this is Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of an object. 

Re-analysis

To be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A. 

The microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

This is the resolving limit of the microscope and it is the uncertain quantity of the object's position. 

The microscope can not see the object whose size is smaller than its resolving limit, dx. Therefore, to be seen by the microscope, the size of the electron must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit. 

But if the size of the electron is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx, the electron will not be in the range dx. Therefore, dx can not be deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can be seen by the microscope, but deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can not be seen by the microscope. To repeat, dx is uncertainty in the electron's position which can not be seen by the microscope. 

To be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, so we can measure the momentum of the electron. 

dPx is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum which can be seen by microscope. 

What relates to dx is the electron where the size is smaller than the resolving limit. When the electron is in the range dx, it can not be seen by the microscope, so its position is uncertain. 

What relates to dPx is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit .The electron is not in the range dx, so it can be seen by the microscope and its position is certain. 

Therefore, the electron which relates to dx and dPx respectively is not the same. What we can see is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx and has a certain position, dx = 0. 

Quantum mechanics does not rely on the size of the object, but on Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment. The use of the microscope must relate to the size of the object. The size of the object which can be seen by the microscope must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx of the microscope, thus the uncertain quantity of the electron's position does not exist. The gamma ray which is diffracted by the electron can be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, where we can measure the momentum of the electron. 

What we can see is the electron which has a certain position, dx = 0, so that in no other position can we measure the momentum of the electron. In Quantum mechanics, the momentum of the electron can be measured accurately when we measure the momentum of the electron only, therefore, we have gained dPx = 0. 

And, 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

Every physical principle is based on an Ideal Experiment, not based on MATHEMATICS, including heisenberg uncertainty principle.

For example, the Law of Conservation of Momentum is based on the collision of two stretch ball in the vacuum; the Principle of equivalence(general relativity) is besed on the Einstein's laboratory in the lift.

Please see the book:

Max Jammer. (1974) The philosophy of quantum mechanics (John wiley & sons , Inc New York ) Page 96

 

Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment is an ideal experiment.

Einstein said, One Experiment is enough to negate a physical principle.

Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment has negated the uncertainty principle.

 

Ideal experiment 2

Single Slit Diffraction Experiment


Suppose a particle moves in the Y direction originally and then passes a slit with width dx(Please see diagram below) . The uncertain quantity of the particle's position in the X direction is dx, and interference occurs at the back slit . According to Wave Optics , the angle where No.1 min of interference pattern is can be calculated by following formula: 

sinA=L/2dx (1) 

and L=h/p where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

So the uncertainty principle can be obtained 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

Re-analysis

According to Newton first law , if an external force in the X direction does not affect the particle, it will move in a uniform straight line, ( Motion State or Static State) , and the motion in the Y direction is unchanged .Therefore , we can learn its position in the slit from its starting point. 

The particle can have a certain position in the slit and the uncertain quantity of the position is dx =0. According to Newton first law , if the external force at the X direction does not affect particle, and the original motion in the Y direction is not changed , the momentum of the particle int the X direction will be Px=0 and the uncertain quantity of the momentum will be dPx =0. 

This gives: 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

No experiment negates NEWTON FIRST LAW. Whether in quantum mechanics or classical mechanics, it applies to the microcosmic world and is of the form of the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. If an external force does not affect the particle and it does not remain static or in uniform motion, it has disobeyed the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. Under the above ideal experiment , it is considered that the width of the slit is the uncertain quantity of the particle's position. But there is certainly no reason for us to consider that the particle in the above experiment has an uncertain position, and no reason for us to consider that the slit's width is the uncertain quantity of the particle. Therefore, the uncertainty principle, 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

which is derived from the above experiment is unreasonable. 

Conclusion


>From the above re-analysis , it is realized that the ideal experiment demonstration for the uncertainty principle is untenable. Therefore, the uncertainty principle is untenable.

Hi,
I'm wondering if there is any interest in a little patch at the
fvwm-menu-directory.

An additional command line what should define with what kind of a
program files with specific endings should get opened.

the additional command line option would look like this:

exec-gen="xv=jpg|jpeg,mplayer=mov|mpg|mpeg,xmms=mp3"

that would mean, xv should open all endings: jpg, jpeg, 
                 mplayer should open endings: mov, mpg, mpeg and
                 xmms should be used to open mp3 files.

for personal use this would be already enough for me actually,
but when this would be interesting to enhance ( icons ), i could
do it as well.

Actually a quick hack with special markings to see where i hacked
around. I'm not really a perl programmer, but I hope it's all ok anyway.

In HandleKeyPress() [file: fvwm/events.c] why is FVWM messing with
2 windows?

I'm guessing 1 window is the last focused window & the other is the
window that _should_ be focussed (may or may not be the same) - is that
right? 

I'm confused as to why it's not possible to decide on _which_ window
to lookup bindings for (ie. CheckTwoBindings()).

Could someone enlighten me?

SCoTT. :)

I didn't check the patch yet, but I probably prefer this syntax:

  --exec-mime="xv -nolimits; jpg|jpeg, mplayer -fs %n; mov|mpg|mpeg"

Or better yet instead of your option, add this one:

  --use-mailcap

that just parses and uses existing ~/.mailcap and ~/.mime.types.

P.S. I would like you to keep the strict indentation (one TAB only, never
spaces) in the code, otherwise I will need to change it manually.

Regards,
Mikhael.

So I added `icon support'.
those new options would be
,----
| --exec-gen=program1:ext1/ext2/ext3+program2:ext1:ext2 ...
`----

then to those programs it's possible to assign a icon
,----
| --icon-gen=program1:icon.xpm+program2:icon2.xmp
`----

so here's the new patch (the hold had anyway a fault, because I
forgot to comment out a debug print .. line. Even so it worked
anyway.

Anyway,
Best Greetings

Sie mgen berrascht sein, diesen Brief von mir zu erhalten, da Sie mich nicht persnlich kennen. Der Grund meiner Vorstellung ist, dass ich Simon Muzenda der lteste Sohn von Paul Muzenda bin , einem Farmer in Simbabwe, der krzlich im Landstreit in meinem Land ermordet wurde. 
 
 Ich bekam den Kontakt zu Ihnen ber das Internet, daher beschloss ich Ihnen zu schreiben.
 
vor dem Tod meines Vaters hatte er mich mit nach Johannesburg genommen, um 8,5 Millionen US-$ in einer privaten Sicherheitsfirma zu hinterlegen, da er die lauernde Gefahr in Simbabwe voraussah, legte er sein Geld in Form von Edelsteinen an. Die Summe war gedacht zum Erwerb neuer Maschinen und Chemikalien fr die Farmen und zur Etablierung einer neuen Farm in Swaziland.
 

 Die Landprobleme begannen, als unser Prsident Robert Mugabe eine Landreform einfhrte, die sich vorwiegend auf weie reiche Farmer und einige wenige schwarze Farmer auswirkte und in der Ermordung und berfllen durch Kriegsveteranen und einige andere Geistesgestrte gipfelte. Tatschlich wurden eine Menge Menschen ermordet, eines der Opfer war mein Vater.
 
Wegen dieses Hintergrundes floh ich mit meiner Familie aus Simbabwe, um unsre Leben zu retten und lebe vorbergehend in den Niederlanden, wo wir um politisches Asyl ersuchen und beschlossen haben, das Geld meines Vaters zu transferieren auf ein besser erreichbares auslndisches Konto, da die Gesetze der Niederlande einem Flchtling verbieten ein Konto zu erffnen oder in irgendwelche finanziellen Transaktionen innerhalb der Niederlande involviert zu sein.
 
 Als dem ltesten Sohn meines Vaters bin ich verantwortlich fr die Suche nach einem geeigneten auslndischen Konto, wohin wir unser Geld ohne Wissen meiner Regierung, die uns alles nehmen will was wir besitzen, transferieren knnen.
 
 Die sdafrikanische Regierung scheint gemeinsame Sache mit ihnen zu machen. Ich bin konfrontiert mit dem Dilemma, diesen Geldbetrag aus Sdafrika zu holen in der Angst, die gleichen Erfahrungen noch einmal zu machen, beide Lnder haben die gleiche politische Geschichte. 
 
 Als Geschftsmann suche ich einen Partner, dem ich meine Zukunft anvertrauen kann und die meiner Familie.
 
 Ich muss Ihnen noch mitteilen, dass diese Transaktion risikolos ist. Wenn Sie mir und meiner Familie beistehen wollen, mchte ich von Ihnen nur, dass Sie ein Arrangement mit der Sicherheitsfirma machen fr die bergabe (der Fonds) von deren Tochtergesellschaft in den Niederlanden, da ich bereits die Anweisung fr die berfhrung in die Niederlande aus Sdafrika gegeben habe.
 
 Vorher mssen die Modalitten zum Wechsel des Besitzes der Anlagen und noch wichtiger des Geldes, das ich zu investieren gedachte, stattgefunden haben.

Ich habe zwei Optionen fr Sie, erstens knnen Sie whlen, einen bestimmten Prozentsatz des Geldes fr die Nutzung Ihres Kontos fr die Transaktion zu bekommen. Oder Sie knnen zweitens in eine Partnerschaft mit mir treten um das Geld sehr viel profitabler in Ihrem Land zu investieren. Welche Option Sie auch whlen, fhlen Sie sich frei, sich bei mir zu melden.
 
 Ich plane 5% des Geldes fr alle Arten von Unkosten im Prozess der Transaktionen zu verwenden. Sollten Sie keine Partnerschaft bevorzugen, bin ich gewillt 10% des Geldes zu bezahlen, whrend die restlichen 85% fr Investitionen in Ihrem Land gedacht sind. 
 
 Nehmen Sie Kontakt mit mir auf ber die obige E-mail ?Adresse, ich bitte Sie instndig absolutes Stillschweigen ber diese Transaktion zu wahren. 
 

 
 Danke, Gott segne Sie!
