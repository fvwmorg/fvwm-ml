Well, I never seen a keyboard with only one Alt, thinking about this
German has more letters than latin, so this is probably what captured the
right Alt.

Strange you think it is overkill, for me it is much simplier and clean
than SelectOnRelease. By SelectOnFullRelease I mean the release of all
modifiers, i.e. left or right "Alt" in our case, not "Tab". I even think
the original modifiers should not be really passed to the menu code; if
IgnoreModifiers is global, a menu knows itself when no modifiers are
pressed anymore.

Mikhael.

Full_Name: Mihai Surdeanu
Version: snapshot 20030228
CVS_Date: 
OS: RedHat 7.1, kernel 2.4.2-2
X_Server: XFree86-4.0.3-5
Submission from: (NULL) (216.138.75.50)


Sometimes when windows are selected or minimized by clicking on the
corresponding taskbar buttons the taskbar loses its content except the
selected window. In these situations, the taskbar appears as a rectangle
filled with the background color, and only the selected window is shown.
If the taskbar is hidden and shown again, or fvwm is restarted, the problem
goes away.
The same bug was observed using the unstable release 2.5.5, but it did not
appear with the latest stable release 2.4.15 and the same configuration.
Please contact me for my configuration.

But I *definitely* do not want the clutter up the NEWS with things
like

  2.5.x: New experimental module foo
  2.5.x+1: Renamed module foo to foobar
  2.5.x+2: Removed module foobar becaus it sucks

I could be talked into including bug fixes in the NEWS if the
problem was already in the stable branch, but I think entries for
problems that were introduced in the unstable branch are moot.
Behaviuor within the unstable branch may change at any time,
without notice.

With these instructions and emacs 20.7.2 and whatever gnuserv
version comes with Debian 3.0 when you have xemacs installed, I
can not reproduce this behaviour.

If it's not in the mail archive I did not get the file., but at
that time I tried to reproduce virtually any bug.

Well, if you are positive that this can be caused by desktop
layout changes (you did fix them, right?) I suggest we can close
the bug report.

I have worked probably on more different keyboards with US layout
than with German layout, and thy all had an "Alt Gr" key (usually
directly right of the space bar).  Well, of course I do not recall
what was printed on the keys, but they definitely worked like the
typical "Alt Gr" key.  Funny.

It's only simpler if you do indeed use a *modifier*.  For
non-modifier key you have to call XQueryKeymap and scan through
the key vector for for relevant set bits.

Actually, it it not a bug but poor documentation.  The decision
which pager is to be used is solely based on the window's name,
class, resource and icon name.  The resolution is permanent: once
a manager decides that it has to manage a window, it does not care
whether the window leaves the area specified by the resolution.

So much for the theory.  I will check in a patch into the 2.5.x
sources to 'fix' this.

Its not in the mail archive.  I only asked because you asked
for the file to be sent to you.  The users mail address isn't
any good anymore.

Yes, I produced something very close to the images supplied.
I believe its fixed.  It works for me.
I closed the problem report a few hours ago.

We have  another one (861) that  claims  the pager comes  up the wrong
size about  half  the time.  It  doesn't  for me.  I'll  try the pager
under Purify when I get a chance and if it  doesn't spot anything I'll
close this one too.

I didn't want to interfere, because I mostly agreed with Dominik about 3
types of entries that should not be included (listed at the top), although
I understand the Olivier's reasons.

But I would not add anything above these 3 types. If there is a question
whether a change is minor or not, it is not minor, say, changes in spaces
or quotes may be considered minor, but not a name change. I *definitely*
want to see all user syntax changes in 2.5.x, 2.5.x+1, 2.5.x+2 sections.
Users use different versions, probably all of these, you can't provide a
support without pointing to versions when syntax was changed. For example,
I wanted to know when Style Border was renamed to Borders and I needed to
grep ChangeLog for this, because from just looking at NEWS it may seem
that there was never be "Border". Not very good for me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It only makes sence to do something on a modifier release. Doing anything
on a non-modifier release is simply too confusing and can't work, because
a user can't navigate a menu if a non-modifier is still pressed.

Is that problem deterministic?  Please provide a configuration and
try to describe exactly what triggers the problem (step by step
instructions if possible).

My approach is simple.  In the stable branch:

 - All code changes are mentioned.
 - The NEWS for the beginning of a stable branch contains a
   summary of all user visible changes.

And in the unstable branch:

 - Bug fixes are usually not in the NEWS.
 - All new features that appear in the unstable branch may be
   changed, renamed or removed without notice.

I can think of at least two uses:

 1) A kind of randomizer with "SelectOnRelease (crsr-down) key".
    Open your xlock menu, press cursor down and select a more or
    less random item when you release the key.

 2) An alternate "select" key.  Open the menu normally and mark an
    item, then press e.g. F1 to trigger.

That depends on the key.

Anyway, I don't really care too much about this feature.

Agree for the pre-alpha versions. But when 50% or more of the messages on
fvwm@fvwm.org speak about 2.5.x I would prefer to start to have NEWS that
looks somewhat between these two opposite approaches.

Dominik,
Here is my configuration (it is an archive of my .fvwm directory).
Unfortunately, the problem is not deterministic, so I can't really provide
step by step instructions on how to trigger it. 

I have been using this configuration for two days at work trying to come
up with a better understanding of the bug, but so far I think that the
only observation that holds is that any change in the taskbar window
buttons might trigger the bug. For example, the bug shows when a window
changes from minimized to normal state, or when the mouse focus shifts
from window to window. 

On my work PC with the configuration specified in the initial message, the
problem happens about 10 times a day, at least. At home, where I use a
similar configuration (but I have RH 7.3 hence a newer X server) I was not
able to replicate the problem. My best guess so far is that it is
triggered by the X server, which does not do a complete refresh of the
task bar when needed. 

I will keep monitoring the bug and hopefully I can come up with a scenario
that can be replicated. I will also upgrade to 7.3 and see if that solves
the problem.

Regards,
Mihai

And those are the only hints that can be used to assign windows to different
managers? Well, IMHO it really should get mentioned in the man page.

Secondly, if that's the case, it would be good to remove the [id] from all
the options that are NumManagers - independent.

The man page part for the resolution:

*FvwmIconMan: [id] Resolution resolution
              Specifies  when  the  manager will display an entry
              for a certain window. (...)

The '[id]' part suggests that the IconMan is capable of setting separate
resolutions for different [id]'s. Which is not true. So it's just a mistake
in the manual?

Don't get me wrong.  The options are *not* manager independent.
It is just that changing the state does not move a window from one
manager to the other.

Hellp guys.

I love fvwm interface and try to port it to native languages. And some
plans for fvwm-i18n? like a menu for locale language options?

Hello,

I am in the proccess of getting fvwm to support the randr extension.
So far I have got fvwm to see the RRScreenChangeNotify event, now I just
figure out what do do where it says "what else to do" in the following 
snippet of code. (mabey I should have fvwm restart there?)

void HandleRRScreenChangeNotify(const evh_args_t *ea)
{
    if (FRandrSupported)
    {
        if (XRRUpdateConfiguration( (ea->exc->x.etrigger) ) )
            fprintf(stderr,"XRRUpdateConfiguration success\n");
        else
            fprintf(stderr,"XRRUpdateConfiguration failed\n");

        fprintf(stderr,"RRScreenChangeNotify -- width %d, height %d\n",
                DisplayWidth(dpy, Scr.screen), DisplayHeight(dpy,Scr.screen));

        Scr.MyDisplayWidth = DisplayWidth(dpy, Scr.screen);
        Scr.MyDisplayHeight = DisplayHeight(dpy, Scr.screen);

        /* what else to do?*/
    }
    return;
}

does any one have a clue for me?

I have the somwhat incomplete and broken patch here, if any one 
is interested in looking at it. http://www.xmission.com/~sa/randr.patch

cya,
sa

Uh, I fear changing the display size requires a major overhaul of
the code.  It's bad enough in fvwm, but it gets even worse when
modules come into play.

As Dominik said, changing the display size would affect all parts
of Fvwm including the modules, so I guess restarting Fvwm would be
the most logical thing to do.

I suppose that would still cause problems for the clients:
If they are maximized, would they be remaximized?
If they were placed with negative geometry, would their positions
be recalculated?

Is the bug about combining characters in todo-2.6 really a bug?
Is it supposed to work automatically. Is this supposed to be handled by
the X-calls that are used? Wouldn't this have to be handled in the code
(or a library used).
I think Pango should be used for this, but it seems like a larger rewrite
for this, is text rendering already done in libfvwm?

Yes I think. But you may consider it is a miss-feature.

Yes text rendering is done in the libfvwm. It has a lot of feature
regarding internationalization and font loading (take a look at the
FONT NAMES AND FONT LOADING, FONT AND STRING ENCODING and
BI-DIRECTIONAL TEXT sections of the man page). Basically, some
conversions are done before using X-calls. However, there are
no "composing char" converter in libfvwm.

About Pango. At present time the direction we take is to use
only "low-level" libs.

Maybe. Does a "composing_char + a_given_char" = "another_given_char"
in UTF-8 or USC-2? If yes and a table can be found somewhere we can add
an other converter (as FBidiJoint.c). If not we should draw string
char by char and take care of these composing characters (I do not like
so much this solution). A last solution is to use Pango, but it is not
the direction we have taken so far.

Can you send me the fvwm config which allows you to produce
composing_fvwm_bad.jpg.

I think composing is a little more complicated than this.
If I understand correctly the spec. several composing chars can follow a
character forming a new character, so that for each composable character
there is forms for all combinations of composing chars, but the order of
composing chars is irrelevant. 
So for example "a" + "umlaut" + "cedilla" would be the same as "a" +
"cedilla" + "umlaut".
So a solution would be to sort all composing characters following a
character and map the resulting "substring" to a precomposed character.

Olivier, I don't think its "another_given_char" that needs to be produced.
What needs to happen (per what unicode notes and what I've seen) is
to super-impose the second character on _top_ of the first -- that's
why those characters (including 'umlaut') have a dashed/dotted circle
within their glyph representations in the various code charts.  Those
dashed/dotted circles are there to denote a hypothetical location of
the character that proceeded it.

Sure, grab the font noted here,

  http://prdownloads.sf.net/arabeyes/ae_fonts.tar.bz2

Include that font in the various "style" and "font" related resources in
your ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc file; the font name being --

  -arabeyes-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1

For simplicity, I'm attaching an archive that includes a minimal fvwm2rc
file as well as a screenshot of what the string(s) are supposed to look
like.  As can be seen from the RC-file, an xterm will start upon "init"
and another example is available upon "restart".

Let me know if there is _anything_ I can do to help.

 - Nadim

Actually it needs to be replaced by a new glyph.
For example:
"G" + cedilla => "G" with a cedilla _under_
"g" + cedilla => "g" with a cedilla _above_

(U+0122 and U+0123)

Marcus, out of curiosity -- is this done visually only or is
what's stored to disk actually changed ?  ie. what is stored to
disk ("U+0047 + U+0327" or "U+0122") ?

I can see that there are a few exceptions to the superimposition
(you note one above with U+0327 when its proceeded with "g" -- looks
like the cedilla oddly enough goes from below to above mysteriously),
but overall it would still visually look OK if things were superimposed
given the exceptions were taken care of, check the various other
characters -> http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf).

I can only conclude one of two things at this point,

 1. All composers are superimposed with a few exceptions in which
    replacements are used.

-or-

 2. There are two flavors of composing characters and their meaning.
    Some that get superimposed while others dictate the need to change
    a previous form.

I would tend to think it'd be #1

In any regard, for various languages this superimposing is the only
option (as there is nothing to substitute with).

Regards,

 - Nadim

Actually both ways can be used in cases where a precomposed form is
present in Unicode.
Although it's recommended to used composing characters. The characters in
the Latin 1-part will mostly be stored in precomposed form due to
tradition.

Further, sorting is another interesting thing. Precomposed and composed
variants is equal. And then there are different sorting order for
different languages, but that's another story...

I think using a precomposed form, if defined and available and superimpose
otherwise is a good idea.

By the way, how general is the shaping and joining code you wrote? Some
other alphabets (besides Arabic) could make use of this (perhaps in a
modified variant).

Sounds very familiar; nothing that concerns Fvwm though :-)

Its generic and includes various other languages as well beyond pure Arabic
(note the header on FBidiJoin.c).

The substitution you note for the example discussed earlier would be a very
simple addition if my memory hasn't failed (add the appropriate encodings
to the 'shaped_comb_table' array).  The only catch there is you need to
compile fvwm with fribidi with the appropriate flags defined, etc.

Its good to see there are other benefits from the code at hand (I knew
there would be :-).  I'm sure the composing character superimposing (once
implemented) will also open a flurry of other much needed and missed
uses/languages as well as entice a number of new users to convert.

Regards,

 - Nadim

Well,

So if I well understand, FBidiJoint.c should be updated to handle
some "composing char". Nadim can you send a patch? An other issue
is that FBidiJoint has nothing to do with bidi and it should be use
even if libfribidi is not detected?

After that we should take care of the superimpose case. We need a
converter which split an USC-2 or UTF-8 string into two "strings" str
and
 
{
	int position; /* position in the str of c */
	XChar2b c;    /* USC-2 char */
}
superimpose_char *superimpose_str;

Then we can easily change Flocale.c to draw these two strings when
needed. Nadim or Marcus can you write such converter I will take
care of the integration into Flocale.c

Do I well understand?

I think the way to go is this:
First map all characters to their "combing class", ("normal" characters
have combining class =3D 0, various combing chars have different combinging
classes !=3D 0).
Then traverse the string, looking at pairs of chars: if
combining-class(c1) > combining-class(c2), swap c1 and c2 (and
corresponding combining classes).
Traverse one character at a time like this.
Do this until no more swapping can be done.

Now traverse the resulting string each pair of characters if there is a
mapping for it to a precomposed form.
For example: "A" + diaresis" =3D> =C4
Repeat this until no replacing is done.
Note that now multiple combination can be done like this:

"A" + "diaresis" + "acute" =3D> "=C4" + "acute" =3D> "A with diaresis and
acute" (don't have this character at hand...)

Since the combinging characters are orderd, a mapping like this would
work.

Last we can take remaining combining charaters and superimpose them as
Olivier suggests.

I'm not sure though wether we need to do a step before all this that
decomposes any eventual precomposed forms to make it correct.

For example suppose we have:

"=C4" + "acute"
and
"=C1" + "diaresis"

The first would yield a "A with diaresis and acute"
but the second would give "=C1 with diaresis", since there will be no
mapping for this order of combinging, thus the superimposition would be
used in this case.
I don't know if this would be a problem.
We might need to first apply a decomposistion:
such that "A with diaresis and acute" will map to "=C4" + "acute" which
will in turn become "A" + "diaresis" + "acute"

Hi!

I have buttons 1,2,4 activated for my regular windows and for aterms alone I
use this Style...

Style "aterm" TitleAtLeft, HandleWidth 3,  MouseFocusClickRaises, NoButton 2,
NoButton 4

Previously Button 1 used to appear at the top-end of the TitleBar.. now it
appears at the bottom-end!

You can see it here at http://kingsly.net/fvwm-bug.png (The aterm in the
foreground is from 2.5.6 and the one below it in the background is from a
screenshot I'd taken of 2.5.5)

The only thing I could see in the changelogs is the new style options ..
!UseTitleDecorRotation / UseTitleDecorRotation 

I tried both of them.. and they have no effect whatsoever on the button
layout or even the title text. (What is it that those options do anyways ?)

I do not think that there is a bug here. It is a new feature of 2.5.6.
Buttons, title text and decoration (if UseTitleDecorRotation) accordingly
to:
LeftTitleRotatedCW / LeftTitleRotatedCCW, 
RightTitleRotatedCCW  /  RightTitleRotatedCW,

Try: Style aterm LeftTitleRotatedCW

This brings the button back to where it used to be before... but the text
gets "inverted" that is the base of the text points away from the
term(leftwards) instead of towards the term.

And both !UseTitleDecorRotation and UseTitleDecorRotation don't really seem
to do anything at all!

I don't think anything should be changed in the code.
Try to get used to a new feature, it seems intuitive for me.

If you really want the previous behaviour, you may configure buttons
differently for aterm like this (not generally recomended, but may work):

  Style * Button 1, Button 2, Button 4, NoButton 8
  Style aterm NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Button 8

And setup ButtonStyle definitions and bindings to be equivalent for
titlebar buttons 1 and 8.

It makes no difference because you don't use real decorations, just a
solid background color.

Mikhael.

Are you left-handed by any chance? because I don't find it intuitive at all,
whenever there is sideways text, it's almost always with the base of the
letters facing right.(Look for any widthwise ads in magazines.. and you'll
find that the top of the ad is at the left end of the page.)
(I flipped through a bunch of magazines lying here and looked at some
hardware boxes and I couldn't find anything which had bottom-top text with
the base facing left. and even when I'm making notes in the margin the base
of my letters face the right.)

While I agree that the TitleAtLeft is performing as it should (logical -90
degree turn) and the old behaviour would have been 'unexpected' ... I'm not
sure how many people would find it easy to read text the way it's currently
rendered when rotated.

You can see here text facing both sides...

Sort of ... look at your bookshelf.  Unless you're Russian, but your
name doesn't sound it.  ;-)

I looked at both of these, and I have to say that while I have always
thought of text with the baseline towards the window as the "right"
way, the text with the baseline to the left seemed easier to read to
me.  Interesting...

Looks like I overlooked the obvious! Even my game boxes have text facing
left(the same applies to CD/DVD cases too). But whenever there is text facing
both directions (regular and sideways) the the base faces right. I guess
that's why the magazine ads are that way because of the text on the other
page.

Interesting.

BTW LeftTitleRotatedCCW doesn't do anything to my style.. is that also
because I have no decoration. ?

We really did think about the better text rotation.  When the
title is at the left side of the window, it is more likely that
the title is left from the middle of your face.  Assuming that one
tends to tilt the head towards the window title (and definitely
never away from it), this somewhat reduces the angle at which you
look at the text.

That said, I think it's a bad decision to place the odd numbered
title buttons near the beginning of the title.  They always belong
at the top of the window.  Anything else is utterly confusing.  I
see no real dependency between the orientation of the title and
the placement of the buttons.  They just happened to be near the
beginning of the title by chance.

Since the birthday is only two and a half months from now (1st of
June), we really need to start thinking about what we want to
plan.  Here is what I suggest:

  1. IRC chat with the developers.
     [no planning required; just announce]
  2. Finally kick off the fvwm logo contest.
     [need to agree on the rules soon; the contest shouls be
     under way on the 1st of June; need a contest maintainer]
  3. Make a secret 2.4.x demo (possibly 2.4.15 too).
     [Who can do that?]
  4. Update the web site for the event, including some historical
     information.
     [soon]
  5. Announce the event on fvwm-announce and some other places.
     [what other places?]

I can help with (2), (4) and (5) and write down a roadmap, but I'd
be gratefull if someone else volunteered for the web stuff.  I can
*not* help with a demo.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

We had this discussion in the past.

I don't think odd numbered buttons always belong to the top, they belong
to the left of the title if we rotate our head in the needed direction.
This is more obvious for more complex non symmetrical titlebar designs.
For me, only rotating the whole titlebar makes sence, anything else is
utterly confusing.

However, I am not against having flags for separate text and button
rotation if this makes some users happy.

Regards,
Mikhael.

After some busy months I am slowly returning. I will help with the event
organization. I can prepare the web (including a festive design of the
home page later and creating birthday/ tree now). You may send me some
initial plain texts to start from.

I tend to think we don't have enough time for a demo. And 2.4.15 is not
good enough for this, all cool features are in 2.5.x only. So probably we
should drop this idea or postpone it to 2.6.0.

Who else can help with organizing the event? Any artists?

I can think about contests for the best titlebar/menu/panel design.
The works can be posted on fvwm@fvwm.org and voted by readers. The winner
works will be linked from the event page (i.e. birthday/index.html).
I think I can prepare birthday/contest.html with initial rules for
these contests (including a logo) in about a week.

I will gladly receive any help from anybody (Dan).

Regards,
Mikhael.

We really did think about the better text rotation.  When the
title is at the left side of the window, it is more likely that
the title is left from the middle of your face.  Assuming that one
tends to tilt the head towards the window title (and definitely
never away from it), this somewhat reduces the angle at which you
look at the text.

That said, I think it's a bad decision to place the odd numbered
title buttons near the beginning of the title.  They always belong
at the top of the window.  Anything else is utterly confusing.  I
see no real dependency between the orientation of the title and
the placement of the buttons.  They just happened to be near the
beginning of the title by chance.

As a few things changed in the placement.c code I was once asking about,
I think repeating my question may be useful somehow.

The problem was (and still is) in iconification/deiconification of
windows followed by PlaceAgain command. If I iconify a window, move
(GotoDesk) to another desktop then deiconify the window and do
PlaceAgain for it, the window is moved to the desk where it was
iconified. It even prints "map on new desk:" on stderr now.

When I replace SGET_START_DESK(style) parameter in PlaceWindow
invocation in CMD_PlaceAgain function with 0, it behaves OK but this
hack is probably not a real solution.

A simple test:

- Create xterm window
- All (xterm) Iconify
- Change desk
- All (xterm) Iconify off
- All (xterm) PlaceAgain

Window is moved to the desk it was iconified and is not displayed. It
can be seen in FvwmPager, but on the screen is shown only after desktop
changing back and forth.

Concerning: FVWM, current CVS version

I have a request: 
_Please_ make the functable.c the way it was before 2003-03-03.

Why? Let me explain:
On that day Dominik introduced a slight modification ("trigger
on ButtonPress for many of the functions"), and it's been causing trouble
ever since. I don't know what was the purpose of those changes, but I know
one for sure - the "decoration button pressed-in" behaviour has gotten
really bad.

Example: Imagine you have a title bar with a "Close" button. In the good old
days if you pressed the button, the "Close" action wouldn't get executed
until you actually released the mouse button. This allowed fvwm to show the
alternate "ActiveDown" decoration, and also to cancel the "Close".

But now things have changed - it is enough for the user to press the button,
the action gets executed immediately. Fvwm has hardly time to draw the
"pressed" button pixmap, the user just sees it "flash" for a microsecond
- so the Up and Down button states are quite useless (if you can't see it
clearly, then it's useless. And I can't see it clearly.)

And secondly, you can no longer cancel the function after pressing the
button. Which is a bad thing - canceling the "Close" action in the last
second has saved some of my windows.

If those two arguments aren't convincing, then I have a third one - all
other windowmanagers do it the other (old-fashioned) way round. You click,
the titlebar button gets pressed, and it _waits_ for the user to release the
button (or cancel the action).

I presume that Dominik was (and still is) following some Brilliant Master
Plan, and simply overlooked some of the consequences, but the current
"pressing is enough to trigger" behaviour really breaks many things when it
comes to titlebar buttons.

Dominik? Could you _please_ explain what you're trying to achieve?

That is why I was working in placement.c.  I haven't found a
satisfying solution yet.  It is surprisingly difficult to find out
the right value for the start desk.  I had already tried a patch,
but it did not work as it should, so I commented it out.  That is
the change you saw.

I changed it because some functions worked on ButtonRelease (e.g.
iconify) and others on ButtonPress (e.g. Move).  All the
ButtonRelease functions did not work when invoked outside a window
context:  the window selection cursor just flashed and whatever
was under the pointer at that time was immediately selected as the
context window - usually no window, making the action fail.

But as we see now, this removed one bug and made another one
worse.  I will try to fix both problems at the same time.  Perhaps
the Press vs. Release decision can be made based on whether there
already is a context window or not.

Bye

Should be fixed now.  Please report back if you notice any

It's an XMMS problem.  When The X server is blocked, XMMS
eventually stops playing.  Please file a bug report for XMMS.
However, you can tell fvwm not to block the X server when resizing
by putting this line in your config file:

  Style * ResizeOpaque

I think I still have a draft of the rules from the last attempt to

What have you got in mind when saying making a demo? Do you
think a (quite large) set of configuration files which
provides access to most of the features of fvwm will do it? 
I am thinking of collecting some window decorations, menu
styles, key and mouse binding definitions, pixmaps and so
on, to show whats possible with fvwm. The different
features of fvwm could be turned on and off via menu
entries or FvwmButtons. Of course this is similar to
fvwm-theme but it will be within the fvwm-package and could
come with it in future.

Or did you mean a self-running demo like a movie?

To the web site: 
Does your web server support php? If so I could provide a
simple frame-work written in php3, which lets you handle
the contents of web sites entirely separated from its
layout. You can provide a web site in different layouts and
generate different navigation structures. At the moment
it is in beta state but can be already used.

Sure. Well, the buttons work fine now, thank you.

But some new bugs were introduced. Try doing something like

Mouse 1 T N Move

And then dragging the window (by the titlebar).

Well, normally you don't see it. The 'default' Mouse1<->Titlebar binding
works as expected. But if you redefine it, it goes crazy.

It's not much of a trouble for most people, but I am using a 5-button mouse
(plus wheel), and have been happily using those two extra side buttons to
move/resize windows.

<snippet>

Mouse 6 WTI A Move
Mouse 7 W A Resize

</snippet>

But now it won't work. In the past I could drag the window by simply
pressing and holding Mouse6 anywhere in the window (and moving the mouse,
of course). And that was very nice. Now the "move" function kicks in when
I release the button. And then I have to move the mouse, and press mouse
button _1_ to acknowledge the whole transaction. Which renders the whole
function very ugly.

It seems there's no simple solution to this. Context-dependency seems a nice
way out, but I don't know if that's that easy as it seems. In titlebar
buttons the functions should (i guess) get executed on a ButtonRelease. In
the "main" titlebar area (titlebar, but not a "normal" button) it should be
either ButtonPress (e.g.  "Move"), or ButtonRelease ("Raise/Lower",
especially because the titlebar can be drawn "pressed-in", just like
a button)

So it already shows that context-dependency won't do the trick. So _maybe_
the best thing to do would be to revert the changes, and accept the idea
that some functions work on ButtonPress, and others on ButtonRelease. And
maybe we should simply start thinking which functions should be triggered on
"press", and which on "release". It isn't perfect, but it seemed to work.
Mostly. And it would be a good temporary solution.

The *ideal* solution would be to implement correct bindings, like it was in
the past with "Key -FOO". Maybe new commands, like KeyPress/KeyRelease, and
MousePress/MouseRelease, so that the user could decide how it should work.
That would a very flexible solution, but I guess also the most difficult to
implement. As I see it's no longer possible to assign a action to
KeyRelease, so suggesting to implement it on an even wider basis (including
Mouse and changing some of the Functions engine) is, well, not so good.

But I still think that a good KeyPress/KeyRelease, MousePress/MouseRelease
would be the solution to many problems. Sawfish is a nice example - in that
WM the user has access to a set of functions. The user binds events to
contexts not using simple Mouse/Key functions, but a series of commands,
including some that recognize double/triple clicks&releases. Sawfish however
doesn't recognize KeyRelease...

Alright, so 'Key -FOO' didn't work out and got removed from fvwm. Would doing
a MousePress/MouseRelease variations of the "Mouse" command be just as
difficult? Because such commands could be a nice, clean and flexible solution
to those issues. Keyboard handling could use those features as well, but
I guess that sane mouse handling is more urgent.

I don't know the internals of fvwm, but it would probably be a major change.
It would be a Good Thing, though.

This mail is more a feature request than a bug report, and I understand that
it has very low priority right now.

The only exception seem to be title buttons.  In all other cases
you want a certain set of actions to be executed immediately.  If
I did not have to think about backward compatibility, I'd say the
current code does the right thing.  After all, you can achieve the
dragging effect with

  AddToFunc titlebar_move
  + M Move
  Mouse 1 T N Function titlebar_move

But of course we have to think about old configurations too.

You forget that the functions working on ButtonPress fail to work
without a context window.  You can not pick a target window when
invoking them from a non-window context.

Key release bindings are too unreliable.  They *will* screw up
the keyboard focus in no time.

This functionality is already available through complex functions.

It is extremely difficult to code right.  I'd be surprised to see
a (fairly complex) window manager that can handle key release
bindings right.

Complex functions.  See above.

Quite contrarily, it has the highest possible priority for me.
These are the first problems that will surface once a release is
made.  It is better to catch them before.

We thought about a self-running demo, but that does not exclude
showing off fvwm's features.

A X-Demo, Flash or something else? Partly interactive?
How about using the schedule-feature of 2.5.x to build a
demo?

Well, the complex function is a acceptable solution.

Oh, you're right.

And Sawfish is no exception. It actually uses libgdk to get the events, and
this was also one of the reasons why I dumped it for fvwm. Whilst it works
quite fine most of the time, libgdk is unable to handle mouse buttons >3
correctly. It recognizes "clicks", but not "drags". So my side buttons could
only invoke functions that didn't require cursor movement. Popping up menus
etc. But I wanted a WM that would allow me to drag a window with Mouse5. And
fvwm could.

So it works OK now, but some commands need to be wrapped in complex
functions. That isn't much trouble... the important thing is: it works.

An fvwm demo.  It should run from inside fvwm, requiring as few
external programs as possible, especially X applications.

Your choice.

No opinion.  Might work well, but maybe not.

This might be done be done by a file containing
fvwm-configuration statements and fvwm-commands or
FvwmCommand if I get it to work. Currently it claims:
"No such file or directory FvwmCommand error in opening message fifo"

FvwmButtons could be used to select parts of the demo and
execute them step by step.

Instead of the schedule command one could use constructs
like

PipeRead 'sleep 1; echo "Popup MAIN_MENU_popup"'

to achieve a delay between steps of fvwm commands.

Which features should be demonstrated (Moving, Shading,
FvwmCascade, Buttons, TaskBar, WindowList, Colorsets,
Menus, Functions, ...)?

You have to start FvwmCommandS before FvwmCommand works.
Both comamnds have to be started with $DISPLAY set to the same
value.

Look in /var/tmp to see the FIFO its looking for.

I started hacking in FBidiJoin.c to add the support for composing
characters. But it seems shape_n_join() isn't called.
configure reports FriBidi is used and I think I tried Arabic joining
within FVWM some time ago.

Or is it that stderr isn't output as expected? (I added fprintf to stderr
as debugging). I started the my testing version of FVWM manually, so I
think it should output stderr on the terminal...

Are you sure you use an Arabic locale or text encoding?
shape_n_join is only called from FBidiConvert which in turn is only
called for bidi-requiring (i.e. right-to-left) encodings, see
FlocaleCharsetTable in FlocaleCharset.c.

I guess you should unlink or split this functionality from the bidi code.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, I see.
I guess I'll take out this code from the BIDI stuff.

And I suppose I should use the fuctions from Flocale.c and Ficonv.c to
convert input string to Unicode.
Should I run FiconvCharsetToUtf8 straight away?
The comment says: /* conversion from the current charset to UTF8 */
But the the function takes an argument "FlocaleCharset".
What value is this supposed to have? Or do I already have this in
FlocaleEncodeString, where I guess the calls to my routines would be.

You *really* should have mentioned that you use the StickyIcon
style (cost me about one houre to figure that out).  :-/  I have
fixed this particular and other PlaceAgain relateg problems.

I'm sorry. I didn't realize it is important. Poor excuse, I know - it's
obvious but I just didn't think about this.

Iconification works OK now, thanks.

Apropos - maybe there could be some "bug reporting configuration"?
I think about a file containing only the default fvwm settings, without
additional menus, bindings etc. Settings should be placed in the file so
there will be no confusion if they're changed in the code. This way,
when talking about a bug, one could say what's wrong and maybe what
should be modified to reproduce that behaviour. What do you think?

Actually FBidiJoin and libfribidi are very much coupled at the moment.

A couple of things to note.  Arabic and various other languages (those
derive from it or behave like it) require the following,

 1. Bidirectionality (bidi for short - ie. displaying right-to-left)
 2. Shaping          (chars look different depending on location within word)
 3. Combining        (taking 2 characters and substituting them with one)
 4. Composing        ("superimposing" - draw one character on top of another)

FBidiJoin with the help of Fribidi does the first 3 requirements (I didn't
know how to code-up the 4th or I would have done it :-); other languages
might require a subset.  What Marcus has pointed out is that there are
instances in which #3 above will need to be done without regard to anything
else.  Adding those new mutations that have nothing to do with the first 2
rules (and bidi specifically) seems like it would create more confusion then
its worth on the code as it stands now (I'm also sure that Marcus would like
to see #4/composing as well).  The way the code is currently structured,
the first 3 requirements are all rather intertwined (note "FriBidiChar").

In short, it would be logical to break out each of those functions into
their own function-call or whatever (if need be) and have them be
self-sustained.  You see, if you use fribidi, you are very likely to
require the other behaviors (note "HAVE_BIDI" defines).

I'm not sure I understand, I'll try to come back to this as time allows
later (but more explanation would certainly help).

If you guys (Marcus/Oliver/etc), on the other hand, get to this before me
then Great :-)

There is the fvwm-bug shell script, but that does not store any
configuration details.  At present, it's nigh impossible to
determine the configuration without user interaction or running
fvwm - but fvwm has no way to dump the config at the moment.

I did. I had a try last night at home and it works as
expected (2.5.2). At work (2.5.3) it does not. I have tried
several combinations - setting DISPLAY by hand in fvwm and
in the shell which executes FvwmCommand and using the
options -S and -f - without success. In /var/tmp there are
two files:
   /var/tmp/FvwmCommand-gruenbube:0.0C
   /var/tmp/FvwmCommand-gruenbube:0.0M
which disapear when I kill FvwmCommandS. DISPLAY is set to
"gruenbube:0.0".

I got it to work. It was actually my fault, since there are
two fvwm version installed on my computer at work. One is a
2.2 version and the other is 2.5.3. I am running fvwm
2.5.3. The FvwmCommand was taken from the 2.2 version and
the module FvwmCommandS as it should be form 2.5.3. If I
use FvwmCommand from version 2.5.3 it works beautifully.

Nope, the draft is gone along with Pat Rogan's contest site and
all the mails in the mail archive except one by Mikhael with a

That would be useful of course, but it's not exactly what I was talking
about. My config has now some 650 interpretable lines and its dump would
certainly consist many informations not relevant to the question.

I thought about a situation when after finding something suspitious I
could replace my own configuration with a simple "bug reporting" one
taken from the file in CVS tree. I could examine the problem and then
send you report saying "I found this. To reproduce it you have to change
A to B in well-known configuration, then do that. Is it a bug?". Config
should be written somewhere to be easy to see and modify and possible to
set even if fvwm defaults are changed.
With that approach you would know the whole situation, without
additional costs and not having to rely on my guesses about what's
important. Repeated in many reports simple configuration would probably
make communication clearer.

How is this different from the following user report:

Here is a minimal rc file containing 3 lines (one Style, one Exec etc)
that when placed in ~/.fvwm/minimal-rc and called as "fvwm -f minimal-rc"
or directly "Restart fvwm -f minimal-rc" shows the problem. (Description
of the problem follows.)

Mikhael.

User knows his (or her) config but probably doesn't know what are the
default settings. If I have two configs - my and the default one I can
almost imediatelly see and check the important differences and write you
about them. Of course settings are present in the code and described in
the manual but they consist many other informations and it's really hard
to extract only the defaults.

Even if the minimal config is created it is connected only to a
particular fvwm version. The same minimal config would behave
differently in different versions. This doesn't carry any informations
since you don't know if it's so because of changes in defaults or the
functionality. After some commits one can find out that an error
appeared. If the defaults were also changed, the behaviour could be
simply compared by running fvwm with both "bug configs". I can see no
easy way to do it without config files.

If you ask users to create the whole minimal configuration, they would
probably submit all the settings that they think are important. When
asked only for changes, they could see that most things are already set.
I think life could be easier with reports including only the
modifications of the configuration you know really well (because you
often see it). And the file with all the options and their settings
should be handy anyway.

Your help is greatly appreciated.  The most pressing issue is a
new web site.  Below are the steps from my draft of the birthday
planning document.  How much do you think you can tackle?

       Goal: Make a shiny new site for the celebration and keep the news up to
             date.
       Priority: high
       Responsible: volunteer needed, parv?
       Status: planning schedule

       10-Apr
        * Write a short announcement message for the 1st of June and discuss it
          on fvwm-workers.
          [pending]

       15-Apr
        * Put the announcement on the web page.
          [pending until 15-Apr]
        * Put the announcement for the logo competition on the web site.
          [pending until 15-Apr]
        * Make a web page for the logo competition.
          [pending]

       25-May
        * Make a shiny web site for the celebration and post it on fvwm-workers.
          [pending]
        * Make a web page with the pictures of the developers.
          [pending]

       30-May
        * Upload the celebration page.
          [pending until 30-May]

       30-Jun
        * Remove the celebration page or keep the page but remove references to
          the birthday event.
          [pending until 30-Jun]

Bye

I understand what the problem is, but do not know what to do about
it.  When you have "StartsOnScreen c" set, and a window appears that
has the USPosition hint set, there are two cases:

  1) The application knows nothing about Xinerama and requests
     coordinates relative to the screen origin (without knowing).
  2) It's an fvwm module (e.g. FvwmIdent) and requested
     coordinates in the global coordinate system.

Whatever you do, one of the two cases is interpreted the wrong
way.  We can not do anything about the application, and the module
does not know about the StartsOnScreen style.  *With* that style,
global coordinates are wrong, and *without* the style they are
correct.

The bottom line is that StartsOnScreen does not work without
IgnoreUSPosition.

Bye

Do you mean wholly new web site, or will a separate directory for
the occasion (either on fvwm.org or under my own personal space
somewhere) be enough?

I personally prefer little or no doodas on a web page.  Check
it yourself...

  http://www103.pair.com/parv/


..so if anybody else think that my style doesn't/won't fit the
celebration, by all means let me know & take over the design at any
point.

I think this item would be responsibility of whomever ends up
designing/owning the related pages, right?

Again, I can offer a set of php-scripts (GPL) which can
either run on an apache server with php-modules installed
or which can be used to generate a whole html-tree runable
on a server without php.

The relation among the different pages belonging to a web
site is recongnized by the scripts so that changing one
page does not mean updating all other pages refering to
this site. One can choose different layout and navigation
styles.

To get an idea what it could look like have look at my
homepage (only in german at the moment). In the right upper
corner the is a link which toggles between two layout and
navigation styles. (Note the two different navigation
styles if you move to subpages.) The site is currently set
up using style sheets. Since this is not fully supported by
netscape 4.x it may look different with this browser. The
site should be displayed properly with mozilla, opera, msie
:-( and even with netscape 4.7x with JavaScript and
Stylesheets turned on (Netscape needs Javascript to display
style sheets properly).

The usage of style sheets is not mandatory. I used it since
it is efficient and easy to use.

Forgot to mention that this is only the announcement message on

Sparse decorations are no problem.  The result should look more
professional than what we have now, and more eye friendly.  It
must be easy to read and the backgound must give a good contrast
to the text.  And, of course, it should not insult anybody's
aesthetic feeling (green text on red background, or a pink title
on grey background as we have now).

I would like to keep the new design after the birthday.  For the
birthday it should be a bit mor colourful (with confetti and such
;-) ), but after that the more plain style is better.

Yes, it's not interesting now.  We can think about it later.

You have to as Jason what we can do on the web server (I have

How about if I make suggestion for a layout using the
navigation structure from the current web page. I might
have time on weekend to do it (or if it not in the
beginning of next week). For the first time I could put on
my personal webspace.

According to your other mail you are quite open regarding
to light/dark foreground/background. Or do you have any
preferences?

How about loading times? Do you want to keep the web page
as small as possible? One could do two versions of the
layout. One which is simple and small, and one which is
more shiny with a lot of pictures but may take a time to
load it with a modem. The user could choose which version
he wants. Using the php-scripts I mentioned this quite easy
to set up.

No objections, but you and parv should tem up and coordinate your
efforts.

I don't know.  The only requirements I have are

 a) It must be easy on the eye and easy to read.
 b) It must not annoy anybody (e.g. with strange or too bright
    colours, bad text/background contrast, small font sizes,
    requiring large browser windows, etc.)

By the way, these are only *my* opinions.  All others have the
same right to talk about the web site design.

Missed that when first reading it.  A wholly new site that is kept
in separate directories until the birthday.

Please keep topics not related to the web site design out of this
thread and post design related emails only here.

----

  Goal: Make a shiny new site for the celebration and keep the
        news up to date.
  Priority: high
  Responsible: volunteer needed, parv, Uwe
  Status: planning schedule           
                           
  10-Apr                   
   * Write a short announcement message for the 1st of June and
     discuss it on fvwm-workers (for the web site).
                   
  15-Apr      
   * Put the announcement on the web page.
   * Put the announcement for the logo competition on the web
     site.
   * Make a web page for the logo competition.

  30-Jun
   * Remove the celebration page or keep the page but remove
     references to the birthday event.

parv>  Q: Do you mean wholly new web site, or will a separate
       directory for the occasion (either on fvwm.org or under my
       own personal space somewhere) be enough?

dominik> A:  A wholly new site that is kept in separate
         directories until the birthday.

dominik> Sparse decorations are no problem.  The result should
         look more professional than what we have now, and more
         eye friendly.  It must be easy to read and the backgound
         must give a good contrast to the text.  And, of course,
         it should not insult anybody's aesthetic feeling (green
         text on red background, or a pink title on grey
         background as we have now).

dominik> I would like to keep the new design after the birthday.
         For the birthday it should be a bit mor colourful (with
         confetti and such ;-) ), but after that the more plain
         style is better.

parv> > * Remove the celebration page or keep the page but remove
      >   references to the birthday event.
      Q:  I think this item would be responsibility of whomever
      ends up designing/owning the related pages, right?

dominik> A:  Yes, it's not interesting now.  We can think about it
         later.

Uwe> Q:  According to your other mail you are quite open regarding
     to light/dark foreground/background. Or do you have any
     preferences?

dominik> A:  No.

Uwe> Q:  How about loading times? Do you want to keep the web page
     as small as possible? One could do two versions of the
     layout. One which is simple and small, and one which is more
     shiny with a lot of pictures but may take a time to load it
     with a modem. The user could choose which version he
     wants. Using the php-scripts I mentioned this quite easy to
     set up.

dominik> A:  I don't know.  The only requirements I have are
        
           a) It must be easy on the eye and easy to read.
           b) It must not annoy anybody (e.g. with strange or too
              bright colours, bad text/background contrast, small
              font sizes, requiring large browser windows, etc.)

Ahm, what is "shiny" in your eyes? Do you have examples on how it could
look like?

IMHO all a good site needs is an easy navigation. More than two clicks
to get what you want is too much. If you ask me: I like the current
fvwm.org page somehow. It looks so ... settled :) No, not shiny.

No, and I'd rather stay out of this because I have no web design
skills at all.  But we definitely need something more fancy for
the birthday.

I don't think the current site is too bad.  But it has some *very*
ugly colour combinations like the pink titles on gray background.

Umh, maybe you're right about the webdesign skills, but still, you will
have sites you like and sites you dislike. Interesting would be a number
of sites you like, as you're one of the main developers here.

Dominik, be honest: Does the default configuration fvwm2 comes with look
beautiful in your opinion? I mean, if you have a nice and shiny website,
you should maybe think about using another default config for future
releases.

I know, this is OT, but it just came to my mind. Would it be possible to
have the website look like fvwm2? Or/and have fvwm2 by default look like
the website? This is maybe crazy, but, yeah! why not?

Just an idea. I really do _not_ like the default look of fvwm2. I could
imagine that a new user would be quite shocked ... (sorry to the creator
of that "theme", but it's my taste).

That's what I have said for years.  The default config makes new
users run off screaming in panic.  But let's move this topic out
of this thread.

I had the same idea.  A web page surrounded by a themable window
border, with the menu in the title bar :-)  Would be fitting for a
window manager.  Or perhaps with a pager to navigate the sub
pages?

Mikhael, Olivier,

is it feasable to rip a nice, perhaps motif-like default config
out of fvwm-themes and use it as fvwm's new example config?

Actually I have thought of this already. Making a web
design which uses parts of fvwm screenshots should not been
that difficult ;-)

With my latest commit to the development branch, you can now
easily have some kind of 'virtual' tabbed windows.  Well, you
don't really have tabs, but you can cycle through the stacked
windows:

  Key period A M Direction Center (!iconic, currentpage) raise

Then start some windows at the same place with the same size:

  $ xterm -g +0+0 & xterm -g +0+0 & xterm -g +0+0

now you can cycle through the windows with Alt-.  Works only if
the windows are exactly the same size.

Bye

The background should appear more black than gray.
Perhaps the contrast setting on your monitor is low.

I prefer the stone look to plain black, just to add some
interest, but I have seen the background appear a pretty light
gray on some monitors.  It doesn't look that way on mine.

Does cyan look better than pink?
Both look good to me, but the cyan looks a little better.
I'll change it if you like it better.

I think the background has to be either black or white.
To be readable against a range of colors these are the only 2
colors that have a chance of working.

I really prefer the dark background since I don't like shining
a bright light into my eyes.

Does anyone have small public domain images of birthday decorations
that could be used as a page frame?

Since I play some computer games that are very dark, I have set
contrast and brightness to the maximum.  I'm not against a
slightly grained background, but as it is it looks like its
nibbling on the text.  The body of the pages looks very cleanis,
but I dislike the page titles (colours and fonts) and specifically
the old fvwm logo - it makes me scream everytime I look at it.
It's simply amateurish.

As much as I dislike frames, the frame-less site we have looks
somewhat like the content is leaking out of the pages.  The text
lines are too long on some pages.

I really like the idea to give the site a 'window' layout with a
title bar and a border (perhaps only on the top and the left):

 +------------------------------------------+ <- screen

Uwe has a button on his site to switch the page theme.  Wouldn't
this make a great interactive show-off of some fvwm features?
There would be a button to cycle through the available themes with
a link to download the theme config to put in your .fvwm2rc :-)

I don't think it's a matter of colour.

Plus some very dark blue, cyan and gray tones and light grays,
close to white.  The contrast between pure black and white is too
extreme.

Me too.

This is great idea. 

To get an idea I replaced the corner pictures from my web
site against some in fvwm style:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm.php?layout=layout_fvwm_demo

The pictures were taken from the fvwm-theme homepage. The
navigation menu on the left site could be drawn with
pictures from a fvwm menu - but this takes a little bit
more time to set up.

Let's work out the window frame idea first.  Perhaps the pager
would make an excellent new type of menu, giving a graphical
representation of the web site layout :-)

Try Kobo Deluxe.  Its not dark, and its the only game you'll
ever play.  (Well maybe not.)

Probaby due to your settings.  The texture is supposed to be
subtle.

The fonts are your default fonts.  We don't set any fonts.

I used the old logo because it was the default banner in FvwmBanner.
I never switched to the new banner because I think it looks really
bad in comparison.

I'd like to resolve both issues.

Hello FVWM workers,

Enclosed is a patch i proposed a few weeks ago, but which wasn't accepted at
the time because of another bug in FvwmButtons. So, i am reposting it for
revision, and would like it committed. The patch adds a new option to 
FvwmButtons 'Relief <reliefmode>' (with <reliefmode> one of Up, Down, Both),
specifying in which state of the button a relief should be drawn.

Once this is done, I would like to implement two new options for Panel in 
FvwmButtons.
The first one is 'OpenCreates': When a button controlling a panel is
clicked, and the panel does not exist yet, the command of the Panel
is executed to create the panel.
This new option induces another possible option, 'NoStart': When FvwmButtons 
is started or restarted, the 'command' of the panel is _not_ executed. 

I personally have a need for both options, both for a respawning and a non-
respawning panel. Does anyone have any comments on this ? 
The names of the options might not be very good, so suggestions on those 
are also very welcome.

cheers,
Remko

PS: I am not on the fvwm-workers list.

Yes, this is possible but this needs some works. One problem is
that fvwm-themes is complex. So, if we want a good default config
easy to edit some work should be done. An Other issue are all the
icons used and a way to install it in the fvwm user home dir. I think
we should remove all our default configs file and have only one
which is more or less the official fvwm default config.

This thread is meant to contain all discussions about the planned
logo competition.  Please keep unrelated topics out of this
thread.  To begin with, you can find my first draft of the logo
competition rules below.  When you replay, please quote only the
sections you are referring to.  The current draft can always be
found in CVS.

At this time, input is specifically asked for about the format
and size of the contributions and on how to maintain a web page
with submitted logos.

----

	Fvwm Logo Competition Rules
	---------------------------

*** DRAFT ***

!!!
(give a short explanation what fvwm is and why it needs a new
logo)

1. Competition Schedule

* The logo competition begins on 15th of April, 2003.
* Contributions can be made up to and including the 31st of July.
* From the 3rd of August to the 30th of August, the winning logo
  will be elected by the fvwm users on the fvwm mailing list.
* The winner will be proclaimed on the 31st of August.

2. Logos

* Logos can be submitted in either XPM or PNG format.  All other
  formats, including .jpg and .gif are not accepted.
* The acceptable size of the logos is about between 240x150 pixels
  to 360x240 pixels.
* No more than 256 colours may be used.
* Transparency should be used to shape the image.
* As the winning logo is used as a banner, it should have a good
  contrast to any background.
* The submitted logos will be used at full size, scaled down to
  half size, and to a height of 16 pixels.
* The submitted logos will be converted to use no more than 16
  colours when packed into the fvwm distribution and should still
  look good.
* A version using only black and white will also be part of the
  distribution, so it must be possible to still recognize the logo
  with only two colours.
* The name "fvwm" must appear in the logo, without a version
  number (i.e. *not* as "fvwm2").

3. Contributing

* Everybody may participate in the competition with any number of
  contributions.
* Logos can be submitted by
  A. Posting the URL of the logo to fvwm@fvwm.org.
  B. Uploading the logo to ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/incoming/fvwm/
     and sending a mail to inform the fvwm@fvwm.org list of the
     upload.
  C. Sending the logo as an *aggressively compressed* attachment,
     no larger than 20kB to fvwm@fvwm.org.  Due to the possible
     number of contributions, larger files are *not* acceptable.
* For our convenience, please use the subject "[logo]" when you
  send a mail to fvwm@fvwm.org.
* The contributed logos will be exhibited on the logo web page:
  http://!!!
  in the three sizes mentioned above, with full colour and with 16
  colours.
* Logos with illegal, discriminating or otherwise offensive
  contents, at the discretion of the fvwm developers, will not be
  accepted.

4. Copyrights and License

* The artist retains full copyright of his or her work.
* By submitting a logo to the competition, the artist accepts that
  the logo is converted into XPM format (if necessary) and
  distributed under the terms of the Gnu General Public License
  (GPL).  !!!Link to GPL.

5. Voting Rules

* In the election phase, votes are sent to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
* Everybody may vote only only once.
* You can give one or no votes for any number of logos. The voting
  email should contain a list of logos for which you vote.  Give a
  vote for each logo you would enjoy to see as the official fvwm
  logo.
* The logo with the most votes wins.
* The above voting mode is meant to determine the logo that is
  accepted by the broadest range of users and not disliked strogly
  by a large fraction of fvwm users.
* Although everybody may count the votes sent to the fvwm-workers
  mailing list, the current standings of the election will only be
  published when the polls are closed.

6. The winner

* The winning logo will be shipped with the fvwm distribution
  (hopefully in 2.6.0) and used as:

  - A startup banner with the FvwmBanner module at full size.

I understand.  We are in no particular hurry, but we should manage
to get it done until 2.6.0 is released.

Because we are in feature freeze, no new features are accepted at
the whim of one developer.  However, I agree to apply this patch
if a) someone else proof reads and applies it, and b) my fellow
developers agree.  I thought the patch already went into the code.

I asked a colleague and he did not even notice the background was
not pure black from a distance of about 1.5 metres.  Maybe my eyes
are especially sensitive to dim colours.  I thought the background
was too bright right from the start.

Mozilla default fonts, then.  THe Serifs are too pronounced for my
liking.  But setting our own fonts is probably not worth the
trouble.

I guess we don't need to know exactly which of the two looks worse.
The reasoning for the current FvwmBanner logo was "everything is
better than the old one".  That does not imply much quality in the
new one. ;-)

Prize?  What prize?  Isn't the logo being part of FVMW a prize in
itself?

(Rhetorical question people; if you must reply, keep that in mind.)

Setting our own fonts would be a major mistake, (in my opinion).
The choice should be on the client side.

I never saw any point to Serifs.  Theoretically, they increase
readability, but I don't get it.

In mozilla, its easy to pick:

edit->preferences->appearance->fonts->proportional->sans serif

Hi Parv,

It was suggested making a web page in the look of fvwm.
Dominik sayed it would be nice if we could use the a
"FvwmPager"-style navigation and if the web page would be
available in different fvwm-designs used from fvwm-theme. I
like both ideas a lot. The pager navigation might not be
that easy but possible ;-)

Do you know php? It's a simple programming language which
can be embedded in html-code. It makes web design very
powerful since html-code can be generated at request time.
It makes it possible to separate the contents (e.g. text
and pictures) form a web site from its layout. The links to
other pages can be generated as well which allows different
types of navigation structures.  

I developed a simple concept which can be used to describe
web page contents and layout (almost) totally separated. 

I will describe its workings briefly:

Each (php)page consists two parts. One contains
informations about the page which may be useful to other
pages refering to this page (e.g. title name, link name,
link picture, file name, ...) and its relation to other
pages (parent site, child site). Here is an example usable
for fvwm:

$title          = "Fvwm Homepage"; 
$link_name      = "Home";
$link_picture   = "";
$parent_site    = "top"; 
$child_sites    = array("download","news","faq");
$requested_file = basename($PHP_SELF);
$this_site      = fvwm_home

if( strlen("$navigation_check") > 0 ) return;

if( strlen("$site_has_been_loaded") == 0 ) {
  $site_has_been_loaded = "true";
  include(sec_filename("$layout_file"));
  exit();
}

This "Header" is common to all pages belonging to a web
site. Below this header the contents of this page follow
which can be html or/and php. 

After all pages are described in this way. A php-script
called navgen.php is executed. It collects all
header-information from all php-files it founds and
performs simple checks to ensure consistence of the
navigation structure. This scripts generates a file which
contains array assignments like:

$top_array = array("download", "news", "faq" );

$fvwm_home["file"]         = "/afs/tu-chemnitz.de/home/urz/u/uwp/public_html/fvwm_home.php";
$fvwm_home["url"]          = "/~uwp/fvwm_home.php";
$fvwm_home["link_name"]    = "Home";
$fvwm_home["link_chapter"] = "";
$fvwm_home["link_pic"]     = "";
$fvwm_home["parent_site"]  = "top";
$fvwm_home["child_sites"]  = array("download", "news", "faq"); 
...

Note: Not all information in the header need to be exported
to the arrays and not all information exported need to be
defined in every header. The script needs to be ran only
once when something on the navigation structure was changed
e.g. web page was added, removed or renamed. When the script
reads the header information a variable "$navigation_check"
is set which causes to exit the the php-web-page at the
following line:

if( strlen("$navigation_check") > 0 ) return;

A the time of a page request (the page is displayed by
web-browser) this variable is not set so the page is
processed further where it includes a layout file. This
layout file defines a set of layout functions and uses them
to display the contents of the page. The layout file uses
the arrays generated by navgen.php to generate the
navigation part of the web page. From the layout file the
page is include again to get its real contents. 
   I have written a couple of php-functions which convert
the array-structure to a html-navigation. This functions
may be (re)used for the fvwm project.

I know this sounds a little bit confusing. I packed to
php-files of my web-page in a single archiv so that you can
download it:
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/download/navgen.tar.gz


Okay so far, what can we do next? I have downloaded all
html-files form fvwm.org and packed them in a tar archive:
 http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/download/fvwm_14032003.tar.gz
This html-files can be used to write/generate the
php-files. All we need to do is add the header to this
pages and adapt them according to the fvwm site structure.
We may need to add some header information to get the
"navigation pager" work. But this can be done later. After
this we can run navgen.php and use one of the existing
layout files to display the pages.

After this we need to create a new layout file in fvwm
style and maybe redesign some of the existing fvwm pages.
For the fvwm-project I would like to put more php-functions
in the layout file which maybe used in the web page files
to insert some layout properties. 

We need probably a CVS repository to keep our files
consistent. I will ask fvwm-workers for this.

Please let me know what do you think.

Uwe

I may suggest to do it a bit differently, new options for Panel: Respawn
and SpawnOnOpen. This should achieve the functionality you want, but in a
bit different (and I hope a more intuitive) way,

I want to have the functionality in the patch, but the way it is done now
it is not very extendible and as it is now it should be named
"DrawReliefOn <state>", not "Relief <reliefmode>".

Ideally I would like to have more relief styles in the future, like:

  Relief <state> <style>   # state = up/down/both, style=clean/shadow/edge

Or to use "UpRelief/DownRelief <state>" syntax for this.
Additionaly I would like not to encourage a special meaning of negative
Frame value and do it like FvwmIconMan does it. I.e. Frame is taken only
to be positive and we have style=raised/sunk/raisededge/sunkedge values.
By default style for "up" is "raised" and for down is "sunk", like now.

So although I want to have this functionality, I can't vote "yes" yet
for the patch. This needs more discussion so we don't need to change the
syntax in the future.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is indeed a better alternative. I thought about this alternative
yesterday, but leaving out the Respawn option (since Respawn is default
behaviour, and NoRespawn is an existing option). At the time, i found a
problem with this, but i can't seem to find it anymore. So, is the
Respawn option still needed ?

I agree.

> Ideally I would like to have more relief styles in the future, like:
>   Relief <state> <style>   # state = up/down/both, style=clean/shadow/edge

I'm not sure i understand 'style' completely. I would say style (at 
the moment) would be something of 'raisededge/sunkedge/flat' ?

Fair enough. I wasn't aware of a similar option in FvwmIconMan. It would
indeed be better to have similar options. If i understand your 'Relief' 
approach above correctly, i will implement it that way.

By the way, can you estimate how long the feature freeze will last ?

cheers,

Full_Name: Carsten Prescher
Version: 2.5.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux-2.4.18-14 (RedHat 8.0, 
X_Server: XFree86 4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (53.122.197.194)


Precondition: DISPLAY is set to :0

fvwm2 changes the DISPLAY environment variable for all its children to
XDisplayName() which results in DISPLAY=:0.0
Then FvwmCommandS creates the file /var/tmp/FvwmCommand-<hostname>:0.0

If you start FvwmCommand not from a fvwm2-child, the DISPLAY is still :0,
hence FvwmCommand tries to open the file /var/tmp/FvwmCommand-<hostname>:0
and cannot find it.

Yes, Panel already has Respawn (a default), so it is not needed.

As for the second option I don't really worry about the exact name,
SpawnOnOpen seems better to me, but LazyStart or NoStart may do too.

It would be "raisededge/sunkedge" if not the negative Frame values.
With negative frame it only makes sence to have simply "edge", because
negativeness means "sunk".

It may be called "flat", but I used "clean" to make it clear that the N
pixels defined in Frame _are_ used, but bg color is used not sh/hi.

I used "shadow" to name the current plain-3d-effect. If we remove the
special meaning of negative values of Frame, it should be "raised" and
"sunk" instead.

Theoretically there may be a lot of styles, oval-like, gtk-like, qt-like,
sgi-like and so on, but some of them require more colors than just
bg/sh/hi. I would also like to have a relative shadow where the real
image pixels on the border are dimmed/brighten instead of hi/sh (that is
a dinned/brightened version of one color only bg). All these shadow
styles should be done as a library and be shared among modules.

What others think, should we remove the meaning of negative Frame values?
It is not critical to do this change, a user simply gets a raised button;
to get a sunk button he should use this new Relief option(s).

Until 2.6.0 is released. :) But there are good chances your features are
approved if you convince developers that they are very wanted/needed and
you tested possible cases throughly.

Dominik, please wait with 2.4.16. I planned to backport single letter
variable replacements first, like $[w.id]. Probably tomorrow.

I want to ask everyone to make a short notice at least a day before every
release. Most of the releases come at random with a surprise. There may
be some unfinished/uncommitted works. Not to speak about a request for
testing.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'd like to get the Pager changes into 2.4.16 too.
I don't want to hold anything up, but I think I can do it
later today or tomorrow.

Gee, I didn't expect the 2.5.x version of the pager to be
so different.  I think I'd prefer not to port my changes to
2.4.x.  They can wait for 2.5.x to be released.

I am not sure why we need 4 weeks here, one week would be enough.

I think the participians should be encouraged to create large qualitative
logos, like 600x400 that could be scalled down to any needed size.

I would drop this requirement, see also below.

> * No more than 256 colours may be used.

I don't see any difference between 256 and several thousands of colors.
Both can't be easily used on 8bpp. It is better to have more colors if
we want to scale down images.

I would drop this requirement.

I am not sure "a good contrast" is the best wording. I would use
"looks good on any background, preferably achieved by an alpha-blended
PNG image".

"The submitted logos will be used at 3 sizes.
1) The size suitable for FvwmBanner.
2) The medium size (like 150x100).
3) Small size (the width is 16).

The participant is requered to submit only one large qualitative logo.
The 3 sizes mentioned here are optional for submission."

We now have in 2.5.x a good automatical color redution algorithms, so
this is requirement is not needed. I would either make it optional or
drop it.

I am not sure where 1bit images could be useful.

I see 5 variants here, not 3.

  <author>-logo.png     # may be at any size with any number of colors
  <author>-banner.png   # about 300x200, suitable for FvwmBanner
  <author>-medium.png   # about 150x100, also any number of colors
  <author>-narrow.png   # about 150x20 (if this makes sence)
  <author>-bw.png       # about 300x200, black-white

The author may provide either one image (the first one) or all 5 or less.
I would not make "narrow" and "bw" mandatory, but something that may
improve the rating.

True enough.

I would instead *demand* that no more than 16 colours are used.

Okay.

PNGs with alpha blending are inacceptable.  Only xpm and xbm
images with no more than 16 colours will be included in the
distribution.  (Because of the size and the library requirements).

Okay.  But it must be stated that the large logo will *not* be
published.  It will only be used to create the logos in the three
target sizes and depths and must look good in this format.

Colour reduction is nice, but the logos are too large in xpm
format with many colours.

No, it isn't.  Jason would have to move them to some place where
we can edit them and put them on the contributions page.

I see four:

  - XPM banner (about 300x200, 16 colours) 
  - XBM banner (about 300x200, 2 colours)
  - Sidebar    (about 16x24, full colour, rotated 90 degrees)
  - Web site   (about 150x100, full colour, jpg or png)

The author can submit any or all of these.  If any formats are
missing, a large, high quality version must be submitted from
which the smaller versions are generated.  Submitting the smaller
versions is optional in case scaling them down automatically does
not give good results.

16 colors for FvwmBanner? May work and may not depending on the image.
I think we should not mix FvwmBanner problems here. It is not hard to
add a code to FvwmBanner to use different images for 1bpp, 8bpp and
24bpp.

If we speak about our logo globally and not about FvwmBanner, I don't see
adding any color limitation as a good thing increasing a number of
participants.

I don't think distributing PNG together with XPM is a bad thing.
We may convert PNG with alpha blending to transparent XPM (try gimp)
or ask the winner later (if he uses such PNG) to create XPM for us.

I don't know whether anyone will actually use alpha blending, but it
would be really great, such images may be applied to any background very
smoothly.

I think it should be something like: "the large logo may or may not be
published/distributed by the decision of developers, it may be used to
create other suitable images".

We may distribute .xpm.gz, I think it is supported by most modern (all?)

I think it will be more practical to just give the email address of one
or more developers who can place the received images into cvs in a short
time. Dan did it well with screenshots. Or Dominik, Mikhael.

I think we should publish the whole image during the voting process and
then decide what to do with it. It can't be decided now which sizes
exactly will be used, it all depends on the image content and style.

BTW, 16x24 is the size of your titlebar button, I don't think this would
be usable as a menu side image.

For me it is better to receive more submissions than less (we did not
receive many on the previous contest), this is why I don't like strong
color and size restrictions. I would add a restriction for logos to be
nice. :)

Ok.

Judging by the last time we tried this, I think we'll be lucky to
get any good submissions.

I don't think a lot of rules are going to help.

We can color reduce and resize good images ourselves.

Okay, here is a dramatically stripped down version of the rules
with most of the nitpicking removed.  On the issue how to
contribute:  we could simply register a free mail account
somewhere and share the password.  This way any of the
developers can do the work.

--------------------------- snip --------------------------------

	The fvwm Logo Competition
	-------------------------

*** DRAFT ***

(!!!give a short explanation what fvwm is and why it needs a new
logo)

Competition Schedule
--------------------

  15-Apr/10-Aug
    Logo contributions are accepted.

  15-Aug/30-Aug
    The winning logo is elected.

  31-Aug
    The winning logo is proclaimed.

How your logo should look like
------------------------------

* The name "fvwm" must appear in the logo, without a version
  number (i.e. *not* as "fvwm2").

* We want to use your logo in different formats.  The actual size
  will depend on the logo.
   - On the fvwm web site (about 200x120, full colour)
   - As a banner for fvwm startup (about 300x180, 256 colours)
   - As a banner with only black and white (about 300x180)
   - Running up the left side of a menu (about 24x48, 16 colours)

* You do not need to make all these different images yourself.
  Just draw a big image with all the colours you like and we will
  take care of the smaller versions.  Of course you may do that
  yourself too - your choice.

* What you should keep in mind is that the banners will be
  converted to XPM format and put in the distribution.  They
  should look good on any background and not occupy more than 25kB
  after compression.

* Logos can be submitted in either XPM or PNG format.

Contributing your logo
----------------------

* Everybody may submit any number of logos by sending it as a
  *compressed* email attachment to !!!<email address>.

* The contributed logos are exhibited at
  http://fvwm.org/logo-competition

* Logos not created by the submitter or logos with illegal,
  discriminating or otherwise offensive contents, at the
  discretion of the fvwm developers, can not be accepted.

Copyrights and License
----------------------

* The artist retains full copyright of his or her work.

* By submitting a logo to the competition, the artist accepts that
  the logo is converted into XPM format (if necessary) and
  distributed under the terms of the Gnu General Public License.

There can be only one
---------------------

* In the election phase, one voting email per person can be sent to
  fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

* You can give one or no votes for each logo. The email should
  contain a list of logos for which you vote.  Give a vote for
  each logo you would enjoy to see as the official fvwm logo.

* The logo with the most votes wins.

* The above voting mode is meant to determine the logo that is
  accepted by the broadest range of users and not disliked strogly
  by a large fraction of fvwm users.

Gimme the Prize
---------------

* The prize for the new official fvwm logo is 100 Euro or the same
  amount in any other currency.

--------------------------- snip --------------------------------

Bye

Ok, I have created a mini mailing list for this pure administrative work:
fvwm-logo@lists.sf.net. I have subscribed Dominik and Dan, but anyone may
be subscribed/unsubscribed as well if he wants so (you don't need to do
this, everything will be on the web) at:
  http://lists.sf.net/lists/listinfo/fvwm-logo

Votes could be sent to this same address too, so we don't litter
fvwm-workers with dozens of unrelated messages.

Well, the logos from the previous competition *may* be submitted by
not an author, because they already contain all needed permissions.
No prize in this case. No need to document this specially too.

fvwm-logo@lists.sf.net.

Hmm. If it is possible to vote for every logo, I prefer it to be a rating
of 5 not 2, "horrible/bad/neutral/good/wonderful". It may be done using a
web form showing 5 choices near every logo together with a button for
sending votes by email. I may do it after we have the logos submitted.

I think we should allow voting from the web.

There was a specific reason why I did not want pictures on a
mailing list:  my ISDN line at home.  I don't want to download
MBs of images there.  But with the new mailing list I can set a
filter that blocks the list mail on my home address once the
competition started.

Do you still have them?

You can make such changes directly in CVS.  I don't need to say
yes to everything.

I read a bit of theory on voting and elections.  The big advantage
of this mode is that if you strongly dislike one choice, the best
thing you can do is not to vote for it.  You can not further
reduce its changes by voting for something else.

> I think we should allow voting from the web.

Yes.  But I fear this will encourage people to vote multiple
times.  Perhaps an email form?

THere is a bug in the aspect stretching code.  If the pixmap is
wider than it is tall, it is stretched to fit the target
rectangle's height, and if it is taller than it is wide it is
stretched to match the target width.  For example, if the pixmap
and has this format:

  +------+
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  +------+

And the menu this:

  +------+
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  |      |
  +------+

The pixmap only occupies the upper part of the menu.  I think we
a "TiledAspectPixmap" option too.

Hi there,

I have put a first version under development of the fvwm
homepage on my webspace:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm_web_site/

This version is uncompleted. Currently there is only one
page available. I put it online to show what I am going to
do. I plan to add a pager in the top left corner and either
a fvwm menu or an icon manager containing sub links below
it. I think about putting a TaskBar on top of the page
which shows the location of the actual site relative to the
fvwm home page like

+----------------------------------------------------------
| fvwm home -> documentations -> man pages -> FvwmButtons
+----------------------------------------------------------

I rewrote my php-scripts that all links are kept relative
now. It is so possible to generate the whole html-tree and
put it on the fvwm-server without any modifications
(hopefully). This needs only to be done if your web server
does not support php - What I don't know yet.

I implemented a couple of functions which insert the window
decorations as seen on the demo site. They can be used in
each fvwm-page and will depend on the actual style e.g.:

<?php decoration_top_line("Fvwm Home Page"); ?>

will insert a table line containing a window decoration
which has "Fvwm Home Page" in title.

Maybe we need to discuss the structure of the web tree. My
first suggestion is:

Home (This site)
|
+- News (As it is now)
|
+- Features 
|
+- Download 
|   | 
|   +- Fvwm Packages
|   +- fvwmrcs
|   +- vectorbuttons
|   +- icons 
|   +- sounds
|
+- Screenshots
|   | 
|   +- Window decorations
|   +- menus
|   +- desktops
|
+- Documentations
|   |
|   +- man pages
|   |   |
|   |   +- fvwm 
        +- ....
|   +- may be other docs faqs (cvs)
|
+- Contact (Mailing list addresses)
|
+- Links
| 
+- (Other infos ?)

Authors? Maybe from Home

Any suggestions are welcome :-)

Regards, Uwe

Nice.  It gives a good idea of how it could look like.  Just to
have something to compare it to:  could you make another
version that draw the window title and the left border around the
whole page?  (I.e. "page looks like a desktop" vs. "page looks
like a window".).  I think I slightly prefer the "window" layout
since it would look more structured, but it's hard to say without
seeing it first.

It's fine to start with.  We have to keep in mind that we need a
nice design for the *front page* on 1st of June.  Everything else
can wait a little bit longer.  Don't spend a lot of time on the
other pager before we have agreed on the basic looks.

Argh!  No way!  No taskbars on fvwm web pages!  Yuck!  :-)

Looks good, but don't nest it unnecessarily.  For example, there
is no need to sort everything remotely related to documentation
under "Documentation".  We can as well keep the old two sections,
one with developer info and one with man pages.  I suggest about
ten to fifteen links/buttons on the front page.  This is not too
much for the eye and gives a good granulatiry.  With more buttons
it becomes confusiong (see
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/ for an example) and with
too few you have to click too often.  Oh, by the way, keyboard
navigation (tab) on the page is mandatory.

Like 
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm_web_site/index.php?layout=window
?

That's ok. The hardest part will be to find the right
layout ;-) Pages are only derived from this layout file.

> Argh!  No way!  No taskbars on fvwm web pages!  Yuck!  :-)

;-)
I thought making the web like a screenshot. For example:
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/screenshots/full/spruce.gif
(My idea was to show as much fvwm features as possible and
use them in the web design way:)

This might be to much for the Icon-Style-Buttons I used now.
Especially if you view the page on small desktops. i.e. 800x600:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm_web_site/index.php?layout=16buttons

I have planed to put a "quick" navigation on each page, so
that you don't have to use the back button of your browser.
This quick navigation with Icons should contain at most 8
links.  Or we may use another style to present the links
i.e. FvwmIconManager. On the top/start page it might be
useful to provide additional some "direct links".

There too much links on this navigation ;-)

This should depend on your browser. With mozilla you can
switch to the links with tab. I have not tried other
browsers yet. (I can do that at home.)

Almost.  Can you remove the bottom and right border of the outer
frame too?

Yes, I got that :-)  BUt we should keep in mind that the page must
still be easy to navigate.  We must not drown the surfer in
graphical gimmicks that make it hard to find the information she
is looking for.

Yes, that's too confusing.  But that is a specific problems of the
"desktop icons menu" style.  In the end we should probably have
some structure with the links in one, maybe two vertical columns.
Everything else is too difficult to read (so forget my idea of
putting the menu items in the title bar).

How about a WindowList like layout:

  +-------------------+
  |[i] Home           |
  |[i] Download       |
  |[i] Developer Info |
  |[i] Man Pages      |
  |[i] Screen shots   |
           ...
  |                   |
  +-------------------+

The [i]s are some mini icons, but it's probably easier to read
without them.

And one suggestion about the site layout:  Screen shots and
configs should be in the same place so you can say "I want the
config for this shot".

No need to check all browsers.  I just wanted to mention that the
pages must allow it (not like Shockwave flash menus, etc.).

With difficulties. I use a simple shell script to generate
the decoration pictures from a window screenshot or
another picture. To see how it works look at:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm_web_site/index.php?layout=window&border=1 

The script cuts 9 pieces out of a pictures which can be
remerged in a html-table to make the original picture scalable.

So I have to remove the bottom and right border by hand.

In my opinion a web site must be designed to provide access
to the information one needs as easy as possible. So the
first requirement is easy and obvious navigation the second
would be a fancy layout to bind the surfer ;-) 

I will do some examples. Due the php-concept it is quite
easy to add and remove parts of a web page. Once you have
set them up you can insert them in a page and remove them
from it within seconds ;-)

Yes. Good idea. I could do an example hopefully by the end
of this week.

Yes, that's what I have in mind too. I was also thinking
about modular configs which can be included by Read in
.fvwm2rc. One could provide config-parts for window
decorations, menu styles, module configs and so on. I have
set this up at my home computer but not that consequently.
It makes changing parts of the fvwm-config quite easy and
portable.

I have to check the pages which different browsers anyway.
Every browser displays pages slightly differently.  Most of
them do not support the whole w3c standard :-(

Agreed.  Perhaps we fvwm developers seem to define "fancy" less
colourful that others.  A good layout should make it easy to
choose between more fancy and less fancy.

In the best of all possible worlds, it would be possible to
generate the theme automatically from fvwm-themes, including the
config snippets :-)

Please don't forget the other browsers, i prefer using dillo or
w3m and hate it to start mozilla when a site is unreadable.=20

Apart from that you design look very nice (on mozilla ;).

Hello,

Is there no way to keep a window such as FvwmButtons from showing
up inside the FvwmPager? I think it would be a nice feature if it
could be done with some configuration directive.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

I would like to see an option to FvwmButtons so that the icons rested on
the
back of the screen, with no buttons visible. The icons need not be
draggable
but are not icons: they can be clicked upon to launch an application, like
the ones on the gnome desktop running sawfish (red hat 8.0) for instance.
I don't think such a feature would make fvwm inefficient, would it?

Thanks,

Neil

Mine is in the middle, not the top, but no matter.

This is not the bug. AspectPixmap is required to preserve the image aspect
ratio, and therefore cannot fit the menu all the time, and indeed will
rarely be a perfect fit.

The bug is that portion of the menu not fit by the pixmap is old historic
pixmap data. I thin it should either be some background colour or a
tiled copy of the AspectPixmap.

It also doesn't really address the question of why the pixmap is drawn
onto the menu instead of being set as the XWindow's background. I'm
curious about the reason for this choice. It seems to me that putting
it as the background would get you tiling for free.

It's not in the 2.5.6 FvwmTheme manual entry.

Possible in 2.5.x, man FvwmPager.

This is a big problem. I have played around this morning
with amaya and dillo. Both do not support style-sheets as
they where defined. This makes it nearly impossible to
describe the page as I did it and have them displayed
properly in those browsers. 

There several ways to cope with this. 

One could make different versions for different browsers.
This is possible only if the web server supports php (or
another pre-processor language). Using php and a modular
concept this is less work than is sounds. Many professional
pages do that.

One could find a set of (html)-statements which are fully
supported by all browsers. 

One could use _fixed_ images for decorations. As I said
before I used 9 generated images to produce the window
layout. This highly depends one the use of style sheets
since the images are small and must been repeated by the
browser to draw the whole border. If this is not supported
by the browser one could use 4 simpler images together with
a background color:

+------------------+
+------------------+
| |              | | 
| |              | | 
| |              | | 
| |              | | 
+------------------+
+------------------+

In that case the size of the window remains fixed. And the
page will look ugly when the user uses font size or a
screen resolution which is far away from that for the page
was designed to. You can see this quite often. Most times
it is said "This page was designed for a screen resolution
of 1024x768". I would not like to do that.

One could design the page that it looks good in browser
which support the standards and look less fancy in other
browsers. One need to ensure in that case that the
information on the pages is accessable by the other browsers
as well. This can be done by choosing the right background
colors which will be displayed by the non-standard
browsers. Standard browser will overlay the colors by a
background image.

Yes.

It can not be made a perfect fit, but it can be made lager than
the target rectangle.

Read: I think we *need* a "TiledAspectPixmap" option too.

Why not just a link to a "light version" at the top of the page?

I made a new version which uses background pictures only to
draw the decorations. Those pictures are not drawn by amaya
and dillo so they not shown at all in these browsers.
Defining a backgound color as well the site is still
visible in amaya and dillo even if it does not look that
fancy as in the other browsers. 

I have also added a menu in fvwm style.

Can anybody write a list of fvwm features you would like to
be shown on the web site?

I see you work on it right now.

I like how it looks in Netscape 3 (without image decorations, but I think
it could be nicer than just gray). Please always specify bgcolor in <td>,
it is currently not specified in the gradient part. And I think the
global page background could be set using <body background>, this way it
will look nicer on more browsers.

Do you mean the current features.html? It may be updated, but it is ok.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am quite suprised that is still looks good in netscape3
even if I had some difficulties to get it diplayed properly
by the first time I opened it with netscape3.  The version
which is currently online is about 30 minutes old. I have
tried a new version of the script which extracts the
sub-pitures from a window screenshot image.  The background
colors have to be adapted when we have find the right
decoration/layout for the page.

Done for most cases ;-)

You are right. I used stylesheets only till now. The
background image in the body tag has been added by now.

Uups. I have overseen it all times. - My fault. I will use
features.html of course.

Thanks for the hints.

With the next fvwm release, I plan to modify the license on the
parts of fvwm that I have written:

Using my code will be allowed under the terms of the GNU Public
License for:

 - private use everywhere,
 - use by non-government organisations that have humanitarian
   goals or fight against all forms of war,
 - use by anybody in the countries that do not dispatch military
   forces against Iraq.
 
Using fvwm is explicitly forbidden in any country that does send
military forces against Iraq:

 - in their public administration and government
 - in educational institutions and research istitutes
 - in companies.

These terms will be in force for the duration of the war plus one
hour for every killed civilian.

I can not bear the thought that my work has any part in killing
people, no matter how small; for example at universities that
further the development of weapons by their research.  I am fully
aware this is unjust towards many people, but killing is a much
greater injustice.  I will listen to suggestions to improve these
licensing terms, though.

Fvwm is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License
which enforces the same license on all modifications of the code.
But there are central source files that have only been touched by
me and for which I hold the copyright.  Therefore I think I have
the right to do this.  The license of all versions in the past
will not change and anybody may continue to work on fvwm on this
base.

Everybody who knows how much time I spent improving fvwm should
know how difficult this step is for me.  So, please, spare me any
flares, especially of the anti-German type.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

You need to aim your arrows better.  You got me and I don't
like killing people either.

Hi Dominik,

: With the next fvwm release, I plan to modify the license on the
: parts of fvwm that I have written:

Have you read this GPL FAQ?
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL

I support your cause, but I'm not sure a modified licence
is going to be as legally watertight as GPL.

Dominik, war and murders are not good but what you are doing can be

If you insist on this license change it will be required that you
list all files you are able to relicense. These should be the ones,
that have been written and corrected only by you.

Obvious stupidity of this temporal relicense is that it will expire
shortly (if you do not change you mind and relicense it again) so that
nobody will even note the change.

>From the other side, just after you change the license fvwm will
become non-DFSG clean
(http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines),

With this step you wont hurt US/British goverment. You will mostly
hurt many free software users.

I am disappointed. How exactly fvwm is affected by one world conflict.
We have hundreds of world conflicts yearly, millions of people die.
If we change a licence hundreds of times every year where will we come?

Sorry, fvwm is a peaceful project, please don't make it a slave of
someone's political ambitions.

Anyway,

  1) You can't change the license of the already released GPL'd works
  2) The code in cvs is GPL'd, if you add any other code it is still
     GPL'd, if you want to start a political-non-GPL-fvwm, please do
     it in another cvs repository

I am fully with your pain, but what you want to do is just silly.
This is not any different from the steps of the side you are fighting
against. Politicans of side A decide politicans of side B are bad
so the people of side B should be punished. And you decide that the
politicans of side A are bad so the people of side A should be punished.

Let's stay away from the politics here, it is too dirty to even discuss.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Dominik;

Leaving aside the context, let me make a few points from a legal
perspective:

 1) As you point out, you can only change the license on versions of the
    code which have not yet been released; you can't retroactively change
    the license on versions already released.  So this would only impact
    the next releases.

 2) Also as you point out, you can only change the license on files
    which you alone hold copyright to: that is you wrote them in the
    first place and are the only one who's modified them.

 3) If you do change the license to "Dominik-GPL", then your copyright
    will become legally incompatible with the rest of the FVWM code,
    which is licensed under the GNU GPL.  The GNU GPL does not allow
    restrictions such as the ones you mention.  Remember that even the
    old BSD license was incompatible with the GPL until Berkeley
    rescinded the advertising clause, and that was minor compared with
    the changes you are proposing.

    That means that we cannot make any new releases of FVWM until either
    (a) all the incompatibly licensed code is removed, or (b) the
    license is changed back to vanilla GPL, or (c) all the rest of the
    code is also changed to allow distribution under the terms and
    conditions of "Dominik-GPL".  Any attempt to release the code would
    be violating its own license and thus illegal (if you are the sole
    copyright holder you can of course violate your own license: you are
    not bound by licenses on code you have copyright to... but no one
    person has copyright to all the FVWM code).

 4) Even assuming we could get everyone with a copyright stake in FVWM
    to agree to change the license to make releasing a new version
    legal, this license is not free according to either the Open Source
    definition or the Debian Free Software Guidelines, which means that
    FVWM would have to be dropped from a number of Linux distributions.

 5) Not only that but some of the libraries or other "3rd party" code
    that FVWM links with may be covered by the GPL as well (we'd have to
    check this though), and if so that would mean we could no longer
    link FVWM with that code.


The situation sucks but I don't know that this is the right approach for
speaking out about it.  In the end it's of course up to you as it's your
code.


Peace.

Let me make some comments to the issues that have come up.

 1) My motivation is by no means political.  It is solely based on
    moral.  I can not bear that my work is misused to kill people.
    I do not mean to punish or antagonise anybody, but I am trying
    to save myself.

 2) I am fully aware that such a change of the license will make
    it impossible to ship fvwm as part of Debian and other Linux
    distributions.

 3) Given the results of similar wars in the past, I do not think
    the license will last only for a short period of time, but for
    years (i.e. many thousand civilians killed, like in
    Afghanistan, Kosovo, etc.).

 4) I am thinking about allowing to "buy" the right to use fvwm by
    making a donation to one of the mentioned non-government
    organisations, for example Amnesty International.  I assume
    that nobody accepting or helping the war will do this.  I trust
    people's common sense when they decide the actual sum to
    donate (of course other forms of donations are accepted too).

 5) Determining a way how the license can cooexist with the GPL is
    a very delicate matter.  It will take time to write down a
    water-proof license.

 6) In case I can not find a license I currently see the only the
    option to completely cease contributing to the open source
    community.

Thank everybody for the comments.  I *am* listening to all
complaints, suggestions, etc.

Unfortunately(?) the GPL is extremely robust in the face of such things.
Any license which adds _any_ restriction beyond what is required by the
GPL is not compatible with the GPL, and cannot be combined with code
licensed under it.

As I mentioned before, even the BSD advertising clause, which _was_
perfectly acceptable to both Debian and the OSS, was not compatible with
the GPL.

There is absolutely no possible way a license with clauses such as the
ones you described previously can coexist with GPL'd code, no matter how
carefully crafted or how much time is spent on it.

The exact same freedoms that we depend on to keep our code free from
proprietary use are the ones which prevent you from restricting its use
by the entities you mention--as is so often the case, sharp tools cut
both ways.

That would be a great shame, to be sure.  I sincerely hope it doesn't
come to that.

Well, maybe there is.  The GPL covers only the right to
distribute, modify and copy the software:

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, ...

Strictly speaking, the GPL forgets to grant anybody the right of
using the software.  So, as long as I do not care about whether
the source code or binaries are copied, modified or distributed, I
think I can still restrict running it.

I do not want this either.  It would have almost the same effect,
except that nobody would notice.

I don't think this is the case.  The key point is not whether you can
restrict things that the GPL doesn't address, it's whether the resulting
license is compatible with the GPL.

The relevant section is this:

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And this:

  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
  a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
  the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
  extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
  of who wrote it.

It must be entirely released under the GPL itself, or it doesn't meet
the legal criteria.

Yes, I agree with that analysis.  The crucial point is that the
GPL and a license to run a software are orthogonal, as stated by
the passage I quoted.  Since running the software is definitely an
"activity other than copying, distribution and modification" it is
"outside its [the GPL's] scope".  And if it's outside the GPL's
scope it can not violate the GPL.

By the way, the fvwm license already violates the GPL by
restricting the right to modify the sources:

  Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
  documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,
  provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that
  both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation

(note the explicit permission to use fvwm - which can be easily
circumvented by deriving a new window manager from fvwm).

[Taken off-list]

As an American, I must say that I am extremely ashamed of GWB's
inability to listen to reason from respected leaders of other
countries--as well as people in his own cabinet--as well as the
countless numbers of people that have been, and still are, protesting
this insane and irresponsible drive toward an unnecessary war.

That being said, I'm afraid that your protest, although being made for
morally impeccable reasons, will be less effective then any of the
other protests that have taken place in the last year or so, since it
will have very little visibility to the general public, who don't know
window managers from store managers.

Your decision, if you decide to go through with it, will be very
unfortunate for the future of FVWM, which is nearing its celebration
of the anniversary of its birth, as it causes doubts about whether
people will even be able to use the program.

I am not a lawyer, and I will leave it to people with more experience
working with the GPL to figure out how your currently stated
decision(s) will affect future versions of FVWM.  I have seen some of
the responses to your message, and it seems that there may be some
basic incompatibilities with the GPL and your desires.  It is because
of any possible damage to FVWM that I would urge you to possibly
rechannel your protest to a means that would be more effective in the
long run.

Again, I must tell you that I truly understand how upset you are about
my country's current actions in the Middle East.  It is my hope that
the war will be quick, and that as many people as possible emerge from
it safely.  I know that my hope is shared by many people around the
world, including people within my own country.

Please let me apologise in advance for the controversial political
statements contained within this posting, and for any offence that I may
cause to others by the inappropriateness of my comments. As has already
been pointed out in an earlier thread, it really should not be discussed
here in this forum.

I applaud and admire your strength in having the courage to stand by
your convictions. I have often wondered how many open source software
development projects have been unknowingly contributing to the
persecution, torture, rape, and murder of millions of innocent civilians
by oppressive ruthless despotic regimes, or even secretive terrorist
organisations, but I guess there's no real way to tell is there?

Personally I would also include media organisations as they seem to be
gaining greater benefits from this "unjust" war than anybody. It has
been in their own interests to fan the flames of protest and dissent,
and distort the facts with hypothesis and hyperbole in the guise of
"information", and thereby knowingly participate in the distribution of
propaganda from all aspects of the discussions now taking place. Is
there anything the media empires wont do for a headline?

And thereby alienate more distributions and further contribute to the
demise of fvwm's popularity.

Given the recent advancements in modern warfare technology I don't think
any comparisons with other conflicts can be justified as being "valid". 
In Afghanistan (the most recent) the terrain and tactics were entirely
different, and there was no clear distinctive method of identifying "the
enemy" as they wore civilian clothes and often (and possibly still do)
posed as innocent civilians. 
In Kosovo the practice of ethnic cleansing was a primary motivation for
U.N. intervention. In both conflicts widespread civilian casualties were
the direct result of the actions of the original aggressors, which is
apparently what Saddam also intends by strategically placing as many
military targets as possible behind innocent human shields, and thereby
invoking world wide outrage at the high cost of "collateral damage".

Having said that however, it does nobody any good to expect or theorise
what the outcome will be. Only time will tell, and history will be the
final judge.

This may actually be a good idea in peace time as well as in war. A
donation to any charitable organisation is surely welcome always.

You may not have as much time as you think to decide this as most

This would most certainly be a great loss indeed. Your insights and
contributions have been considerable, and I am convinced that fvwm in
particular would not be the outstanding example of the achievements of
co-operative open source software development that it is today, without
the benefit of your wisdom and guidance over the many years of
leadership that you have given freely and generously, without thought of
reward or recompense. Whatever your decision may be, I sincerely wish
you well.

Finally, to paraphrase the Buddah, "All life depends on suffering."
Humans have flourished by eating the flesh of animals. Governments have
flourished by consuming the wealth of their populations. One cannot
blame the gun that kills. Nor can one lay blame on the hand that crafted
the weapon. It is the hand that wields the weapon that must be judged.
Not the weapon's creator. These are the very same issues that the
scientists who worked on the now infamous Manhatten Project were facing.
No sane human being would want a war! Would they?

Robert Nation began the development of fvwm while working on a military
project which required certain attributes from the window manager that
were lacking at the time. Does that mean that fvwm's development has
been tainted all this time?

I hope my arguments here, from purely an uninformed user's perspective
have helped, and not confused or clouded the issues confronting you. I
once again, whatever your decision, most sincerely wish you well, now,
and in the future.

The war itself is off-topic, but how it affects licensing isn't.

I prefer to believe that fvwm (and opensource) contribute to global
peace and understanding.  There is a message about cooperation,
sharing, and helping strangers involved that I think everyone
understands.

You hit the bull's eye, Dan.  I have always been a fervent
advocate of the GPL because I believe in unversal cooperation
instead of competition, and developing open source software was my
way to contribute to that idea.  Now I had to learn that I was in
error regarding the GPL, and that open source software *is* a
political thing.  But that should not affect my basic beliefs.

As I said in some other mail, I think the GPL is incompatible to
the original copyright by Evans & Sutherland and Robert Nation and
I thus was never allowed to impose it on fvwm unmodified.  That
gives us the chance to modify the license we have now.

Tim suggested to make a public plea for peace, similar to the
proclamation we made after the attack on the World Trade Center.
But I believe this is not enough.  I would like to add a statement
about the fair use of fvwm to the license, and obligate *all*
users and developers (including myself) to read it and to make a
donation to aforementioned non-government organisations, no matter
how small the donation might be.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

fvwm doesn't handle the KDE Kicker system tray properly. Often the icons
are misplaced. The KAlarm system tray icon doesn't show up at all. If I
kill fvwm and start the native KDE window manager, the Kicker tray works
properly.

The KDE KIcker Pager shows a different virtual desktop number than
selected. The number is always the true desktop number plus 1. If I
reconfigure fvwm to use virtual desktops 0 to 11, the behaviour is the
same, but additionally the desktops 3 and 4 four are the same.

That's what I currently configured:

Style * EWMHDonateIcon EWMHDonateMiniIcon EWMHUseStackingOrderHints \ 
	EWMHIconicStateWorkaround
Style kicker Sticky,NoTitle,NeverFocus,StaysOnTop,BorderWidth 0,HandleWidth
0
EWMHNumberOfDesktops 12 12

I tried to configure KDE to use 1 or 12 Desktops. This setting doesn't seem
to have any effect.

Normally I am only reading fvwm-workers, but this time I guess I have
to pipe up.

Dominik, in my opinion you need to find the balance between fighting
your frustration about the war and frustrating other people by
forbidding them to use fvwm2.

All you $DEVELOPERS of fvwm2 did a really great job, providing a
wonderful, stable, customizable window manager and supporting us 08/15
users with helpful words. I don't think I only speak for myself when I
say that you lightened up my life with fvwm2.

Now there's the other side of the medal: fvwm2 is free and so publicly
available. There's a license of whatever sort which restricts the use of
this particular piece of software or parts of it. Therefore, it's likely
that some not-so-nice-fellows use it as well. That is what you want to
avoid by changing the license.

Dominik, think twice!

 - do you really beleive that a guy who is able to kill humans reads
   your license and thinks: "oh, it's illegal, so I will not use it"?
 - on the other hand, all that are affected by your license which do
   not hurt others, they might read the license and feel illegal. Maybe
   they really uninstall fvwm2 and stop using it. Dan would be one of
   them, I suppose.

In my opinion, it is much better to let those who like your code enjoy
it, regardless of who it is, than penalize some groups of which 90% are
unguilty, and 100% of the remaining 10% don't care about what you're
writing.

Please, rethink it.

The screen goes blank when I press the right mouse button inside a nedit
window. When I moove the mouse a little, the screen reappears.

This happens with fvwm 2.5.0 and 2.5.6 (and probably the versions
between),
but not fvwm 2.4.16 or a different window manager. I have
fvwm-themes-0.6.2
installed (this happens with the default theme).

I'm not quite sure whether this is really a fvwm bug, it might also
be a bug in the themes (but they're just a bunch of scripts as a
replacement for .fvwm2rc, right?) or in the X-server (nvidia) or in
nedit.

I have the following line in my .fvwmrc2 file:
  Style XClock Sticky
to make xclock sticky.

If I open an nedit window for a file named "XClock" by issuing the command
"nedit XClock" the nedit window gets sticky, too.

I'm not sure whether this is a bug in fvwm or in nedit (version 5.3RC1)
or even a feature.

By "blank" do you mean "black"?

Do you mean the entire screen on your display station turns black?

Do you just mean the nedit window?  If so, does that include the frame?

It didn't happen for me, I just got a little popup for copy/paste.

Its a limitation of the way styles work.
They match on a windows name, class, or resource.
You can start xclock like this:

xclock -name MakeMeSticky

and then change the style like this:

Style MakeMeSticky Sticky

Please use fvwm@fvwm.org before reporting a bug.

Thanks.

I used to use fvwm 1, long ago, and then fvwm2 on my Sparc IPCs.
Eventually I switched to Enlightenment since it came with RedHat and
let me do most of what I had been doing with fvwm2.  With RedHat 8.0,
this was no longer the case, and I went back to fvwm2, using the beta
version to get Gnome session managment.  Additionally, fvwm2 lets me
run a very light-weight session which is useful for some of the
graphics applications I am using.

With this change in licensing, I can no longer use fvwm2 for the
computer in my office since it is a company computer.  It can be
reasonably argued that my "home" computer is also disallowed since I
do consulting work on that computer.  In short, even thought is
requires some work to get fvwm onto my RedHat system, it was worth it.
Now it is about to be forbidden.

As a result, I've switched to KDE and am now trying to figure out how
to get all my old shortcuts, menus, and behavior working.  I'm not
going to try to argue you out of your position, but you need to know
what the effects of your choice are and that's all I'm trying to
convey.  

I will also be dropping off the list soon, there's little point in my
staying since I no longer have any stake or interest in fvwm2.

roland

Slow down.
The license hasn't changed, and I predict it won't change.

I have to agree.  I don't think that the changes in licensing Dominik is
proposing will be accepted by the majority of developers, regardless of
their personal views.  As I'm discussing on another thread, I don't
think they are legal but we should probably get someone like the FSF to
give an opinion.

I hope this doesn't cause Dominik to stop working on FVWM because that
would be an absolutely tremendous blow to the project going forward,
there's no question about that.


In the meantime there is no change in the current licensing of any
release of FVWM, or even of the unreleased code currently in CVS.  The
issue being discussed would only impact, at most, future releases and
future committed code.

I don't believe that's true: the GPL requires that the combined work be
released under the GPL, and exactly the GPL.  It does not allow for any
extra terms or conditions to be applied, even if they are not directly
addressed by the GPL.

Also note that people do not have to agree to the GPL, or to your
license.  There is no "click wrap" etc. on FVWM so there is no way for
people to affirmatively agree to the licensing terms: they are required
to do so.

The GPL works because it _ADDS_ freedoms that copyright law would
normally not allow: modification, redistribution, etc.  So, if you don't
agree to the license the FSF doesn't care: that just means you can't do
any of those things.  The only way you can do them is by agreeing to the
license.

Licenses which _REMOVE_ freedoms that copyright law would normally
allow, such as most EULAs etc. and the license you are proposing, _must_
be agreed to in some affirmative way.  Otherwise they can simply not
agree to your license and use the product as allowed by copyright.
Using a product you own for the purposes which it was designed is
definitely not violating a copyright.

I don't see any restriction.  You mean because it says the copyright
notice must be present?  That's no problem: the GPL itself makes the
same requirement.

Perhaps... although the new version would begin with the same
restrictions as the previous one.  Only if the license allowed you to
change the licensing could you do so, even on a derived version.

I don't believe that's true.  I remember when this was done and IIRC we
asked around and got permission to make this change from most everyone
involved.

Anyway, the original license, IIRC, does not conflict with the GPL.  If
you go back to the code as it was before the GPL started to be used then
of course you can change the licensing on that version--if _that's_
allowed, which it might not be either; we'd have to check the license.

Again, this is a violation of the GPL and so can only be imposed if
everyone with copyright interest in the code agrees to change the
license.

[I was planning to keep off this volatile thread... but guess I need to work
on my will power.]

I don't think changing the license or Dominik dropping out of FVWM is really
going to make any real difference to the working of the countries around the
world. Lets face it.. the damage has been done .. war has begun.. it's not
going to end because of what we are proposing. 

Instead of disrupting other people's desktops(with a license change) .. or
disrupting fvwm development (if dominik drops out).. we could have an
Anti-war message/list of charities that people could make donations to help
victims of war.(something akin to vim and helping children in uganda)(set it
up as a splash on first run and as a menu option in the themes that are
shipped with/by fvwm.)

This would mean.. that more work the fvwm team puts in to improve fvwm.. more
people that would use it.. and a higher probability of  people that would
make a donation.(I don't think it's right to only target governments and
research institutes.. when most of the countries in the world are
democracies.. people that voted for or did not vote for a government that
goes to war .. are just as responsible for war.)

In case no one has noticed.. in all the mails/opinions in this thread.. no
one has tried to justify the war.. and I think most would agree that this
would be a better and more positive approach than asking warmongers to pay
up.(chances are most of them will switch to another $WM than make the
donation that Dominik proposes. End result... the victims of war continue to
suffer.)

I'll end with something I got in my mail today (SF.net's newsletter)

	This morning I tried to look at Uwe's designs for the new FVWM Web
site, but I just get "404 Dokument nicht gefunden". To see if maybe
there was a university-wide problem, I tried backing up to the
University's personal home pages directory, and successfully followed
the links to a couple of other people's home pages, but
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp (or anything under that)
consistently gets a 404 response. I'm still getting a not-found as of
about 16:00 EST. Has anyone else been able to view these pages lately?
Any idea what's wrong?

	I discovered yesterday that I'd somehow gotten unsubscribed from the
fvwm-workers list a while back, and I'd missed all the discussion on the
new Web site design, the logo contest, and the war/licensing issues, so
I've been catching up via the archives. I thought I'd take a look at
what he's done, and see if I could offer any help, suggestions, or
praise, but it's hard to offer any intelligent commentary when I can't
see the darn thing.  :-(


Cheers,
Bob

Actually you should have got a 503. At least I got it. Last
night the administrators at our university did some
maintance on the system which results that parts of the
raid array broke competely. Unfortunately my home directory
(and about 3000 other homedirs as well) was on this part. It
was said to be fixed in a couple of hours from this morning
but it seems to take longer since I still got this message.
I hope they have fixed it till monday morning.

To get you an idea about the actual version of the design I
ripped it on my computer at home, converted it to html (It
was php before) and put it on
http://home.arcor.de/uwe.pross/fvwm_web_site/
(Hope this works better)

I have not changed much on the design since last thursday
but I hope that I find some time to do further work at this
weekend.

I want to finish the menu structure, put a pager window in
the left upper corner of the page and (Dominik may forgive
me :) make a taskbar like navigation path on top of the page
which displays the path from fvwm-home page to the actual
site. (If the pager or other things on the pages are not
wanted they can be removed easily.)

Regards, Uwe

I can reproduce this, with fvwm 2.5.7. the entire screen goes blank,
like it has gone into power saving mode. I will check into it to see if
I can figure out whats hapening.

It seems the kicker's idea of desktops starts at 1 and fvwm starts 
its desktops at 0.

If you start FvwmPager with the following. It will rename the Desks. 
However if your FvwmPager is too small for the text "Desk " to fit in, all that
is diplayed is the fvwm desk number. (ie, 0 1 2 3)
*FvwmPager: Label 0 "Desk 1"
*FvwmPager: Label 1 "Desk 2"
*FvwmPager: Label 2 "Desk 3"
*FvwmPager: Label 3 "Desk 4"

On the other hand if you make the FvwmPager Label only one characture
you wont have this problem.
*FvwmPager: Label 0 "1"
*FvwmPager: Label 1 "2"
*FvwmPager: Label 2 "3"
*FvwmPager: Label 3 "4"

does this help you?

Dominik, you might want to look into various charityware licenses
out there or include whatever text you might like into a separate
file in which you note your feelings/thoughts (given consensus).

Vim is the most publicized example (note its Uganda connection),

  http://www.moolenaar.net/Charityware.html

but there are plenty of others that include "help such and such"
and "I don't like such and such" or "eat turkey not chicken :-)"
etc.

Hope that helps and averts a rift !!!

Being a humanitarian with a conscious nowadays is rather difficult.

I found this bug report on the nedit site.
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=468569&group_id=11005&atid=111005
it says:

  We had problems with right-clicking with lock keys on.  
  That's been fixed in 5.3, but only to the extent that the menu 
  will not show if the lock keys are down.  But it won't lock up.

  In KDE, you might want to disable the "grab the right mouse
  button" flag.  It tends to screw up Motif bad.

  Also, send the first few lines from Help>Version.  If you're
  not
  running the binary from nedit.org, try that.  That's built with 
  the real Motif and behaves better.

I just checked, this window blanking bug does happen while using kde's 
window manager too.

Thanls, Nadim, this is exactly whyt I am thinkng of.  Require to
donate, make the requirement not too obvious and do nothing if
someone does not donate.

No, it isn't.  You just have to be prepared to take the
consequences of what you think is right.

As I quoted above, it touches only what is in the scope of the
GPL.  It does *not* restrict adding licenses for what is *outside*
of its scope.

I disagree.  If this was the case, it would for example forbid you
to deny your children access to a software under GPL that you
think is not appropriate for them.

My point of view is:  the GPL does not grant anybody the right to
*run* the software.  By doing so, you break the law.  So, I am
*adding* the right to run the software.  In case of fvwm, the
original copyright notice grants the right to run fvwm, given that
the permission statement is kept intact in the sources.

The GPL allows to make *any* modification to the *sources*,
implicitly including removing the copyright statement.  That does
not change the copyright or the license of course, and this does
not allow to remove the text of the license from *non-source*
files, such as the license file.  The E&S license *forbids* to
remove the license statement from the *sources*.

Ergo, with the E&S license notice plus the GPL it is illegal to
distribute the fvwm sources.

It does allow to change the licensing:

  Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its
  documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,

You are very welcome. Currently I work alone and I have got
not that much time for the project, so I could need some
help the get this web site ready in time.  

Half a year ago I thought about a concept which makes it
possible to separate the contents of a web site (almost)
completely from its layout. I used it to develop my
homepage and offered its use to fvwm. I did a posting to
fvwm-workers how it works.
Could you please read it to understand the next sayings
better?

For the fvwm web site I added a php interface which
provides access to all layout elements of the web design.
For example the file index.php which describes the contents
of uses 

<?php decoration_window_start("Official Homepage of Fvwm"); ?>

... contents of the window ...

<?php decoration_window_end(); ?>

to draw the window decoration. Please have a look in the
file layout_default.inc to understand it better.

I have put the actual version of the php-files to 

http://home.arcor.de/uwe.pross/fvwm_web_site/packed.tgz

Could you please download it from there, have a look to the
files and tell me what you could do? 

We need to convert the actual fvwm-html to php, finish the
actual layout file add some new functions to get a pager
and a taskbar/windowlist. Further we might do some new
design suggestions.

BTW: If we work both on the files we might need to set up a
cvs repository somewhere to keep or changes synchronous. 

Regards, Uwe

At the moment, I am a bit unhappy with the window like layout.
Take a look at

  http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm_web_site/features.php

Is it just me, or does anybody else find the text arranged in
windows confusing?  I tend to favour the idea to make one big
window and arrange the text blocks inside as it was on the old
site.

Bye

Look like the solaris /bin/sh does not know the "$(( ... ))"
syntax.  What is the most portable syntax for arithmetic
expansion?

Changed. At the moment I am playing around with the web
sites. There are several things I don't like on the current
design e.g. the background pixmap and the navigation style.
In my opinion the page should be look more like fvwm. 
I am going the "fix" that step by step. Next step will be
switch the current navigation with a FvwmPager naviagtion.

Thanks for the comment - it is good to get some feedback.

Regards, Uwe

Checked in 5.9 and it really doesn't.

Probably using (external) expr, but AFAIR the $(( )) arithmetic
expansion should be supported in all POSIX compliant shells.

I checked, that notation is part of the POSIX requirement for shells.

This is what the Solaris 8 man page says about popen (what PipeRead uses):

popen:

     The environment of the executed command  will  be  as  if  a
     child  process  were  created  within the popen() call using
     fork(2). If  the  application  is  standard-conforming  (see
     standards(5)), the child is invoked with the call:

          execl("/usr/bin/ksh", "ksh", "-c", command, (char *)0);

     otherwise, the child is invoked with the call:

          execl("/usr/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", command, (char *)0);


So, our man page statement about PipeRead using /bin/sh is not
strictly true on Solaris.

I built fvwm with gcc and arithmetic in PipeRead appears to work
for me.

The standards(5) man page is a bit confusing, but I think it
says you should use c89 instead of cc or define
_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L
when using Sun's compiler.

	I think we should see where this is heading. Uwe is still playing
around with ideas at this point, and I'm all in favor of seeing as many
as we can and then deciding what to keep and what not (on the principle
of "build one to throw away" prototyping).

	Personally, I kind of like the desktop emulation layout (as Uwe wrote
elsewhere, he's continuing to modify it, and I'd like to see where he
goes with it), but we certainly want  to avoid going too far in that
direction lest we have so many graphical gadgets and gewgaws on the page
that it becomes confusing (or even just annoying!)


Cheers,
Bob

	Hooray! I'm glad to see they finally got your directory back online.

	I'll take a look at your php files later today or this evening. 

	The one thing I noticed right away is that you probably want to make
some changes to accommodate register_globals = off (the default setting
in PHP 4.2, for security reasons) - e.g., in place of the lines that
read

	$requested_file = basename($PHP_SELF);

you'd want to do something like this:

	if (PHP_VERSION < 4.1)  {
	  $requested_file = basename($HTTP_SERVER_VARS[PHP_SELF]);
	  }  else  {
	  $requested_file = basename($_SERVER[PHP_SELF]);
	  }

(and $HTTP_SERVER_VARS has to be declared global).


	Since I can make piddling little changes like this in less time than it
takes to describe them, I think we ought to look into putting this stuff
in CVS. Is it feasible to make a special test website directory on the
FVWM CVS server that doesn't get pulled into distributions? Do you have
CVS access, by the way? (I'm just thinking of this as a convenient
source repository, I'm not suggesting that we hook the test pages into
the FVWM Web server, even as temporary undocumented URL's.) Or is there
a better place to do it?

	Oh, and I didn't notice whether we got a reply to the question of
whether we have PHP currently on our server. Jason, do we, and if so,
what release?


Cheers,
Bob

All files are intended for php3. It is running at my
university and at my computer at home. But it should be not
a problem to switch to php4. I thought if the sites are
runable with php3 they should run with version 4 as well. I
restricted myself to use version 3 for porting purposes.

Before we put the files online we have to think about
security issues. Thats why I use the function sec_filename
for example.

Yes, that's right.

No, I don't.

Just in case, I have sent a project request to
sourceforge.net for a modular webdesign project. It was
said to be answered within two days.

Jason, can you please enable php stuff in apache running on fvwm.org?
If you don't know what to do for this, you may ask here.

I think there is a consensus that the web design of Uwe is good and we
may try to go with it (the exact look is configurable by a visitor).
Since it uses php files not html we may keep both old and new designs for
a month or two without conflicts.

We should grant write permissions to Uwe to update fvwm-web cvs.
Uwe, you may send your encrypted password to Jason.

BTW, if you place new design pages in the fvwm-web cvs (say, index.php),
it will be automatically available in php enabled site:

  http://fvwm.sf.net/index.php

The old (current) design is as usual at:

  http://fvwm.sf.net/

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is actually a bug in Solaris 8, which is fixed with patch 108827-40
(108828-40 for x86), so that the posix shell /usr/xpg4/bin/sh is run
instead.  This is fixed in Solaris 9 and up without a patch.

Just to add to the fun, the man page in Solaris 9 says it runs
/usr/xpg4/bin/ksh -- it's wrong.

On my Solaris 8 system, /usr/xpg4/bin/sh is a link to /usr/bin/ksh
which happens to the the same as /bin/ksh.

The "sh" man page confirms this:

     The /usr/xpg4/bin/sh utility is identical  to  /usr/bin/ksh.

I think someone is confused.

Okay.  This is different in Solaris 9, and possibly in Solaris 8 with
the patch I mentioned.  They are separate binaries, and the man page
notes that they're mostly the same except in some places mentioned in
the ksh man page (which happen to be in arithmetic expansion, as it
turns out).

Looks like it.

I found a Solaris 9 system.
Assuming the man page meant to say they run /usr/xpg4/bin/sh,
here's Solaris 9 man page for sh:

     The /usr/xpg4/bin/sh utility is a standards compliant shell.
     This  utility  provides  all  the  functionality  of ksh(1),
     except in cases discussed in  ksh(1)  where  differences  in
     behavior exist.

But when I look at the ksh description, this is the difference:

  /usr/bin/ksh and /usr/bin/rksh treat prefix 0  through
  9 as decimal constants. See the examples below.

     Command               Result in /bin/ksh   Result in /usr/xpg4/bin/sh
     echo $((010+10 ))     20                   18
     echo $((010+10 ))     29                   error
     [ 10 -le $((011)) ]   true                 false


Which doesn't make a lot of  sense since the  first 2 examples are the
same,  but  I don't   think  the difference  caused the  error message
originally reported.

I checked /usr/xpg4/bin/sh, it can at least evaluate simple expressions.

I'm guessing that's a typo and that the second command should read:

echo $((019+10 ))

The output makes sense in that case. I guess like perl, 0-prefixing in
XPG4 shell is supposed to be octal.

I have no idea what this thread is about. I just like making fun of
/usr/xpg4 on Solaris...

I would not add a Prize section. Although it may be no problem for
someone to take out of a pocket 100 euro (I don't know), this could be
incorrectly thought as we are a commercial organization. The prize is a
honor and a mention on the web and in the sources.

As for the schedule I would like to have a new logo (or at least most of
the candidate logos) till June 1, so we may use some of them for the front
page. We may then extend the last submission date after this if there are
no enough submissions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yup.  I filed a bug against that, as well as against the typo in the

How about a bug report for the lack of posix compliance in /bin/sh?
Or is it a compiler issue or popen?

Both my HP and AIX systems have no trouble with arithmetic in
/bin/sh.  Solaris seems to be the odd man out.

/bin/sh (and all the other utilities in /bin) is not expected to be
posix compliant.  If you want posix compliance, you should be running
the versions in /usr/xpg4/bin instead, either directly, or by putting
that first in your $PATH.

There was a bug filed for exactly this about five years ago, which was
closed because it was presumed that too many scripts depend on the
particular behaviors of /bin/sh to make the transition worthwhile.  I
don't think there's any way to make this change and preserve
compatibility for everyone who expects it.

/bin/sh on Solaris is a pretty sad program, and really (in my opinion,
not Sun's) shouldn't be used.  Either use ksh for interactive stuff and
personal scripts, or use the posix-flavored utilities in /usr/xpg4.
Which means that you'd have to parametrize the path to the shell with
configure, but you already do that for perl, so it's more of an
annoyance than a difficult problem.

I have got the first version of the pager navigation
online. I did some major changes on the design.  I have
checked it with mozilla, netscape, opera, dillo, amaya and
lynx. The pages look similar and reasonable good in all
browsers.
The algorithm which selects the pages which are shown in
the pager has not been finished yet. I am going to make the
pager that it shows the path back to the home site and to
the subpages of the actual page as well.

I would be happy if I get some feetback about the design,
colors and pictures. All comments are welcome.

Regards, Uwe

I found a bug last night in the php files I have packed in
the last tar archive. There was a problem with the variable
$rel_path and its usage. It happend that the file
"definitions.inc" was included within a function what never
should be happen. I have fixed that.

The version you have downloaded may therefore be faulty. I
packed the files of the actual version together:

It is meant as an encouragement to take part in the competition
and thus increase the number of submitted logos.

If we extend the submission period later, this will only confuse
people and force us to post another announcement.

I don't agree.  The GPL explicitly says that the code must be released
under the GPL, full stop.  There is no exception that allows you to add
any extra terms or conditions as long as they don't conflict with the
terms and conditions in the GPL... in fact the GPL specifically forbids
"sublicensing".

The license also _explicitly_ says that "The act of running the Program
is not restricted".

So you cannot add a restriction on running the program that does not
directly contradict the terms of the GPL, and you must release the
derivative under the terms of the GPL.

No.  The GPL only talks about your obligations if you distribute the
code.  Basically it says that (to use your example) if you give your
children a GPL'd program you have to make available to them the source
code to that as well.

Nowhere does it require you to give it to them in the first place.

Anyway, children are minors and so do not have all the rights and
privileges of adults.

Copyright covers only certain activities: modification, redistribution,
_public_ performances, translation to another language, etc.

Consider: when you buy a book at the store you do not have to have a
special license to _read_ that book; you won't find any language in any
book that explicitly gives you that right.  Similarly, if you buy a CD
you don't need a license to allow you to listen to it.

Bob and me (and maybe others) will work on the new fvwm-web
site. During the development the new site should not be
shown when requesting for www.fvwm.org. 

I am not an expert for cvs. In my cvs repository I would
create a new tree for the new page - but maybe the is
another better solution.

Some thoughts to the cvs control for the new web page: 

I think it would be good if the new page tree is separated
from the old one in the cvs. This makes it possible to
discard the old page when the new has been set up. It would
be also good if the new page would be accessable via
fvwm.org (www.fvwm.org/new_page or something like this) to
get other developers an idea how the development of the web
pages goes on. For this it would be good if changes to the
cvs tree of the new page effect directly the subdirectory
on the web server like it is now when commiting changes to
the fvwm-web tree. If this is not possible I will keep a
online version at my homepage like it is now.

Maybe Bob or other developers can make a comment what is a
good way to put the new page under cvs control.

BTW: I realized that fvwm.org is mirrored by
     fvwm.sourceforge.net and maybe by others as well. If
     we use php for the new page and support the usage of
     different page styles we might need to make sure that
     the mirrors support this as well. 

Regards, Uwe

It's not sublicensing.  The GPL is not at all affected by certain
types of license.  The GPL states *explicitly* that it only
licenses copying, modifying and distributing the software, nothing
else.  Licensing for any other action is not covered and thus the
license is determined by the laws for them.

> The license also _explicitly_ says that "The act of running the Program
> is not restricted".

That statement is more or less devoid of meaning.  It just says
that the GPL does not limit the right to run the software, but it
neither *gives* you that right.  It must come from somewhere else.

> So you cannot add a restriction on running the program that does not

I think that is wrong.  *If* I can not limit the right to run a
software, it is not because of the GPL but because of laws.

But we are not talking about buying or selling a product.  If we
sold fvwm, then the act of selling would imply the right for the
buyer to use what she bought.  But we don't sell fvwm and thus the
legal framework of the selling/buying transaction do not apply.

	I had originally thought of just using CVS as a source repository where
we could both (all?) work on it together, but kept separate from the
regular Web stuff and not viewable on the live site. However, Uwe's and
Mikhael's comments lead me to think that a separate directory that got
propagated to the Web site might be easiest for all concerned, so that
neither of us needed to keep a separate Web server in sync with CVS to
let the other developers see the work in progress.

	Yes. Jason, what would be most practical for this purpose, a
subdirectory under fvwm-web, or a separate directory at the same level
as fvwm-web? (I'm guessing the former.) I think our main concern is to
keep the test stuff from getting included in any release or snapshot
tarballs, but making it easy to feed to the Web site.

	Does anyone have any objections to having the new test pages viewable
from the regular Web site, given the special test URL? Are there
negative implications we haven't thought of?

	I believe Mikhael indicated that the SourceForge site is PHP-enabled. I
don't know of any other mirrors...are there any? I don't know how the
mirror(s) are fed, but I guess the same considerations apply here
vis-=E1-vis the directory structure.

Bob

Please remember, these new pages are going to become official in a month
or two. Unless you want to add and remove files in cvs a lot, I would
immediatelly work on the final (or almost final) names.

I would neither add a new tree nor a new repository, just create .php (or
.phtml) file for every existing .html file, in the same directory if
appropriate. Then, when the new pages are ready, just remove .html files.

I see no problem for test files to be accessible from the web.

Any other solution (a new subtree or a new cvs repository) will
unnecessarily complicate things. There will never be a conflict between
old pages and new pages, so we can keep 2 versions simultaneously in the
same directory structure.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Good morning fvwm-workers,

I agree. I have pulled the fvwm-web tree from cvs and put
it at

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/

The new php-files have been added to this directory. Since
our web server serves php before html I have moved the file
index.php to home.php. So the new version is accessable via

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/home.php

Since I don't know what the web server at fvwm.org serves
first I will keep home.php until the site is published
officially.

I have added a "Latest news" entry for the development of
the new site to home.php to show what's going on. Entries
are made to the file latest_news.txt which is included in
home.php. The entry on the web site will be removed before
the site is officially.

Before I add the files to the cvs and put them online at
fvwm.org it would be good if somebody looks in the php
sources for potentially security lacks. Bob could you
do that please? - Four eyes see more than two.

To the actual layout: Does anyone have objections on the
actual layout? Is the navigation through the site via the
pager understandable? I think the pager navigation is
different than the navigation on other web sites - but it
should be comprehensible. 
How about the actual colors and window decoration? Bob
meant the colors should be changed a little bit. Any other
suggestions?

If there are no objections on the actual design. I will go
on and fill the sub sites with contents, create icons for
each sub page, etc.

Regards, Uwe

Hi!

I updated to the latest CVS version today, and it seems that something
has changed concerning the move command.

My config shows this simple line:

Mouse   1       T       A       Move

Formerly, this allowed me to "drag&drop" windows with my left mouse
button. Now I have to click on the title, move the window, and then
click again.

Is that behaviour wanted?

Cheers

Yes, it is wanted.  The right way is to use a complex function:

  AddToFunc immediate_move
  + I Move
  Mouse 1 T A immediate_move

I'm too lazy now to explain in detail why I changed this, but
there are several mails that discuss the same problem.  Right now,
the choice to be made is between breaking these old configs to fix
a bug with root mouse bindings and leaving the bug in the code but
keep configs working.

Bye

I like the pager better than the menu.

When it shows the window for the first page, I don't like the
squashed appearance of the first window.
Is there a way to add a minumum height to the window so it doesn't
look squashed.  Perhaps always extend it to the bottom of the
browser?

I am not sure what you mean. Do you mean the height of the
window on home.php? I have added a minimum height and moved
the web site news into the window.

Actually the height and the width depend on the size of
your browser window. If have got a big screen resolution
say 1600x1200 the window might have looked squashed. I
have got a 880x660 resolution at home and a 1152x900 at
work. On this resoultion the window does not look that
squashed.

For now a minimum height of 800 pixels has been added. If
this in not sufficient I could add more which might look
strange at lower screen resolutions. 

Another possibility would be put more text in the
windows so that it's height is more than the browser's
height.

Regards, Uwe

Yes.

It looks better now, but by adding text you made the window taller
anyway.

Yes, I'm using 1600x1200.
In this case, I guess it was squashed because you had another
window under it, but I think an earlier version was squashed
with empty space under it.

I think a minumum height of 800 will do it.

Is it possible to attach alt tags to the images in the pager?
For example, there are 4 screenshot pages, but you can't tell
where they lead until you click on them.

Done. I added "title" as well to get it shown in mozilla
and opera.

Cool.  Looks much better than I would have imagined.  BUt instead
of the icons in the pager I would try to cram the name of the
contents into a single window in ech page like this:

  +----------------------------+
  | Download                   |
  +--------------+-------------+
  |+------------+|+-----------+|
  ||            |||           ||
  || Sources    ||| Icons     ||
  ||            |||           ||
  |+------------+|+-----------+|
  +--------------+-------------+
  |              |             |
  |              |             |
  |              |             |
  |              |             |
  |              |             |
  +--------------+-------------+

And to improve readability, I would use pale colours for the pages
and strong colours for the desk titles.

Left aligned Desk titles would be nice.

This works since 2.3.x:

  Module FvwmButtons MyLeftTopBar
  KillModule FvwmButtons MyLeftTopBar

And "KillModule FvwmButtons" kills all aliases.

That's not that easy.

Deskname left align:
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/home.php?layout=text_pager

Text instead of icons:
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/home.php?layout=text_pager&text_on_pager=1

The problem is that the font size depends on your browser
settings. If you use big fonts the pager looks quite
different than with small fonts. I used images since they
have the same size independent from the browser settings.
I could generate images for the pager with text instead of
mini icons. I will have a try tonight.

BTW: The links in the pager pages were thought to be an
 additional fancy feature to jump to certain sub links
 directly. One can get to the sub pages of the third tier
 over the links in the desk labels as well. The links in
 the pages are just additional.

I see.  Is there any reason why I can't say just

  KillModule MyLeftTopBar

?

Looks good, but when I click on one of the sub links, the mozilla
tab it is displayed in freezed.  I can not even close it.  The
problem with text in the pages is that it occupies too much space
(see the screenshot I posted).

Actually, I like the additional fancy feature much more than the
main feature with nested pagers which I find immensly confusing
because it works much unlike the pager layout suggests.  :-)

Hi there,

The best way to achieve this is to have pictures for the
windows on the pages. Using convert this should not be a
problem.

Is it wanted that the pages look stretched
horizontally?

[snip]

Ah, maybe we should just drop the multi-desk multi-page pager and
have a multi-desk one-page pager with windows on the shown page
for the subsections.  The active desk and the active window is
hilighted:

  +----------------+
  | Download       |
  +----------------+
  | +---------+    |
  | | sources |    |
  | +---------+    |
  | +-------+      |
  | | icons |      |
  | +-------+      |
  +----------------+
  |.Features.......| <-- selected desk (section)
  +----------------+
  |................|
  |.+----------+...|
  |.|.features.|...| <-- selected window (subsection)
  |.+----------+...|
  |................|
  |................|
  +----------------+

However - regardless of the pager layout - if we have more than
two or three sub sections per section, it becomes confusing.

But that removes the possibility to navigate the page in a text

That was a feeble attempt to have mor space for the labels.  Looks
very ugly, I know.

Anyway, take a look at my new proposal in another mail first.

Hi there,

Console browsers like lynx use the description of the alt
attribute in the image tag. If this is properly set one can
use this browsers. Have a try with lynx - looks not that
good but it works.

Will then "KillModule FvwmButtons" mean kill only one alias (no alias)
or all aliases? Currently you can do both variants (for example, I use
"KillModule FvwmEvent to kill all event listeners). This was the reason
of this KillModule syntax, another reason is similarity of the Module
and KillModule syntaxes regarding aliases. Finally, currently you may
define "Module FvwmIconMan MyLeftTopBar" and it works.

The global problem we have with aliases is that alias is optional for
modules, once we make the alias concept to be mandatory for all modules,
we may then think about changing the syntax of all module commands.
I will start a new thread about this later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Only one.  How about pattern matching as in DestroyModuleConfig:

  KillModule FvwmButtons*

?

Aggh...no, not those colors!

:)

I think shades of blue are always good.
The current gray is safe.

Forget about the colours, it's just the palette I was using today.
If large areas of the screen were painted with these gradients I
had to visit the eye specialist soon %-\  We can talk about the
actual theme later.  Anything that resembles Windoze even remotely
has to vanish :-)

	Actually, your server's order wouldn't be a problem. I'd call the home
page index.php. Then when we go to 

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web

we'll see the new stuff, which is what we really want to see. If anyone
wants to look at the old version, he can explicitly ask for index.html.

	I would guess it gives precedence to index.html, but I don't know for
sure. Does anyone have an answer? 

	*Never mind*  - I just saw Jason's answer come in as I was typing
below. So, since index.html has precedence on the live FVWM site, I'd go
ahead and call it index.php.

	And 6 or 8 would be even better.  :-)

	I just grabbed your latest tarball, and will take a look at it shortly.
The first security issue, as I've mentioned before, is that we need to
modify the code to work with PHP 4 with register_globals set to off
(which I'm sure is what Jason installed). But we want to modify it so
it'll be backward compatible with your PHP 3 system. I'll hack up a test
page and send it to you a little later; try it out and let me know
whether it works OK on your system.

	As for merging the new files with the existing fvwm-web, we want to be
sure there aren't any subdirectory clashes. For example, there is a
"screenshots" directory in both your new set and in the old fvwm-web,
and they're different things. In the tarball I pulled down, there is
only your new stuff. Is it your intent that I should be able to merge
this with my existing (copy of) fvwm-web?

	Ah, that reminds me...what are the implications for running navgen in a
merged directory? (That one also appears to have some PHP 3/4
incompatibilities that I haven't had time to research thoroughly yet.)

	Mainly for the pager background. I think something a bit lighter than
that grey would give some needed contrast - possibly a light cream
color.

I think we should develop for the target system not for my
system at home. I figured out that at the university's
server php 4 is running. 

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/php_info.php

I will switch to php 4 at home as well.

So you need not to do that.

Yes the screenshot subdirectory was an accident :-) We might
switch to screen_shot.

nagven.php looks recursively for files having a .php
extension and includes them. It extracts the variable
settings in the header of the php-files, does some
consistency checks and stores the contents of the variables
in the file navgen_write/navigation.inc. On my server at
home the apacher server has the permission to write into
this directory. I would suggest to do not allow this on
fvwm.org since a writeable directoy is potentially a
security issue.

You can try different colors on your own by specifying them
in the url like:

http://localhost/uwe/fvwm_web_site/?pager_bg=%23ffff66

Please note that this variable is not passed through links
to other pages. Other possible changes to the actual layout
and their default value are:

if(!isset($decoration_path))  $decoration_path=$rel_path."/decorations/window_deco_simple_blue";
if(!isset($window_border_bg)) $window_border_bg="#c5cecd";
if(!isset($window_border_fg)) $window_border_fg="#ffffff";
if(!isset($window_bg))        $window_bg="#000000";
if(!isset($window_fg))        $window_fg="#ffffff";
if(!isset($body_bg))          $body_bg="#000000";
if(!isset($body_fg))          $body_fg="#ffffff";
if(!isset($body_bg_image))    $body_bg_image=$rel_path."/pictures/Totally-New-Product-1.jpg";
if(!isset($menu_bg))          $menu_bg="#c5cecd";
if(!isset($menu_fg))          $menu_fg="#000000";
if(!isset($windowlist_bg))    $windowlist_bg="#c5cecd";
if(!isset($windowlist_fg))    $windowlist_fg="#000000";
if(!isset($pager_bg))         $pager_bg="#b5bebd";
if(!isset($pager_fg))         $pager_fg="#000000";
if(!isset($hilight_bg))       $hilight_bg="#1a6e99";
if(!isset($hilight_fg))       $hilight_fg="#ffffff";

For example to change the background image using a file on
the local machine one could use:

http://localhost/uwe/fvwm_web_site/?body_bg_image=file:/home/uwe/pictures/azure.jpg

I don't think you should rename that directory.
Just add screenshots/index.php (if you have it).

There are some scripts in that directory that need to be reworked.
After your stuff is checked in, I plan to take a look.

Same for some of the other subdirectories.

	Help! I don't know what's wrong, but after making my standard
register_globals patches, this version acts really strange. It won't put
any titlebar decorations on the windows. I can see that you've made a
lot of changes to the live site today. Is there possibly a newer tarball
I can grab this evening or tomorrow?

	When you set it up, set register_globals = Off in your php.ini. You'll
start to see the problem. Obviously, you can't control how the
university's server is set up (they have it on).

	So a developer making changes that required running navgen would run it
on his local system to regenerate navigation.inc, then commit the
resulting changes to CVS, fight? (By the way, did you know there's an
option to build a command-line version of PHP, so you can run something
like navgen just like you would a Perl or shell script?)

	These are a bunch that have to change for the new register_globals
setting, by the way.

This breaks compatibility with the way it always worked (all FvwmButtons
instances are closed) and does not add anything that is not already
possible using KillModule.

Pattern on what? Module name (the first Module argument) or module alias
(usually the second Module argument, but not always, it's heuristics)?
I don't like the way we currently mix these two, we did this in the past,
but we should not do this in the future if we want a non-ambiguous clean
way of working with modules. We should have 2 levels, one for module
names and one for instance names instead of global mixing of everything
in one namespace.

I have a proper and convenient solution for this, but it is a bit
revolutional to be discussed now. Maybe after 2.6.

Mikhael.

Copyright has nothing to do with buying and selling: that is contract

anything for the work.

Library books are still copyright, even though you didn't pay for them.
Books given as birthday presents, or CDs given away for promotion, are

lying on the street, copyright does not prevent you from reading that

I created a subdirectory for the tarballs:

I have checked fvwm_php_28032003_0809.tgz twice and untared
it in a test directory.

I like that concept since it forces me to think about what
I am doing. It reminds me on the type concept of java.
Thanks very much for this explanation. I think it is not
that much effort to convert the actual php-files that they
work with php4 and this settings.

I am going to grab 4.3.1 today. I have not compiled a
php-module yet - hope there will be not that much problems
to get this work with my actual apache installation ;-) 
Maybe I need to upgrade my apache server to version 2 as well.

I could do that changes when php4 is running on my machine.
Or if you like you could do that as well - let's see who is
first :-)

I could make the images smaller. With the actual size the pager is

Hi there,

Yes, this one looks nice. I think one can do that but it
will be a _really_ big effort, since the overlapping
windows cannot be display in a table like it is now. One
needs either assemble the images in sub tables or uses
complete images in conjunction with image maps.
 
I would suggest to keep that in mind and have a try when
the first version of the new pages has been finished. I
think otherwise it takes to much time and we might get
problem to have the page ready in time.

As I said in the parent messages, I want to rework module aliases before
3.0, i.e. finally add a concept of aliases to the module protocol and
adjust all module commands.

Adding now a syntax that 1) does not add any new functionality, 2) breaks
compatibility, 3) may kill a wrong module in some infortunate cases,
since the alias name currently is determined by heuristics, 4) will be
removed soon when the real solution for module aliases is implemented,
does not seem a proper thing to do for me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

D.1 Make the distinction between FVWM (project) and fvwm (core executable)?

What does that mean and how does it affect the release?

I have checked in a new license file with ethical license terms to
the development branch.  See below for the contents of this file.
Furthermore, I added this statement to the beginning of the
COPYING file:

  Before using this software, every user is required to read the
  fair use statement in the file ETHICAL_LICENSE that comes with the
  fvwm distribution.

Please tell me your comments, enhancements, critique, etc.  Also,
I ask everyone who ever made any change to the CVS repository or
submitted a patch to support this license and have his or her name
added to the list of subscribers.

------------------------ ETHICAL_LICENSE -------------------------
Legally, fvwm is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License. However, the events following the 9th of
September, 2001 and the multinational war against Iraq that began
in March 2003, made me reconsider the wisdom of choosing this
license.  I can not ignore the fact that my work has a part in
killing people, no matter how small it may be.  After discussing
this with many people, I decided to add the following "ethical"
license.

No user of fvwm is forced to agree to the licensing terms.  But
please keep in mind that fvwm is developed by volunteers in their
free time.  Blatant violation of this license by many people will
not only demotivate me and other volunteers, reducing the quality
of fvwm, but may also end development completely.

Thank you for your attention

Dominik Vogt
(fvwm developer)


        Ethical Use of the Fvwm Window Manager
        --------------------------------------

1. You, as a user of fvwm, are expected to make a donation to a
non-government organization that must fulfil one of the following
conditions:

 * It fights against all forms of war, regardless of the nations
   involved.
 * It engages for human rights world-wide, including the country
   you live in.

The donation can be monetary, human labour, donation in kind or
any other form that helps.  Any amount is accepted as long int
lives up to the spirit of this license.  I suggest a donation to
Amnesty International, but you are free to choose a different
organization.

2. You are expected to not use fvwm during work related to

 * research of weapon technology,
 * manufacturing of weapons,
 * supporting, planning, preparing or executing wars and other
   military actions.

3. If you feel you can not comply to the terms above, you are
   kindly asked to choose a different one of the many available
   window managers.

I don't agree.

Given the amount of work I do, I think it will be easy to override
my vote if others feel as you do.

Your stated plan is to leave Fvwm.  Have you reconsidered?

I don't think any tie-in with the software, especially as it
pertains to the license is a good idea.

Please uncommit until you get agreement so that I can continue
to check out, build, test until then.

I see you left out terrorist acts.

You are trying to involve Fvwm in something it shouldn't be
involved in.

I don't agree either, even though I haven't actually contributed since '98
(before the change to the GPL, the legality of I wondered about at the time)
and therefore am probably even more override-able.

I tried to stay out of this but it's getting hard to ignore, especially now
calling for "everyone who ever made any change to the CVS repository or
submitted a patch" to support it.  I suppose I fall into that latter category,
and therefore now felt the need to say that I don't support it.

This I agree with, fvwm is just a window manager, just leave the politics out
of it.  It's bad enough having to deal with or hear about the pseudo-politics
involved in all the other various wm and desktops out there let alone drag
"real" politics in.

On a slightly related note, I also thought it was odd (although a nice
gesture) to even mention the Sept 11th stuff anywhere with fvwm documents when
that happened too, but that was a little less contentious.

Out of curiousity, did anyone ask Rob Nation's point of view (privately of
course, since I didn't see anything on the list) about all of this when he
posted to the list the other day?  I don't really know him at all, but somehow
doubt that he would support it either, given his background and when/where he
developed fvwm originally.

I'll go back to simply lurking again now, as I don't want to get drawn into
any debates on all of this, merely wanted to let my position be known as well
so as to not seem to be agreeing because of my silence.

Chuck

Hear hear!

Dominik, I (& it would appear many others here) have the utmost respect
for your intentions & sense of ethics. However, I cannot help but feel
this is an inappropriate manner in which to express them.

If you want to make a positive difference on these issues, you need to
get into politics, not software development. Lobbying politicians etc.
is infinitely more effective than anything you do (or don't do) with
a C-compiler.

Yes, sure.  It's because you write the numbers in dates in the
wrong order in America ;-)

I can also add a list of people who do not agree to the license.
Everyone, at least here and in the USA, has the right of free
speech, not just me.  Tell me what kind of statement you would
like to see in that file, and I will add one.

I am contributing right now, and probably for the rest of the
year.  Other than that, we will see what happens.

Why?

Any other form would be moot as it reaches nobody.

As the only requirement I made is that fvwm users read the ethical
license, and you seem to have read it, I see no reason why you can
not do these things.  If it is because we disagree on the contents
of the license, I can not help.  I have only one life, and I had
to make a choice.  I will not back out because that choice has
real consequences.  I have to stand the image I see in the mirror
tomorrow morning too.

I saw no need to overload the ethical license with terms that are
already made crystal clear by laws.  If it helps with acceptance
of the terms, I will happily add this.  But if it just helps
people to shut their eyes and say "I a'm already against
terrorism, isn't this enough?" I would rather leave the statements
as they are.

Dan, to be honest I am disappointed that you mention it at all.  I
have never said anything else but that I abhor any form of
violence, that *nothing* justifies violence.  My sympathy with the
victims of the terrorist attacks has not lessened a bit, and every
victim of this war and any other war will always receive the same
sympathy.  Your innuendo that I might have 'changed sides' hurts
me.  I will never argue who had more/less right to kill because
this whole logic is perverted and inhuman.  Even thinking of it
makes me feel sick.

> You are trying to involve Fvwm in something it shouldn't be
> involved in.

I have given much of my life-blood for it, and even if I have put
my work under the GPL I still hold the copyright for it.  And so I
can at least say that the parts that I wrote are involved in
ethics as my whole life is involved in ethics.

I don't want to be forced to think of the open source community as
something that happily absorbs any contributions and then tells me
to keep my opinions for myself.

Bye

Let's make this perfectly clear:

1. I do not accept that anybody takes advantage of *my* work to
support killing in any way (and I mean *any* way).  Not even if it
were my own parents.

2. The decision which of my actions are meant to be embedded in an
ethical context is mine to make.

3. I do not care one bit it my sense of ethics 'inconveniences'
someone else.  The matter is too grave to care about pangs of
conscience anybody may encounter.

And finally I hope we can keep politics out of this, because it is
not about politics - as I stated numerous times before.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Although my contributions are pretty insignificant, I still would like 
to say that I do not agree with this license.

This license was not in effect when I contributed my code, and I think 
it is wrong to add it after the fact.  When I submitted my code I did so 
with the understanding that it would be under the GPL, nothing more and 
nothing less.  If I had known that my contributions would be used to 
further a political agenda that I do not agree with, I would have kept 
them to myself.

I don't believe that this is an appropriate outlet for your political 
beliefs.

Ben Mathews

I don't like to disappoint you, Dominik, but I don't agree too.
I can't see myself agreeing with a license that discriminates people
based on their occupation, ethics or similar.

GNU GPL means free for everyone forever. No exceptions. Personally I am
not a god to decide who is meritorious to use my software and who is not.

One more thing is left out: using chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons (as something that affects an especially large amount of innocent
people) in the past or a possible future if we don't fight it.

To continue, think also about wars against the drug business and other
mafias.  What is more ethical, to kill several drug traffickers in a
skirmish or to let them to break thousands of people? It's clear for me.

Many thousands of people in just my country die in road accidents because
of drunken drivers. If I would want to be ethical and non-political, I
would rather discriminate drinking drivers than military engineers.

How about banks? My friend works in a state bank that deals with all
ministries, including financing of the Ministry of Defence.

With a little fantazy and rhetorics, every human in the world is guilty
and should not use FVWM.

> You are trying to involve Fvwm in something it shouldn't be

Agree, politics are too unclear and dirty to be constructive in software
developement.

Face it. Ethics, politics, religion always mean ego, nothing more than
this, everyone chooses what is better for his own safety or for the
safety of his family, his country, his god, whatever. Nothing special to
be prood of. There is no absolute human ethics. Unfortunately.


I wrote all this before receiving other thread messages. Now I see them.
Dominik, you say it is not political, but you still mention dates and
country names in the license as if the only innocent deaths in the world
were on these dates. It may have something to do with press headlines.
You don't want to be taken as someone who changes sides. I fully believe
you. Still I think my ethics is an ego as well as ethics of others.
People want to live. If you would live in a country where daily/monthly
terrorist acts or local wars are a reality (there are several such
countries), it is likely your ethics would be affected a lot by this.
I know (judging by myself) how it is comfortable to sit in a safe place
and demonstrate a protest against all the world "violence" without
knowing full details and without even wanting to know who and why becides
what the press says.

This is my opinion and it has no personal attacks at all.
Saying all this, if any dates and country names are removed from
ETHICAL_LICENSE, I am not against including this file if it makes some
developers feel better. I do want Dominik to continue the development.
I do respect his ethics and good will although I can't fully agree.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Good morning Fvwm Workers,

How about making a statement on the fvwm web site instead
of a new license? We could place some comments on the war
and the usage of fvwm either on the start page or on the
download page. 

We could say that we are against violation of human rights
(and terrorism) and wish that fvwm will not be used by
people supporting violation of human rights, terrorism or
war in any kind. (This has to be reworded - but in this
meaning)

We could also place a statement site, and link to it from
the start and download page. From this site we could link
to other sites like unicef, ... 

Can anyone go with this or anyone not? I think it is not
that strong as a license but it makes clear our objectives.

Regards, Uwe

I don't agree with this, I don't expect users of fvwm to even know it's 
GPL code. I don't expect the crazy people who compile the fvwm source to 
even read the COPYING file.  When I'm compiling stuff from source I 
usually scan the first screen full of all files starting with capitial 
letters, I don't care if it's GPL or BSD as long as I can use it for 
free. I would be OK with you adding this to COPYING:

===
Before using this software, please read the ETHICAL_LICENSE file that
comes with the fvwm distribution.
===

I also think you should put a short introduction to the ETHICAL_LICENSE 
file that lists those who support it. Not me I'm afraid, I'm British and 
I agree with the war against the Iraqi dictatorship.

Cheers,
Tim.

Strictly speaking, it is no more than a statement, not a license.
I call it a license and put it in the sources in order to force
Linux distributors to mention it.  I do not want that it can be
completely ignored.  And I will not tinker with the "license"
until no more than drivel remains.

--

Several people called it 'inappropriate' or 'the wrong way' to
involve my work in ethics.  I might add that the "Ethical Use"
statement refers only to the code I have written, but the effect
is the same.  And let me express again that I find I much worse
than inappropriate to solve anything by killing.

The ethical license affects the GPL in no way.

In other words, I should soften the wording until it can be safely
ignored without the risk of having a slightly bad conscience?
Sorry, I can not comply to this.  The whole idea of an opt-in
ethical use statement is a bad joke.

It already has.

I do not understand this.  In how far does being British, German,
American, Chinese or Martian affect ethics?

How would you qualify this if not as a military action or an act
of terrorism?  Now, if I would start discriminating between types
of actions or weapons the statement would really become political.
Killing millions with nuclear weapons is equally unethical as
putting a knife in the back of a mass murderer.

Yes, for me too.  Both is utterly unethical.  A human life is a
human life is a human life.

Mikhael, believe me that I have thought thoroughly about this.  I
concluded that if I started listing everything that could take
part in one of said unethical actions, the statement would grow up
to a state where it becomes meaningless.

But that does not mean that ethics are a private decision.  Quite
the opposite, if you accept that people choose ethics too their
liking, you must accept too if terrorists who kill people do it
because they see it as their ethical duty to do so.  If you do not
acknowledge that, ethics becomes pure caprisiousness.  What you
say sounds like "killing is wrong, except when I think it it
right".

Outside of the license.  It is only in the accompanying comment.

If you put it in README and not COPYING, it will not sound as a bad joke.

If this does not affect ethics, how can you explain that most of the
people choose (agree to) the position of their countries? After all
these people elected their politicians or are forced by their dictator.

I can't agree. This may be true by your ethics, not by my ethics.
(Read: by your ego, not by my ego.)

You may only afford to be a humanitarian when you are not directly
involved in a conflict. When you are involved, you should choose sides.

What is a human life? The god's creature, shrine? I am not religious, so
this is not my ethics. Does the animal life is as important as the human
life? If it is as important, you should fight against killing locusts,
midges, cockroach and dosens of others. If it is less important, it is a
human despotism. Since I believe that the basis of all ethical beliefs is
egoism, I have no problem to state that a human life is more important.

Although I would egoistically fight for my own life and the life of my
family, I don't see my life as something holy by itself. I believe in
evolution. If I die, it is ok as long as the humanity in the whole
prospers. Similary about the lives of others. Thinking otherwise is
caprisious by my ethics.

I fully realize a terrorist has his own ethics. Since our ethics are
quite opposite (he wants to kill me in name of his gods), I prefer to
fight him and kill him to live myself.

> If you do not acknowledge that, ethics becomes pure caprisiousness.

It does not only sounds like this, it is exactly this. Everyone thinks
killing is wrong (because she does not like to be killed), except when
she thinks it is right (because she would be killed otherwise).

I have no any ethical problem to realize this.

The entire life is choosing sides. I think we all are on the same side,
we write Free Software, there is no need to expose sides where we differ.
Like social status, profession, country, cultural/religious ethics etc.

Mikhael.

The whole idea of opt-in ethics is ridiculous.  I don't see why it
would make any difference.

In many so-called democratic countries, the media mostly generate
the public opinion.  This is especially bad in countries where
they are mostly controlled by the government.  People with
different opinions are often discriminated - you can see this
both, in America and in Germany.

That's the one big lie I always hear from people who do not even
want to consider if what they are supporting might be wrong.  At
least I can afford to be a humanitarian, regardless of what
happens - as you see: I am attacked from all sides right now.

I am not religious either.  The only 'definition' of morality I
have ever seen that I can agree with (although nobody can justify
it) is Kant's categorical imperative:  Act only according to
maxims of which you can want that they become a common law.  All
other attempts of definition i can think of eventually run down to
treating some people differently than others.

Regarding the "human despotism":  I acknowledge there are two
fundamental aspects of human existence.  The first is the human
being as a product of evolution, as an animal among others.  As
far as I know, animals are not capable of considering ethical
questions.  In so far it makes little sense to talk about ethics
in this sphere.  The second is the human as a thinking being who
has an at least partially free will (if not, we can as well stop
talking now).  In this sphere, it does not make much sense to
think about ethics in other than human matters.  But then, both
spheres overlap in many areas, which makes talking about ethics
immensely difficult.

Does this not run down to:  whoever is stronger should kill his
opponent before the opponent kills him?  No, I believe that it is
vital to not respond to a threat in kind.  To prevent falling back
into barbarity we have to accept the same verdict that you are
deliver upon others.

Just consider this for a minute:  If through some unforeseen
events the 'western' democracies became more or less irrelevant
countries, and the Arabian peoples came to control the world.
Wouldn't we (the citizens of the western democracies) all have to
fear for our lives, because we humiliated the Arabic peoples for
decades, claiming our way of life is inherently better than
theirs?

That may be a purely hypothetical situation, but isn't that the
whole idea of ethics:  do *not* do everything you *can* do without
having to fear the consequences, but acknowledge certain rules to
help maintaining a certain level of order.

Bosh.

In a democracy you don't get to pick policies. The best you get to do is
vote for whatever power group least offends you. And in most systems,
if that's not one of the few major groups your vote gets discarded.
There are preferential scheme, but that basicly means your voite gets
moved to another power group. And once they're in they can basicly do
as they please.

The current agression in Iraq supplies a classic example: in Oz, if pretty
clear that the majority of the population oppse the war and our role in
it. Our glorious leader basicly has the view that it's his prerogative
to go forth anyway. The US leader has the same attitude: he's asserted
the power to make war without going through his Congress.

Anyway, I support Dominik's approach: it doesn't require people to take
his views or even to support pacifistic organisations as he wishes. Merely
to get people to think seriously about it and consider some/all of the
wishes of the code authors.

Personally I think FVWM is a neutral tool. Very unlike, say, a gun,
whole purpose is to kill or injure others - it is fundamentally a weapon,
whatever the mindset of the person brandishing it.
But I'll support Dominik's approach here.

Cheers,

But why call it a license in the first place?

I don't have any problem with people reacting to controversial events,
or even them making their feelings known, whether or not I agree with
them.

If this is no more than a statement, as you claim, then you should
call it an ETHICAL_STATMENT (or DOMINICKS_ETHICAL_STATEMENT if you
wish to split hairs) and declare that you hope that fvwm isn't used to
further agendas that you disagree with, such as warmaking, terrorism,
and other things that are Not Healthy For Children And Other Living
Things.  Whether or not it is ignored is immaterial.

By calling what you've written a license will make Linux distributors
want to shy away from fvwm.  RedHat has already dropped fvwm from its
distribution (for other reasons, I should point out), and I know for a
fact that Debian will not distribute anything that appears to attempt
to dilute the GPL.  Are we looking to be dropped by everybody?  If
this is your desire, then your message will not be seen by anybody! 

In addition, I have seen at least one response to your "license" from
a developer that claims that he supports the current conflict.  That
developer should have as much right as you to add his own language to
that statement, or provide his own separate statement as a matter of
ballance.

Dominick, I feel your pain, and even share your frustration at recent
events, but I really feel that what you are doing is not good for
fvwm, nor is it good for the fvwm community.

I seriously urge you to reconsider your actions.

I really don't like to answer this message, because I don't see a point.
We speak now which ethics is better, but this is irrelevant, the
developers (at least the ones who answered) expressed a wish not to mix
ethics with software.

Anyway, it seems Dominik wants to talk about ethics, so I will show my
point of view. It was evolved with years, I was pretty much maximalist,
cosmopolitan and idealist in adolescence, anti-yankee too. Since then I
decided it was mostly rubbish and there is a much more clean position -
minimalism, that means try not to add anything you can't verify or feel
yourself, like religion or ethics. Operate only on the ego basis if you
don't want to be a hypocrite. Any universal ethics is bullshit designed
to hide someone's ego as something more superior than others.

Do you know what is right and what is wrong? I don't know. By a chance,
do you know what is right for me? I don't have such ethical problems
about what is _right_ and what is wrong, I (just like everyone else)
support only what is _good_ for me, pure egoistical. I know the regime
you are indirectly supporting breaks human rights and kills innocent
people in its own country. I know it used inconventional weapons in the
past against other countries. I know the regime finances thousands of
terorrists and their families. These same terrorists killed several
thousand of innocent people (I may give their names if you like).
I don't want this to happen to me. You would also not want this to happen
to anyone, but unfortunately only after feeling all this on yourself.
Please don't say you already don't want this to anyone, what you
effectively do is quite an opposite.

I don't think anyone attacks you, really, we all love peace, it just that
some people have another view of the situation.

Anyway, expect to be attacked if you activelly fight against a natural
people's wish to live in peace and prosperity without uncontrolled
dictators. You simply don't know what people in all countries close to
this war feel and want.

Does this mean you never treat some people differently than others?
If so, I think you would want to remove ETHICAL_LICENSE that treats a lot
of people differently than others based on your criterion not even laws.

Again, I don't have such ethical ambiguity. You make a distinction
between humans and animals, this is pretty much how religious people
describe things. For me it is still a human ego (or evolution whatever
you call it). People don't kill animals for the sake of it, because it
hurts the nature balance (means hurts people), but kill animals for self
defence and for food (or shortly for survival). I am pretty comfortable
with my minimalistic ethical basis. I would feel very uncomfortable with
your ethical basis as you described above regarding humans and animals.

Yes, exactly, if one opponent tries to kill another, it is likely only
one will survive.

Fortunately people don't usually want to kill each other, so there is
usually a time for talks. The smarter both sides the smaller probability
of conflicts. If one side is fanatical (not smart), no talks are
possible. You don't really want to defend the fanatics, they don't know
your ethics and may kill you without any ethical problem. Just because
you are not currently on their way, does not mean it will not happen.

Did you ask yourself why democratic countries usually don't fight each
other? Because free people would not allow this. They would change a
leader (or maybe he would leave himself) if he is stupid enough not to
prevent a war between countries that surely can solve conflicts with
talks/resources, not wars. Only uncontrolled regimes may allow wars
between countries and unjustified deaths of their own people.

I know only facts. "Arabian peoples" is too much millions to throw into
one basket. There are some democraties like Turkey. Most of the Iraq
neighbour coutries are against this dictatorship, some activelly support
this war, so please don't try to image the war as "western" against
"arabical", this is bullshit. But I don't really want neither support nor
condemn this war, I don't know all details. Just like we all.

Democratic countries are more developed, free people are more effective.
These are facts. In some non-democratic countries you have uneducated
masses and poverty. Do you think people in these countries enjoy their
situation? How do you know, did you ask them? If you want to be real
humanitarian, you may consider to support increasing of the education
level in these countries, not to speak about basic human freedoms.
I do want all these countries to eventually become democratic (means
rich, educated and developed), this seems to be the only effective way to
win terrorism. No, wars are not solution, but any indirect support of the
dictatorship regimes only hurts people in these and all other countries.
Unfortunately the war protesters do not realize they hurt real people.

Hmm, I don't believe I speak politics on this list. Shame on us both.
Again, a question of supporting or not supporting some war is fully
irrelevant when the developers do not want to go away from pure GPL.

Wait a moment, how did you get that idea?  From what I have said
up to here it should be *perfectly clear* that I support *no* use
of weapons.  I reject the logic behind your statement.  I am
against the use of weapons, yes.  I am against it in wars claiming
to be righteous, I am against it to suppress people, I am against
it in any possible case.  Full stop.  Claiming that I indirectly
support unjust use of weapons is one-sided at best, maybe even
malicious.

> I know it used inconventional weapons in the past against other
> countries.

Yes, Iraq did use chemical weapons in the war against Iraq.  I do
not accept that in any way.  However, as a citizen of a country
which has not only used chemical weapons but also nuclear weapons
in the past, you should be careful with that resoning.

Excuse me, but there is absolutely *no* proof for your claims
that was released to the public.  I don't want to see what would
happen in the world if a mere suspicion would be enough to justify
killing.  There are other, non-violent ways to deal with such
threats.

No, it is not.  You claim the right to react to a threat in any
way.  I deny the right to react to a threat in violent ways.  That
still leaves a broad range of non-violent reations.  History and
common sense teach us that violence never works to solve
conflicts.  It may seem work if one of the opponents is far
superior to the others, but unless you completely wipe out the
opposition, you will regret it later.

All I can say is:  wake up.  We (the people in the western
democracies) all want peace.  Sure.  But we usually do not care
one bit about the peoples in other countries, humiliate them, let
our secret services murder democratic governments or encourage
terrorists to do so, suport vile dictators for economic reasons,
exploit their resources and let people die from thrirst and
hunger, deny them modern medicines because they are too poor to
pay the license fees.  And then, when people become so desperate
that some individuals hate us and throw bombs in our direction we
are surprised and whine "They have no reason to do this, they must
all be fanatics, intent on killing us beyond reason."

Yes, we all want peace, but we are still not prepared to pay the
price for it.  You do not get peace for free, you have to fight
for it.

When I ask that my work is not used, for example, to manufacture
weapons, how does this wish discriminate between people?  I assume

And you think peace can be achieved with this reasoning?  What you
say is the ultimate justification for *any* war and *any* murder.
It almost *demands* that people who can kill you have to kill you,
because they might feel threatened by your attitude.

That assumption is not correct.  I do acknowledge the right not
to be killed, even for people who want to kill me.  That does not
mean I want to be killed.  But it does forbid me to force them
into a situation where killing is inevitable.

Yes, much of what you say is true, as far as I can judge.  But
please, why do we have to *bomb* these peoples to democracy,
freedom and prosperity.  These must be ways that at least do not
cost the lives of civilians.

Well, you ask for it, so I can not spare you the comment.  The
USA (and other countries exporting wepons) has equipped Saddam
Hussein with weapons to fight a war against Iran more than a
decade ago.  Later these and other weapons were used to suppress
the Iraqi people.  These are facts nobody can deny.  This does not
justify anything, but it can teach us that we *really* should
think more of what purpose weapons do serve.

> Unfortunately the war protesters do not realize they hurt real people.

You are reducing the peace novement to "No to all wars".  But that
has never been the message.  The message is that all goals for
which ("just") wars are started can be achieved with peaceful
means.  You can only claim that war protesters hurt people if you
think they would do nothing if the war stopped.  What makes me sad
is that nobody listens to pacifists *before* a war has started.

> Hmm, I don't believe I speak politics on this list. Shame on us both.

Well, I tried not to, but some replies forced me to.  Of course I
do not want this list to become a political forum, but on the
other hand, wueations of life and death are definitely more
important than mailing list discipline.  You may remember my plea
not to discuss 9/11 here, but that was basically because I feared
it would turn into a flame war.

Sigh!  Again:  the "ethical license" does not, read: *not*, affect
the GPL.  Claiming that it does is just plain wrong.

For psychological reasons.  Statement are generally ignored by

Oh well, this is a big misunderstanding.  I do not *hope* that my
work is not misused.  Actually I *know* that it is misused.  I
*demand* that is is not.  I do not plan to make it a legal issue,
but an ethical one.  With the whole statement I do not want to
express that I am sorry that wars (etc.) happen, but demand that
my work is not used to make them happen.  Everything less would
only be a parody of my motives.

Anyone who cares to read the statement should be able to verify
that it is not a legal license within two minutes.  If that is not
enough - tough luck.

And I do not deny this right.  Everybody is welcome to do so, and
I will not lift a finger to prevent that.  I can live perfectly
well with different opinions.  But I have and claim the right to
state my opinion about using the work I created in hundreds of
hours of voluntary work, even in a way that some people find
annoying.

Did I ever say or even suggest that the statement is intended to
be good for fvwm?  When human lives are at risk, how can I
seriously consider by how many people a mere set of bits and bytes
is used?

> I seriously urge you to reconsider your actions.

I have reconsidered them a lot, and I listen to all of the
criticism.  I have removed all strict requirements from what I had
in mind at first.  What remains can be ignored, without any legal
impact.  But I will *not* make it easy to ignore.  The statement
is not intended as some general bla bla which everybody can agree
to without even thinking about it.

Well, it got too much into politics to continue it.

The Dominik's reply makes some incorrect assumtions like I am from US and
do not know facts. I am from one of the several countries that commanded
all citizens to carry gaz masks with themselves (because Iraq may still
respond although most of the bases are fortunately destroyed) and I know
more facts about the situation than an average man who only reads press.

I will provide proofs that Dominik asked for privately. If Dominik wants
he may write to the list that he received them and thinks they are valid.
But this is fully optional. Noone will change their mind anyway.

I don't want to agitate against peace attempts, I believe in peace talks.
But humanity will simply not survive with suicidal ethics like "killing
mass murderers and terrorists is bad".

As for us, we should better return to our command lines. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Dominik...

There has been a lot of discussion about whether the ideas expressed in
the "ethical license" are really ethical or not (is it ethical to kill a
person?  Is it ethical to not kill a person who is directly threatening
yourself or your children?  Etc.)

This kind of thing is, unfortunately, a morass from which there is very
little chance of breaking free.

It is _this_ aspect that I want to address: you have lamented that this
has become politicized but you must take full responsibility for that
yourself: there is no politics here except in this context.  Indeed, my
understanding was that this was the entire purpose: you wanted to
politicize FVWM to keep it from being used in a manner which you
disagreed with.

The problem is that ethics are not absolute, and they are not even
universal.

What if some other FVWM developer is fervently opposed to abortion,
looks at your license and decides that the underlying theme of
non-violence should also apply to the unborn.  They add their own
"ethical license" stating that FVWM should not be used by abortion
clinics or other medical facilities that practice abortion, nor should
it be used by facilities like Planned Parenthood that provide counseling
that includes abortion as a viable alternative.

Next, another FVWM developer adds another "ethical license" which is
against all forms of suicide, including doctor-assisted suicide for
terminal patients in great pain, and doesn't allow FVWM to be used by
any facility which supports or even researches this.

Then someone adds an "ethical license" stating that FVWM should not be
used by any group that does not support the "war on drugs"--or that it
should not be used by any group that _does_ support the "war on drugs".

Next we might have licenses regarding homosexuality, or adoption by
homosexual couples, or pro/con gay marriage, or whatever.

And so it goes.

I generally consider "slippery slope" arguments as somewhat weak, but I
believe this is a real danger here.  Once we accept that an open source
software project is a legitimate platform for political (or, call it
"ethical" if you prefer) agendas, where does it stop?

You may say "well, it's not a real license so people can just ignore
it".  But people who are really ethical _won't_ just ignore it: if they
are ethical they will feel bound to not use the software if they don't
agree with _all_ of the ideas espoused in the "ethical license(s)".
With enough of these sorts of licenses there may well be almost no one
who happens to hold all of these ethical beliefs simultaneously.

So what do you have then?  Ironically enough, what you probably have is
that only people who are _not_ ethical will be using your
software... to me this seems counterproductive in the extreme.

It should be clear by now that I would not object to more of these

That is all true if such a flood of statements would come.  But as
it is, I do not fear this possibility.  People on this list have
proven time and again that this kind of 'war' is extremely
unlikely to happen.  I also listen to everybody, and I try to make
the "license" acceptable for as many people as possible without
betraying its motivation.

Hi Mikhael,

I realized that you changed some filenames in the fvwm-web
tree. The filenames are used to give the php files an
unique name which is used in the navigation array structure
and the child array entries. 

Therefore I tried to give the files unique names to avoid
using a name twice. 

Using short names like menu.php or icon.php may cause
problems if these file names appear twice in the file tree.
For example:
	download/icons.php
	screenshots/icons.php
Will be rejected by navgen.php since they have the same
site name.

Further the icon pictures belonging to a php-file have the same
name as the php-file e.g.
	doc_manpages_pager.gif belongs to doc_manpages.php

Currently there is an array entry ${$site}["link_pic"] for each
php file. This entry was going to be removed since the name of
the link picture can be derived from the name of the site
which is actually derived from the name of the php-file. So
the "link_pic" entry is not really needed.

For example:
	File: features.php 
	Internal name: features
	Mini Icon: features_mini.gif
	Pager pic: features_pager.gif
	...

BTW: navgen.php has to be ran each time you have changed
     something which may effect the entries in the file
     navigation.inc. Currently this are file names, link
     names, chapter names, picture names, parent sites and
     names of child sites.

I know this. This is why I wrote a comment in index.php that
navgen should be updated to handle subdirs. The id is better to be:

  download/icons
  documentation/faq

instead of the current forms:

  icons
  download_icons
  faq
  doc_faq

> Further the icon pictures belonging to a php-file have the same

Well, it is not a rule, just a convention.
A convention may be to replace a slash in id with an undescore.

Similarly, here just replace slash with underscore.

I simply changed the new version to handle things closer to the how we
do in the current old version. I hope it is ok with you.

Mikhael.

What else? png and xpm is not supported by all browsers and
jpg is not good for small pics. 

BTW: There gifs on the current web page.

Uups. I have not checked all files you have changed.

Actually I have thought about this. But I decided to force
the user (and myself) to _give_ the sites unique names
instead of generating unique names. Generating the sites
names means that the user must know how this is done since
he needs to use the names in the child and parents entries.
I think that forcing the user to give uniqe names to the
sites/files is not a big restriction.

It becomes a rule if the names of the icons are obtained
from the site names and not from the "link_pic" entry. Well
in the current version is not the case. But it was planed.

That's ok. I am happy if somebody helps working on the new
site since I think there is a lot work to do and there is
not that much time left.
I just wanted to mention that your changes may lead to
naming problems when we develop the site further, adding
new sub sites, etc.

So, let me ask you this.

Suppose someone adds an "ethical license" you don't agree with.  Would
you continue to work on FVWM?  On the assumption the answer is "no",
wouldn't you feel upset that someone had imposed their ethics on your
work, and had essentially co-opted all the hard work you've done on FVWM
over the years, so that you could no longer in good conscience work on
it?

And now that we have seen that all (?) of the other FVWM developers
don't agree with the inclusion of the license, and some don't agree with
the ethics behind it either, what should we do?  Surely these people
also feel like their hard work is being co-opted for purposes they don't
agree with, or at least in ways they don't agree with, and which are
completely unrelated to FVWM.

Hm.  So you believe it's OK to do this because everyone else objects to
the idea that FVWM is an appropriate forum for political statements and
so they won't take advantage of it, leaving you the only person who does?

*Shrug*  This discussion is becoming moot.  I will not tolerate
anymore that my work takes a part in killing.  If the only way to
do it is to stop development of fvwm and somehow prevent that fvwm
is distributed, then I have to do my best to make that happen.

I don't see why gifs would be a problem as long as they're not
LZW-compressed (the patented algorithm).

Ah, thanks for the information.  I was not aware that only the
compression algorithm is the problematic part.

I believe that including the ethical license with FVWM is unethical.
Can I add a statement to the ethical license saying as much?  Yes, this
would be paridoxical, and I think this illustrates the problem quite
well.

I am an FVWM user.  I love FVWM, and I applaud the efforts of you and
all FVWM developers past and present for making the best window manager,
period.  But this ethical license is not appropriate.  Threatening that
use of FVWM by people whos ethics do not coincide with yours may "end
development completely" is petty and almost certainly untrue.

FVWM is free software.  Free software is a brilliant example of what
people can accomplish through peaceful international cooperation.  I
think your license will undermine the spirit of free software with
respect to FVWM.  You state that the license is not binding, but the
license says that FVWM users are "expected to" abide by its
requirements.  This does not sound conditional.

I seriously hope you reconsider.  If the license remains, do not be
surprised if someone creates an "fvwm-unethical" fork that is identical
to the official version, less the ETHICAL_LICENSE.  I hope that will not
be necessary.

	- Ian.

We cannot agree to these conditions: we won't allow you to either stop
the development of FVWM or prevent FVWM from being distributed.

The only thing left to consider for me is how to use my copyright
to prevent further distribution of fvwm.

In September 2001, sixtyfour people from all over the world signed
this dedication message for the 2.4.1 release:

  This release is dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attacks               
  in New York, Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh on 11th of September,               
  2001.  The following people, many of them users or developers of                
  fvwm, would like to express their sympathies to those affected:

So, at least these people came to think that killing civilians
is wrong.  If I were add a similar dedication message to the
2.4.16, who of the subscribers of the original message would sign
it and who would not?

  This release is dedicated to the victims of the war in Iraq that
  began in March, 2003.  The following people, many of them users
  or developers of fvwm, would like to express their sympathies to
  those affected:

I want to add that the answers I get from the subscribers of the
original message will have a direct effect on the future of fvwm,
so please think at least two seconds about credibility before you
answer.

I will subscribe under this.

Can I suggest this wording to make it clear it is not political?

   This release is dedicated to the victims of the war in Iraq that
   began in March, 2003.  The following people, many of them users
   or developers of fvwm, would like to express their sympathies to
   all victims from both sides affected:

	I think this is not necessary - possibly  "all those afected". For one
thing, there are more than 2 sides affected.

	One of the sad facts of war (whether justified or not in anyone's
opinion) is the emotional wreckage that it heaps upon non-combatants in
many parts of the world. Consider the effects thus far on our little
microcosm of the FVWM developer community. In this ongoing argument, we
have all become victims of this war in our own small way (though
certainly not to the same extent as those killed, maimed, or left
homeless in the actual theater of operations), regardless of where we
live, our political leanings or ethical principles, or whether we are on
one side, the other, or neither.


Cheers,
Bob
