I have tested this on Solaris 2.5 with Sun's compilers and "make".

I would like to retain  the binary name of  fvwm2  and the rc file  as
.fvwm2rc.  I didn't see how to do that.

1. I  don't know if this is  something that  can  be changed,  but the
naming on these options seems inconsistent:

	--with-lib-xpm=PATH
	--with-xpm-includes=DIR

2. I had a compilation failure with extras/FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS.c.
It tried to include   "sunos_headers.h" which was  not  found.   Sun's
compiler apparently doesn't automatically define "SVR4".  I got around
this problem  by doing the configure  with  CFLAGS="-DSVR4".  (I don't
believe this has anything to do with the "configure" changes.

3. I had  an executable in my path  named "c++"  which wasn't working.
After I encountered the compilation error, I realized  I wanted to use
"CC" instead of "c++".   Maybe I'm ignorant, but I  had to look in the
"configure" script to find out that I  could override the C++ compiler
by setting   the   variable "CCC".  It   would be   nice  if  this was
documented somewhere.

4.  I'm pretty  sure this  is not under   our control, but I  find the
"configure.cache"   to  be a  pain.  After    I re-ran configure  with
"CCC=CC" on the command line, it still wanted to use "c++" because the
cache told it to use it.  I had to remove the cache  to get it to take
a fresh look  for the C++ compiler.  In  fact, I found that most times
when I   am re-running  configure, it  is  not  going to  see anything
different because of the cache.  My vote for  a default value for this
file would be "/dev/null".

5. Sun's C++ compiler didn't like a space between "-I" and the include
directory name.  It accepted the  "-I" by itself, and then  complained
that  it couldn't  do  anything  with  the  directory name.  I  should
mention  that I used --with-xpm-includes=DIR.   It  was this directory
that was preceded by a space.  Since the other "-I" args had no space,
I think  this should be  fixed, even though it  seems to be like Sun's
C++ compiler is lacking.

6.   The   file  "extras/FvwmConsole/FvwmConsole.c" wouldn't  compile.
Sun's compiler complained about the line:

char *xterm_a[] = {"-title", name,"-name",name, "-e",client,NULL };

Saying it  had a  "non-constant" initializer.   It was  the  automatic
variable   "client" that was  bothering  it.  I  realize this also has
nothing to do with configure.

7.  FvwmConsole  wouldn't link.   It needed  "-lsocket" on the command
line.  I'm not sure if "configure" was supposed to figure this out.

I don't like that feature either.  I've gotten used to typing 'fvwm2'
all over the place [smile].

I think that both "fvwm/.fvwmrc" and ".fvwm2/.fvwm2rc" could be
supported if Steve adds support for a new --with option on the
configure script.

	CC=cc ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-exename=fvwm
	CC=cc ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-exename=fvwm2

Comments anybody?

You can't.  I could put back a configure option to do this.

This can be partly changed.  The leading "--with-" is not changeable, but
the rest is.  What do you suggest?  Is this any more pleasing
aesthetically: 

	--with-xpm-lib[=PATH]
	--with-xpm-includes=DIR

Thanks.  Not including sunos_headers.h in the distribution was an
oversight on my part.  But this file really should not be necessary.  I'd
like to get rid of it eventually.

The rule of thumb is: if you change any "system characteristics", like the
compiler, or libc, or the like, you have to nuke the cache file before
running configure.  In other circumstances, the cache can speed things up
tremendously, to rerun configure with a different --prefix or --with-*
option, for example.

Thanks; this is easily fixed.

Argh.  I wish I had a compiler as picky as yours to find these things
with!  Maybe gcc has suitable warning flags that I can turn on.  I'll try
to fix this one for next time.

Are you sure it was FvwmConsole, and not FvwmConsoleC?  What function was
missing at link-time: connect?  Yes, configure should figure this out. 
And I'll fix it to do so soon.

I'm not convinced an option is  necessary, I would vote for hardcoding
this as fvwm2, but   I have a  strong suspicion   I  would be in   the
minority on this one.  I believe the default should be fvwm2.

Looks good to  me, I was  mainly  bothered by  the order of  the words
changing.

Looks to me   like it would have happened   to  both FvwmConsole,  and
FvwmConsoleC.  I  only  saw  FvwmConsole, because after  I   fixed the
Makefile, both programs linked correctly.  Heres what I got:

cc -DSVR4  -o FvwmConsole  FvwmConsole.o -L../../libs -lfvwm

Do it like the --with-x-includes and --with-x-libraries switches.  I
think they use "libraries" instead of "lib", or was it "library"?  I
don't remember.  But the main thing is that it's logical to choose
option names that are consistent with the X option names, just to be
nice to the people running the configure script.

[time passes]

Oh, I see it's "--with-x-includes" and "--with-x-libraries" (at least
for Emacs), so you should choose "--with-xpm-includes" and
"--with-xpm-libraries".

As do I...  I feel it helps eliminate confusion.

Often times people posting questions to the newsgroups and mailing
lists forget to mention what version they are working with, but at
least usually mention that it is 'fvwm2'.  It also helps keep people
from accidentally running fvwm2 with a 1.xx rc file and wondering why
it coredumped or produced really unexpected results.  Plus it allows
1.xx and 2.xx to both be installed on the same system easier and
safer.

Subject: Bug#16040: fvwm2: PipeRead should set extra environment variables
Date: Tue, 16 Dec 1997 23:09:54 -0500 (EST)

Package: fvwm2
Severity: Wishlist
Version: 2.0.46-BETA-1

When I do a "PipeRead" fvwm2 should set environment variables like it does
when using FvwmM4 (Ie: TWM_TYPE = fvwm2, WIDTH = 1152, HEIGHT = 900, etc)

>From what I can tell, the child inherits fvwm's environment.

Also, when doing a PipeRead, specifing ".fvwm2/program" doesn't read
~/.fvwm2/program nor /etc/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2/program.  Fvwm should treat
PipeRead the same way it does Read, but also search the path if the program
wasn't found.

This makes sense.  I changed the options to --with-foo-library, (since it
is typically ONE library and not a set of them, like for X) and
--with-foo-includes.

The current version also fixes all the compile problems mentioned in Dan
E's last email, and others sent to me privately.  

As the configure script per se settles down, I'm moving onto the second
phase of autoconf'ing the code.  Namely, going through the source and
replacing brittle constructs like:

	#if defined ___AIX || defined _AIX || defined __QNX__ || defined ___AIXV3  || defined AIXV3 || defined _SEQUENT_
	#include <sys/select.h>
	#endif

with something like

	#if HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
	...

where HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H is computed by configure, meaning the code is much
less likely to break in future (when some version of AIX stops shipping
sys/select.h) or work on new/mutant systems (which *have* sys/select.h,
but are not in the current list).

So if anyone knows of a good list of "portability pitfalls" to look out
for, I'd appreciate it!

I'd also like to clean up the code a bit, so that it will build without
warnings such as "gcc -Wall" gives:

	control reaches end of non-void function
	assignment discards `const' from pointer target type
	unused variable `i'

Subject: Annoying flash when changing icon pixmap
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

When changing icon pixmap from within a program, fvwm2 destroys the current
icon window and creates a new one with the new pixmap, even if it has the
same size. This causes:

a) an annoying flash as the icon is removed/recreated
b) a possible jump to a different location on the screen
c) the new icon window is placed on top of any window that was previously
   over it.

It should be trivial to check if the new icon has the same size as before,
and then just repaint it, but I must admit that browsing the source scared
me off for an instant (lots of global variables and tmp_win and stuff).
So, before I start hacking, has anybody already solved this problem,
or is it a bad idea to do so?

For reference, mwm handles the problem quite well.

Please CC: any replies to me, as I cannot afford to subscribe to yet another
mailing list. (sorry about that)

If the icon changes, isn't the last item (c) desirable?  Ie: it might
be trying to tell you something?

I don't have any icons  that change size.  I  used to use a version of
"live-icon" with XEmacs, that did that, but  I couldn't stand it, so I
fixed it.  So I guess its a good idea.

> For reference, mwm handles the problem quite well.

If I remember mwm correctly, doesn't it force all icons to the same size?=

If you really want to try code changes, I would suggest looking at the
icon placement logic after applying my iconboxes patch.

I  think I've cleaned   up the code   quite a bit,   and added lots of
comments:

Hi,

Although the spirit of fvwm has been free development, several of the
modules currently distributed with fvwm2 have surprisingly tight copy
restrictions.

In order to be able to legally distribute this stuff, it would be
worthwhile finding the authors of the following modules, and asking
them to clarify their copyright position.

Here is a list of the prime culprits:

------------------------------------------------------------

FvwmAudio:
---*---
       Copyright 1994, Mark Boyns and Mark Scott.  No  guarantees
       or  warranties  or anything are provided or implied in any
       way whatsoever.  Use this program at your own risk.   Per=AD
       mission  to  use this program for any purpose is given, as
       long as the copyright is kept intact.
---*---
Bug: Only use is explicit allowed. I don't know if this allows
redistributing, because I'm no lawyer.


FvwmBacker:
FvwmButtons:
FvwmForm:
FvwmIconBox:
FvwmIdent:
FvwmPager:
FvwmScroll:
FvwmWinList:
FvwmSave:
FvwmTalk:
Fall into a situation similar to FvwmAudio.


FvwmAuto:
---*---
AUTHOR
       FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
       FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.
---*---
Bug: This is bad: That means there is no explicit copyright, so
therefore it is fully protected by international law.



FvwmBanner:
---*---
COPYRIGHTS
       None.
---*---
Bug: This is very bad. It says that we have *no* right to
copy/redistribute this.  Ouch!



FvwmCascade:
FvwmTile:
---*---
AUTHOR
       Andrew Veliath
---*---
Bug:  No Copyright Statement.


FvwmIconMan:
---*---
AUTHOR
       Brady Montz (bradym@cs.arizona.edu).
---*---
Bug: No copyright statement.


FvwmSaveDesk:
---*---
AUTHOR
       Carsten Paeth (calle@calle.in-berlin.de)
---*---
Bug: No copyright statement.


For those modules with no copyright statement, would a BSD-style
copyright be suitable?  Ie, something like:

Especially Mark Boyns <boyns@sdsu.edu> was very helpful during the time I
rewrote / enhanced FvwmAudio.
I guess the original authors will, as well as I do, agree to any
free-distribution-copyright notice.


BTW: has somebody changed anything since Oct. 1996 ??
Been away for a while (military service).

I'm `whom'. 
I just continued in the original tune on the man page, as I liked the
humor.

The code says:

So if it's ok with rob, I won't stand in the way ;-).

That's ok for the code.
I wouldn't put that clump on the man page-though.
Something shorter. (3 -5 lines at the bottom should suffice)
I would probably add some 
	Bugreports-to: 
or 
	Maintainer:
email address.
(how about a relay station for this at hpc.uh.edu ?)

	Bugreports-to: FvwmAudio-maintainer@hpc.uh.edu

and they are forwarded to me (for FvwmAudio & FvwmAuto).
Makes changing the maintainer transparent and insensitive to
address-changes.
And if some maintainer goes dead :-), messages can easily be routed to
chuck or someone else for a while / forever / till someone else volonteers.

The above copyright is *not* correct.  If you look at FvwmAudio.c
you'll find that there is a GPL copyright notice at the top.  Later in
the file it says:

/*
 * This module is based on FvwmModuleDebugger which has the following
 * copyright:
 *
 * This module, and the entire ModuleDebugger program, and the concept for
 * interfacing this module to the Window Manager, are all original work
 * by Robert Nation
 *
 * Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warantees or anything
 * are provided or implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your
 * own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
 * as long as the copyright is kept intact.
 */

This was added to give Rob Nation proper credit and if I remember
correctly almost all of the modules at that time had such a copyright.
In this case "This module" does not refer to FvwmAudio.

Does this mean you want to be the official maintainer for FvwmAudio?

Hi all,

Due to overwhelming demand, I've put back in the option to name the binary
'fvwm2', with config file suffix '.fvwm2rc'.  This is the default, btw;
the switch exists to DISABLE putting '2' in the names.

I've also returned to NOT building the 'extra' modules by default (there
is an --enable-extras switch) simply because of problems with non-GNU
sunos and irix machines.

Beyond these config changes, I've started fixing the code so that it will
now compile with "gcc -Wall".  Currently, only "libs", "fvwm", and the two
modules I use compile cleanly using -Wall, on linux.  The priorities now
are to first have the main code compile cleanly using the IRIX and DEC
UNIX compilers, (which are pickier than gcc) and then work on modules.
I should probably learn to use 'lint' for this task...

I've had to start naming the versions I release.  I don't want to step on
toes, or to give people the impression that I've taken over maintenance of
fvwm (that's the last thing I need!).  Hence, I decided on the convention
of prefixing with my initials, and suffixing with a number.  This is
intended to indicate the NONOFFICIALNESS of the release.

I'd rather have one of your minutes
than a year with all the hours in it.
