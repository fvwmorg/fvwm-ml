Hello -

Just a quick note, in FAQ #7.18, there's a spelling mistake in the forth
paragraph.  To quote it:

   Make sure you are not using the style IconOverride for these
   applications.  It idsables the use of active icons.  There may be
                     ^^^^^^^^
   other applications with similar features.


The above should be "disables", of course.  :)

Hi All,

Just a triviality but could we change the implementation of WindowShade from

WindowShade [bool] | [[ShadeAgain] direction]

to 

WindowShade [[bool] direction] | [[ShadeAgain] direction]

I've successfully worked around it by using helper functions, but it
makes no sense not allowing shade direction when there's a bool arg.

Cheers,

- Craig

Hi,

Is anyone still watching changes to twm?
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-commit/2005-March/002586.html
may be something needed in fvwm, too...

This is only a feature of HP/UX now but in X11R7 it may become the
default that X servers have both video and print screens.

Currently print displays are running on a separate server called
"Xprt" (X print server) but right now there is some work in progress
to create one server which has both types of screens (video cards and
printers) in one display (example: screens #0+#1 may be video cards,
screens #2 may be a print screen. Or screen #0 is a video card and
screens #1+#2 are print screens).

twm has a similar option but the idea of the bugfix for twm is to
detect this automatically without any extra options - you do not have
to enable xinerama support with extra options in fvwm, too.

Strangely enough, xaniroc was the cause of this problem.

Hi,

        This bug was reported by a debian user.

Package: fvwm
Version: 2.5.12-4
Severity: minor

Running "man FvwmProxy" prints warnings

    /tmp/zmanCcn3zS:154: warning: numeric expression expected (got `t')
    /tmp/zmanCcn3zS:165: warning: numeric expression expected (got `t')

I think those lines

    .IP "SendToModule FvwmProxy Next" (temporary)
and
    .IP "SendToModule FvwmProxy Prev" (temporary)

should be

    .IP "SendToModule FvwmProxy Next (temporary)"
and
    .IP "SendToModule FvwmProxy Prev (temporary)"

.IP takes a single argument, a second argument is an indentation
amount.

Hi,

        This was reported by a debian user:

Package: fvwm
Version: 2.5.12-4
Severity: minor

Running "man fvwm-menu-desktop" prints a warning

    /tmp/zmanKeWDYY:222: warning: numeric expression expected (got `t')

It looks like that line

    .IP "\fB\-\-merge-user-menu\fR" this option tries to merge the user menu

has got the paragraph text joined up on the .IP, where it should begin
on a new line.

Hi,

         [Please retain the CC to 287588-forwarded@bugs.debian.org
          so that the Debian BTS has a record of your input]

         This was reported by a Debian user.

Package: fvwm
Version: 2.5.12-4
Severity: normal

Hi
 When run on a 1 BPP or 4 BPP display, FVWM crashes on startup with
 the following output : 

  X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
    Major opcode of failed request:  91 (X_QueryColors)
    Value in failed request:  0xff
    Serial number of failed request:  8
    Current serial number in output stream:  8

Excerpt from the ltrace :

  XGetVisualInfo(0x8103fa0, 10, 0xbffff6f0, 0xbffff6dc, 0) = 0
  malloc(4112)                               = 0x8105150
  XQueryColors(0x8103fa0, 32, 0xbfffea20, 256, 0xb7f8fe61 <unfinished ...>
  XUngrabServer(0x8103fa0, 0xb7fc7d28, 1, 0xb7cb098f, 0) = 1
  XUngrabPointer(0x8103fa0, 0, 1, 0xb7cb098f, 0) = 1
  XUngrabKeyboard(0x8103fa0, 0, 1, 0xb7cb098f, 0) = 1
  +++ exited (status 1) +++

The fourth argument to XQueryColors() looks like someone upstream
has forgotten about the existence of black-and-white and 16-colour
modes.

This is a relatively new bug. Last year, I used FVWM on 1 BPP and
4 BPP displays with no problems.

 Hi,

         [Please retain the CC to 293368-forwarded@bugs.debian.org
          so that the Debian BTS has a record of your input]

         This was reported by a Debian user.

Package: fvwm
Version: 2.5.12-4
Severity: normal

When you push mouse 1 on title bar and try to move a window the
movement is delayed for a while. Indeed, it appears to wait until
button release, which is very disconcerting.

This is expected behaviour, the user probably wants something like this:

AddToFunc MoveWindow I Move
Mouse 1 T A MoveWindow

The built in binding is:

Mouse 1 T   A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX
AddToFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX
+ I Raise
+ M Move
+ D Lower

Even with a double click binding in the function and clicktime set
to a high value, Fvwm starts moving the window as soon as
it detects motion.

Suite 147, Mooncirlce House

Your Kindest Atention:
=20
Hope you are doing great and sound? I am Barrister James Williams,
Barrister at law and attorney to a  deceased client of mine
(names withheld for now, due to security reasons)
who was based here in the United Kingdom and died of
complications from injuries sustained after a ghastly
motor accident in March 2000, with his wife and only daughter.
As the attorney to him, I was his confidant as he shared
 with me virtually everything
about himself, his business and family. I was his
attorney for 15years and during that period I wrote
his WILL and was also named as the executor, which has
since been fulfilled. I am also aware due to my
closeness to him that the amount Ten Million Pounds he
deposited with a bank in Europe was not willed out. He
told me about this on his sick bed and even instructed
that I should prepare a codicil to that effect,
however before I could finish my work he had died.=20
After his death, funeral and subsequent execution of
his will I went into action to ascertain the
information passed unto me by my client. My
investigation conformed to the information; at that
point I knew I had to do something to move the funds
out of the bank and knowing that I cannot do this
alone I have decided to contact you and seek your
assistance and acceptance to be the next of kin to the
estate.
Aside my humble self and you, the relationship manager
(account officer) of my client knows about this, for
he was very helpful during my discreet investigation,
through him I was able to see the deposit paper work
of the money which confirmed that there is no next of
kin to the funds. It is necessary for us to move the
money out of the bank on time because if we do not do
this within the next one month, the bank would regard
the money as sundry funds, which would give them the
right to claim the money, as they are allowed to do so , if
 any account is not operated for more than five years
I cannot move the money in my name because he is my
client, for it could arose suspicion, his account
officer cannot do the same, hence the importance of
your assistance. Have my assurance that there is
nothing to fear about, as we also need your assurance
that you would work with me without fear or favour to
achieve our desired objective. The legal back up is no
problem for I would be responsible. Since the codicil
was not ready before his death, letter of
administration without Will would be secured from the
probate office, with this letter I would personally
apply on your behalf to the bank for the release of
the funds to you.
What I require from you to enable us achieve the above
are your;
Names
Address
Date of Birth
Telephone and Fax numbers
=20
Upon receipt of a confirmation of acceptance from you
a sharing ratio would be worked out between the three
of us and communicated to you along with my telephone
number.in the light of above, your positive responses
would be appreciated through my private and more confidential email:
williamjames2004@mail2lawyer.com
=20
Take care and have a nice day.
Sincerely,
Barrister James Williams

Hi!

I created a patch that adds a new builtin function called AnimatedScroll,=
 =20
which has the same syntax as Scroll, but scrolls with a neat smoothscroll=
 =20
effect.

It patches at least against FVWM 2.5.12.

I'd like to take a look at this problem, but everything I've
tried so far refuses to work with depth 1 or 4 visuals.

X itself won't start that way, it says the drivers don't support
the depth.  I'm using S3 and I860.  Xnest doesn't want to
start that way either.  The man page says the server needs
to support that depth.  Even Xvfb, which doesn't have to
display anything gives me:

home> Xvfb :2 -screen 0 1024x768x4
_XSERVTransSocketOpenCOTSServer: Unable to open socket for inet6
_XSERVTransOpen: transport open failed for inet6/home-1:2
_XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: failed to open listener for inet6

Fatal server error:
Couldn't add screen 0


I'm using the latest Xorg release 6.8.2.

Hello all -

This is a very minor fix (see 'manpage.patch' attached) for the
FvwmProxy manpage that changes $w variables to $[w.id] to reflect the
"new" syntax.

Hi,
Im experiencing some 'wierd' issues with fvwm on my machine, I dont
know whats causing it, so ill just try to explain what it happens and
maybe someone have an idea.

my initfunction looks like this:

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Module FvwmCommandS
+ I Module FvwmEvent
+ I Module FvwmAnimate
+ I Module FvwmButtons -g $[vp.width]x25+0+0 FvwmButtons-MenuBar
+ I Test (Init) Exec sudo sh -c "echo "ondemand" >>
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor"
+ I Test (Init) Exec gkrellm2
+ I Test (Init) Exec xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 4 5"
+ I Test (init) Exec fbsetbg -l
+ I EWMHBaseStruts 0 0 27 0

It seems to work fine, however when I restart fvwm, all the modules die.
So I made a restartFunction that is 100% identical to the
initFunction, so restart everyton upon a restart. I don't remember
having to do this on x86.

The next issue is, when i maximize a window, the window doesn't take
_all_ the free area of the screen.
As you can see, I have the EWMHBaseStruts  limiting 27 pixels from
being overlaped by maximized window, but a maximized window will leave
a _huge_ gap empty:

Please see this snapshot:
http://ikaro.homepage.dk/05-03-26_20:27:35_1600x1200.png

Ive also added these style to the config:
Style * MinOverLapPlacement
Style * ResizeHintOverride
Style * HintOverride

Doesnt seem to work either.

This is sucking all my energies,  so i hope someone can help me.
I can supply more info if needed.


Thanks alot.
