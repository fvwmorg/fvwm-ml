All three are equivalent now (except that the first allows conflicts):

  *FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 48x48
  *FvwmIconBox:MaxIconSize 48x48
  *FvwmIconBox: MaxIconSize 48x48

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly*
  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar:DeskOnly*
  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar:  DeskOnly*

Ideally the delimiter should be spaces only. But this can't be done now;
without a colon it would break existing configurations.

DestroyModuleConfig does not really support a new syntax yet, will do soon.

> * complex function parsing is now strict

'AddToFunc myfunc myarg' now gives an error rather than assuming myarg
function with "M" (Motion) specifier.

Does anyone else think that "I" (Immediate) specifier should be a default,
i.e. this command should be interpreted as 'AddToFunc I myfunc myarg'?

> * corrected rounding error in Move/Resize when using screen persentage

'Move w+1 w+1' and 'Move w-1 w-1' restore the original window geometry
rather than moving by 1 pixel.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is on purpose. Most people that the window is raised before
it starts moving. I don't know why this changed between 2.0.46
and 2.2 though.

tim_phipps@bigfoot.com will probably always work (until bigfoot or I
die). tim.phipps@st.com is my new official work email,
phippst@bri.st.com may be quicker.#

I'm here, lurking at the moment. The new job is taking lots of attention
and I am not going to get CVS access (serious firewall and no Socks
server). Any ideas for CVS over http or ftp?

Cheers,
Tim.

Since the || operator is weaker than &&, conditions with
both schould really be put in parentheses.  It's a common
source of errors, and often hard to fix when you notice
it with "-Wall -Werror".

Ah, good idea.

No. I see no benefit in this additional syntax, it only makes
config files harder to understand.

I'm not sure if this "Module" parameter is useful anyway.  I *believe*
it's meant to indicate: "Hey, we are running a script, so do not wait
for any user interaction".  If so, we have to redesign this parameter:
(a) give it a proper name and (b) check every place where it is used.
Furthermore the Read/Piperead commands should set this "scripting" flag
too.

I'll take a look at this when I'm through the mail (still 100+
unread mails left).

We do keep a complete checked-out tree in /pub/fvwm/devel/sources on the
server.  But I see no easy way for you to commit, so it's back to sending
patches.

I could try running the CVS server on port 8080 if your firewall will pass
it.

Can you pass ssh?  I know you can easily do CVS using scp...

Any company that expects telecommuting should allow ssh...

running xview tools...

clicktofocus: window w/ focus loses focus while mouse over root.

This bug has always been broken, but a patch exists and is only half
implemented.

the missing patch to events.c ...

change the appropriate line to add the NumberOfScreens check.

if (ewp->window == Scr.Root && Scr.NumberOfScreens > 1)

================================

Clicking on another window has ambiguous change of focus.
This started w/ 2.3.17

Normally, in xview, a black focal point indicates that window has focus.
A grey point indicates where the focal point is, but window doesnt actually have the focus.

In 2.3.21, the first click removes focus from the previous window (leaving a
grey focal point) and sets a grey focal point in new window, leading me to
believe it doesnt have focus yet. At that point, i cant actually tell which
window has it till i start typing.

A 2nd click in the window will result in the black type-in point.
This problem didnt exist in 2.3.16.

Thanx

Another xview problem w/ 2.3.21 that was ok on 2.3.16:

xview mailtool. If there's no msg window, clicking on a message will bring up a message window....but will cause the header window to dive to the back.

I have added this to get the msg window to open:

*FvwmEvent add_window add_event

AddToFunc add_event
+	"I" WindowID $0 (iconic "Mail Tool*View*") Iconify

W/o this, for the 1st msg since deiconifying mailtool, clicking on a msg, it
iconically creates msg window and the header window dives to the back.

more info...

Above is w/ Lenience on.
Get same behavior in 2.3.16.

W/ Lenience off (which is how ive been running 2.3.16), in 2.3.21 it actually takes 2 clicks to move focus to another window.

The whole idea behind the WaitForButtonsUp() in ExecuteFunction()
is seriously screwed up.  There are several theories under which
circumstances this is necessary.  My main problem is that I don't
know exactly why it is necessary at all.

 1) Whenever the main module executes a command.  This is
 currently implemented, but much too strict.

 2) Whenever commands are executed that are *not* part of a
 script (Read/Piperead/Module input).  This is probably still
 overkill and much too slow.

 3) (2) with the additional condition that fvwm is not in startup
 anymore.  I don't know if this is right.

 4) (2), but furthermore only certain commands need to wait for
 button releases.

 5) Only if the command was triggered by a mouse click.

 ...

I really don't know which theory is correct.  Currently I
believe (5) is the best one, but perhaps I overlooked something.
Comments?

Bye

Subject: TaskBar does not appear

Full_Name: Tommaso Toffoli
Version: 2.2.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: XFree86 4.0.1
Submission from: (NULL) (128.197.177.67)


I used the taskbar module in RedHat Linux 6.1, 6.2, and 6.95, with
1x1 screens (no multiple or virtual screens).
In 6.1 the taskbar mostly appeared (though sometimes it didn't). In 6.2
and 6.95 I cannot manage to make it appear at all. Do you have an
exemplar .fvwm2rc for which the TaskBar is known to appear without
problems? Where is the taskbar documented? Where can I find examples?

To me it looks like a system configuration problem; has your autoconf
been upgraded recently, or your m4 been downgraded, or maybe the m4 the
script is finding first on the path isn't the GNU version, or something?

Is there anything interesting in the config.log file?

I'm not ruling anything out, but I don't really see how something that
fvwm did could cause an error like that; it seems more like a system
config error for the GNU configure tools.

Absolutely nothing has changed with that system since the snapshots started
building.

PDS> Is there anything interesting in the config.log file?

Actually, config.log is from yesterday.  Configure didn't get to run,
because the errors were in building it.

I think configure.in, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4 or some combination just got
changed and the system can't build the configure script from them.  I'll
look at updating m4 and see if the problem goes away.

Some might ask why the snapshots are build on an ancient POS with pitifully
outdated software; the answer is simply that the machine is there and free
and it does exercise a few interesting options.  The generated tarfile
doesn't depend on what options the snapshot build host supports.

* Tried to improve handling of "input hint=false" windows.
* Documented how to make xview windows work better (NeverFocus), but this is still not a good solution because it requires such windows to be configured differently than normal windows.

It doesn't seem there was any fix for this since Brad reported it.
Did you find out anything, Mike?  This does not happen in my setup.

Okay, I understand why this is happening now (without lenience):

 a) xview applications explicitly ask to be never given focus
    by the window manager.
 b) With any focus policy but NeverFocus, fvwm asks the
    application to take the focus itself. The Application
    does not get the first click because fvwm intercepts it
    (CLickToFocus and/or MouseFocusClickRaises styles).
 c) The application simply refuses to take the focus.
    
The correct solution in this case is to use NeverFocus and
NoLenience styles for the window.  The application takes care
of the focus itself then.

The Lenience style does not work because of (c).  Xview
applications simply do not want to listen to the window
manager's hints.  The correct thing for fvwm to do is
to treat such windows as if they had the NeverFocus
style set.

I'll commit a patch that tries to improve the general
situation a bit, but I still recommend using "NeverFocus, NoLenience"
for these windows.

Bye

	Hmmm...I can see the behavior that Mike describes, but not the one Brad
reported. Dominik, can you duplicate Mike's symptom if you switch to
ClickToFocus? This looks suspiciously like something I reported almost a
year ago (in the thread "ClickToFocusDoesntRaise...Does", 19 Sep 1999).
I thought I'd committed the fix for it on 20 Sep 1999, but we still seem
to be getting a superfluous Raise when focus is given to a ClickToFocus
window (and then RaiseLower finds the window on top and lowers it).

	Brad, which focus policy do you use...and does this still happen? Mike,
you are using ClickToFocus, right?

	Sorry I've been unable to be more than a shadowy lurker for the past
several months...I hope I can step out of the shadows before too many
more months go by.


Cheers,
Bob

I haven't had much time to spend on FVWM this summer. I started
looking into the problem but got stymied when I realized I'd need to
reinsert debug code. I'll start a big vacation pretty soon, so I may
have some time before leaving town, or failing that, once I return. If
anyone wants to chase this down in the meantime, feel free.

Okay, ClickToFocus does the trick:

 1) Style * ClickToFocus
 2) Mouse 3 t a Raiselower
 3) Create 3 windows overlapping each other (I used rxvt)
 4) Click with button 3 on the title of the middle window
 ==> window is raised and immediately lowered again

While you're here ;-) : Elliot's problem with xview applications
seems to be caused by the grab of the button on a window we
introduced with the decor window.  Since the button is grabbed,
the click doesn't make it through to the application window (if
you use MouseFocusClickRaises or ClickToFocus), so you have to
click twice, once to release the grab and once to give it the
focus (try with Textedit).  Any ideas what to do about it, Bob?

I just did a fresh checkout in a new directory and everything worked as
expected. So I suppose the problem is either in system tools or a local
cvs copy is screwed (maybe due to a bug in cvs, I can only guess).

Jason, I suggest you to manually remove the existing fvwm hierarhy
completely and do a fresh checkout. This is good anyway, since your old
hierarchy contains obsolete files (marked by '?'). Then do all steps
described in cvs.html, if the system is ok, everything should work. :-)

I also suggest you to use 'cvs -q update', not 'cvs update'. The big part
of the log output is garbage, which makes it harder to see a real problem.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Teehee, some problems have a very simple reason :-)  Consider this:

  Style * ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaises
  Mouse 3 t a RaiseLower

Now, what happens if you 3-Click an unfocused window that is not on top?

 1) The window is focused and raised because of ClickToFocusRaises.
 2) The window is lowered by RaiseLower because it is now on top :-P

Of course that does not explain Brad's problem because he uses
keystrokes.  I'll make a fix for this problem, but I am not sure
I can catch every possibility.

I think I have made some progress on this one too.  As I
mentioned before, the fix was very broken and only cured
the symptoms.  Playing with textedit w/ ClickToFocus I
noticed this:

 1) Style * ClickToFocus

 2) Open two windows (any non-xview windows will do) and
 a textedit window.

 3) Click in one of the non-textedit windows to focus it.

 4) Click inside the textedit window until it accepts focus.

 5a) Move the mouse over the root window
 or
 5b) Move the mouse over the window that had the focus before.

==> The textedit window loses focus.

This does not happen if you move the mouse over the other
window that did not have focus before.

Elliot, is this what you mean?

I am poking around to see if I can do something about it.
Probably we can fix (5b), but perhaps we can not prevent
the textedit window from releasing focus in case of (5a).

Bye

Nice to see you back, Dominik.

Well, this seems to fix Raise/Lower command problems, but here is another
problem. Still there is a redudant Raise at the end of any non Raise
command when clicking on a border/title of ClickToFocusRaisesOff window.

  Style XCalc ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaisesOff
  Mouse 1 TSF S Menu MenuFvwmRoot
  Mouse 2 TSF S Move

Press Shift-Mouse1 or Shift-Mouse2 on a unfocussed (only) xcalc border or
title to reproduce this. This is the same bug as reported at the end of:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0003/msg00269.html

but now it does a redudant Raise after a command, not before.

Regards,
Mikhael.

As promised I have made a patch.  I was not able to reproduce
focus loss when entering the root window, but the patch fixes
focus loss over the previously focused window.  Elliot, please
try this patch, and if any problems persists, try to describe
them as detailed as possible.

I can see it again now. I'm on the hunt again.

The problem seems to be, that fvwm does not properly keep track
of the focus if an xview window becomes focused.  The Scr.Focus
variable does not reflect reality and therefore strange things
happen when the mouse enters or leaves windows.  With a bit more
time and a way to reproduce them, I will soon hunt down these
problems.

Hm, I need a Linux executable of mailtool to test this. Do you
have one handy?

I learned that there are much more unfulfilling things you can
do than developing fvwm :-)  Nice to see you again too.

Ah, yes.  Even back to 2.0.46, ClickToFocusRaisesOff only refered
to clicking in the client window.  You could not disable raising
when clicking on the decorations.  I wonder if this can safely be
changed or if people will start complaining.  Hm, probably this
will be not a good idea if people are using something like this:

  Style * ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaisesOff
  Mouse 1 t a MoveOrRaise
  AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
  + M Move
  + C Raise

But perhaps this is not a very common setup.  I will give
it a try, but if too many people complain I may reconsider.

[patch applied]

Subject: Configure can't find readline library

Full_Name: Bryan Henderson
Version: 2.3.21
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (24.16.238.239)


Configure cannot find my readline library.  I specify 
--with-readline-library, but in its trial compilation with
ncurses, Configure does not include the --with-readline-library
value in the gcc command.  It does, however, correctly include it in 
the readline/termcap trial compilation.  I circumvent this bug by
setting the LDFLAGS environment variable.

By the way, I applaud the way Configure tells me at the end what
features it isn't using because it couldn't find them on my system.
Most Configures just silently omit the features and I find out 
much later, at run time, after a lot of debugging, that there was a 
problem at Configure time.

Subject: Configure assumes ncurses in default path

Full_Name: Bryan Henderson

I really appreciate the way Fvwm Configure has options to tell where
the libraries are (and especially that there are separate ones for the
headers and the linkable code), as with most other packages I have to
struggle with their reliance on default paths.

But there's one library missing from this configurability:  The ncurses
or termcap library that goes with the readline library.  I'd like to see
--with-ncurses-lib, etc.

After determining from config.log that Configure needs my ncurses 
library, I got around this by using the LDFLAGS environment variable.

Ok, I see this problem. I will fix it later and submit to you for testing.
About your next bug report #649, I think, I can add --with-library-path
or similar, so one could specify ncurses and/or termcap dir using it.

Yes, really useful.

Fvwm2 has a built-in Read command "Read FVWM_DATADIR/ConfigFwvmDefaults"
where FVWM_DATADIR is the Fvwm data directory determined at build time.
I'm not sure why, since FVWM_DATADIR is part of the default search path
for Read commands, but this creates at the very least an annoying error
message unless you build Fvwm for specific file locations.  I prefer not
to build file locations into my programs.

One way around this, which I've done for myself, is to change it to
"Read ConfigFwvmDefaults".  Another is to provide an environment variable
FVWM_DATADIR.  This might help with other dependencies on this path too.

Incidentally, the error message in this case isn't quite right.  It says,
"/blah/blah/blah/ConfigFwvmDefaults not found in /blah/blah/blah or
~~/.fvwm".  Because it's an absolute path, though, Fvwm didn't really 
look in those directories.

The search order for read commands starts with the user and then
the fvwm data directory.  The file ConfigFvwmDefaults isn't meant to
be changed by users, hence the full path.

I agree that dependencies are bad.
I just did "configure --help".  It seems to me there are a lot of paths
built into fvwm.  Is this preference related to a real need?

That message has been that way since at least 2.0.47d (the oldest version
I keep around).  I remember once trying to clean it up.  I guess I gave up.

Maybe the message should read:

<file> not found in <userhome> or <fvwmdatadir>, not sure which

(Just kidding... sort of.)

	Erm, in this case I think the behavior is correct, and probably *should
not* be "fixed" - I dunno. The problem that I'm seeing is that it still
occurs with

	Style * ClickToFocusRaisesOff

At least that's what I observe on my system. I haven't had time to look
at it much, except to notice that I left footprints in this area of the
code in events.c (HandleButtonPress) when we did the Great Button Grab
Rewrite last year, and I'm wondering if I may have made a tupo and
broken my earlier fix.


Cheers,
Bob

It doesn't seem to be happening at the moment.  So for right now I'll table the issue.  OF course whenever you take your car to the shop it never makes "that" sound.  By the way I use SloppyFocus

Subject: FvwmAuto raises the wrong window

Full_Name: Harald Dunkel
Version: 2.3.21

OS: Linux 2.4.0-test6

Submission from: (NULL) (212.121.155.45)


Hi folks,

Some applications open several windows. One example is xmms: You can
switch on additional displays for an equalizer and a track list.

Using FvwmAuto one would expect that either all xmms windows are 
raised, or that just the window the pointer points to is raised. 
But FvwmAuto always seems to raise the wrong window, e.g. the 
equalizer, even when the mouse is on the track list. This seems 
to be reproducable.


Please mail me if I have missed some important details.


Many thanx

Harri

Those paths mainly just affect 'make' and 'make install'.  Some of them
are built into the code as last resort defaults, to which I have no 
objection.  I only use Fvwm simply, but so far the only path I have found
that I cannot choose at run time is the one to ConfigFwvmDefaults.

>Is this preference related to a real need?

It's real enough that I modified the source code to make an acceptable
version for me.  I build things like this with a dummy --prefix path
(it's a temporary directory) so that I can do a 'make install' without
modifying a running system, then install the built objects wherever
they make sense on various systems.  Usually, I set environment
variables in system profiles to tell the programs where their parts
are installed, but since I can't do that with Fvwm, I just copy the
necessary files into the ~/.fvwm's (and that only works because of the
slight modification I made to fvwm.c).

No, you did not miss anything, it was a bug in the transient
raising code.  I have fixed it.

Is there any error output on the console explaining what
went wrong?  It is probably a misconfiguration of the
task bar in the RedHat distribution.  You might consider
reporting the problem there.

There is an example in the taskbar's man page:

  man FvwmTaskBar

While testing fvwm-themes yesterday, fvwm crashed in

  FindPopup()

  mr = 0x80b9bb0
    s = 0x0  <- screwed up pointer
    d = 0x39 <- screwed up pointer

called from

  destroy_menu()

Unfortunaltely ddd crashed while debugging this and overwrote
the core file.  I just chose [All] from the default theme and
fvwm crashed before it was restarted.  So, if anybody sees this
again, please try to reproduce it or narrow it down.

BTW, there is a sure fire way to crash fvwm in the menu code
which I am aware of since I wrote it a long time ago.  I can't
remember exactly what it is, but it has to do with deleting
or modifying the menu style of a dynamic menu from within this
menu.

I don't know any details but Google turned up a bunch of hits

Tried 907 snapshot.

clicktofocus and running xview tools...

Still lose mouse over root.
Still requires double click.
mailtool header window raise/lower still misbehaves.
Turning off Neverfocus doesnt help.
Also have Lenience off and OLDecor on.

Also noticed that modules compile w/ "-g".
Is that just for snapshots or for the betas also?

Submission from: (NULL) (212.121.155.45)


Hi folks,

xmms windows ain't sticky anymore. This problem must have been
introduced after 2.3.21. My .fvwm2rc file says

	Style "xmms"	WindowListSkip, Sticky
	Style "XMMS*"	WindowListSkip, Sticky

The WindowListSkip attribute seems to work. The second line
should be obsolete, anyway, cause the class name of all
xmms windows is 'xmms'.

The xmms version is xmms-1.2.2, installed on July 30th.


Regards

Harri

It is interesting. Olivier reported some hard to spot (unconsistent) core
dumps. But I myself never got core dumps on my machine. Now, I ran the
same fvwm on another X Server remotely using rsh and always got core
dumps. I am attaching 5 core dump outputs (the last 2 are suspicious, they
are in line 42 (malloc) of safemalloc). I don't know how helpful they are.

Once I got a core, which was lost, that gave in the stack "free(token);"
line in AddToMenu, IIRC.

The first core dump is caused by these two commands:

  Key Enter  A       CM      -
  Key Enter  A       SM      -

(trying to destroy a non-existing binding). You can find these 2 lines
in themes/default/bindings and comment them in to avoid this core.

This may explain other core dumps (if you say you know the cause).
Here is what happens, a menu function is executed, this function calls
more functions and among many other commands, the menu style is redefined.

BTW, we currently only use MenuStyle "*", mainly because there is no
something like UseMenuStyle (ok, CopyMenuStyle) to avoid duplication.

Mikhael.

THe betas are essentially the same as the snapshots, so
they are buit with -g too.

Hi,

When compiling fvwm2.3.20 on a "SunOS 4.1.4 2 sun4m" machine, I got the
following errors. Do you have any idea what's causing it and how to get
around that?
To be sure I have attached the whole output starting from
'./configure'....

Thanks

-simon

It is the fault of xmms.  After startup, xmms explicitly asks not
to be sticky by using the GNOME hints.  Fvwm honours this request,
but if you 'recapture' the window, xmms will not notice that it
has become sticky now.  The reason why this problem appeared now
is that the default has been changed to compile in GNOME support
into fvwm by default.  If you want the old behaviour you can
compile fvwm without GNOME support:

  $ ./configure --disable-gnome
  $ make
  $ make install

Please send a bug report to the xmms developers.  The application
definitely should not try to override the preferences of the
window manager's user.  xmms does not handle stickyness of its
windows, so it really should not touch this setting.  There are
a lot of GNOME compliant window managers that xmms will not
cooperate with nicely.

Bye

I think I have fixed this.  Please fetch the latest development
snapshot from http://fvwm.org and try again.  (look for the word
'snapshot' on our downloads page).  Please tell me if this fixes
your problem.

Subject: delayed popup of windows that were withdrawn

Full_Name: Alexander (Leo) Bergolth
Version: 2.3.20, 2.3.21
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux-2.2.16
X_Server: XFree86-3.3.6
Submission from: (NULL) (137.208.16.90)


When I use withdraw in a Tcl/Tk (or Perl-Tk) script to hide a window and
redisplay it later using deiconify and raise (or Popup), the window
becomes
visible immediately but it's contents are drawn 2 or 3 seconds later.
Without withdraw, the contents appear without delay.

The problem only appears in fvwm-2.3.x, 2.2.4 works fine.

Here is a small script that shows this behavior.

---------- snipp! ----------
#!/usr/bin/wish

wm withdraw .
button .b -text OK -command { exit }
pack .b
update
wm deiconify .
raise .
---------- snipp! ----------

Cheers,
--leo

I just implemented a GNOMEIgnoreHints style.  With the next beta
(2.3.22) you can disable GNOME hints for specific windows:

  style XMMS GNOMEIgnoreHints

This works without recompiling fvwm.

This is no bug but exactly what was intended.  I could see this
exact "problem" too a while ago, but with gimp 1.1.18 it is gone.          
    I do not know how, but the gimp developers found a way to resize       
        the maximized window, so I recommend to simply upgrade your gimp   
            for now.  In the future we will probably implement some styles 
                specifically allowing or disallowing the program or the
user to                 move or resize windows.

I have tried to reproduce this again with xppaut4.55 (I could
not compile 4.01 on LINUX) and saw something similar, but only
with the main window (the one with the graph). When I moved other
windows over it, they erased the graph itself, but not the
buttons or the text. With the latest beta versions (2.3.x) you
can try to turn on backing storage for this window:

  style *XPP* BackingStore

With modern graphics cards this slows down drawing of the XPP
window dramatically, but it works for me (you have to restart
XPP before the style works). Unfortunately XPP fails to set
a common class or resource on its window, so you have to set this
style for all its windows individually if you have problems with
other windows:

  style "Data Viewer" BackingStore
  style "Initial Data" BackingStore
  ...

Overall, XPP's Expose event handling seems to be badly broken.
Please consider reporting this to the xpp developers (and suggest
to give all xpp windows a common resource and class name too).

Are you sure about that change in gimp? I am currently using
1.1.25 (which is the latest released version) and had tried most
of the preceeding versions (including 1.1.18) too - I couldn't
see any change with regard to that matter. (I had sent a bug
report to the gimp developers, but AFAIK, nobody addressed that
issue)

I personally am certainly eagerly waiting for this feature :-)

Is there maybe some simple patch to revert fvwm to the old
behavior?

Regards,
               Peter

Hm.  I've tried it again, and gimp does not even try to resize
the window in the conventional way by XResizeWindow() or
XMoveResizeWindow().  I don't know how it does this.  If it
tried that, fvwm would still prevent it.  Gimp does not use
GNOME hints either, so at the moment I have no idea how gimp
does it.

The patch is simple:

Around line 1955 in events.c you will find this code:

    /* dont allow clients to resize maximized windows */
    if (!IS_MAXIMIZED(Tmp_win) || (!dw && !dh))
    {
      if (IS_SHADED(Tmp_win))
	get_shaded_geometry(Tmp_win, &new_g, &new_g);
      SetupFrame(
	Tmp_win, new_g.x, new_g.y, new_g.width, new_g.height, False);
    }

Simply remove the condition so that the code is executed
unconditionally:

    if (IS_SHADED(Tmp_win))
      get_shaded_geometry(Tmp_win, &new_g, &new_g);
    SetupFrame(
      Tmp_win, new_g.x, new_g.y, new_g.width, new_g.height, False);

This will do the trick.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

... and it did, indeed. 

Thanks a bunch :-)

Hi,

1 - Since Ultrix doesn't have strdup I made the following patch.

2 - /bin/sh doesn't have 'unset' command, then I must replace it by ksh in 
configure script. But i don't know how patch configure.in to do that.

Bob.

Duh.  Every /bin/sh should have unset.  That ist something the
autoconf developers should know.

Not so; early versions of sh didn't have unset.  It was added later.

The autoconf developers _do_ know, that's why you don't see unset used
in any autoconf-generated code.

However, there are a bunch of unset's in the configure.in script, and
that's where this problem is coming from.

I think I finally fixed all the focus problems bugs w/ xview
applications.  Everything works fine with any focus policy
for me.  I can't address the mailtool problem though since
I don't have a Linux version (if there is any).

Okay, so what do we do about that?  I found this comment in
configure.in:

  dnl Using 'unset' is said to be unportable, but setting to null is
  dnl not enough to avoid using the cached value!

  unset ac_cv_header_X11_xpm_h

Warning, this is untested.  How about something like:

UNSET=unset
x=`unset x 2>&1`
case $x in
  *not*found*)
    UNSET=true
  ;;
esac

$UNSET ac_cv_header_X11_xpm_h


If the logic requires the variable to be set to null, a leading and
trailing $UNSET might do the trick.

Just so my work isn't unnecessarily duplicated,
I've got a "70% done" conversion script for converting the
2.2 .fvwm2rc to 2.4.

It might be a while longer before I get to check it in.

This may only fix syntax errors, but the logic will not remain the same.
Ok, I will do this tomorrow together with other configure.in things.

UNSET=true
if unset UNSET 2>/dev/null; then UNSET=unset; fi

So, on some old systems rerunning configure will use the cached values...

Mikhael.

Why don't you dump it in cvs right now so that others can see
what you have done already and possibly help with the work, Dan?

We discovered some problems with monochrome screens after the
2.2.x releases.  They are already fixed in the beta versions.
Try out the latest 2.3.x release please. If this does not help
please tell us what the problems are exactly.

Hmm yeah, on 2.3.20 the colors are ditchered (or should that be
rendered?) properly ( In 2.2.4 the frame around xterm and as well
as titel bar were all black ). However I had other problems with it
like 
	-at top of the xterm I would just have title bar only, no
	 buttons to resize, no menu, etc at all, just title bar.
	- for some reason I just got only one big virtual desktop 
	  bigger than my screen, instead old style several virtual
	  screens of size of monitor.

I don't know, mabye it was a new config, mabye it was a bug 
or something else

Adam
btw: I just discovered ctwm and it looks quite nice on BW monitor and
seems to have all the nice features.

message means that tha application has asked to be no smaller
than 368x490 and no bigger than 0x490 pixels.  This is of
course impossible.  Please report this to the developers of
the offending application.  Otherwise you can safely ignore
this warning: fvwm will work properly with the window.

Bye

% make dist2  # or distcheck2

builds both tar.gz & tar.bz2. You can update make_fvwmdist.sh if you wish.

% make release=1 rpm-this

builds rpm from the previously created source tarball if you have all rpm
building software (rpm-build). This should work ok for a home usage.

But creating rpm's which will actually work for many users and different
distributions are not trivial. I hope it is possible to create one rpm
(or two: one src and one i386 binary) good for all RedHat/Mandrake/SuSE
and like, otherwise it is not worth it.

Whoever creates the rpm package should have a stock distribution made
totally (mostly) from rpm's. RedHat 6.2 is most prefered as a standard,
but SuSE can probably also do the work, I can't say yet. This person
should have a root to at least test installing/uninstalling of the rpm he
made. He should decide which feature to compile-in. For example if the rpm
is compiled with GNOME libs, all users should install GNOME libs first
before installing the fvwm rpm.

I think the rpm should include support for: GNOME hints (no problems
here), stroke (there is one rpm for stroke 0.4), GTK & Imlib (for FvwmGtk
menus and dialogs, there are enough GTK rpm's, just hoping they are
compatible), rplay (there are rpms around), but without GNOME libs.

So, for now I would suggest you not to create rpm yourself unless you
really want to deal with all these issues, but have someone, who will be
responsible for creating rpm from the source tarballs you release. I can
start with it, but if someone has a knowledge in creating rpms and a
desire to do it and fix user problems, he can freely take it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You can either strip the executables after building fvwm:

  $ cd <installation directory>
  $ strip *
  (ignore error messages)

Or you can specify the compilation flags manually:

  $ make CFLAGS="O2"

O2 turns on optimization.  If you do not use gcc the flag
may be different.

Well, this looks as if you do not have installed the X header
files.  Symbols like XK_Page_Up *must* be defined to compile
fvwm.  Perhaps someone who knows Ultrix better than I can give
you some hints here.

There is a note about this in INSTALL.fvwm (worth reading), it suggests:

  make -k install-strip

The last section of this file should be redone. I can take a look later.

Ah, but didn't install-strip fail because it tries to strip
shell scripts?

CFLAGS="-O2" means gcc will compile with these flags. The default is
usually "-g -O2". If you have a modern CPU, it is possible to specify much
better optiomizations than -O2, see gcc man page.

'make install-strip' is the same as 'make install', but 'install -s' is
used instead of 'install', so all installed programs are stripped.

'make -k install-strip' (note -k flag) means that make should continue
even after errors - strip will fail on shell scripts, but with -k it's ok.

Mikhael.

I rewrote readline/termcap/ncurses detection code once again.
There are now --with-termcap-library and --with-ncurses-library
options. It is now possible to specify something like:
  --without-termcap-library --with-ncurses-library=/path/to/libdir-or-lib

Just to understand better how it works, --with-termcap-library=no and
--with-ncurses-library=no are equavalent to --with-readline-library=no.

Please get a daily snapshot and check how configure works for you now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is the fvwm CVS setup documented somewhere? I would like to add
similar CVS commit -> mail interface to my project, and would rather
like to avoid rewriting the stuff.

The scripts I hacked up are on the FTP site in /pub/fvwm/cvs.  Feel free to

I have created initial rpm's for fvwm & fvwm-themes for your testing.

  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/rpm/

Please read README, it probably answers many questions.

Both fvwm & fvwm-themes were build some hours ago from their current CVS,
this is reflected by 2.3.22-0.2000MMDD version-release numbers, the final
version rpm will have an integer release number, like 2.3.22-1.

fvwm was compilled without -g flag, so no debug info, this saves about 7M.
Both rpm's were created on RedHat Linux 6.2 by 'make rpm-dist' (I will
commit some changes soon). The prefix is /usr/local.

Please everyone who tried to install these rpm's write to me to say
whether it was a success/failure, specify your distribution and problems
if any. The more input I will get the more I can do to fix problems.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Description:
	I updated Fvwm to the latest version on CVS (2.3.22) and now 
	when I log in using GDM, Fvwm first starts quite ok, but then 
	(about when panels appear, the delay between Fvwm startup and 
	appearance of other applications launched by GNOME session is 
	oddly quite long) Fvwm crashes. There's some flicker suggesting 
	that Fvwm might try to manage some window, but fails. Log files
	reveal following errors (the icon warnings are caused by Debian 
	menu-package generated menus):

	Manually restarted fvwm seems to work fine. Also previous Fvwm
	versions worked quite ok (although the odd, slow GNOME session
	startup has been there earlier too).

Repeat-By:
	I'm running the latest Helix GNOME packages for Debian and programs
	started automatically are: unclutter, swisswatch, gmc and two GNOME 
	panels. First, screenwide bottom panel contains in addition to 
	some program launcher icons, menu and logout buttons following 
	applets: 
		- Sound Monitor
		- Mixer
		- Mini-commander
		- Fish 
		- Odometer
		- CPU and memory monitors
		- Clock
	The other panel is auto-hide enabled floating panel (and I think
	therefor more suspious for causing these problems I'm experiencing).
	It contains some launchers, network monitor and weather applet.

Couple of things about the mail archive search:

 1) If you don't restrict the search to any months, it starts with the
    earliest month in the archive; I guess I would think it would be
    more useful to start with the latest month and go backwards; hits
    near the end are more likely to be interesting than hits near the
    beginning (in 1995 or whatever).  Anyway, it would be nice if there
    were an option to do this (search backwards).

 2) Restricting the search to just some months doesn't work; it never
    matches anything.  I searched for "gnome", selected all the months
    in 2000, picked the "restrict matched files" button, and got back 0
    hits, which I _know_ isn't right :)

OK, I could have sworn I'd saved an email from the list on how to do
this, but I can't find it, and (as per my previous mail) my efforts at
searching the archives are proving frustrating.

Also, I don't find anything in the latest FAQ, etc. about it... are we
really missing this documentation from the distribution, or can I just
not find it?

Anyway, I'm trying to get used to Gnome, to see what it can do.  I just
can't get used to E or sawfish, though, I'm missing too much of my fvwm
functionality (Forms and FvwmButtons in particular) and I can't find
functionally equivalent alternatives.  So, I want to try to use FVWM
from within Gnome.

If someone gives me some pointers on the magic needed to get Gnome to
see fvwm as a window manager that can be picked from the list, and/or
otherwise integrated, I'll try to write something about it down
somewhere (the FAQ?) and submit it.

Submission from: (NULL) (165.228.131.12)


We have some Java code which uses alot of modal transients
(java.awt.Dialog).  When the first transient pops up, it is given focus as
expected (Style * GrabFocusTransient).  Subsequent transients, however, do
not get focus, even if the Java code explicitly requests it.

We're using Sun's Linux JDK version 1.3.0beta_refresh.  As far as i know
it's the latest refresh (b09 JDK with b07 HotSpot).  Here is a bit of code
which shows the problem:

import java.awt.Dialog;
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.TextField;

import java.awt.event.KeyAdapter;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

public class transbug {

  private static Frame f;
  private static Dialog d1;
  private static Dialog d2;
  private static TextField tf;
  private static TextField td1;
  private static TextField td2;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    f = new Frame("Frame");
    tf = new TextField("F1 to open Dialog 1");
    tf.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
      public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F1)
          d1.show();
      }
    });
    f.add(tf);
    f.pack();

    d1 = new Dialog(f, "Dialog 1", true);
    td1 = new TextField("F2 to open Dialog 2");
    td1.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
      public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F2)
          d2.show();
      }
    });
    d1.add(td1);
    d1.pack();

    d2 = new Dialog(f, "Dialog 2", true);
    td2 = new TextField("F3 to exit");
    td2.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
      public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F3) {
          f.hide(); d1.hide(); d2.hide(); System.exit(0);
        }
      }
    });
    d2.add(td2);
    d2.pack();

    f.show();

  }

}

Yes, searching mail archives sometimes is not very effective.
For example "GNOME; Mikhael" returns much more than 50 results, so the
last one is from 11/1999. "Mikhael; GNOME" returns only 35, but it is
obviously incomplete. Here are some URLs, which can help you to write FAQ,
there are more, probably, but you should try to search yourself.

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0005/msg00523.html
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0008/msg00144.html

You can also read about gnome and session managers in the fvwm-themes FAQ.

In short, there are 2 choices. The second was reported to be slow now,
also there are some artifacts with it.

1) Running pure GNOME-compilant fvwm, not on top of GNOME.
   -------------------------------------------------------
Just call fvwm2 in your ~/.Xclients or ~/.xinitrc. Use GNOME apps freely.

2) Running fvwm as a GNOME window manager (while running gnome-session).
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to the "System menus/Settings/Desktop/Window Managers" gnome panel
foot menu and create an entry for fvwm. Choose it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

1) Does the crash leave a core file?  If yes, can you please fetch
us a stack trace?

  $ gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

2) Does it crash if you put this line in your config file?

I just wanted to start debugging the problem with WINCH signals
that Neil Zanella reported a while ago.  But I actually can't
find any documentation about this other than the signal(7) man
page (Linux) which states:

  SIGWINCH    28,28,20     B      Window resize signal (4.3 BSD, Sun)

I need a bit more information that this :-)

About the crash. I've got also such a crash when I start certain app
(kfm). This is caused by the recent change:

gnome.c line 871 (GNOME_ProcessClientMessage):
 if (DO_IGNORE_GNOME_HINTS(fwin))

if I replace this line by 

if (fwin == NULL || DO_IGNORE_GNOME_HINTS(fwin))

No more crash. I've commited this.

About the timeout. The timeout is not present with 2.3.10
and it is here with 2.3.13. Not yet try 2.3.11 and 12.

Still crashes, although the lines containing error message
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 2, EventType: 33
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
have disappeared from log file.

While doing 'cvs diff -r version-2_3_10 -r version-2_3_13 session.c' (a
very long listing), I have memorized one surprising change (not mine) -
a new empty function, but I had no time then to investigate this.

Ok, I have fixed this bug and thus timeout. Your info helped a lot.

Mikhael.

Subject: Use of Next/Prev

Full_Name: Abigail
Version: 2.2.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux, kernel 2.2.13
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (216.112.175.67)


I am trying to cycle through all the non-iconified windows on the current
page, with an action bound to a key; and when cycling, I want the cursor
and keyboard focus in that window.

The following worked for me on Solaris 2.4 through Solaris 7 (but that was
a while ago, and cannot recall the fvwm version; probably 2.0.x):

    key F3 A N Next [!Iconic, !Sticky, CurrentPage] WarpToWindow 50 50
    key F4 A N Prev [!Iconic, !Sticky, CurrentPage] WarpToWindow 50 50

Unfortunally, it doesn't cycle. When using 'Next', it will go through a
few windows, and then it "gets stuck", that is, not pick a next window to
warp to. When using 'Prev', it will just flip back and forth between two
windows.

This does work though:

    key F3 A N Next [*] Focus
    key F4 A N Prev [*] Focus

at least, kind of. It cycles through all windows, but it does have a 
preference for windows that are under the cursor. Each time it flips
from one page to another, the window that's underneath the cursor will
be the next one to get focus.

This is reproducable with the current CVS (2.3.22) even with SloppyFocus.
Of course it does not work (and should not work) with ClickToFocus at all.
I can't say now whether this behaviour is a bug or not, probably not.

Anyway, you should not expect fvwm to give focus to windows on Next/Prev,
this is critical for Next/Prev to work, so better give focus explicitely.
The following should work for you:

  Key F3 A N Next (!Iconic, !Sticky, CurrentPage) SelectWindow
  Key F4 A N Prev (!Iconic, !Sticky, CurrentPage) SelectWindow

  AddToFunc SelectWindow
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

Mikhael.

I use SloppyFocus for xterms, and FocusFollowsMouse for the rest.

That works, except that if you quickly hit F3 or F4 a few times, it takes
a second or two to go to the next window. Let me study the manual to see
whether I can avoid that.

Seems to have fixed it for the moment, but I'm sure now that I've said
that I will be plagued again.

I think fvwm's role in this is limited.

>From the Solaris termio(7) man page:

     TIOCSWINSZ
           The argument is a pointer to a winsize structure.  The
           terminal  driver's  notion of the terminal size is set
           from the values specified in that  structure.  If  the
           new sizes are different from the old sizes, a SIGWINCH
           signal is set to the process group of the terminal.

>From the rxvt command.c file:

/*
 * Tell the teletype handler what size the window is.
 * Called after a window size change.
 */
static void
tt_winsize (int fd)
{
   struct winsize ws;

   if (fd < 0) return;

   ws.ws_col = (unsigned short) TermWin.ncol;
   ws.ws_row = (unsigned short) TermWin.nrow;
   ws.ws_xpixel = ws.ws_ypixel = 0;
   ioctl (fd, TIOCSWINSZ, &ws);
}

As long a the terminal program is notified by fvwm of the window size
change, its up to the terminal program to send the sigwinch signal.

Not that I've ever seen I've been doing make install-strip for over a
year, but the make -k says to ignore failures so even if it did try to
strip a script make would keep going.

The second seemed the most obvious, so that's what I started with so
far.  I haven't noticed it being particularly slow?

Anyway, I have a lot of questions; thinks kinda sorta work but not
really.

 1) Can I get the GNOME panel pager to work with FVWM?  It comes up with
    the right number of pages visible depending on what I set
    DesktopSize to, so at least that far it's OK.

    But, clicking on the "other" pages in the GNOME panel pager doesn't
    do anything; my viewport doesn't move.

    I checked the Advanced properties for the GNOME panel pager and
    selected all the WM workarounds checkboxes (before I was using
    sawfish so all of them except "Window manager expects pager to
    modify area+desktop properties directly" were already selected; I
    selected that one too but it didn't make any difference).

    Can I use this, or not?  If not, what do I do?  Swallow the FVWM
    pager into the panel?

    Which brings me to my second problem:

 2) I can't seem to get the panel to swallow FVWM modules very well.
    For example, I added a swallow app for FvwmButtons, and when I
    created it it did indeed swallow the existing buttons.

    But, when I restarted FVWM, the FvwmButtons module obviously
    restarted, and when old FvwmButtons went away the swallow app on the
    GNOME panel disappeared as if it'd never existed, and the new
    FvwmButtons wasn't swallowed at all.  Also, when I log out and log
    back in my FvwmButtons isn't swallowed.

Is it possible to get FVWM to play footsie with the GNOME panel in a
reasonable way?  Or is there some better way to set this up?

Hmm, so I'm trying some different things to handle swallowing.

First, I added an "FvwmCommand FvwmButtons" as the exe command line for
the swallowed app (I do start the FvwmCommandS module and I can run that
from the command line and it works).  However, I can't figure out how to
make the panel invoke that command; I still have an empty section in my
panel and my buttons are free-floating.

Basically, the swallow functionality in the GNOME panel seems pretty
damn anemic.

So, then I tried logging in again.  This time, according to my error
logs, the panel came up and tried to run FvwmCommand before FVWM had
created the FvwmCommandS module; I got this error:

  No such file or directory FvwmCommand error in opening message fifo

So then I thought I'd try to change the start order of the panel and/or
FVWM to see if I couldn't ensure FVWM was up before the panel.  I looked
at the Session Properties list and FVWM isn't listed as one of the
running processes here!

Why not?  I thought all GNOME-compliant processes should be listed
here.  Heck, even rxvt is here!

Anyone have any ideas on this?

gnome is slow, therefore, running fvwm with gnome is slow ( at least, it's
slower than running without gnome)

I am using an older version of gnome, and (apart from the bugs in the pager)
the pager works fine with fvwm.  my version of the pager does not have an
option for wm compatibility, you may want to disable all of these settings..

fvwm should fully understand the basic gnome pager operations (min/max, 
winshade, sticky)

if you have mulitple desktops, use GnomeShowDesks <# of desks for gnome>
in your .fvwm2rc to tell gnome about these...I'm not sure if you need to
set this to 1 for the Gnome pager to work properly with a single desk setup
or not.

the only way I've been able to work out 'swallowed' apps with gnome is by 
comming up with command lines that gnome can run without knowing anything
about fvwm.  what I mean is...if you can't supply a command that can be 
run from the shell, gnome seems to have trouble consistantly swallowing the 
app.

what I do is use the fvwm pager (which I feel is nicer anyhow) in one corner
and put the gnome toolbar in another.

Good Luck,
-Matt

Here are several bugs, which I experienced trying to convert someone
else's config, and suggestions. I have no time to fix these now.

The script handles incorrectly the commands in function, i.e.
  AddToFunc func-name I WindowFont fixed
  + I WindowFont fixed
  Key F1 A SC WindowFont fixed

HilightColor can accept a space delimiter, not only a slash delimiter.

PixmapPath/IconPath delete dirs starting with $VAR.

Also, I think, it is preferable not to delete potentially useful commands,
like ColorLimit and ModulePath, but comment them in with a note who
commented them and why. But this is not very important.

Probably, the script could print suggestion to convert all found Read'd
files if any.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I have fixed a start-up timeout (about 20 seconds) two days ago.
Which setup is more obvious is not by itself obvious. I have $WINDOWMANAGER
line in my .xinitrc and before starting X, I define this var to be one of:

  "fvwm2 -f some-rc"
  fvwm-themes-start
  gnome-session
  xterm  # really useful

Similarly, I have several fvwm based WM's defined in GNOME: fvwm with some
config, fvwm 2.2.4, fvwm-themes. So I can switch between several setups.

Woops, it worked just fine some weeks ago, even in pure fvwm outside of
gnome-session (the first method). Something was broken recently.

There is somewhere my answer to similar question on fvwm@fvwm.org.
It is possible if you use tricks, but I don't really suggest to swallow
fvwm modules into panel if you use gnome-session. It is better if you run
gnome-session from InitFunction in pure fvwm, then you can try to
syncronize panel and modules using ModuleSynchronous. But even this is not
really suggested. Just run them in different corners like here:

For now, I've documented this as a bug.

Fixed.

I'd like to expand the var and check it against the builtins.
I think I have to change this to perl or some other language.
For now, I've documented the behavior.

Done.

Yep.  I didn't like the way fvwmrc_convert did message printing.
(With $TTY.)  Another reason to convert this to perl, or maybe its just
my unfamiliarity with awk.

Agree, probably awk is not powerful enough to help with all cases,
although there are not many.

I've recently switched window managers to fvwm2- I used the
2.2.4 stable release from www.fvwm2.org. Before switching, I
was a long-time uwm user (uwm is a *very* old window manager).

One thing I became very used to with uwm was the way that
icons could be created and dragged around on-the-fly. By
default, fvwm2 seemed to have the characteristic that if I bound:

         Mouse 1 I N Iconify -1

in my .fvwm2rc, the first time I iconified a window, I could drag
the icon into place while holding down the mouse button. If
I deiconified the window and attempted to re-iconify it, it would
immediately iconify in the previous icon location. To work around this,
I added an option to fvwm2: "IconForgetLocation". When enabled,
each time Iconify() operates, it re-gets the window's location, and
starts the icon there- just like uwm did :-).

I believe I followed the instructions in the FAQ for submiting a
patch- my apologies if I made any mistakes. Obviously, I'd love it
if this could be incorporated in future releases so I don't have to
maintain it myself. Please let me know if I've made any mistakes,
or if there's any additional material I can provide. In the FAQ,
it says "Be sure to read the answer to Q16" in 5.2 ("How do I
create/submit/apply patches?"). I could not figure out to what that
referred, so my apologies if I've missed something.

I made all my changes #ifdef JIMZ, and added -DJIMZ to Makefile.{am,in}
in my tree. I hope this doesn't cause any problems or confusion.

It looks like you were reading the FAQ that comes with 2.2.4.

The current FAQ is at http://www.fvwm.org.

In the current FAQ, the reference to Q16 was corrected to point to
point to 5.1.  (Wait, it gets worse.)

The answer to Question 5.1 includes this:

If you plan to write a patch, *please*, first of all fetch the
   latest development release from our web site.


There's more,  I suggest reading it.

> I made all my changes #ifdef JIMZ, and added -DJIMZ to Makefile.{am,in}

If-defing the patch isn't necessary.

I can't comment on whether the patch would be accepted.
I would guess we'd rather apply this as a "Style".

The other issue is that we are in hard freeze, since  we are trying to
release another non-beta.  (I think we  are close.) I don't think that
should deter   you  though.   The  icon  movement behavior  comes   up
periodically and some flexibility there is probably a good idea.

I think that now the crash and the delays are fixed.
Can you try?
On the other hands, I need to use

Style "panel" UsePPosition

so that the panel find its good position at startup.
(I think that this also "fix" the FvwmErrorHandler errors
but I am not sure).
Unfortunately, I've got problems with gnome icons: If gnome
is configurated to not start to a page on the left of the
desk (via "saving session"), then the gnome icons are
not on the good page ...

Hello,

Yes, when I used the glibc 2.0.7 and gcc 2.7.2.3 (RH 5.1) I've got
a few core dumps with inconsistent core files.
Now I use glibc-2.1.3 and gcc 2.95.3 19991030 (Mandrake 7.1)
and I've *no* core dump (and I try to get some ...).
It seems that there is something strange. So, I use dmalloc and
it suggests a few fix that I have applied. I think it will be great
if one (Dan, Brad ?) can run Purify with fvwm-themes. Reapeting
"load all a_theme" will do somethings similar than the test/purify
"script" but updated for 2.4.

I used the latest beta for fvwm-themes.

I got lots of FMRs and some UMRs.  I've trimmed out the duplicates.
If you'd like the complete file, I can mail it to you,
its too big for this list.
The first UMRs seemed to be caused by icons getting focused.
The FMRs came from the theme loading.

The theme loading never completed, I got one of those lockups that
purify is prone to when running purify in gui mode and trying to
purify a window manager.
