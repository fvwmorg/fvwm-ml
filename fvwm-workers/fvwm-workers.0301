I tried the later build (from yesterday), and that bug I was seeing before
is gone. 

But when iconifiying an xeamcs, there is a black background around the
icon picture (inside this is the icon picture provided by xemacs with a
grey background).
I think xemacs is not providing the black part. When running mwm there is
no black background. The part outside the grey background area is coloured
with the standard coulour of icons (a small band inside the icon border).

Perhaps there is a problem with differenr visuals?

By the way, I really like the new icon background feature.

No, I do not think so. I think you use the IconSize Style?  What's
happen is that the xemacs icons is a non monochrome icon without a
shape mask. The IconSize a b style copy the xemacs icon onto a black a
by b pixmap. I will fix this soon.

I got this message after seeing all files are commited:

2003-01-02 02:01:11 Exim configuration error
  group manager, referred to in line 209, was not found

This also may mean that there will be no mail on the latest commits.
In any case I will send a separate message on my last commit.

On the other hand I didn't get my message sent to fvwm@fvwm.org yet,
so this message I just type may disappear or be delayed as well.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I have implemented a new conditional command that is unlike all others
do not work on windows. Currently only several conditions are available,
but more useful conditions may be added.

  On (Version 2.6.*) Echo Ok
  Cond (NoMatch) Echo Not ok

As usual, these lines should be placed in a function for Cond to work.

InitFunction and RestartFunction now may be obsoleted, everything
could be done in StartFunction and the user chooses the order:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmBanner
  + I On (Init) Exec xterm
  + I Module FvwmButtons
  + I On (Restart) Exec play dzin.wav
  + I Module FvwmPager

Thinking about this, if I add SessionInit and SessionRestart conditions we
may remove even more special functions in the long run. Having totally 2
functions StartFunction and ExitFunction instead of the current 8.

Should I mark InitFunction and RestartFunction as obsoleted in the man
page and/or the code, or we need to support them forever?

Regards,
Mikhael.

The problem is that since 2003-01-01 fvwm/fvwm is feature freezed!
Yes, we do not get a warning message from Dominik ...

Dominik, are you still our maintainer for 2.5.x/2.6.x ?  I strongly
hope this. Note that we should fix a date for module feature freeze
and also a date for string freeze (for translation; this involves
fvwmrc discussion).

I noticed you worked very hard to fulfil this date.

I would not make dates holy, fvwm should be ready for the freeze first.
If we cut it on some date, it may be a set of random features not working
well together. Additionally, I see no problems if someone has plans (and
I wrote that I have my todo list, just didn't have a time to post it on
December) and asks for some additional time.

Since we did not really discuss the freeze date. I suggest to do it now.
Let it be January, 15 for the core? At least we have a time to think what
is missing.

I hope too.

There is also perllib, that I will decide when will be its freeze date,
I don't think it will be before March/April. It should be finalized as
API for 2.6.x and future versions and it is not complete yet.

Mikhael.

Here is my todo list. I tried to reduce it to only critical things and
excluded any new features.

  * Enhance M_NEW_PAGE packet as I wrote some time ago.
  * Move documentation from FvwmTheme.1 to fvwm.1 or create a separate
    man page fvwm-colorsets.1 (I prefer fvwm.1).
  * Rework WindowListFunc so it works under window content and does not
    need any window id parameter.
  * Complete FvwmWindowMenu, it is not ready yet.
  * perllib: add trackers and other planed things.

Renaming:

  * We have a lot of new commands/options/modules, rename some.
  * Finalize the MultiPixmap syntax, probably rename to Multi, since it
    accepts Solid and Colorset. I will write more on this.
  * Use Image for png/xpm files instead of Pixmap everywhere in user
    commands while still supporting both for now.
  * Remove Closable, Maximizable, Iconifiable as duplicates?
  * Finally decide what to do with .fvwm2rc (except for supporting it).

Fixing/testing:

  * Reproduce all core dumps (there are a lot!) and report them.
  * Post my list of bugs (there are several and much more to discover).
  * I don't think I will have a time to write tests, so please others do.

I would like to have the following too, but it is not critical for 2.6.x,
so it may be postponed:

  * Add fvwm-command utility (similar to fvwm-root, in C) as a future
    replacement for module FvwmCommand.
  * Enhance FvwmAnimate to accept pause/continue actions via SendToModule.
  * Add FvwmPlacement for 5-6 fancy placement policies requested by users.
  * Add support for absolute coordinates in CursorMove.
  * Add HueRotation (recoloring) to colorsets with help of Olivier.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I would like to get rid of one-letter variables in the long run, since
they are very problematic. Some, like $d, are not consistent with all
other variables, and they all conflict with $width, $right and similar in
module lines, so one-letter variables are not expanded in module lines.

By converting them to $[] variable we solve all these problems.

  $d      - $[desk.num]
  $w      - $[w.id]
  $n      - $[w.name]
  $c      - $[w.class]
  $r      - $[w.resource]
  $v      - $[version.line], $[version.num], $[version.info]
  $x      - we already have $[vp.x] for this
  $y      - we already have $[vp.y] for this

Any comment are welcome.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am not against this date. I will simply prefer a message from
Dominik. I think that date are important if not we will never stop to
add new features. As usual, freeze does not mean that no new feature at
all should be added (the procedure is no vote against it and 2 votes
for it). But we should spent our main fvwm time to test and fix fvwm
and to do some special work (e.g., config, better web page, new format
for our doc).

I've no objection against these changes. However, I think we
should support the one letter name for 2.6.

Additional practical problem is SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $c++; then one
letter variables conflict with perl variables.

I think it may be $[desk.n] for consistency with $[page.nx], $[page.ny].

I think I didn't add any breakage of 2.4.x syntax during 2.5.x.
The idea is always document the new syntax, but still support the old one.
I will also backport these variables to 2.4.x, so there will be no any
reason to use the one latter variables anymore, unless I see objections.

Mikhael.

The current colorset functionality is simply amazing, but I feel that
something is not complete. I am trying to see what.

1) Colorsets in menus.

We still don't have full ActiveColorset support including images or
gradients. And it would be nice to support Transparent in it similarly to
FvwmIconMan and FvwmButtons. I.e. it is possible to get active item
background by just tinting the normal background (a part of a big image).

Greyed items in menus may support the same things using transparent or
even non transparent GreyedColorset. It is ok with me if the
compatibility is broken and it should be marked Transparent to have what
we currently have. Unless there are technical problems to achieve this.
BTW, GreyedColorset seems to be broken in cvs.

2) Colorsets in window decorations.

I see small advantages in how windows ignore most of the things defined in
Colorset/HighlighColorset and use TitleStyle Colorset as filters for
different title states. But I think it will not be very inconsistent to
fully apply Colorset/HighlighColorset (not just fg/bg) and start
TitleStyle Colorset from non plain colorset. This way some titlebar
designs would not need TitleStyle at all, this includes half of the
current fvwm-themes themes. Of course this is not trivial, since it
involves the issues like different states and UseTitleStyle, but I hope it
is solvable. I think it is good to support Colorset/HighlighColorset
fully. If we do this, Main from MultiPixmap probably may be removed as
redundant (and I don't worry that this means a design with MultiPixmap
can't be done without colorsets). I think it also may mean that it is
possible to use Transparent and not just RootTransparent in Style
Colorset, but this is not really important.

Similarly to BorderStyle vus BorderColorset.

3) Root Transparency.

It would be very useful to have the following functionality in fvwm-root
using "-d -r" or similar option. Read the current random root background,
(re)create an image from it and then retain it. I hope this does not sound
meaningless. This way anyone who wants to use RootTransparent should run
one command and it would work regardless of the current background.

4) In FvwmPager it would be nice to have {Hilight}TitleColorset, the
current plain rectangle taken from HilightColorset is really not enough.

5) Colorset HueRotation (recoloring). Should be more useful that Tint in
some situations. Would be nice to have.

I didn't try yet different combinations of Icon{Background,Title}Colorset,
but it looks very good with nice tile.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, now it gets the correct background colour.

Well, we already have $[desk.name<n>], $[desk.width], $[desk.height]
and in the future $[desk.pagesx] or $[desk.sizex].

Besides, $[desk] is a valid shell variable, like "SetEnv desk bla-bla".

I do not think this is difficult to implement. Only the fg colour
from the GreyedColorset is used for inactive items and the full
GreyedColorset is used for the active one.

This is not possible in general. Why not just use fvwm-root to set
the root window bg? We may add jpg (and svg) support in the future.

Yes, this will be good. I do not know if I will have the time to
implement this. My Pager plan is to add

WindowActionFixed (Mouse x) Action
    causes the pager to execute Action when you click on a
    mini-window and this click does not imply a desk or viewport
    change

WindowAction (Mouse x) Action
    causes the pager to execute Action when you click on a

What is the formula? I do not think that this is essential.

What does this mean? 2 different colorsets used to draw the mini-windows,
will the title colorsets be used to draw just the title part of the
mini-window?

Just curious.

I hope this refers to ActiveColorset.

I don't think this will look correct/good.

You have a point that we need ActiveGreyedColorset too.
I didn't mean that only fg should be used in GreyedColorset, everything
including IconAlpha/IconTint/fgAlpha/Gradient/Transparent may be used.

I think I have a good solution for this that is also backward compatible.
We have one GreyedColorset that is a filter and forced to be Transparent.
It is applied to both MenuColorset and ActiveColorset (that itself may be
Transparent). I.e. the current

  MenuStyle * GreyedColorset 7
  Colorset 7 fg gray60

will work like it works now, but the following will work too:

  Colorset 7 fg parent, fgAlpha 50, IconAlpha 30

Image/Gradient/bg attributes may be ignored (because it is Transparent),
but Tint, if any, may be applied to normal or active menu items.

This (optionally) requires support for "fg parent", it may be useful
in other places too (FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan).

It would be more clean to implement this now. But it is OK to postpone it.

JPG is an issue because a lot of .jpg backgrounds that are compact (30Kb),
grow to 300Kb when converted to .png, regardless of a converter (xv, gimp,
convert). I am really puzzled by this fact. PNG has a good compressor.

But even if we leave the JPG issue, by default fvwm-root does not work
with RootTransparent and I think we will get a lot of user messages
wondering why transparent decorations or fast menus do not work. I think
it is reasonable to make -r default. Then a theme designer may always
suppose that RootTransparent is available. Or, like I suggested, he may
run fvwm-root with some parameters to ensure RootTransparent will be
available without forcing one specific backgound. I want to have a
solution to make RootTransparent work reliably.

I understand why two are needed, but I think that only first is useful,
the second would be somewhat confusing. A typical user may leave Mouse 1
for desk/page switching and only bind Mouse 2/3/4/5. So I suggest to have
only one WindowAction that is executed with a window context, so if a
user ever wants to emulate the second variant he may easily do it:

  *FvwmPager: WindowAction (Mouse 3) Menu WindowOps
  *FvwmPager: WindowAction (Mouse 2) GotoAndOnlyThenMenuWindowOps

  AddToFunc GotoAndOnlyThenMenuWindowOps
  + I GotoDeskAndPage
  + I Menu WindowOps

I don't know the formula yet. Do you always do tinting manually or use
XRender if available? Maybe XRender has something about HueRotation.

I may try to create the formula or find it on the web, but not now.

Mikhael.

They would be used to draw the title of the pager desks, not mini-windows.
Run this command to see what this may mean:

So it would be possible to use different colour for the desk labels than
the desk background (or use pixmaps as desk backgrounds and still have
coloured labels), that's pretty nice.

I was thinking about another feature for the pager. To allow to have an
extra border around the desks that could be given different colours for
active/not active desk.
This way it would be easier to know which is the active desk when not
using labels. It would also be possible to get a relief effect (so that
for example the desks looks like buttons where the active one is "pressed
in").

Yes, the look of a pager could be improved, the only problem is that if it
is only one solid colored line border it will not look nice. I think it
is pretty difficult to design a nice look that is also configurable.

It is already possible to have raised in/out look if you use corresponding
images. Not exactly what you want, but I am pretty satisfied with:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/tmp/migo-FvwmPager.png

I don't know myself what I would prefer to see in place of "Work" title.
So even if this HilightTitleColorset is implemented it is still not
trivial to use it effectivelly. Of course, it would be better to have only
"Fun" titles and not to have to work, but this is not an option...

I was thinking about using highlight and shadom from a colourset to draw
this border.
This way it would be possible to get both a flat and a beveled look.
Maybe the same thing could be done for the labels.
This way it would for example be possible to have the labels act like
buttons and have the active desktop surrounded by a distict coloured
frame.

> I think it

Yes, I agree.
For example, I like the look of "ov", the pager used by 4dwm in IRIX, but
something like this would be quite specific.

Yes. But the problem is that the size can in some cases vary. For example
if you use DeskTopScale and use workstations with different resolutions
(or buy a bigger monitor :) )

Yes, how about a new option:

fvwm --do-all-my-work now

Handling and drawing of such buttons does not seem an easy task to me.
Even without them, the pager has a bug now of not updating itself and its
resize hints correctly after DesktopSize command.

Actually, ov (Desks Overview) is a good example to see what and how.

  http://www.nekochan.net/albums/irix/IRIX2003.jpg

Probably my proposed [Hilight]TitleColorset may be [Hilight]FrameColorset
together with the option to configure desk view offset inside the frame,
so it would be possible to get the look of ov on this screenshot, but
without Menu/arrows/Global. Of course this means fixed-size images...
I would like to hear the Olivier opinion on [Hilight]FrameColorset.

Speaking about this screenshot, the framed icons are already possible.
Olivier, how about to rename IconBackgroundColorset to IconFrameColorset?

Not necessarily, there are high quality images that look good when resized
like on my screenshot. When I resize the pager two images are adjusted.

After five more minutes of thinking. You can already get what you want
if you swallow several pagers (FvwmPager 2 2) in FvwmButtons. You may even
add a menu button and put this FvwmButtons into FvwmScroll to emulate ov.

This is really needed. Useful in alchemistry to convert water to gold.

According to this page, the formulas are pretty fast (no trigonometry
functions for rotation, quite a surprise), as fast as Tint:

  http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ncs/color/t_convert.html

So, the rotation formula for HueRotation(r, g, b, offset) is:

  (h, s, v) = RGBtoHSV(r, g, b);
  h = (h + offset) % 360;
  (new_r, new_b, new_g) = HSVtoRGB(h, s, v);

If there are no objections, given the level of participation
lately, I think 2 votes are adequate.

Marcus, wait a couple of days, if nothing further is posted,

RootTransparent is a dangerous colorset option! The E method is a bad
hack: the E pixmap is an unprotected shared resource. This is very
bad, specially because the E pixmap may involve a lot of memory.

So, I think that -r must not be the default for fvwm-root.  User
should read the manual page. If a user discover the RootTransparent
colorset in the manual page, (s)he will be able to read under which
condition this colorset can work.

For fvwm-themes, you can always use the -r option if you want (but I
think that this is not the perfect solution). You may also create
fvwm-themes-setbg which may select the best set bg program and use the
appropriate option regarding the colors and colors-extra component.

Again, it is *not* possible (in general) to make a screenshot of
the root window bg.

Actually, in 4dwm (and mwm,dtwm etc.), the decoration (frame) is the same
colour as the icon title (follows active/inactive state).
So maybe there could be IconFrameColorset/HilightIconFrameColorset that
defaults to IconTitleColorset/HilightIconTitleColorset.
And a style IconBorderWidth that sets the width of the border, would
default to 0, no border, the current behaviour.

I think the default should be like it is now - no icon frame colorset.
Even if IconTitleColorset is defined.

Which one from the current IconTitleRelief, IconBackgroundRelief,
IconBackgroundPadding or IconSize do you mean?

I was thinking that the border comes outside of the icon background as it
is now. So there will be an inner rectangle corresponding to using:
Style * IconBackgroundColorset whatever
as it is now (including IconBackgroundRelief if not 0).

Then
Style * IconBorderWidth 5 (for example) will add a border outside the icon
background rectangle.

The question is if the the relief width of the border shall be the same as
the relief of the title. And what happens if a user sets the border width
smaller than the title relief.
Maybe when using icon borders, the relief shall be conbined with the title
relief. If you look carefully (xmag) on an MWM icon, you will see that the
border relief is 2 pixels wide but the relief lines immediatly above the
title (2 horizonal lines, one hilighted, one shadowed) is only 1 pixel
wide.
So the icon is drawed as one big rectangle with a 2 pixel relief.

I made a screenshot show this (icon.png)

I also made an image (icon2.png) show approximatly how a
Style * IconBorderWidth 2

would (possibly) look like with a relief of 2 pixels (inner relief of
border is 1 pixel), in combination with
Style * IconBackgroundRelief 1

I'm not sure what IconBorderWidth would do when not using
IconBackgroundColorset.
Should the interiour region still be transparent?

I see no problem in keeping the current behavoiur without IconSize,
though. Let the interiour region be as big as the picture (+ padding if
used) in this case.

Actually I meant: IconBorderColorset/HilightIconBorderColorset
(I used the term border below). Or perhaps it should be called frame?
And IconFrameWidth.

But I think since we have "BorderWidth/HandleWidth" for windows, it's more
logical to use the term border also for icons.

Is it possible to use the CVS mode in emacs to commit changes?
I'm wondering, since when comming in this mode, you are prompted for a
description for each file you commit. Will this generate an email for each
file?

Or is there some other way to do it?

I'm used to using Emacs for working with CVS, think it's quite handy.

Hi all,

Is the Perl subroutine FVWM::Module::readConfigInfo likely to
be implemented anytime soon?

SCoTT. :)

No, it is already removed in cvs and will be replaced by a more powerful
tracking mechanism once I have a time. Please be patient.

ConfigInfo will be just one of the several available high level trackers.
Other trackers will be PageInfo, Colorsets, WindowList, GlobalData etc.

Mikhael.

I used it for a while, but then gave up.
I'm sorry, I don't remember if there were issues with commit messages.
It was a long time ago.
The info seems to indicate it groups things up, but I'm not sure
how well it deals with multiple changelogs.

I think the upper case C which says it scans the ChangeLogs would
stand the best chance of working right.

I made a patch for IconBox before (adds options to set the title reliefs
for iconified/normal windows and turn off parenthesis around titles).
It never got incorporated before. But I didn't here any complaints, so I
guess it just got lost in the noise.

If there is no objection, I'll commit it now.

When looking through the Changelog, it seems my patch was commited.
Strange, because when I do cvs update, it marks these files as
modified. And doing diff shows the changes I made.
Maybe I need to delete the files and upate again.

If this is not the proper means of adding a "me too" note to
a bug report, let me know.

But I'm getting the same problem running fvwm2 on a sun blade with
solaris 8 as bug #958 in incoming.

the versions I've tried are solaris's preinstalled:

FVWM version 2.4.3 compiled on Nov 28 2001 at 02:05:26
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM

and 

FVWM version 2.4.14 compiled on Dec 31 2002 at 13:59:25
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM

which I built from source.

Is this a known problem (beyond these reports)?  Are there some
patches I'm overlooking?

Larry Johnson

I believe the ChangeLog got updated from the patch of yours
I applied.  I thought you were including that for some
prior patch you submitted that was missing a changelog.

Yes, the patch wasn't really applied, it seems. Good I saved the diff....

No, mail to the buglist is not good.

You can see the thread so far for this problem here:

Some colleagues of mine have seen this problem as well with 2.4.7 on a
SunBlade under Solaris 8.  Their solution was to upgrade the frame buffer
(PGX) to one that supports 3-D graphics.  If your Blade has a PGX (aka m64),
and if you run

    fbconfig -prconf

as root and _don't_ get

    Type: double-buffered FFB2+ with Z-buffer

then you're hitting the same problem they did.  My guess is it's a bug with
Solaris 8's PGX 2-D device driver.  From bug #958's text, it appears to have
been fixed by Solaris 9.  Hope this helps.

Since I have been having the same problem (crash while
moving windows, solaris 8, on a sunblade 100)

I recompiled fvwm2 as per the instructions below and induced
the crash (the crash is very easy to do and remarkably consistent).

Unfortunately no core file was produced (did a find / -name core)

Any other suggestions?  I'd like to help follow through on this.

						Larry

Can you compile fvwm with debug symbols enabled and fetch us a stack
trace?  With gcc/gdb:

   $ make CFLAGS="-g"

to build and then run and crash fvwm, locate the core file and run

  $ gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

Others may help out with the instructions for the SOlaris compiler
and debugger.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

So, it looks like a Solaris problem,  If you'd still like
to see if there's something that can be done on the fvwm side:

Either fvwm is coring, or its printing a message and exiting.

Check that you don't have core dumps supressed:

ulimit -a

make sure coredump(blocks) is a large number or unlimited.

Look for the stderr output from Fvwm.  Where that goes depends
on how Fvwm is started.  If you are using CDE, it should be in
$HOME/.xsession-errors.

I don't know what you expect Dominik to do.
I don't think he wants to be "maintainer", and he shouldn't have to be.
Anyone that puts code into fvwm should follow thru to the final release.

I think its clear that we have to stop adding things to 2.5.x
and turn it into a stable release.

For that, we need to make sure we have a complete set of features,
get the documentation up to date and create test cases.

I think I've seen  todo lists from all  the major players.   Just keep
publishing them.  (And try to make them get  smaller over time.)  Make
sure that test cases are part of your todo lists.

Hey, I know I'm not doing much development.  Maybe that qualfies
me to give direction.

I assume Adjusted is equivalent to Streched+Shrunk
but each option overrides the other?

What is the option to get it back to doing nothing?

My plan is to remove the unnessesay
"Closable","Maximizable","Iconifiable" and "AllowMaximizeFixedSize"
since they correspond to "!" variants of
"Unclosable","Unmaximizable","Uniconifiable" and
"DisallowMaximizeFixedSize"

Does it make sence to let the non-default styles be the only ones, and
have the opposite styles as the default?

I guess this should be done for all styles. But I guess this will be done
for 3.0, since it breaks backwards compatablility.

Also, I might add a "DisallowIconifyFixedSize" to complement
"DisallowMaximize" fixed size. But I guess this would also call for a
"DisallowShadeFizedSize".

Or maybe this better wait until after 2.6.

Could I cast a vote for NOT doing it this way?

You should keep "Closable" and discard "Unclosable", using "!Closable"
and so forth. All these attributes should be positive statements.

Likewise there shouldn't be any "Disallow*" options, just Allow*
and !Allow*.

This issue is entirely separate from what the defaults are.

No.  I *may* fix a few bugs, but other than that I do not plan to
spend much time on fvwm anymore.

Well, I see nothing that should stop someone else from setting the

I have heard this before, but I don't see where fvwm is involved.
Have you asked the xawtv developers about that?

There is some disagreement between some window managers and some
applications how the size/position a window requests is to be
interpreted.  I am deparately trying to find a solution that is
accepted by most window manager programmers, but things proceed
awfully slow.

The weak side of this is that a user has no any indication of what is the
normal window behaviour. Other than this I have no problem to name options
regardless of their default.

Use again IconSize without the optional argument

Style * IconSize [resize_type] a b [c d]

Style * IconSize Adjusted 54 54

Then

Style * IconSize 54 54

restore the "default". But I've not yet documented these new options
to IconSize.

The default is written out in the man page.  It is always the last
style of all the alternatives.  For example,

  !AllowMaximize / Allow Maximize

means that AllowMaximize is the default.

I have to say I've never realised this. Could someone (Dan?) put a paragraph break
after the words:

	options is a comma separated list containing one or more of the
	following keywords.  Each group of style names is separated by
	slashes ('/').  The last style in  these  groups  is the  
	default."

I know I for one missed this. My fault of course.

Maybe you missed it because it was deleted at some time.  I added
it again only recently.

Why is WindowShade not just called Shade?
I was wondering, because I plan to add a style "Shadable" to match
"Closable" etc.
"WindowShadeable" looks a little weird to me.
Is the command called like this to not confuse with shadows of colorsets?

Would anyone have objections about a style "Shadable"? I'm not sure if I
will add this before the feature freeze though. Since this will also call
for a conditional "Shadable" and possible a style "AllowShadeFixedSize".
And also a style "AllowIconifyFixedSize" should probably be added for
consistency.

I'd like to propose a name change of the style "IconSize" to
"IconPictureSize" or "IconBackgroundSize".
Since the size of the icon is really (IMHO) the total size of the
picture+padding+relief+title.
Also if (when) there will be an extra configurable border the name might
be misleading.
Since this style is new in 2.5.x I guess it would be possible to rename it
if considered a good idea.

Dominik,

  Just want to mention that I haven't forgotten your request
for a Purify test of windowshading.  I've put an hour or 2 into
building a test script and I think I still have quite a bit more to go.

  I know we have one from 2.4, but I assume you want the new
stuff tested.

  I can't work on this every day, so this could take a while.

Hi all,

I have an app (FvwmTabs module) that dynamically resizes a widget
causing it to grow/shrink & consequentially causes FVWM to resize
the window.

However, after I manually resize the window of the app by dragging the
borders, the dynamic-resizing of the widget no longer causes the
window to grow/shrink.

How can I get around this?

Thanks for any help/pointers.

SCoTT. :)

Full_Name: Bill Wilson
Version: 2.2.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux, Red Hat 8.0
X_Server: ?
Submission from: (NULL) (130.76.64.16)


I have used fvwm2 for years with Red Hat Linux (going back to Red Hat
4.0).
I recently upgraded to 8.0 and now when X windows I generate using the
Xlib
are covered, they are black when uncovered.  I was under the assumption
that
fvwm2 handled this.  Is that true?  How can I fix this.  My displays are
real time image displays and I don't want to regenerate.  What happened?

Sorry, this is probably not a bug, but I need help!

It sounds like the application is not repainting itself
when it gets an exposure event.

Fvwm 2.2.5  is very old.  Perhaps  you should start  by upgrading to a
current release.  The latest stable release is 2.4.14.

If you are still having a problem, seek help by sending mail
to fvwm@fvwm.org.

Hello,

Message-ID 865 is now in "enh. done", but was it actually implemented?
I can't see anything like that in the man page :-)

Regards,
Giulio

Hi, please send questions to fvwm@fvwm.org.

The enhancement is "done" in some sense of the word.

Its available in the 2.5.x beta series.
Search the 2.5.x man page for FONT SHADOW EFFECTS.

Hello,

I have a concrete proposition for improving FVWM documentation. This
has been discussed a number of time and I think that action is
needed. I am really agree with the last mail of Dominik on the
subject. I've just this mail in my brain but roughly speaking we need:

- The current man pages

- Improved HTML version of the documentation (better inter-link that
we have now with the man to html conversion).

- Possibility to have a printable version of the documentation.
  I.e., a ps and/or pdf FVWM book.

I think that what we need is SGML+DocBook. The LDP and numerous open
source project use this now.

So, let us be concrete. Attached to this message a tar.gz ball which
contains an experimentation: the conversion of a very small part of
the FVWM doc into SGML. The source are sgml files and utilities:

fvwmdoc.sgml     - a file to centralize all the doc
fvwm.sgml        - A SGML version of a very small part of the fvwm man page 
FvwmIdent.sgml   - Full SGML version of the Fvwm Indent man page
FvwmTaskBar.sgml - just the title for a SGML TaskBar doc
CommandList.sgml - A SGML reduced version of doc/COMMANDS (can be
                   autogenerated in an artificial way).
docbook2man      - a dramatic perl script that can convert the sgml file
                   that I've written to manual pages. This need some works
fvwm_print.dsl   - Config file for building the ps/dvi/rtf version of the
                   doc
fvwm_html.dsl    - Config file for building the html version of the doc
doit.sh          - A personal shell script to build the html and ps/dvi/rtf
                   doc
README           - Some useful www link

All the remaining stuff is auto-generated (but collateindex.pl which
comes from docbook-dsssl-1.77.tar.gz). Man page are under man/,
*nothing* is needed to build these man page but the ridiculous script
I wrote docbook2man. The html version is under html/; you found the
dvi and ps version under tex/ and the rtf version under rtf/ (all
these need DocBook-4.2, docbook-dsssl-1.77, jade or openjade and tex
for the dvi/ps version).

So try it! BUUUUUTTT please do not take to much attention to the
abstract and the 2nd paragraph of the Description section of the fvwm
Chapter. This is an other subject (What is FVWM?). I would like to
comment on this but later (at least an other thread should be started
on this).

I think that we can see with this small example that we can really
improve FVWM documentation by switching from man page to sgml. In
practice we should write the man pages using SGML+DocBook. Then, the
real man page should be auto-generated (as the man page for our perl
scripts are generated) using an improved version of docbook2man.
So from the point of view of the distribution nothing is changed:
the installed doc are the man pages.

The other versions of the doc will be build by a fvwm worker and put
for use (html) and download (html.tar.gz and ps.gz) on the web site.
Maybe, in the future, we can release an fvwm-doc-x.x.x ball together
with a fvwm-x.x.x release.

I need some comment before I do (or not) the full translation to the
new format.

Regards, Olivier

Everyone else has moved on to XML, using Norm Walsh's very nice
docbook-xsl stylesheets.

XSLT is a much better solution for this type of problem, and as a
matter of fact the docbook-xsl package already includes a man
page stylesheet.

Maybe I don't have all the facts, but using SGML seems like overkill to
me. Were it up to me, I'd maintain the fvwm documentation as POD (perl's
Plain Old Documentation). POD is a very simple format, and there already
exists many scripts for converting POD to useful formats like man, html,
etc. It's also rather trivial to write a perl script that will convert
POD into some other useful language, if the script doesn't already
exist. 

But, I'm just a big perl fan, so maybe I'm biased ;)

I also don't have a problem with the current state of fvwm
documentation... I just read through the manpage every now and then to
make sure I'm getting the most out of my .fvwm2rc ;)

There is not a big difference between SGML and XML (DocBook doc say
this). I will try it. I think that at the current step I just need to
change some path and name in the head of the source files.
But why XML is better than SGML for writing doc?

I will prefer to have our own tool for docbook to man. Reason:
When a doc update is needed the .sgml file should be edited and then
the man page should be generated (make manpage). Then, both files
should be committed and we may _not_ put the sgml files in the
distribution (just the manpage). If we use XSLT we should impose to
all FVWM developers to have all the XML/XSLT stuff (with the same
version). This is not reasonable (as it is reasonable to impose Perl)

For building the other formats (dvi/rtf/ps/html) one can use any
appropriate tools (jade or openjade or XSLT with the foo or the xyz
style-sheet ..etc.). Then we will distribute the best results.  We may
distribute the doc source and experimented user may build the doc with
particular features. This is one of the advantage of the SGML/XML -
DocBook stuff.

BTW, does XSLT allow to build tex?

I'm sorry, what did Dominik say?

Right now we have links to external places, for example, for
the libstroke package, and links to our other man pages, for
example the modules like FvwmPager.

I guess you mean you'd like to see links to other parts of
the man page, for example when it mentions colorsets, you'd like
a link to the colorset section.

I'd add, the ability to include images.
Some of the documentation talks about visual effects,
but there are no illustrations in our documentation.

A while back I suggested junking the man pages and
going to straight html.  There were objections so it never
happened, but I'm still not convinced that man pages are
necessary.

The generated man pages and html look pretty good.

However the .sgml is really hard to read. 
The markup gets in the way.
I don't know if I'd like trying to edit the sgml with emacs or vi.

The little POD that I've seen looked better.  But I don't think
POD allows for images either.

i suppose man pages could become pure reference instead of being
both reference & explanation of things.  then, man pages could point
to appropriate places to look for details.  something like xv(1) but
not as extreme.

that way, those who need explanations could be better served, while
keeping man pages light & to the point foe those who are familiar w/
fvwm syntax.

POD is easy almost like plain text.  it, of course doesn't have
facilities to include images.  of course.

how about LaTeX (or TeX) then?

I like a lot Latex. I wrote my PhD. Thesis with it and a lot of
papers. For me it is the best language for printing output.  However,
we need the doc under man page and html format and using Latex as a
common source for all these formats is not a good idea. Moreover,
Latex is not so easy (you do not need to learn XML/SGML/HTML but Latex
needs some practices).

Ok, XML is a subset of SGML. As XML is enought it is probably
better.

I think that POD is too weak. I will quote an old msg of Mikhael:

 "We already use the pod documentation format in FVWM in perl tools:

     * fvwm-menu-directory
     * fvwm-menu-headlines
     * fvwm-menu-xlock
     * fvwm-perllib
     * all perllib classes
     * FvwmPerl
 
  I would probably say more yes than no to use pod in all documentation,
  but I don't see a lot of reasons for this.
  Pod is pretty rich, but not as rich as the man page format.
  As for me, both the man page format and pod are easy to write and read.
  
  There are a lot of small things in pod (say, no center-justification in
  man pages) that I don't like, it is just not configurable enough. I myself
  even have somewhere a patched Pod::Man that fixes some annoyances, like
  converting "run fvwm(1)" to "run the fvwm manpage", but it's not an option
  for everyone to install it. Also fvwm-perllib fixes one bug in pod2man.
  
  There is no easy way to define a plain-unformatted-lines text without
  first padding it with at least one space, this looks ugly in SYNOPSYS and
  other places. This padding feature is often misused, for example the pod
  used in Pod::Parser class itself hardcodes the 12 spaces indentation,
  which is bad if the output is html, not just man pages.
  
  Of course if I would not be a pod fan, I would not create fvwm-perllib
  that uses it in several interesting ways."

- With the html version you will have a page which contains all
fvwm commands with a small description: as doc/COMMANDS in
2.5.5. Then, to get the detailed description of a command you will
just have to click on the command name. (With the ps version you
will have the page of the detailed description).

- With a man page you have in FvwmIdent "See the Module Command section
of fvwm (1)". With the html version you will have a direct link.

- With the html/ps version you will have various complete table of
contents and an "concept" index (both automatically generated).

- We may add images for a better explanation of some cmd.

- You will have the man page in the current form!

I send an answer to this message but it does not appear.
Maybe it was condidered as a SPAM as it contains html?
I try again ...

Looks pretty good to me.

I may write pod2xml convertor once I understand how it should work, so we
don't need to worry about the existing pod documentation.

If this helps, we may drop the current docs/ directory completely and
start a new doc/ directory with subdirectories from scratch.

Some text files (the current NEWS, AUTHORS come to mind) are only needed
to be converted to html and not other formats, so xml is not needed.
But this is not clear. As well as what to do (if at all) with fvwm.lsm,
DEVELOPERS and ChangeLog~s.

FAQ may be maintained as xml, it needs rewritting from scratch anyway.

COMMANDS.xml (or CommandList.xml) may be autogenerated from a slightly
modified fvwm/functable.c. I may do it later in a reusable way using
autogenerated perllib class and clean API.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Other window managers seem to call it Shade (some call it Roll).
I don't have a problem to rename it while supporting the old name.

[I am going to nitpick in this message.]

They are better to be called conditions, not conditionals (Next is a
conditional command). And I already added them to NEWS. Ok, I will fix
this together with some spelling.

Please use the same spacing + new line for the header ChangeLog line
like others do.

If your mailer allows, please configure it to add a header
  Mail-Followup-To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
to your messages to this list, so I and others with compliant mailers will
not need to remove your address manually when replying to your messages.
You will reduce a mail traffic after configuring the mailer this way.
In mutt it is just a line "subscribe fvwm-workers@fvwm.org" in .muttrc.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, thanks.  This was     a discussion about not  having    duplicated
information in the source code, man pages and  a proposed tutorial.  I
suppose using docbook might help with that.

The format is more regular which might make it easier to generate or
parse.

The massive amount of markup in docbook format makes it hard
to actually read the text.

I realized that XEmacs wasn't highlighting the document by default.
I made some adjustments and I got some of the stuff to highlight but
theres still a huge amount of markup in the file.  I see that
SGML mode has a command to hide most of the markup which helps, but a
quick test shows that you can't edit with the markup hidden.
(Stuff gets put in the wrong place.)

Right now I'd say that this is still a problem, but not a big one.
I'd guess after I get used to sgml-mode, there might be more benefits
than problems.

Yep, thats a great advantage.

OK, I'm convinced that POD isn't better than Docbook.


I see that Docbook supports images.  I guessed that we still
couldn't use images because we want to convert Docbook to manpage
format.  I haven't looked at the process to convert Docbook
to man, but is there some way to mark text in such a way that
it will not appear in the man page?  I'm thinking of:

<inlineimageref>
The following shows how a HGradient appears:
<image>XXX</image>
</inlineimageref>

(The whole inlineimageref section would get dropped out when the man
page was generated.)

Take a look at the thread which start with:

8 Aug 2002  Len Philpot  Documentation (was: Re: FVWM: How do I start modules automatically?)

For example Dominik wrote:

  "*Sigh* Yes, the documentation is one of the biggest open issues

And:

  "I'm a complete newbie inrespect to documentation formats.  Some
   basic requirements are:

    - Must be convertible to various other formats (man page, ps,
      html and possible GNU Texinfo) and must look good in these

    - The tools must works on any system and should run out of the
      box.  Everybody must be able to edit the documentation.
    - The format should be reasonably easy to edit without any tools
      other than a text editor.

I'm not convinced too that man page are necessary. But, I am afraid
that a lot of people will be very disappointed if we remove the man
page. Any way with my proposal you will have the fvwm doc with the
format you want (texinfo is an issue but there are tools which convert
DocBook to info; I just fail to setup these tools).

Note that "XML" is basically a subset of "SGML" and that both
look likes HTML.

I do not understand. Really, SGML, XML and HTML is very very similar
at the edition level and you say that you would like to use HTML.

let us take an example the ChangeMenuStyle command

Man page: 

.TP
.BI "ChangeMenuStyle " "menustyle menu ..."
Changes the menu style of
.IR menu " to " menustyle .
You may specified more than one menu in each call of
.BR ChangeMenuStyle .
.EX
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
.EE

DocBook (you may add more space in between lines):

<!-- next line has no analog for man page -->
<anchor id="MenuStyle">
<para>
<synopsis>
<command>ChangeMenuStyle</command> <parameter>menustyle</parameter>
<parameter>menu</parameter>
</synopsis>
Changes the menu style of <parameter>menu</parameter> to
<parameter>menustyle</parameter>. You may specified more than one menu
in each call of <command>ChangeMenuStyle</command>.
<screen>
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
</screen>
</para>

HTML (to get an hilighted synopsis command line):

<!-- next line has no analog for man page -->
<A NAME="MenuStyle">
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#D7C79A" WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD>
<B>ChangeMenuStyle</B> <I>menustyle</I> <I>menu</I>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Changes the menu style of <I>menu</I> to <I>menustyle</I>. You may
specified more than one menu in each call of <B>ChangeMenuStyle</B>.
<PRE>
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
</PRE>
</P>

So DocBook and HTML look similar:
<para> -->       <P>
<command> -->    <B>
<parameter> -->  <I>
<screen> -->     <pre>
<synopsis> -->   hilight the bg of the synopsis of MenuStyle

The advantage of DocBook is that the MarkUp's are "concepts" and not
direct formating instruction. So for example if you want to redefine
the way you hilight an fvwm cmd synopsis, then with DocBook you modify
a few line in the style-sheet file, as with HTML you should "rewrite"
all the cmd synopsis.

There is a big difference between man page and DocBook/HTML.  I will
just say that I do not like so much the lines of the form:

.IR menu " to " menustyle .

for me HTML/DocBook is better for this.

I am afraid that POD is too weak. I will try to answer to Rob Park on
this subject.

Take a look at the thread which start with:
  
8 Aug 2002  Len Philpot  Documentation (was: Re: FVWM: How do I start modules

I'm not convinced too that man page are necessary. But, I am afraid
that a lot of people will be very disappointed if we remove the man
page. Any way with my proposal you will have the fvwm doc with the
format you want (texinfo is an issue but there are tools which convert
DocBook to info; I just fail to setup these tools).

Note that "XML" is basically a subset of "SGML" and that both
look likes HTML.

I do not understand. Really, SGML, XML and HTML is very very similar
at the edition level and you say that you would like to use HTML.

let us take an example the ChangeMenuStyle command

Man page:

.TP
.BI "ChangeMenuStyle " "menustyle menu ..."
Changes the menu style of
.IR menu " to " menustyle .
You may specified more than one menu in each call of
.BR ChangeMenuStyle .
.EX
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
.EE

DocBook (you may add more space in between lines):

<!-- next line has no analog for man page -->
<anchor id="MenuStyle">
<para>
<synopsis>
<command>ChangeMenuStyle</command> <parameter>menustyle</parameter>
<parameter>menu</parameter>
</synopsis>
Changes the menu style of <parameter>menu</parameter> to
<parameter>menustyle</parameter>. You may specified more than one menu
in each call of <command>ChangeMenuStyle</command>.
<screen>
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
</screen>
</para>

HTML (to get an hilighted synopsis command line):

<!-- next line has no analog for man page -->
<A NAME="MenuStyle">
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#D7C79A" WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
<TD>
<B>ChangeMenuStyle</B> <I>menustyle</I> <I>menu</I>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Changes the menu style of <I>menu</I> to <I>menustyle</I>. You may
specified more than one menu in each call of <B>ChangeMenuStyle</B>.
<PRE>
ChangeMenuStyle pixmap1 \\
  ScreenSaverMenu ScreenLockMenu
</PRE>
</P>

So DocBook and HTML look similar:
<para> -->       <P>
<command> -->    <B>
<parameter> -->  <I>
<screen> -->     <pre>
<synopsis> -->   hilight the bg of the synopsis of MenuStyle

The advantage of DocBook is that the MarkUp's are "concepts" and not
direct formating instruction. So for example if you want to redefine
the way you hilight an fvwm cmd synopsis, then with DocBook you modify
a few line in the style-sheet file, as with HTML you should "rewrite"
all the cmd synopsis.

There is a big difference between man page and DocBook/HTML.  I will
just say that I do not like so much the lines of the form:
    
.IR menu " to " menustyle .

for me HTML/DocBook is better for this.

I am afraid that POD is too weak. I will try to answer to Rob Park on
this subject.

I'm going to move the CVS services to another host.  This should be a
quick operation, but it may take a bit for any cached DNS records to
expire.  If you have trouble reaching the CVS server for more than
about 15 minutes or so, make sure that cvs.fvwm.org is resolving to
129.7.128.22.

Once this move is completed, I'll begin experimenting with better
notification scripts and install an ACL system.  I'll be doing most of
this in a separate repository so things shouln't break while I'm
experimenting, but please notify me immediately if you notice any
problems.

Hello,

I used fvwm a few years back and really liked it. Now that I'm
back into a Linux environment, I can't stand the KDE appearance
and am thinking of trying to get fvwm on Red Hat 8.0, so have
downloaded the rpm's, etc from your site.

However, I would like to print various things from your site
- especially some of the text advice and so forth. But, your
pages are all white text on black background - which does not
show up as anything readable on my printer.  May I humbly
suggest that I am not the only one who has pointed this out to
you?

May I ask why you intentionally make it harder for people to
use fvwm ?

I say, just go into your browser config and force it to use black text
on white bg. If you have a half-decent browser, this will not be
difficult.

They print fine for me.  I'm using Mozilla.
I didn't do anything special to get the pages to print.
I've had reports that they print fine from Explorer too.

Are you claiming that others have reported printing problems?

Do you really think the color scheme was chosen just to create
problems?

Can you tell us what software you are using to do the printing?

You might get a better result from printing the man pages.

What web browser are you using?  Your browser should take care of this
and print the page as black text on a white background regardless.  I
suggest trying mozilla or a mozilla derivative.  (I would think this
were the default under RH 8, but heh.)

The windowshade test didn't produce any Purify problems.

There does seem to be an uninitialized memory read in borders.c:

Its complaining about
bg->pixmap.g.width and bg->pixmap.g.height.

The stack can start with Focus, CMD_Iconify, etc.

I'm using pine. 
I set the "Reply-To:" header for this list. I'm not sure if this is the
correct way to do it.

Mozilla doesn't do this as far as I can tell. It's VERY annoying.
Netscape used to, and I do all my printing from netscape.

The function border_get_border_background() is supposed to fill
the "pixmap_background_type bg" structure, but it sets only a

anywhere.

I would not myself put the mailing list address in "Reply-To:".
The best I may find about pine and Mail-Followup-To: is this link:

  http://lists.tendra.org/tendra-bugs/20021110/msg00010.html

I don't know how this suggestion is useful.

Accourding to http://cr.yp.to/proto/replyto.html, nmh 0.24+ understands
Mail-Followup-To:, but probably there is no way to set it.

There is a solution to set this header if qmail MTA is used:

It would be nice to be able to bind, stack, snap windows together, ala PWM
way (http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/screenshots/pwm-1.jpg,
http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/), also the way galeon and mozilla are
using tabs. (a more tunable SnapAttraction (with titles of windows at the
top)  ?)

thanks

bye

In CMD_exec, I can see no reason why  stdin should not be closed after
the fork() and before the execl().

The close solves the  problem with gmplayer,  and  it just seems  more
correct.

If there are no objections, I'll make the change in both branches.

Subject: KDE applications lock up during resize
Message-Id: <E18Z72z-0005e9-00@malifon.math.uh.edu>

Full_Name: Michael Smith
Version: 2.5.5
CVS_Date: Used source tarball
OS: Linux 2.4.7-10
X_Server: XFree86 version: 3.3.6
Submission from: (NULL) (203.221.83.42)


I run fvwm under xsession. I use some kde and gnome applications.

Two kde applications which had the problem were kpppload and konqueror. It
was most consistently seen with konqueror, possibly because its windows
tend to be larger.

During resize the rubber band would freeze (not resize further) and all
other window manager functions would refuse to respond. The rubber band did
not appear static, it may have been updating but with frozen geometry.
Perhaps this is a loping problem between the window manager and the
application?

I recompiled fvwm with --disable-ewmh (Extended WM Hints Support disabled)
and this seems to have fixed the problem for me entirely.

When FvwmAuto is invoked like this

Module FvwmAuto 0 -menterleave Nop Beep

it doesn't work, i. e. no beeps to hear. FvwmAuto isn't even started at
all. If you replace the Nop with something else, even a nonexistant dummy
function, it does work.

Fvwm Version: 2.5.6 fromm CVS

The !CirculateHit condition doesn't seem to work as advertized.
Consider the following .fvwm2rc:

Module FvwmPager 0 3
Style FvwmPager Sticky, CirculateSkip
Key F2 A N Next (FvwmPager !CirculateHit) Raise

The pager window is not raised when I press F2.
If I understand the manpage correctly, the !CirculateHit condition should
neutralize the effect of CirculateSkip. I tried various combinations of
CirculateHit, AcceptsFocus and whatever, but that didn't make a
difference. Only removing the CirculateSkip style helps.
Have I encountered a bug, or am I misunderstanding something badly?

This problem isn't really severe for me, I can work around it by dropping
the CirculateSkip style alltogether and adding a AcceptsFocus to all me
focus-cycling commands.

Best regards

Jochen

Normally all CirculateSkip windows are skipped, with condition
CirculateHit such windows are not skipped.

  Key F2 A N Next (FvwmPager, CirculateHit) Raise

Fvwm version: 2.5.6 (CVS)

Problem: the "Resolution" option doesn't work correctly with NumManagers > 1

Example:

	DestroyModuleConfig FvwmIconMan*
	*FvwmIconMan: NumManagers 2
	*FvwmIconMan: 1 Resolution !page
	*FvwmIconMan: 2 Resolution page
	FvwmIconMan

this should give me two nice IconMan windows, listing different things. The
two IconMan windows do show up, but the second one never displays anything.
No matter what "Resolution" I use, it stays empty. Other options work
perfectly - different colorsets, geometry - no trouble.

Resolution, however, seems to work only for manager no. 1.

Subject: FvwmPager icon move bug
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Spam-Level: 
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Version: Fvwm 2.5.6 (CVS)

Bug:
If I move an icon in the FvwmPager window (by draging with Mouse2 in the
pager window) the icon on the desktop moves, but falls out of sync with its
subtitle.

How to reproduce:
Just try and move an icon with the FvwmPager. With some luck(?) the icon
title will get misplaced, sometimes very far away from the icon itself.
There's even a chance of the icon itself getting misplaced.

Um, why do we have a plain Makefile in the CVS tree?  Writing a
Makefile.am is much easier and much more portable.

Good question. I just wanted to run that test, so I temporarily updated
the makefile. I guess it's not really that great to have a
"hardcoded" makefile.

Have to learn how automake works...

I looked at the content of the directory sample.fvwmrc, and found this
command bound to a mouse-action on a title button:
Replace

Just curious if someone knows where this command comes from, was there a
command like that before? And what did it do?

My fault.
Its been so long, I can only guess.
I think I was planning on replacing it with sed for testing purposes.
Meanwhile, it spread thru a bunch of my config files and made its
way into the source tree.

What we can do (and I experiment this) is to add aliases.  This
involve to extand the dtd and to preprocess the document with a filter
style-sheet. Currently:

<acronym>   --> <ac>
<emphasis>  --> <em>
<quote>     --> <q>
<command>   --> <cmd>
<envar>     --> <ev>
<filename>  --> <f>
<option>    --> <opt>
<optional>  --> <otn>
<parameter> --> <pmt> and <pr> (for fvwm parameter reference)
<userinput> --> <ui>
...etc.

and we can add
<fc>: for fvwm commands
<fcr>: for fvwm commands references (see <fcr>KillModule</fcr>)
<fp>: for fvwm parameters
<fpr>: for fvwm  parameters references

I think that smaller MarkUp may help reading/editing the source.
Also, we may remove from the dtd some the Markup that we do not want
to use.

Yes this is possible.

There's a small mistake in the FvwmIconMan manpage. The manual describes the
"ShowOnlyIcons" option, but it should be spelled "ShowOnlyIconic".
(FvwmIconMan doesn't know anything about an option named "ShowOnlyIcons")

I have a menu to sets colour sets. It runs a script that generates colour
sets (and also generates .gtkrc and sets X resources).
It used to work flawless, but now the colour is only updeted for the
active window. Changing focus updates windows to the new colour. And
restartting also works.

I have only used colour sets in 2.5.x, so I guess this doesn't happen in
2.4.x).

2.5.5 on Solaris 5.8

If I have in .fvwm2rc...

DeskTopSize 4x1

AddToFunc StartFunction
+	I Module FvwmPager * *

*FvwmTaskBar: DeskOnly
*FvwmTaskBar: PageOnly

AddToFunc GotoDesk_func
+	I GotoDesk 1 0 1
# work around Taskbar PageOnly bug
# +	I GotoPage prev
# +	I GotoPage prev

*FvwmTaskBar: StartCommand (Mouse 2) GotoDesk_func

then...

switching between desks ignores PageOnly and all of a desk's buttons
get displayed. Some even get displayed double.

Let me know if you cant easily repeat this.

Thanx

If it matters any, my FvwmTaskBar is actually...

As I learned recently, when I checked out the fvwm-web module
from scratch over my ISDN line, the fvwm-web module has become too
big (16.5 MB).  I think we should move the screen shots into a
separate cvs module.

Bye

A bit more details, would be good, for example the script, the
menu and the liens defining the window decoprations.

I think we discussed this many years ago and the consensus was
to use:

cvs checkout -l

for the main directory and then do checkouts in the
subdirectories as needed.

Is there some good way (from a shell script) to determine if a window is
iconified? 
I'm writing tests for the new Closable, Maximizable etc. styles.

xwininfo gives the geometry of the windows normal size, so there is no
difference when iconifiying.

I guess an alternative is to have an interactive script where the user is
asked wuestions interactivly.

This seems to work:

FvwmCommand 'Next (window1 iconic) echo "yesitsiconic"'

Maybe a tiny C program to check if the window id is mapped?

There are 2 small problems with FvwmProxy (current CVS version).

1. FvwmProxy seems to have trouble handling mouse buttons other than the
default ones.
If I click with the middle button on a proxy window, then FvwmProxy dies.

2. FvwmProxy windows get redrawn to frequently, in some situations.
The potential trouble can be shown with the help of xmms. When xmms plays
a song, it also changes it's title, once a second (because the title
containes the play time by default). Now if you have xmms playing something
while showing proxies, then the proxies will redraw themselfs every time the
xmms title changes (every second). This simply looks bad, but more
importantly: when the proxies get redrawn, the active (hilighted) proxie
looses it's hilight. It's rather hard to navigate between the windows if you
loose the hilight every second.

Maybe FvwmProxy shouldn't update the proxies every time some window decides
to change it's title?

Argh!  *Please* ask the xmms developers not to do this.  It is
asking for trouble.  They probably never thought of the icon
managers that have to do all the redraws too.  The window title is
no good place to display fast changing information.

Hi.
The way I see it, there is currently no way to turn off these horizontal
lines that are drawn on the title bars of sticky windows. They are mostly
useless if you use a titlebar button to stick/unstick (+mwm hints), and
sometimes simply look bad, especially on a textured titlebar.

Would it be possible to add new style options, eg.
"ShowStickbars/!Stickbars"? So that I could decide if I wish to see them or
not? Well, maybe not as an "style" option, but an attribute to TitleStyle,
like "flat" or "noinset" ("TitleStyle -- nostickbars" maybe?)

It's nothing really important, but would be nice.

Actually, I have planned to implement such a style.
But it will be after 2.6 is released, so mayby in the next beta series.

I also don't relly like the "stiples". Mostly windows I have as sticky are
"obvious" sticky ones, such as the pager, icon box, etc. I think it's
a little redundent information to indicate on stickyness on these.

Mayby as a part of TitleStyle is better, any more opinions anyone?

Umm, yeah, that kills it.  I'm not debuggable right now, but I'm guessing
ClickAction[PROXY_ACTION_CLICK+1] is NULL.  That would kill it.
I guess we're not setting all the buttons to "" by default.

If they can, they will.  If they don't, someone else will.
If I just get a M_WINDOW_NAME, we don't need a full rebuild.
Maybe we should avoid the Reshuffle under modest changes.
Perhaps a simple redraw of the single proxy would do it.

So how do you get this xmms thing to play a CD, anyhow?

Visually distinct sticky vs. slippery windows is one of the nice features we
got when we changed from fvwm95 to fvwm2.  The "ribbed" look is a plus -
it's a good visual discriminator for our users, even for the Pager.  A new
Style/Titlestyle is fine, but my vote is to keep the ribs as the default for
sticky's.

There is a way to turn them off:

Style * NoTitle

Oddly enough, all of my sticky windows are title-less.

Yes, I think the current behaviour is a good default.

Folks, after I get back in from dinner I'm going to start some work on
the CVS server.  The first order of business is to toss the commit
scripts we're using and move to something more recent.  The next step
will be to set up an ACL system.

This should all be pretty low impact.  It's possible that a few commit
messages will come out odd until I tweak things.

One question, however: I've hacked the new commit scripts to include
diffs up to a certain size, which I've currently set at 100 lines.
I've always liked seeing diffs as part of a commit message, but I'm
not sure how big they should be allowed to get.  Is 100 lines about
right, or should I go larger?

in 2.5.5 there is an option -- StippledTitleOff -- mentioned in
fvwm(1)...

              With the  StippledTitle  style,  titles  are
              drawn  with  the same effect that is usually
              reserved for windows with the Sticky, Stick-
              yPage or StickyDesk style.  StippledTitleOff
              reverts back to normal titles.


...but really doesn't work as expected (for sticky windows).  could
this option be reworked/reimplemented such that the option really
does what its name implies (for any type of title)?

100 lines won't bother me.

I hope you'll be bypassing diffs on the screenshot images.
I think most of them were checked in as binary.

I would not include any diffs, or we need 2 mailing lists, one for
discussions and one for the full cvs logs/diffs.

Probably such my preference is because I usually always see diffs (when
have a time) by issuing something similar to "cvs diff -D now | less"
prior to every "cvs update".

I am often very busy and I _really_ prefer to see one resulting diff of
the Dominik's work for several days than many small and sometimes non
relevant diffs, one fixing another. Also think about many messages that
just say "updated dates", "updated for new release number". Additionally,
if someone decides to reindent a file, this should not be a reason to skip
the changes done to another file, because of the size limit. So for me
auto-diffs are not a solution and I will continue to use my "cvs diff"
method anyway, so auto-diffs would only distract my attention.

Finally, one more argument against diff. In 90% of cases it is more than
enough to see the headers of commits. I am not interested to see diffs
when a function name is changed (in dozens of files), or changes done to
lex/yacc files (autogenerated), or translations, or some html and images,
or changes done to all man pages autogenerated from pod (by me), or all
autogenerated html pages. I want a short summary instead, just like now.
There are better ways to get diffs when one needs them. If we really
decide to polute this list with a non indexable information, we should
split it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yeah, it doesn't diff binary files.  I'm not really sure what a diff
of a binary would look like anyway.

Well, that's the longest discourse against something that you don't
even have to read I've seen in a long time.  The idea was to include
just a little more information when it makes sense; as you may note, I
currently have it limited to 100 lines of diff so it's not as if the
full diffs are always included.  I find that anything that saves me
the time required to go to a shell and type some cvs commands is an
improvement.  Especially for small bug and typo fixes where there's
little point in composing a long commit message that would end up
larger than the fix itself.

But hey, I'll certainly use it for my projects and if you folks don't
want it then I'll just leave the option off.

I suppose you'd argue similarly against including diffstat output?

StippledTitleOff youst turns off the StippledTitle option, exactly
as described in the man page.  It has no effect on sticky windows.

I completely agree with Mikhael here.  I am not interested at all
in the diffs 99% of the time.  In the past, I looked at the
diffs of a specific commit about two times a year.  And even if
the need arose more frequently, I would have almost certainly
deleted the commit message in the mean time.  I like the way we
have it now:  full comments in the ChangeLog, a good wrapup in the
commit message, and "cvs diff" if I ever need more information.

I don't agree with the last sentence, you may spend days to fix a bug
that results in one character fix, noone will be able to understand it
without a short summary. Replacing short descriptions with diffs is not
a good idea. I really prefer to see accurate mail messages saying
"* s/built in/built-in/" than hundreds of context lines of diffs.

Compare the current compact message of my last commit and the forced diff
of this commit that is 43Kb (!). Please do it to see what we are going to
receive with auto-diffs:

  cd bin; cvs diff -D '2003-01-29 11:00 GMT' -D '2003-01-29 12:00 GMT'

diffstat may be ok if its output has fixed size, I don't know.

BTW, did you plan to post full files that are added or deleted from cvs?
If no, the whole auto-diff idea is broken, not just annoying/useless.

To improve the usefulness of the cvs and mailing lists, I suggest
(actually this was suggested for a long time) the following:

  * have separate fvwm and fvwm-workers archives that are searchable
  * setup web-cvs, so any diff output in a nice colorful form is possible
  * put all scripts that generate auto-mails/snapshots into cvs

For example I always disliked that leading spaces are stripped from the
cvs log messages, I would be able to fix this myself. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not by intention. I don't see how else to express arguments against
something that you are fully convinced is not good.

Hmm, interesting interpretation, but I only thanked Jason in advance if
he does 3 listed tasks, nothing else. :)

Mikhael.

I would like FvwmTaskBar to show only programs on current desktop and
page.
After Fvwm starts or restarts, FvwmTaskBar works well even if switched
between pages, until I change desk. Then it shows me all programs in the
desk instead of current page. Sometimes, one program even has two items in
FvwmTaskBar. 
Is there another option such as DeskAndPageOnly? Thank you.

My configuration in .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmTaskBar: Font -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset 6
*FvwmTaskBar: UseSkipList
*FvwmTaskBar: PageOnly
*FvwmTaskBar: DeskOnly
*FvwmTaskBar: MailBox None
*FvwmTaskBar: StartMenu RootMenu
*FvwmTaskBar: FocusColorset 3
