Do we have a current maintainer for FvwmWinList?

I've cleaned up the handler for M_FOCUS_CHANGE, re-instating support
for the

*FvwmWinListFocusFore <color>
*FvwmWinListFocusBack <color>

options.  Currently, they don't work at all in 2.0.46.

There were some useful old comments lying around.  From them, I
believe that this code was replaced by some from the TaskBar -
however, the TaskBar code doesn't quite handle focus changes correctly
(according to the old code).

The old (commented-out) code was also quite convoluted, but it was
enough for me to get the idea of things, and re-implement the focus
stuff properly.  That's lead to a (IMHO) cleaner handler for
M_FOCUS_CHANGE. I think it's now clearer to read, understand and
modify in future.

While looking at the code, I also got the title centering stuff
working again; I believe it broke when MiniIcon support went in.

This means the *FvwmWinListLeftJustify option is now of use again,
since FvwmWinList now defaults to centered titles (as it was always
claimed in the manpage).  Note there's no matching
*FvwmWinListCenterJustify option - so once you've picked LeftJustify,
there's no way of overriding it.

My fix to the centering stuff makes lines with a MiniIcon left
justified, so the CenterJustify/LeftJustify stuff only actually
affects lines that don't have an icon associated.  The reason I've not
changed the behaviour for icon lines is that its not clear what people
want in the case of icon lines with CenterJustify - should the icon
stay flush left, or should it float with the title?

Anyway, I've appended the patch below.  It includes an update to the
manpage fixing one obvious cut-n-paste-o, and documents the
LeftJustify option wrt MiniIcons.

A few weeks ago I rewrote the style flags to use bitfields for the
core fvwm2 just to play around with it.  I'm just curious if there is
any interest in this.  I was going to wait for 2.0.47 to re-port it to
that, but I'm not sure how long that will be.

I came up with the following flag manipulation mechanisms (I had the
fvwm2 core up and running using these):

Test flag:

flag_isset(tmp_win->flags, title);

Set flag:

set_flag(tmp_win->flags, transient);

Clear flag:

clr_flag(tmp_win->flags, transient);

With some binary ops:

and_flags(ontmp, onFlags, fw->flags);
eq_flags(oneq, ontmp, onFlags);

The problem remains of sending the flags to the modules, one thing I
was considering was to have it just append a sizeof then the actual
byte data to the end of the message body.

I have written a patch for FvwmTaskBar which allows the following behavior:
  - Only windows on the current desk (including sticky windows)
    show up in the taskbar
  - When the desktop is switched, the taskbar updates to show only windows which
    are associated with the new desk

This allows the taskbar to be much less crowded, and I find this behavior to be
more useful than having taskbar entries for every window known to FVWM.

If there is any interest in this patch, I'd be happy to make the above behavior
optional and then submit the patch to the public domain.  I have two questions:

1) Is there any interest?
2) Who would be the appropriate person to send such a submission to?  I checked
   the source code, but none of the email addresses listed there exist anymore.
   I also checked the FAQ, which said that the mailing lists were the current
   forum for new code submissions.

Thanks for any info,

I don't know about everybody else, but I think a far more useful property
of a task bar would be one that only included iconized applications.  If
they aren't iconized, they are easy to find.

That's a good idea.  Here's what I'll do -- I'll add an option
like *FvwmTaskBarShowWindows which can be set to "All", "CurrentDesk",
or "Iconized".  "All" will be just like the current FvwmTaskBar module,
"CurrentDesk" will show only windows for the current desktop, and
"Iconized" will show only iconized windows.

When I'm done, I'll post the resulting module to this group.  Thanks for
the input.

fervent wish for the "perfect taskbar feature"... and I don't even think
it should be that hard, at least not the basic idea... but I'm not an X
hacker.

Subject: Fvwm Icon Manager enhancement
Date: Wed Jul 23 11:56:00 -0400 1997

OK, I've been playing with various icon managers, from fvwm2's builtin
iconbox and windowlist, to FvwmIconMan, to the task bar that fvwm95
uses, to tkgoodstuff's windowlist tool.

All of them are cool, but none do quite what I want.  I think what I
want would be most excellent (just saw Bill & Ted's again on Fox last
week :) so I'm asking if anyone can point me to something that can do
it, or is interested in modifying their particular manager to do it.

First, I have _tons_ of icons.  Most of them are of two basic types:
Emacs frames and rxvt windows.  There are some others thrown in for good
measure (ical, tkman, maybe a WWW browser, occasionally Frame, etc.)

The rxvt windows are also of a few discrete flavors: for example, we use
ClearCase at work and I have a specific ClearCase class of rxvt windows
that are set to ClearCase views.

I have so many icons they can't all be shown at once.  And I really hate
scrollbars in an icon manager; too cumbersome.

Here's what I'd like:

  * An interface like the 95 button bar where you get a button per task,
    then you click on it to raise/focus it, etc.

  * BUT!  It should be possible to define a _set_ of windows that would
    appear under one button.  Then I'd define one set for Emacs frames,
    one for ClearCase view rxvt's, etc.  And I'd get just one button no
    matter how many Emacs frames I had.  The set would be based on X
    resource class/instance names, of course.

    When you picked a button that represented multiple windows, you'd
    get a popup listing each of the windows with its title (like the
    fvwm2 builtin windowlist).  Then you'd pick the one you wanted from
    that list.

  * The button bar should have an option for hiding itself, like win95
    and the new tkgoodstuff can, where it becomes a thin line against
    the edge of the screeen when the mouse moves off of it, then
    reappears when you move back over it.

  * In an ideal world, you could also define actions for each set; the
    actions would appear on the popup above the list of windows,
    separated by a line.  The actions could of course be commands, fvwm
    modules, or whatever.

    Right now I have an FvwmForm configured to start ClearCase views; it
    asks for a view name and invokes rxvt with a command to set to that
    view.

    So, for my rxvt ClearCase "set", I'd want my popup menu to be
    something like:

        .________________________.
        | New View               |
        `------------------------'
        ' psmith_view1 @ lemming `
        | psmith_view2 @ bronto  |
        | psmith_view3 @ whaler  |
        `------------------------'

    Then when "new view" was picked, my FvwmForm module is kicked off.

Anyway, you get the idea.

I _dream_ about this interface now that I've imagined it.  Can someone
help? :)

        I'd like to propose an alternative to Austin Donnelly's solution
to the (more or less) reversed stacking order on Restart problem, which
eliminates the added overhead.

        I've uploaded the StackingOrder patch to incoming and notified
Jason. It should appear in the unofficial_patches directory soon. It does
three things.


        First, it adds a second set of chain pointers to the FvwmWindow
structure, which keeps track of the current stacking order. (Don't hit
me, please. It's really not as bad as it sounds!) So now Fvwm can easily
answer the question "who's on third?" at any time without doing a
Vaudeville routine with the server.


        Second, using this new-found knowledge, the Restart stacking
order problem is solved by a one-line change of the Reborder loop control
to something like

  for (t = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev; t != &Scr.FvwmRoot; t = t->stack_prev)


        Third, it restructures the changeDesk and MoveViewport logic to
perform a simultaneous bidirectional loop through the window list via the
new stacking order chain. Windows that are moving off the visible screen
are unmapped/moved from the bottom of the stacking order upwards, to
minimize expose/redraw overhead. Windows that are moving onto the visible
screen are mapped/moved from the top down, for the same reason.

        A nice (I think) side effect of this, is that the visual dis-
turbance is not only minimized, but somewhat equalized. Previously,
moving off a page with a lot of overlapped windows was slow and entailed
a lot of needless redrawing activity, whereas moving onto such a page
was smooth and quick. This change evens out that inequity quite a bit.

        The third part was suggested to me a few weeks ago by a post from
Jan Vicherek, who mentioned that the flashing and the slowness of moving
off a page containing a lot of overlapped windows could be very annoying.
While I'm not going to try this with 30 - 90 windows on one page, I see
a very noticeable improvement in speed and smoothness on my system with
even a few overlapped windows. The added overhead of the dual loop seems
to be more than offset by reduced demands on the server.

        I would expect, on average, to see at least a marginal improvement
in most page/desk transitions. Of course, if you *never* have any 
overlapping  windows, you're not likely to notice any great improvement.

	Well, maybe you remember me, I am that nice guy who wrote the
nextify patch for the marvellous fvwm2, I'm being out of it for a while,
(mainly becasuse I finished my studies (physics) and started new ones
(mathematics) so, sorry for the wait, but I'm on it again, and having
seeing the problems fvwm2 is having to keep up to the new standards,
and because I like it to much to just forget it, I started (today, hehe, 
I code really fast :) a big change to several things in fvwm2 I think
can be improved (mainly menu and decors), so the good news are that it 
was easier that I thought it to be, the bad news are that I indented the
whole code (sorry but I like it kr style :), so the patch is really
great, I'v decided to pack the whole code, but I have no web server
or ftp server to put it on.

	I hope to finished the code before June (it's almost done, but
I want to be sure it works in the rage conditions), so if any of you have
some spare space in his big and incredible ftp server please drop me a
mail (preferebly if you have a good conection to the net, no 28.8kbps
please :) (I've already got an answer to this by Adam K. )

	The look of my fvwm2 is really good now (I would say the best
wm I've ever seen) and it is not too difficult to configure, so....

PS: don't ask for screenshots, I will post some as soon as I could :)

	Well, after a long long time without having seen any improvements 
in the great fvwm2 I have decide to take up the task, but it will have
a cost, I have reindented the full source (using indent -kr -bli0 -bl), so
patches are not a good way to distribute it (last was greater than the code
itself :).
	My question is simple, is anybody working on fvwm2 now?, if yes
what are his goals?. If nobody answer, I will start a new series in the fvwm2
development (maybe something like 2.0.46.x :), and start to put patched
versions at Adam Kopatz site, I would include most of the patches most
commonly used (as FvwmPager Ballons, fvwmpython interface, etc...), so 
I asked the authors of this patches to contact me (I'm not going to repeat
already done code :)

	Thanks everybody, and hope fvwm2 will rule again really soon!

I already made substantial changes to the menus for 2.0.47, and decors
are significantly improved in Scwm, which descends from fvwm2, but uses
Scheme as a very dynamic configuration language (see my web page).  Be
sure you're not reinventing the wheel.

	Well, I've visited your page (really don't know of it)
and although I haven't applied your patch (my source is reindented :(
it seems a GOOD (TM) Thing, but has nothing to do with my own patch,
my intention is to make menus a really nifty thing, with it you can
apply menu styles in a Popup basis (I mean a different style for each
Popup - of course only if you want so :), I have also reimplement the
nextish lookup, and now you can also set the Menu background as a button
(I mean, gradients, pixmaps, etc. ), and the gradient option has been
rewritten to add the posibility to specify the angle (I keep the 
Horizontal, Vertical, and Diagonal for speed ), also I have changed the
way items are highlighted, now you control all the process.

So I think I'm not reinventing the wheel, but anyway I will include you
patch (with a bit effort and crediting you of course :) in my main tree, 
thanks!

I just wanted to let you know that I have been using your patch and that
the only comment/request I would have is that with your patch you loose
the seperators in the menus which are really nice for organizing hosts if
it you don't wan't numerous sub menus.  So I don't know if it is possible
to have them or not.  Just thought I would point it out.

	In my new version separators are keeped intact, and I improve
a lot the code (not more need to hashtables or sfx.c), only bad thing maybe
speed (in my dual PII 300Mgz + Motion 771 it's really fast, but ...),
but I would ask improve it as much as I can (not really too much :)

	Any more ideas to menus?

	Sorry if it seems so, but I only want to cooperate with you in the 
development of such a nice wm, but I wasn't subscribed to fvwm-workers
list, so don't now anything about active development, I by no means want
to seem a "hostile-taker", on the contrary, but as the WEB Page doesn't
get updated for a long time, I just think fvwm2 developer team has switched
over to scwm, I know now that things are not so bad, many people are still
working on it!, I would apply the changes to your version (the one with
autoconf), and submit it to Adam Kopaz to be include in his page.

	Any more info appreciated (mainly more patches I must include)

No.  I didn't mean to suggest that at all.  I'm doing Scwm development,
but by no means has fvwm2 been replaced by Scwm.

Sorry if my response was misleading.

An admittedly lethargic active development though...

Yes, that original post aggrivated me quite a bit at first, but then I
realized that I was really more upset with myself for not having
enough time to do the work on fvwm that I really wanted to.  So I've
come to a decision, which I'll outline below...

I've had many people write me (both on the mailing list and directly)
citing that same cathedral/bazaar paper:

  http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html

It's not that I was deliberately choosing the "cathedral" method of
development, but I just didn't have enough time to truly do a more
frequent development cycle.  I really wanted to (eventually) get a
good 2.1.0 version out, and then start dual stable & development
paths.  As you can see, I haven't quite made it there yet.

Several months between updates has been the norm for me for the past
couple of years, unfortunately, so I'm not sure that I would consider
5 months to be a "long" time considering that...

Please hold off on putting another fvwm pseudo-distribution out
there.  It really confuses things...

GJGG>   Any more info appreciated (mainly more patches I must include)

Ok, more info (and the decision I mentioned above):

As of today I'm giving up being fvwm's maintainer.  Unfortunately I've
finially decided to face facts and accept that I don't currently have
anywhere near the amount of time to devote to fvwm that it should
probably have.  It was a painful decision, but probably for the best
(besides, I guess I can still submit ideas and patches periodically).

I wish to thank everyone that has helped out, submitted patches &
ideas, or just plain used fvwm over the years that I've been involved
with it, especially the folks on the mailing lists.

In the not so distant past I spoke offline with Brady Montz, and I
asked if he might like to take over maintainership from me when I was
ready to give it up, as I felt that he was one of a few good
candidates from the mailing lists and that he might have more time to
devote that I do.  At the time he said he was interested.  After I
made my decision this morning, I wrote him again to ask if he was
still interested, but unforutunately haven't heard back from him yet.
I really wanted to hear back from Brady first before I wrote anything
to the mailing lists, but decided that I should speak up before too
many messages flew back and forth without my input (hope you don't
mind, Brady).  In the event that Brady has changed his mind and
doesn't want to (or can't) take over, I'm sure we'll be able to find
someone else.  I'll be sure and announce when this is all decided.

So, what's next?  Well, I'll hand over my current development snapshot
to the next maintainer after that's settled and they can start with
that or just toss it out and start with 2.0.46, whichever works out
better for them.  Then we'll see where they drive it...

My parting thoughts on the future of fvwm:

        - Please try and keep the base code lightweight, standalone
          (ie - minimal external code usage beyond Xpm), and as
          generic as possible.  Granted, it still needs more cleanup.
        - The configuration language definitely needs some more
          improvement, but I don't think I quite agree with adding an
          extension language like Guile, Tcl, Python, etc as I think
          they are all overkill.  Just my 2 cents on the subject since
          I was out of town and unable to respond when this thread
          came up again recently.
        - The current module interface needs more work as well, and
          should probably be encapsulated in another little lib to be
          shared amongst the modules as much as possible.
        - Dynamically loaded modules that use hooks into existing fvwm
          routines to make for tighter integration is probably worth
          looking into.  That'd probably help with modules being able
          to muck with decorations, multiple language interpreters,
          etc.

I could probably put down more, but I guess the TO-DO list and the
notes I keep in my local development ChangeLog already cover all this
and more...

That's enough rambling for now I guess.  Please be kind and
understanding to the next maintainer.  It's been fun.

Thanks,
Chuck

Thanks, Chuck.  I know everyone appreciates what you've done, and I
personally have enjoyed coordinating things with you.  I do hope you'll
stick around and continue to provide guidance.

Just to note, I will continue to supply mailing list, FTP and web service
for as long as it is wanted.  I can also provide a CVS tree (with anonymous
access and CVSweb) and anonymous rsync access.  I still don't have the time
to coordinate development, though.

First off, I'd like to second Jason's sentiments and thank Chuck for all the
work he's done so far. he was particularly helpful with me a while back as I
muddled through the module API docs while writing the X11::Fvwm module for
Perl5.

I concur that Brady, if he has the time, is the best choice for picking up the
Fvwm mantle. However, if brady cannot do it, I will offer a slice of my 
(admittedly limited) spare time. I'd prefer it went to Brady, though.

Randy

	Well, I think you have take the right way, your work in fvwm2
has been really fantastic, but GPL makes these things easier :)
I hope Brady will take over it, and I hope he'd choose a more open 
development mode, just because (IMHO) it is the only way to have a chance
against wm like WindowMaker, AfterStep, or Enlightment; I really have
no idea of what the current state of your fvwm2 devlopment tree is, so
may be I am wrong (I hope so :)

	And about my patch, I've almost finished, and after great work
I have applied it to smr-2.0.46.4 version of fvwm (the one with the 
autoconf), I will post a snapshot tomorrow (Tuesday GMT), beacuse many
people have misunderstand what the patch is made for, I hope you like
it and decide to include it in the main tree. Another important thing
may be to choose a good indentation mode (I just think currently (2.0.46)
indentation is a bit chaotic) because if you choose a baazar approach
it would be too late :)

	Well, after all, things are changing in the fvwm2 scene, and
I can just wait to the day fvwm2 rulez again!

	Thanks Charles for all your good work (I hope you'd continue
active development, your experience is just too valued to be lost),
thanks!

	Well, here it is, my first version of this patch which will
change your menu looks (I hope to a better one).

	It's made against fvwm-smr-2.0.46.4 by Steve Robbins (I can't
remenber the URL, please post it Steve ).

	I'm wait for your opinions ...    (not your critics ;)

Subject: I'm taking over fvwm development

Well, it's officially decided that I will be taking over the fvwm
development. I'd like to thank Chuck for his years of service and stellar
attitude. 

He's handed off the development tree to me. I have to take my PhD prelims May
28, and I have to to a code walkthrough, before I'll be able to do any real
work on the code. I will probably release the current code as 2.0.47 with the
minimum number of changes and set up a public CVS repository. I hope to have
that done in the first week of June. I'd like to ask everybody who has any
patches > 10 lines to wait until then.

Since this endless march of "beta" versions appears to be confusing to various
distributors and sysadmins, causing them to keep their users at fvwm 1.24, I
plan to split fvwm development into a stable 2.2 version (released ASAP after
freezing feature additions when 2.0.47 is released) and development version
2.3. Note that I am skipping 2.1 altogether to get fvwm in sync with the
linux/xemacs convention of odd minor versions for development versions and
even for release versions.

Version 2.3 will be for incremental improvements to fvwm, targeted towards a
stable release in 6-12 months. Since I think fvwm might need some ground-up
redesign to support things like loadable modules, potential embedded
languages, etc, I will probably start a 2.9 source tree for the truly
speculative and adventurous changes. I think that loadable modules alone would
warrant a major number increase to 3.0. 2.9 will have to wait until 2.0, 2.2,
and 2.3 are running smoothly however, so this might occur towards the end of
the summer.

        I've had couple of reports of dramatic performance improvement
with the Stacking Order patch I submitted over the weekend. It seems to
have turned out far better than I'd expected when I started working on
it.

        Of course, all hell broke loose immediately afterwards, so I
was a little surprised that anyone noticed it - particulary with that
catchy subject line!  :-)

        I'll do my best to get it reworked for the new code base as
soon as Brady makes it available.

	Well, here there is a new version (I'm releasing even faster that 
Linus :), it repair some problems with interaction between MWM FVWM and 
NEXT menus, no you can mix them in any way you like, I have changed the 
Scr struct heavely (mainly deleting items) and have removed the flags 
MWMMenus and FVWMMenus, including them in the MenuFace struct.

	Hope you enjoy it.

PS: It's made against fvwm-smr-2.0.46.4 (so you must reverse my last 
patch before installing this new version)

PSS: This is the last version I'm posting to both lists, I'm going out of
the Fvwm plain list (I mean I would keep only the workers list), because
I have started to hate receiving duplicated messages (that this one :)

PSSS: Brady, if you receive it Email me to confirm, if not I will resend 
it to you for your approval. (Aye Aye Sir :)

PSSSS: What the hell this PSSSS mean ;)

status report:
-------------
Good news, I passed my prelims yesterday.
Mixed news, I'm flying to Des Moines to visit my dying grandma (sad part) and
eat lots of corn-fed prime rib (happy part).

So, I haven't gotten much done on 2.0.47 except look it over, and won't until
at least next week.

volunteer request:
-----------------

I'd like two things:

1. A list of people who want to alpha test. Along with a name I want to know:
  a. architecture/OS used
  b. modules used (me: FvwmM4, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIdent)
  c. "extensions" used (things with defines in Fvwm.tmpl) (me: shape,
     miniicons, pixmap buttons, titlestyle)

People on this list will get to alpha test the new release (probably future
releases too) and will be expected to give a complete testing/report (reminder 
email sent after a week). Sounds like fun, eh? 

2. A repository of fvwmrc's on the website (along with all icons, scripts,
   etc.  used and a list of any environment variables and options in Fvwm.tmpl
   which need to be set so that people can just run them without going mad)
   organized by features. So if someone wants to use some fvwmrc's using
   gradients, they can find them. It would probably also be cool if people
   submitted "truncated" fvwmrc's which only had the configuration for some
   module, for example, all of their *FvwmButtons lines long with any Style
   commands which modify how FvwmButtons looks. I would like to have a
   volunteer to get this running too. This volunteer (unlike those poor souls
   for #1) would probably get lots of happy feedback.

I have a page with several fvwm configuration examples on it.
(http://www.public.iastate.edu/~crode/fvwm).  However, I have come to
realize over the last several months (almost a year) that the page hasn't
been updated, that I don't have the time to keep maintaining it -- that,
and I have switched to enlightenment on my main machine.  I also have
several fvwmrc submissions sitting around that haven't yet been added to
the page.  If whoever volunteers to take on Brady's second request would
like any/all of these, please get in contact with me.  Thanks. :)

	I will do it, I'm using Linux (usually last dev kernel version) with
gcc2.8.1 + latest binutils + glibc2.0.7pre3 + XFree 3.3.2 (Waiting 
eagerly for next versions of everything :). I use mainly FvwmPager + 
FvwmButtons although I would use any other if it's necessary or usefull. 
I compile Fvwm with all options enabled (I mean all Fvwm.tmpl options 
enabled)

PS: Have you received my patch to *improve* menu look with a new menustyle
concept?

No. I'd prefer to wait on that until I've released 2.0.47 and set up a public
CVS server, and let you put all your stuff in yourself.

That is what fvwm-workers was created for. It was named after "bind-workers"
and others to do what you are suggesting. I guess you are suggesting that
fvwm-workers is too open of a list, and gets used as the fvwm list on a
regular basis...

:   a. architecture/OS used

:   c. "extensions" used (things with defines in Fvwm.tmpl) (me: shape,

These are the things that should be reported after compiling and testing
reports are sent back, not before. These things will change over time, as
systems and OS releases come and go. I currently have access to 13
combinations of Vendor and OS.

Expected is a bit too strong in my view. Everyone here is a volunteer, and
have to interleave their paid or scholastic work for "internet projects".

I do believe that a format in which to report results is important. However
an individual who is active for several alpha runs, my only be able to
monitor the testing reports during others.

I agree in that I have had alot of difficulty in the past getting some
examples to do anything like what was intended. However too much work will
tend to keep people from donating their creative ideas. I have gained much
from reading "fvwm2rc" files that will never run correctly at my site.
Maybe this says something about the portability of the .fvwm2rc file, which
may or may not rely on built in defaults or features of fvwm2.
At a minimum, I find a screen shot(s) most helpful to determine weather
further perusal of ones fvem setup is waranted.


Thank you "Brady Montz", for taking the gauntlet. I support over 1000 Unix
workstations of various flavors upon which fvwm2 is the default window
manager. There are many things fvwm2 does well and many it could do better. 
The whole "dt/mwm" proliferation is the outcome of the vision that "fvwm" 
and "t*wm" provided as heterogeneous window managers.

And thank you "Chuck" for picking up the gauntlet and caring it when you
did, when the future of fvwm was in doubt. I have enjoyed working with you
and other fvwm-workers during your stint in supporting fvwm2. 

I hope to provide help as I can. In the right window of opportunity I can
provide alot of feedback.. at other times less. I hope this type of
contribution will be accepted, and allowed to add when it can, monitor when
it can not.

Randall
