Please accept my apologies for submitting this as a bug.  When I created
a minimal .fvwm2rc file, I noticed that before I was using a shell
script (for FvwmEvent: Cmd) to prepend the path to my sound files to the
file names given for events.  I did this to get around FvwmEvent's lack
of a Dir option (like what FvwmAudio has).  With the minimal
configuration file, I used ``Exec /usr/bin/esdplay'' for FvwmEvent's Cmd
and the full path to the sound files for events and I am now unable to
reproduce the problem.

Again, I apologize for taking up Dominik's time and that of anyone else
who may have looked into this.  I'll try to be more observant in the
future.  Thanks.

I think it should only know the length of the input (not sure why this is
needed, maybe to double check or to limit to the substring), not the
length of the output, which it returns.

Good work at finding the problem. I will try to enable the new code by
allocating more space, today or tomorrow. But I think I already tried to
allocate 3*str_len and it still core dumped... I am sure though your
analyze is correct.

Ah, I see now what you mean. Yes, fribidi assumes the caller allocate the
space for the output, that is just an incorrect thing to do for such
library, because a caller can't know the output length yet.

Ok, I did some changes. Including removing alloca (not that this helps
with speed and core dumps).

I allocate 4 * str_len. I don't think it worths to write now more exact
calculations when it is the fribidi task to worry about an allocation.
Seems to work, although I can't guarantee it will not core dump.

Here is some result. It is possible my font is bad, because I don't see
spaces between words. But at least I can see the text is more connected.

to get inverted, "pressed in" looking title reliefs.

Not that I speak French, but I guess only one of these lines is

  "Vous avez du courrier"

Yes I will double check soon (not the time just now).
Sorry for the mess in po/Makefile.am.

uninstall rules which are executed only after several minutes of
running make distcheck.  There was a number of typos in the uninstall

If you meant to contribute this for the screenshot page,
perhaps you would want to combine the menu shot and the screenshot
into one image.

Notice how the other screenshots are done:

http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/

To get the menu into the desktop image, you can use a program
like xv which has a delay option on the grab operation.

I do not know. I see FvwmIdent as config helper. For example, the man
page refer to Name, Icon Name, Class and Resources for Style.  If we
translate FvwmIdent this can cause trouble. No?

Yes, I forgot to update uninstall after my last big po/Makfile.am
rewrite.

Hello,

in 
   fvwm 2.5.4 (from cvs) compiled on Oct 20 2002 at 00:42:44
   with support for: ReadLine, XPM, PNG, GNOME WM hints, EWMH
   hints, Shape, SM, Xinerama, XFT

things seem to work as desired.

Yesterday, recompiled and installed a cvs version (sorry,
dont have it on hand, but that's whatever was in the cvs
yesterday).

Now, when i specify 'fg' in the colorset used for my active
menu items (colorset 2), there is no effect. 'bg', however,
does take effect when I change it.

I am willing to admit that maybe something with my config
used to be wrong, but used to work anyway, and now
rightfully does not. Hence, I am wondering if there were any
recent changes to colorset/menu handling that could've
caused this?

Config hasn't been changed between the two versions. Also, I
did try changing colorset values, and I do see background
change, while foreground does not.

Here are my relevant lines

   CleanupColorsets

   # 
   # menu
   #
   # basic menu colorset
   ColorSet 0 fg NavajoWhite, bg #475293, Plain, NoShape
   # greyed menu colorset
   ColorSet 1 fg grey48, bg grey48, Plain, NoShape
   # active menu item fg+bg
   Colorset 2 fg #475293, bg NavajoWhite, Plain, NoShape

   (there are more, but I dont think they are relevant)
...

   #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   #				MENUS
   #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MenuStyle * Fvwm, Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*
   MenuStyle *	DoubleClickTime 300, HilightBack
   MenuStyle * MenuColorset 0, GreyedColorset 1, ActiveColorset 2, TrianglesSolid
   MenuStyle * PopupDelayed, PopupDelay 300, RemoveSubmenus, PopupAsSubmenu

thanks,

denis

I was was thinking about some new conditional "operators" (the same type
like "Current (sticky) ..."
I would like to be able to see if a window is resizable and minimisable,
for example, to be able to define different menus for the window menu (for
example) depending on what operations are available.
Is this possible currently (except specifying for know windowclasses)?

I guess if this is to be implemented, it's part of the conditional rewrite
someone talkt about for 3.0

Olivier, here's my crack at it (code sniplets attached).  Feel free to
modify as you see fit & do please check it.  Looking forward to a working
solution.

Regards & thanks for your continued help.

You mean, because we could tell somebody "please look up the
window class" and she can not find it because it is translated?
But then, if the user speaks English so badly that she can not
translate "window" and "class", she will not be able to ask a
question on this list :-)

In the long run, I want to have a condition for every style we
have, but that does not exactly cover the case you mentioned.
There is a loot of window state information that could be checked
in conditions too (transient, position, size, etc.).

There already is a function is_function_allowed() in decorations.c
that checks whether move/resize/maximize/close are allowed by the
program or by the user.  Would be easy to write conditions using
the function.

About minimisation:  I tend to removing the "do not minimise" hint
completely.  It makes zero sense but can be extremely annoying.

Yes, but more important we use these words in the man page.
IMO, these words are technical words so translation is
problematic (but maybe this is not the case, I do not know).

Of course the real big challenge is to translate the fvwm
documentation (some doc is translated in fvwm-themes).

I think that French can be used to ask question on this mailing
list. German, Hebrew and Russian too? Maybe we may mention on the
web page that if a user has some difficulty with English (s)he can
use "French, ...".

Full_Name: Dorothy Robinson
Version: fvwm-2.5.4

OS: SunOS 5.8 on sparc

Submission from: (NULL) (216.99.209.149)


If I compile with extended window manager hints, I can cause a terrible
hang by trying to resize Mozilla and accidentally dragging the cursor onto
the TaskBar, which I have at the top of the screen.  When I do that, the
cursor stays in the diagonal-arrow state and blinks rapidly, forever. The
only thing to do then is log in from another machine and kill fvwm2.
Killing Mozilla, or the taskbar, or any other module doesn't do it.  The
screen stays in that state, displaying a resizing Mozilla, even after
Mozilla is dead.

If I compile with --disable-ewmh, it doesn't happen.  I'm not running
Gnome, or I'd blame it on that.

The change is described in the NEWS:

  The HilightBack and ActiveFore menu styles are independent of
  each other.  HilightBack without using ActiveFore does no longer
  hilight the item text.

And from the man page:

  ActiveFore and ActiveForeOff switch hilighting the foreground of
  the selected menu item on and off.  A specific foreground color
  may be used by providing the color name as an argument to
  ActiveFore.  Omitting the color turns hilighting on when an
  ActiveColorset is used.  ActiveForeOff turns off hilighting the
  foreground completely.  The ActiveColorset option overrides the
  specified color.

It is slightly inconsistent with the way it worked before.  To sum
it up, add

  MenuStyle * ActiveFore

and it works again.  I changed that because I saw no reason why
HilightBack also activated foreground hilighting.  You could not
have both independently of each other.

Bye

Please provide some more details:

 - What Mozilla version do you have?

 - Are you using the task bar coming with fvwm?  If not, which
   task bar is it (and which version)?

 - How do you resize the window?  By dragging from the frame?  Or
   by some function built into Mozilla?  Is it a wire frame or
   opaque resize?

 - Does it help to press Crtl-Alt-Esc to get out of the hang?

 - Please try to strip down your .fvwm2rc file as much as possible
   so that the problem still happens and post it to the mailing
   list.  If it stops happening when you remove a specific line,
   please say so.

 - When you log in from a different machine, try to attach a
   debugger to the running fvwm process to see where it hangs.
   If you have gdb:

     $ gdb fvwm <fvwm-process-id>

Then, at the gdb prompt, type

     (gdb) where

(this prints a stack trace in clear text, please post that
output).  Next, single step through the code until you come across
the same code line as "where" printed:

     (gdb) s
     <some output>
     (gdb) <hit return repeatedly>

And post all output.

Bye

I added a field in window_flags in fvwm.h and parsing conditional.c
But where do I do the checking against an actual window?
The function MatchesConditionMask in conditional.c only checks few cases
and always returns False for iconified windows.
I can't find the place to evaluate the conditional. I tried to grep for
flags.is_iconified (for example) and it only shows up add_window.c,
events.c, and window_flags.h

OK, it ands iconified, transient and iconified by parent, not or:ing...
ok, I missunderstood this part. But still I'm not sure where to do the
check.

You do not need an additional flag - the code is already there.
Call the is_function_allowed() function from decorations.c.

But wouldn't I still have to in code that parses the condition string in
CreateConditionMask and patch MatchesConditionMask to check
is_function_allowed for the current window and resize?

The ewmh-mozilla-resize problem turns out to be simpler than I thought.
It happens with no FvwmTaskBar, and resizing at any corner. I removed
my .fvwm2rc entirely, and it still happened with the base configuration.
The Mozilla verson is 1.1. I tried to resize it by grabbing the corner
of the FVWM window decoration.  Resizing other things, including
Nautilus, has no problem.  I tend to be suspicious of all things Gtk
on Solaris, in case you can't tell :-)

I've attached the gdb output you asked for.  This FVWM2 is compiled from
CVS head on Dec 2, which is version 2.5.5, I guess.

Ctl-Alt-Esc did nothing. (is it supposed to on a Sun?)
BTW I've seen this on two machines - my little Ultra 10 at home and
the Blade 2000 I use at work.  They're both running Solaris 8, though
probably different patchlevels. I'm afraid they're both running the same 
Mozilla, too.  I'll try downloading a newer version soon.


Dorothy

Of course - all I wanted to say is that you do not need to add a
flag to the window structure and write the code to do the check.

Interesting.  Fvwm should not be in the HandlePropertyNotify()
function at all.  My guess is that either an innfinite number of
PropertyNotify events is generated by the application, or that
fvwm receives the same event again and again.  Can you please add
this code at the front of the HandlePropertyNotify() function in
events.c (line 2526), right after the "DBUG" statement:

---------------------------- snip ---------------------------
fprintf(
	stderr, "pn: ser 0x%x time 0x%x atom 0x%x w 0x%08x '%s'\n",
	(int)te->xproperty.serial, (int)te->xproperty.time,
	(int)te->xproperty.atom, (int)te->xproperty.window,
	(fw) ? fw->visible_name : "(null)");
---------------------------- snip ---------------------------

And post a few lines from the end of the output once it is hung?
THis should confirm either of my theories.  If the numbers "ser"
and "time" do not change, it is the same event again and again.

In any case, can you repeat the single stepping session until it
enters HandlePropertyNotify() for a second time, please?  Just
hold down the return key in gdb and wait until you have seen the
"fprint" from above two times.

It's an fvwm thing to bug out of certain 'hang' conditions.

There is some work going on with the new FvwmWindowLister module.
Personally I hope it will replace the whole WindowList command one
day.  It is a perl script and thus extensible much more easily.
Hopefully it will provide a much more flexible interface than
WindowList does now.
>>

Is there any work in the near future on adding sorting by {type} to
FvwmWindowLister? I could then add what i added to my windowlist.c, where i
add a "null' entry where a multiple entry class is starting or ending.

I'm not familiar enough w/ perl to do much w/ it.
(awk is so much easier to work w/)

I'm not quite sure what you mean here. Currently it sorts windows
into groups by title (or class, resource, etc) in a user-defined way,
and puts separators between those groups. Is that not what you're
after? Can you send me a screenshot of what your code does?

It currently allocates by specified classes plus a catchall.
But each section is unsorted....including the catchall.

I have my windowlist.c automagically create sections for each class that has
more than one member.

eg:

class1 title 1
class1 title 2
------------
class2 whatever
class3 whatever
------------
class4 title 3
class4 title 4
class4 title 5
------------
class5 whatever
------------
class6 title 6
class6 title 7


To do this, i first sort by class (standard command) and then as i run thru
the list, i put in a break whenever a class that has more than one entry
starts or stops. This autocreates sections and keeps everything still in
class order.

I put the code snippet in and captured some of its output, and caught
about 4 HandlePropertyNotify calls in gdb.  Hope this helps.

As I suspected, the same event gets processed again and again.

I'm sorry, but this is still too short to see what is going on.
You probably just looked for "HandlePropertyNotify" in the output.
That string is printed every time a function call inside
HandlePropertyNotify returns.  May I ask you to repeat the
procedure?  The output should be much longer.  I am sorry that I
have to bother you again, but I can not find the root cause of the
problem by looking at the code, and it works fine on my machine.

Apply this patch to events.c:

------------------------------ snip -----------------------------
*** events.c.orig       Thu Dec  5 11:08:40 2002
--- events.c    Thu Dec  5 11:09:05 2002
***************
*** 2642,2647 ****
--- 2642,2648 ----
                break;
  
        case XA_WM_ICON_NAME:
+ fprintf(stderr,"********************** XA_WM_ICON_NAME\n");
                flush_property_notify(XA_WM_ICON_NAME, FW_W(fw));
                if (HAS_EWMH_WM_ICON_NAME(fw))
                {
------------------------------ snip -----------------------------

(Paste it into a file events.patch and the run
"patch < events.patch" in the fvwm/fvwm directory, or just add the
fprintf line without the '+' manually).

Then, after recompiling and reinstalling, trigger a hang and
attach the debugger as usual.  Note the line number of the fprintf
statement.

Switch to events.c, set a breakpoint at the fprintf statement and
let fvwm run into it

  (gdb) list events.c:1
  <ignore output>
  (gdb) break <line number of fprintf statement>
  (gdb) cont

Fvwm should stop again at the line with the fprintf statement.
Now, single step through the code as before until you come across
the fprintf line again.  This should generate at least several
hundred lines of output.

--

When you generated the necessary output, please fetch the latest
CVS code and check wheter the problem persists.  I fixed a bug
that is related to the debug output, but I do not think it should
fix the problem.  Even if it does, I suspect there must be another
bug.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I added conditions "FixedSize" (matches unresizable windows) and
"HasHandles" (matches windows without resize-handles).
Now when I created the diff it also included changes I did to the IconBox
that hasn't been checked in.
Is there a way to create a diff with just the new changes? Would I need to
remove the affected files from FvwmIconBox and cvs update and then do a
diff and after that reapply my old patch? Seems a bit teedious.

//Marcus

Thanks Olivier/Mikhael for all your help (it would have taken
me months to debug that myself).  I just fixed the combinational
character problem (that was noted by myself in the code) and
reformatted the code a bit for better readability and for it to
be no more than 80 characters wide (so I'm including the entire
file so that you can simply substitute what's in CVS with what's
noted (FBidiJoin.c) - I've been running with it for awhile now).
I'm also including the arabic .po files along with the minor
patch to include 'ar' as a "lang".

Arabic (& derivatives) are now 99% complete (I will mail later
about the remaining 1% with regards to harakat/tanween (eg. U+064E)
characters).

BTW: Olivier, did those UCS4<->UTF8 functions look ok ?

Much thanks.

Either edit patch manually (don't change anything, just remove lines) or
execute "cvs diff [-u] [fvwm/file1] [fvwm/file2] >conditionals.patch".

Just for your information:  I am no longer working on new fvwm
features and I no longer apply patches.  And I have no more
opinion on the correct syntax, or the correct names of new
features.  So, please do not expect me to apply any of Marcus'
patches.  If there is some consensus that the patches are good,
someone else has to proof read and commit them.

Bye

Dominik,

  I fully agree with your decision.  I can't see how its any
fun for you to spend your time applying changes you might not
use.

Workers,

  I believe Marcus has been on this list for years and there
is no reason why he couldn't be granted cvs access.  (One vote.)
Meanwhile, I'll apply the patch (after I look at it).  I think that
might take a few days though.

I've installed xnest, and attaching gdb to an fvwm inside of xnest
is no problem.

I was trying to get this working to see if I could contribute
to the Openinterface problem, but right now, I'm afraid I don't
know what part of Fvwm to set a breakpoint in.  I tried fvwm/events.c
HandleEvents, but that seems to be driven too often.

Does anyone have any hints?

(Assuming the problem was with windows closing unexpectedly, I
can't remember exactly right now).

Start with destroy_window() (add_window.c) and see from where and
why is it being called.  Hopefully it's not from an event in
events.c.  Try to figure out why it is being called.  It may help
to add a debug fprintf right before any destroy_window call to
narrow down the reason.  You want to find out if the application
withdrew its window or if fvwm destroys it on its own.  In the
former case, we have to pin down the root cause why the
application thinks it must unmap its window.

(Note the change to fvwm-workers.)

Send me the information for system access.

Let me know if nights or weekends are OK, I probably won't
get to this right away.

Dominik,

Oops, I think the transcript I mailed last night was too big - the
mail seems to have been eaten.

Whatever you did, it had an effect - the newest CVS doesn't hang
anymore.

I didn't have much luck with the breakpoint business.  I think I
got the printf in the wrong place, and by the time I realized that,
I had already done the CVS update, and it was getting late.  This
weekend, I could go back to version 2.5.4 and play with it some more.
I have ddd, so it isn't too painful.

I captured more output by just stepping through.  Since the mail
doesn't like it, you can get it at

Description:
	When a window is focused, either by clicking or by the Alt-Tab
	windowlist, it is not plucked from the windowlist and put to the
	front of the list, instead the whole list is rotated. In other
	words, it shows the behavior of Focus instead of FlipFocus.
	This issue showed up in recent CVS versions

Repeat-By:
	Start fvwm with a config file that contains only this line:

	Style * ClickToFocus

	Launch a few different Programs. Switch between them by using
	the Alt-Tab windowlist or by clicking into the windows. Press
	Alt-Tab again to confirm that the windowlist was rotated. Thus
	the list is not kept in least-recently-focused order, as it used
	to be.
	I added a WindowListFunc (with explicit FlipFocus),
	so that the complete config file looked like this:

        ----- snip -----

	Style * ClickToFocus

	DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
	AddToFunc WindowListFunc
	 +        I WindowId $0 (*) Iconify off
	 +        I WindowId $0 (*) FlipFocus
	 +        I WindowId $0 (*) Raise

	----- snip -----

	This does not affect this behavior.
	The problem exists only if ClickToFocus is active, with 
	MouseFocus the windowlist ordering works as usual.

It is still possible to continue to use rpm -ba and the rpm man page
explains how to do this.

But I will move to rpmbuild, since it was since RedHat 7.x.

Here is a list of things that I think have to be done before 2.6
that you may not be aware of.  I write them here specfically
because I will most likely do none of them.  My reasoning is:
nobody is maintaining these features or taking care of them,  and
2.6 is meant to be a *stable* release.  But of course you can do
what you want with them - it's all code under GPL.

 * Remove tear off menus.  Either that or finish the menu rewrite
   (to allow full operation without grabbing pointer or keyboard
   from within menus).  There is still some unfinished code in
   menus.c.
 * Remove Key release bindings.  Does not work reliably.
 * Rename FvwmProxy.
 * Either rewrite the FvwmProxy placement algorithm to give decent
   results (no hangs; all proxy windows visible even on very full
   pages; placement must work with sticky windows and windows on
   other pages too) - or remove FvwmProxy.
 * Rename FvwmWindowLister.  The naming of the window listing
   features is becoming very confusing.
 * Either enhance FvwmWindowLister to replace the built-in
   WindowList command or remove it.
 * Remove the new internal event and command interface.  I suggest
   to back out the code by moving back to the 2.5.3 code base and
   re-apply all patches.  The changes were too big to catch all of
   them.
 * Remove the --disable-ewmh and --disable-gnome-hints configure
   options.

Bye

I'd hate to see tear off menus go away.

I use them and they seem to be problem free.

Just as important, tear off menus are one of the comparison points
on the window managers page.  Its an important feature from a
visibility point of view.

If they are causing a problem, I don't see it.  In this case,
I think you are setting your standards too high.

Actually one problem is that new windows appear only after leaving the
menu. If a menu item causes a new window to popup.
I haven't looked any at the menu code, but I guess the event loop for
menus don't check for this. With normal menus this is probably not a
problem since the menu gets unposted at the time of the click

Although I can see potential compromise of stability in the core when
multiple (or even single) tear off menus are open, this feature is not
mandatory. I think we may mark it experimental and/or partial if you want.

If you are strong about removing anything, I suggest to remove the default
key and mouse bindings that revert a menu to a tear off. So only explicit
TearMenuOff will work (and it also adds Backspace hot key). Or maybe,
instead, introduce a command MenuWindow that starts a menu in a window.

As for me, the things as they are now are pretty good. I run with many
complex menus open on the screen for several hours now and it is ok.
Of course some things are pretty unusual regarding what happens when a
pointer leaves a submenu as compared to normal submenus. But it's ok.
The only problem is that no bindings (W or A, key or mouse) seem to work
inside tear off menu windows. Also if you start a window from such menu,
you should leave it to see a window. This is not critical.

>  * Remove Key release bindings.  Does not work reliably.

Here I probably agree. I myself can't use key releases, because they make
some applications unhappy. This is a good feature and I would like to have
it, but it is currently not very usable and I am not sure it is possible
to implement it without conflicts.

This is why I don't want to mix modules and the core.
Modules may be buggy (we had really buggy, sometimes crashing FvwmIconMan,
FvwmTaskBar and some others for years), but the core is still stable.
Of course if FvwmProxy makes X hang it is another story...

I don't have an opinion about removing or leaving this module.

My stance is simple. If it is a mandatory extension to the core, I am
against it, if it is a usual module, like FvwmDragWell or FvwmScroll,
and the author is willing to maintain it, it is perfectly fine with me.
I personally can't think yet how it can be useful to me.
(But I also don't see how 15 more modules are useful for me and I don't
want to remove any of them for 2.6.x except for maybe FvwmSave[Desk]).

>  * Rename FvwmWindowLister.  The naming of the window listing

What would be a better name for you?
We have modules with different functionality, IMHO it is good.

FvwmIconBox - pretty unique, shows normal icons, I think it is ok as is.

FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmWinList - persisting graphical modules.
They may be replaced in the future by one module, FvwmWindowBar (?).

FvwmProxy - transient non table list, it may be called FvwmWindowProxies.

FvwmWindowLister - transient table list, may be called FvwmWindowListing.

All these modules do different things, and I think there may be more
modules that work with the window list (think FvwmPager).

If we have these names in the future, is it less confusing?

  FvwmWindowBar
  FvwmWindowProxies
  FvwmWindowListing

>  * Either enhance FvwmWindowLister to replace the built-in

WindowList simply can't be removed in 2.6.x, because all user
configurations use it. But this does not mean that FvwmWindowLister
that answers some user requests should be removed. It is possible
to implement all the current WindowList functionality, but I don't
think this is urgent, because WindowList is not going to be removed.
I also don't think WindowList should be replaced with a call to
FvwmWindowLister (effectivelly making it a mandatory extension).

I think we should freeze WindowList features. Then to discuss after
2.6.0 whether to do something about WindowList depending on what
FvwmWindowLister may offer to that time.

Really, I don't see a problem to have both, one internal and one external
for some fancy features. Personally I need FvwmWindowLister for several
reasons, first - to answer all requests that want some fancy WindowList,
second is to have a regular module to test new perllib features on it.
I also have some unfinished patch to FvwmWindowLister that shows a window
list horizontally using GTK+ (if available and if requested) instead of
fvwm menus. I don't know yet whether I will include it or not.

I would like to find another solution than to go back to the 2.5.3.

What are the problems with a new interface except maybe that it is not
finished?

I am not sure it is bad to have these. But since you seem to have a
strong willing to remove them, they may be removed.
Olivier said he may do this. If not, I may do this later.

I will post my todo list for 2.6.x later in December.
I will also try to find a time to report some bugs.

Mikhael.

I stand corrected.
I've only been using it for my window operations menu.
That does seem like a problem.

Hardly - with the whole keyboard grabbed ...  The menu code simply
does not belong into the core.

As a module in a stable release, it should not have known problems
that make it useless in certain situation.  At least it can hang
the module interface for 30 seconds and eat a lot of cpu before
being killed.  The proxy placement algorithms is a loop that seems
to have some potential for looping eternally.  It's fine as a
module, but it does not belong in a stable release if it isn't
stable.

  FvwmWinList - WindowList - FvwmWindowLister

That is confusing.  Perhaps FvwmWindowMenu.  (I prefer
FvwmCodeDuplicator, though ;-)

Well, then let it suffice to say that I believe the current path
of generating module and code duplication will bite future
developers.  Maintenance is already a nightmare and getting worse
with every line that duplicates what another already does.

It is finished, and I know of no problems.  As nobody except me
knows how it works and nobody maintains it, it's not a good
candidate for a stable release.  The patches were extremely
disruptive, perhaps even more than the style flag rewrite a couple
of years ago.  Removing it manually would probably cause even more
problems.  But anyway - since it is very unlikely someone
volunteers to do the hard work to remove it, I would not be
surprised if it stays in the code forever.  When that happens,
just don't expect me to fix it.

configure option = conditional compilation = hell to maintain
In my eyes, configure options are a valid choice only for
libraries (include and library path).

Personally, I plan to stabilize the features I wrote since 2.4.0,
remove the ones that are too unstable, and then think about
whether I see any future in developing fvwm for me or not.  At
least I recognize the possibility that I am overreacting at the
moment.  But as it is now with everybody doing some things without
thinking about the big picture there is little sense in flogging
the dead horse even further.

FvwmWindowMenu is good with me, I am just not sure whether it sounds ok:

  SendToModule FvwmWindowMenu Menu

If there are no other suggestions, I will probably rename it later.

Too long, but maybe to shorten it to FvwmCoder or FvwmCat? :)

The problem is human resources and it will not be any better if a new
project is started. Anyway, I believe you will make the right decision
and we will see you here, maybe after a good half year vacation.

Also don't forget about the 10 year celebration. :)

I have some plans for new menu functionallity. This will have to wait
until after the feature freeze for 2.6, ofcourse.

The idea (as discussed before) is to have conditional statements in menus.
For example have conditionals to make an item inactive (greyed out),
unavailable and choose different labels depending on conditionals.

For example:

AddToMenu WindowMenu
+	Inactive(!Maximized, !Iconified) "Restore" RestoreFunc
	...
+	Skip(FixedSize)	"Size"	Resize
	...
+	If(Sticky) "Unstick" Stick off 	Else "Stick" Stick on

Suggestions are ofcourse welcome.
I plan to use the code as the other conditional statements. And also I
plan to add conditionals for all function hints (I implemented
conditionals "FixedSize" and "HasHandles"). This would also involve new
styles "FixedPostion", "Uniconifiable" and so forth.
Yes I know, many people hate when these hints are used. But after all
these are styles so it means freedom for the user...

You may read some discussions about a new menu syntax here:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0203/msg00508.html

As for your examples, I suggest to use only the conditions we have now in
ThisWindow, i.e. (!Focused, !Maximized, !Iconic), not Inactive(...).

Mikhael.

Ok, "Disabled" is already covered by that link. There is no need in
Skip/If/Else (and if/else is just impossible to parse without conflicts).
Only one condition specifier "C" is needed to enhance that proposal:

  + I "Unstick"
  + C   (Sticky)
  + A   Stick off
  + I "Stick"
  + C   (!Sticky)
  + A   Stick on

I think FvwmABitLikeWindowListButWithSomeFeaturesOfFvwmIconMan :-)

Or FvwmWindowMenu is good too.

I agree that it makes more sense to merge the persistent modules
into a very capable FvwmIconMan.


> FvwmWindowLister - transient table list, may be called FvwmWindowListing.

By its very simplistic design FvwmWindowLister is not easily made
persistent. I wrote it to scratch an itch of mine, but hoped
that by virtue of its simplicity it would remain as a useful
example for power users to adapt to their own specific needs
(as Elliot has already done).

This kind of scripting ability provided by perllib is a major
selling point of fvwm for some people.

To this end I think it would be useful to maintain an archive
of modules (CFAN?), some working but esoteric and some experimental,
separate from the main distribution, which will only contain
well-maintained code.

When I've perpetrated hack-jobs such as FvwmWindowLister and
FvwmPlaceTransient I haven't necessarily intended them to
go into the distribution, but would like others to be able to
find them easily, play with them, and adapt them.

(On a side note, I still think configurable transient placement
would be a great addition to the core, but there are design issues
to discuss.)

Should that be an extension to FvwmWindowLister or a separate
module in an online archive?


Just my 2 cents.

fvwm2 man page:
"The  conditions are a list of keywords from the list below and are
separated by commas or whitespace."

But, if I use commas in a list of conditions, I never get a match.  If I use
spaces, it seems to work fine.  Anybody else seen this behavior?

Also, if everybody is ok with the CycleWest, CycleEast, etc options
for the Direction command, I'll go ahead and add it to the core man page.
Any objections?

Post an example so we can tell what goes wrong.  I'd like to
remove the non-comma syntax in the long run.

I still think it should be moved into a separate command and take
two directions as the argument (like IconBox).  One major
direction and a minor direction which must be orthogonal to the
first one.  For example:

  ScanWindows North West

This means "Scan windows from North to South.  Of all windows that
are closest in the primary direction, pick windows from left to
right."

Bye

Based on XEmacs highlighting for quoted strings, I think there's
an extra or missing quote around line 8083, (the TitleStyle line).

I'll probably fix it, but not today, just writing this note in case
anyone else wants to stare at it for a hour or so and/or to remind
myself if no one else volunteers.

"]]" ["   should be replaced with    "]] ["

I am also not happy with how the first page of "man FvwmAuto" is
formatted.

Works:
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate               \
                        Direction CycleEast (CurrentPage !Sticky)

Doesn't work:
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate               \
                        Direction CycleEast (CurrentPage,!Sticky)

I tried CirculateHit, but it doesn't seem to avoid WindowListSkip items.
Most of my persistant WindowListSkip items happen to be sticky, so this
works for me, but it's not really a good solution.

I was also trying to minimize my impact of trampling around in the core.
A downside of my first version is that the secondary axis direction is fixed.
On the plus side, there's no new commands and only one function in one
file is changed.

Syntax-wise, ScanWindows looks fine.  It just sounds like more code 
(and therefore more time, space, and maintenence).

Is it code or syntax that's the problem?  I haven't looked at the
parser/dispatcher, but if a short entry for ScanWindows can route
to the same CMD_Direction and F_CMD_ARGS has an argv[0] equivalent,
we can pretty much use the code close to what we have now.
If arg0==ScanWindows, I could do gravity_parse_dir_argument twice.

Or I guess we could just turn CMD_Direction into a regular function
and route CMD_Direction and CMD_ScanWindows into it.

I don't like how there are 8 possible secondary directions, but only
2 are valid.  Maybe right/left turns, like 'ScanWindows East Right'.
That would mean the z-axis points into the screen.

If you take you keyboard apart, you can probably find what's causing
your shift key to stick.  I had a similar problem when I spilled some
apple juice on a VIC20.

Very nice looking module.  Without reading the code yet, here's a few
questions...

1. Can I run more than one FvwmTabs, at least one per desk, but probably
multiple per desk.

2. How about configuration?  Is that still todo?  (sizes, fonts, colors)

3. How'd you get the tabs inside the window?  I was guessing they'd
have to go on top of the regular sizer bar.  Hmm, borderless subwindows?

4. What do you think about an auto-grab?  You could identify some patterns
of window names in the config and then toggle buttons would appear on the
tab bar somewhere allowing you to auto-swallow anything with that pattern.
Or just put the toggle in the FVWM-Tabs menu.  I'd probably prefer that
the exclusivity of multiple FvwmTabs instances work on an independent
per-desk basis.

Ok, done.  Here's the working example:

Key -Meta_L     A   A   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Hide
Key Tab         A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate       \
                        ScanWindows East Right (CurrentPage !Sticky)
Key Tab         A   SM  SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Circulate       \
                        ScanWindows West Right (CurrentPage !Sticky)

If this ok, I go ahead and add ScanWindows to the core man page.

By "closest in the primary direction", did you mean anything other
than "exactly the same", such as "within some delta"?  Cause I didn't
do that.

That would be confusing since Left and Right are synonyms for West
and East.  I'd prefer to parse the direction as usual and complain
if the secondary direction is not orthogonal to the primary.  And
it is consistent with the semantics of the IconBox style.

When the distance is != 0 it is obvious what to do.  But when a
window with distance is found, the distance in the secondary
direction is used.  In other words, with "North West", the closest
window to the right of the current one is take.

The COMMANDS file project is still in progress here.
In trying to describe the "Prev" command, I noticed this in the man page:

  .BI "Prev [(" conditions ")] " command
  Performs
  .I command
  (typically
  .BR Focus )
  on the next window which satisfies all

The way I use fvwm, I don't really have a use for next/prev,
but it seems to me the word "next" in this description should be
"previous".

Also, neither Next nor Prev describes how it looks for windows.
Is there some part of the man page that describes how the order of
the list of windows is controlled by fvwm?

Yes, "next" is wrong.  Too much cut and paste.

There may be something in the descriptions of the focus policies,
but definitely not something we should add a cross reference to.

I marked some items with a question mark.

I just happened to catch the StickyAcrossxxx commands
and added them to the list.

It seems like a very useful thing to have a list like that,
but it seems like a bad idea to keep it separate from the
fvwm source code or the fvwm man page.  Its going to
get out of sync.

Extracting from the man page wouldn't be to hard, but
the command introductions need to be made more regular,
I saw:

.BI "Command"
.BI Command
.BI "Command ["
.IP "\fBCommand [[\fP"

Of course we could just do:

.\" ONELINE Command "One line description"

before each command.

I don't plan to do anything like that right now.
I'm just sharing some thoughts.

I've been working with Tomi on the premature close of OpenInterface
GUI problem without much success.  I've been able to recreate the
problem once or twice but not very consistently.

I've never created the problem with gdb attached or with debug
information printing.  Even without gdb or debug, its not consistent.

Anyway, I'll keep at it.

Since I saw inconsistent behavior I thought it might help to do some
Fvwm runs with Purify.  I don't think I'm going to be able to use
Purify with the GUI in question due to some firewall issues, but I did
run a few GUIs with child windows, resize windows, iconify windows
switch pages, and pop up menus.

2.5.6 looked pretty good.   All I see  are a few UMRs.  (Uninitialized
Memory Reads.)   Often  UMRs aren't  a problem.    Its  fine to   copy
uninitialized memory.  As long as you aren't  doing tests against that
memory there is no problem.

Here are the UMRs:

UMR: Uninitialized memory read:

hehe - the problem I have isn't hardware, it's bioware. :)

: questions...
: 
: 1. Can I run more than one FvwmTabs, at least one per desk, but probably
: multiple per desk.

Not yet, but thanks to Mikhael I've worked out how to do it (I can use
'Pick' on a per-FvwmTabs basis to add a window) & I intend to add this
functionality Real Soon Now (tm).

: 2. How about configuration?  Is that still todo?  (sizes, fonts, colors)

Yeah, TODO. You'll see a short TODO list at the bottom of the FvwmTabs
source file.

: 3. How'd you get the tabs inside the window?  I was guessing they'd
: have to go on top of the regular sizer bar.  Hmm, borderless subwindows?

I'm basically reparenting windows into a Perl/Tk app. Then just mapping
& unmapping them as necessary. The only problem with this approach is
that when the windows are reparented to FvwmTabs they no longer appear
in the windowlist. Haven't found a way around that yet.

: 4. What do you think about an auto-grab?

A very good idea. If it's not on the TODO list, it should be. I'll get
hacking on all these features after my xmas holidays, which start at
4:59pm tonight - yipee! :)

SCoTTie! :)

Ah, precedence.  Ok, fixed.

Ok, but what you're not saying and what I'm not doing, is that if
the distance along the primary is, say, 1, that it says "that's pretty close",
and balances it with the cross axis (sorta like what Direction does).

Ok, back to the man pages.  Also, I went with ScanWindow (singular) to be
more like ThisWindow.   A commit is on its way real soon.

Whenever you modify functable.c you should also modify NEWS and
docs/COMMANDS, not just the man page.

I don't think having such comment line in the man page is the best.

I initialy created COMMANDS from functable.c, the man page is less
relable. If any automatization is to be done, I think, it is adding
52-char description in functable.c near every command in the list.

Right, we have "Direction" for this.  ScanWindows should not try
to be clever here.

But it should be plural as it operates on many windows while
ThisWindow operates only on one.

Should Next be NextWindow or NextWindows?

If it is Windows it could be thought to work like All (AllWindows),
but it works on one window only. I don't care much about this thought.
Maybe ScanForWindow? Or ScanLines?

I don't understand this one.  What code do you have in
functions.c, line 545?

Should both the "fixed".  They are not really UMRs.  Purify seems
to be unable to handle btructs with bit fields properly.

Thats right, there are a few things Purify gets wrong.
I'm not surprised that it doesn't track things at the bit level.

Hm.  Perhaps it's because the string is somthing between 13 and 15
characters, but expaction[0] reads four bytes?

Maybe using bit fileds isn't this clever at all.  Sure it saves
several hundred bytes per window, but we pay this with additional
code and slower execution.

If the compiler caused code to be generated that accessed 4 bytes,
I think it generated bad code.  If you don't see anything wrong
then I think you should forget it.  Its not a perfect tool.

If I remember correctly, we checked the code generated by the compilers
and bit field access generated code comparable to byte access.

Yep.  I got it right in the COMMANDS file.
Its easy to get confused with the Style option.
This might end up as FAQ question 0.2.

Just like the "Stick" command and the "Sticky" style.

But not when writing a bit.  To write a whole byte, the compiler
can just put the value into the byte.  But to write a single bit
in a bit filed structure a la

  struct
  {
    unsigned is_foo : 1;
    unsigned has_bar : 1;
  } flags;

It has to read the corresponding byte, set or delete the target
bit, then write it back.  At least if the assembler does not
support atomic bit operations.

Hi,

I was wondering if it could be possible (without too much effort) to have
the possibility to place the titlebar outside the borders.
I mean something like this:

TTTTTTTTTTTTT
BAAAAAAAAAAAB
BAAAAAAAAAAAB
BAAAAAAAAAAAB
BBBBBBBBBBBBB

(T: Titlebar, B: Border, A: Application's Area)

instead of the classic:

BBBBBBBBBBBBB
BTTTTTTTTTTTB
BAAAAAAAAAAAB
BAAAAAAAAAAAB
BBBBBBBBBBBBB

This would let the user define a lot of new themes that are not possible as
long as the titlebar has to stay inside the borders and their
shapes/colors.

The closer to the source code, the better.
But:

There are commands in functable.c that are not meant for the end
user, for example "set_mask".  An additional flag in the macro call
could solve that.

The one line description is very close to the first sentence
in the man page that describes the command.  Very likely they
could be identical.  A program that used functable.c
to generate parts of fvwm.1.in could solve that too.

I've been trying to debug this, but I'm pretty much stuck.
I've been working off the workers list, but in this case,
I'm copying the list since I'm out of ideas, and I see something
pretty strange.

The original problem is an "Openinterface" application from Sun
that seems to exit when one of its child windows closes.
Tomi suspects that Fvwm is telling the application to close.

The last 4 tests I've run fail to duplicate the problem.
I don't have any reason to suspect that additional runs
will make the problem come back.

I did some Google searches for "Openinterface" and I fail to
find anything that explains what it is.

I also searched for "rm6" and "fvwm" and didn't turn up anything
useful.

Here's the thing that's strange:

The last test I did, I ran rm6 inside an Xnest window with nothing
else active inside the Xnest window, not even Fvwm.  Ie. I ran
rm6 without a window manager.

The strange thing is, rm6 came up with a border and titlebar.
Using the border, I was able to resize the window, and clicking
on the border, I got a popup menu that looked to me like an
mwm menu.  I did some "ps" commands and wasn't able to find any
window manager running.  Running this way, I wasn't able to get
the status popup to show, but I was able to get the about screen
to come up.  (Also with a border.)
I wasn't able to duplicate the problem this way
though.

>From this, I conclude that rm6 is way too involved with the
window manager.  I don't know what its doing to put borders
on itself, but it appears to be detecting the absence of
the window manager and doing something.

I think we need more information about Openinterface.

Mikhael/Olivier, I had sent an email with regards to the attached
patch to FBidiJoin.c to this list (as well as in private) so as
to include the the required changes/fixes to the shaping/joining
file.  I'm not sure if my email was received as I didn't get any
responses nor did I see the changes committed to CVS.

I'm attaching an archive which include a 'diff -ubB' (patch) of
the changes as well as the entire file itself (it'll include
cosmetic changes along with the fixes).

Apologies if this issue has already been taken care of.

Regards,

 - Nadim

Further developments:

I find I can't create the problem in an Xnest window,
but I can on :0.  Thats seems very consistent.

Using prints, I see that HandleUnmapNotify calls
destroy_window leading to the window the main window
being destroyed.

HandleUnmapNotify doesn't seem to get called inside Xnest.

I think what I need to do is print more of the information
about the event.  Right now, I have no idea how to do that,
or what to look for,
so I have to do more research.  Of course, hints would be
appreciated.

Doesn't an Unmap event indicate the application has unmapped
itself?  Looking at the logic in HandleUnmapNotify, it looks
like its not that simple.

Add this after the "if (!fw)" clause in HandleUnmalNotify():

  fprintf(stderr,
	"hun: w=0x%08x f=0x%08x, synthetic=%d '%s'\n",
	(int)te->xunmap.event, te->xunmap.send_event,
	(int)fw, (fw) ? fw->visible_name : "(null");

te->xunmap.event is the client window id that was unmapped.  If
te->xunmap.send_event is true, the client requested transition to
withdrawn state.

> Doesn't an Unmap event indicate the application has unmapped
> itself?

No, fvwm gets an XUnmapNotify when the X server unmaps a client
window.  It does not matter why the window was unmapped..  I can't
think of anything else but to find all places where
XUnmapWindow(), XDestroyWindow() or XWithdrawWindow() is called for
a client window throughout the fvwm core and print debug output for
each (et least the window id and the title).  But to be honest, I
don't expect much to come out of the whole debug session.  Since
you said that the app tries to be its own window manager, I
strongly suspect that its doing something terribly wrong.

It may help to watch the events flying around prior to the window
being unmapped.

When you said that you see problem only with :0 and I did some testing
also and found out that's true.  At work I'm using dual screen system
and the problem only occurs with :0.0 not with :0.1

I tried fvwm 1.2.4r and it's also just fine.

Gee, maybe I'm not hopeless, I already have all that.
Here's what I gathered:

AddWindow: entered
AddWindow: window 8164FE0, window name is RAID Manager - dog.bert.sun.fi
AddWindow: entered
AddWindow: window 815FBD0, window name is About...
HandleUnmapNotify: calling destroy_window 815FBD0, event C00026, window c00026, Root 26, send_event 0
destroy_window: entered
destroy_window: About...
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleUnmapNotify: calling destroy_window 8164FE0, event C00012, window c00012, Root 26, send_event 0
destroy_window: entered
destroy_window: RAID Manager - dog.bert.sun.fi
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered
HandleDestroyNotify: calling destroy_window
destroy_window: entered

The debug statement in HandleUnmapNotify looks like this:

	fprintf(stderr,"HandleUnmapNotify: calling destroy_window %X, event %X, window %X, Root %X, send_event %X\n",
		(int)fw,(int)te->xunmap.event,
		(int)te->xunmap.window,
		(int)Scr.Root,
		(int)te->xunmap.send_event);

What you labeled as "synthetic" I've got labeled as "window".
I wanted to know if it was a synthetic event, but I didn't know
how to do that.  What value would fw have if it was synthetic?

In destroy_window, theres one statment showing entry and another
when fw is non-zero.

OK, I think you are saying that there are other places a window
can get unmapped/destroyed/withdrawn by fvwm other than destroy_window.
I'll try to find all the other places and see if I can trace them.

Good.  Thats my feeling too.
The actual application executable has a name that ends in .EXE,
(a sure sign of trouble).  But I don't think this is another one
of those Mainsoft applications (like Rational Rose).

We don't seem to have any debug logic that produces a trace of events.
It seems like it would be pretty useful.

Same here.  It has a problem on Linux vt7 (:0),
but works fine on Linux vt8 (:1).

> I tried fvwm 1.2.4r and it's also just fine.

Do you mean it works on both :0.0 and :0.1?

BTW, in my last email, I misspoke, the executable ends in
.exec, not .EXE.  (I'll wake up soon.)  At least its not guilty
of the sin of trying to work under Windows, but that doesn't
explain why its trying to be its own window manager.

I don't think just the events help, its not clear where they
originate:

Fvwm event: UnmapNotify

destroy_window: RAID Manager - dog.bert.sun.fi
Fvwm event: FocusOut
Fvwm event: LeaveNotify

I could add window id to the events that its appropriate for,
but I don't know that it would be any clearer.  Still, its
educational to see all this stuff.

It would be neat to be able to turn a trace  like this off and on with
a special keypress or buttonpress.

Humm ..., you start to write this code. If you do not want to finish
it during the freeze, I think it will be more safe that _you_ disable
this code by using "#ifdef" (as you know it). Using "#ifdef" will
allow to finish this code after 2.6.

If this code is ok and finished I do not think we should move back to
2.5.3.  If a bug is found in this code at some point, then the
fvwm-workers will try to fix it.

I will do this (beginning of 2003).

I'm implementing new styles to control allowed operations on windows.
Looked at the code in decorations.c (is_function_allowed) I see that the
MWM hint Close disables both Close and Destroy.
So I'm not quite sure what is the best thing to do: Follow this behavoiur
with the new style, implement an additional style or always permit
Destroy,
There is also a comment in the code: 
/* shouldn't destroy always be allowed?? */

Maybe that should be so, Destroy should always be possible.
Thought I would want to hear som opinions.

Destroy is still possible, thru keybindings, mousebindings,
and root context menus.

The source code for mwm is now downloadable.
I'd say whatever mwm does is the right thing to do.

Is Destroy handled specifically when it's used?
As far as I can see the code in is_function_allowed is the same for
Close and Destroy:

case F_CLOSE:
	if (IS_TEAR_OFF_MENU(t))
	{
		/* always allow this on tear off menus */
		break;
	}
	if (!(functions & MWM_FUNC_CLOSE))
	{
		return False;
	}
	break;
case F_DESTROY: /* shouldn't destroy always be allowed??? */
	if (IS_TEAR_OFF_MENU(t))
	{
		/* always allow this on tear off menus */
		break;
	}
	if (!(functions & MWM_FUNC_CLOSE))
	{
		return False;
	}
	break;

If I've not missed anything (have got an hangover today... ^^ ), this
could be written as:

case F_CLOSE:
case F_DESTROY:
if (IS_TEAR_OFF_MENU(t))
        {
                /* always allow this on tear off menus */
                break;
        }
        if (!(functions & MWM_FUNC_CLOSE))
        {
                return False;
        }
        break;


Also I'm thinking about wether Style Unclosable should apply also for
tear-off menus. 
The argument in favour: The user has requested this
expliciltly through a style
The arguments against: It is incosistent with how hints are handled and
there is no other way to close it (what does destroy do on a tear-off,
kill fvwm?).

Yes, I guess this would be a good idea.

I will look at this when I get time. During the holidays I will visit my
parents, unfortunatly they only have Win2000....

I too feel that a window should always be destroyable by fvwm just like
xkill does it. But there is another solution to this.

You didn't say what Closable should mean, but I would think this is a
user's setting to disable closing of some otherwise closable window.
So it should affect all Delete, Close and Destroy to be useful.

I think the problem of window operations disabled by hints or style may be
solved by introducing a new command/prefix Force (like Silent) that would
force Move/Resize/Iconify/Close otherwise disabled.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't think we need Dominik to disable it,
its pretty clear where the #ifdef would go.
(Around line 4663 in menus.c.)

Hmm, hangover, I'LL TRY NOT TO SHOUT!

Yep, its the same.

It only takes a second to try it.
(No it doesn't kill Fvwm.)

I don't know why we would need a Style Unclosable.
We have more direct methods of removing the close button
from a titlebar.  (I know it affect context menus too.)

I think the idea of the MWM hint, is that applications that didn't
implement the delete window protocol would set the hint.  This
was to encourage the user to use other means to close the window,
perhaps the file->close menu entry.
It all seems pretty pointless anyway, Fvwm can still apply close/delete
to the window.  I always thought it was more for appearance.

Well, too late :-)
I already implemented (Un)Maximizable, (Un)Iconifiable (spelleing?),
(Un)Closable.
I also implemented  AllowMaximizeFixedSize/DisallowMaximizeFixedSize
if DisallowMaximizeFixedSize is on, if resize is not permitted then
maximize is automatically also disabled (in is_function_allowed).
AllowMaximizeFixedSize gives the default behaviour ie. maximize is allowed
unless turned off by hints or through the style option.

Yes, I guess it's more for appearance.
But I found a use for Uniconifiable. When using the icon box, either I
have to turn on icon for the icon box

Style * NoIcon
Style FvwmIconBox Icon

or assign a special menu for the icon box window that lacks an iconify
entry.
In my opinion the Uniconifiable style is more clear than using special
functions. And even if you replace all Iconify in the config with a
complex function it's still possible to use an FvwmConsole.

And so for consistency I thought I might as well implement the others.
And I guess I'll trow in conditionals for these 3 aswell.

There is a comment in style.c that says that you have to add code for new
styles in merge_styles() and handle_new_window_style().
In merge_styles I see only code for a few styles and a general merge
routine. Is "on-off-styles" handled automatically?
And how about new windows? It is my impression that the flag fields are
zeroed on creation. If this is so I don't need to do any any special code
here for my new styles. And as far as I can see it works.

The initial style value for bit options is zero by default. To define non
zero default add a corresponding "Style *" in ConfigFvwmDefaults.

Boolean style options are merged automatically if you set corresponding
style masks using macros, so you only need to define macros and call them
when Style command is issued.

I hope you don't name your style options UnIconifiable, since you have
!Iconifiable automatically, this would be the only syntax for boolean
options.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I added styles with and without "Un" for all three (opposites).
Shall all "opposite-names" be removed? And only the !-variant work in the
future? I added the Un variants to be consistent with the existing
options. I guess removing redundant styles will not be done before 2.6

And yes, I defined macros to set the bit masks. So for Iconifiable for
example the bitfield is named is_uniconifiable (since the default value,
0, means not uniconifiable ie. the default value).

Hi,

  I think I can pretty confidently say Fvwm is not shutting down
your application.  I don't know why it closes, but I might have
some hints.

  I have a few different traces.  This one is from Fvwm.
It shows every event Fvwm recieves from X, and every call to
XUnmapWindow or XDestroyWindow that Fvwm makes, and some tracing
in Fvwm's routines for adding and destroying windows.

Between the time the About window closes, and the main window closes
there are multiple entries into Fvwm's destroy_window function,
but it never calls XUnmapWindow or XDestroyWindow.  The first
thing Fvwm knows about the main window is when it recieves an
UnmapNotify.  So the main window decides to close on its own.


Then I have a trace using this command:

truss -f -t'!all' -u:: /usr/lib/osa/bin/rm6

This traces all shared library calls:

13815:        <- libX11:XCheckTypedEvent() = 0
13815:      <- libndvgm:EventNatProcessPendingInvals() = 0xff0ebe08

13815:    <- libndvgm:EVENT_ProcessInval() = 0xe5d30
13815:  <- libndvgm:EVENT_MainLoop() = 4
13815:  -> libndgw:GW_LibExit(0x4, 0x5cbb8, 0x0, 0x1)

13815:          -> libc:_return_zero(0xfeb3e498, 0x77510, 0x0, 0xfeb3a000)
13815:          <- libc:mutex_lock() = 0
13815:          -> libc:_free_unlocked(0xcc768, 0x77510, 0x0, 0xfeb3a000)
13815:          <- libc:_free_unlocked() = 0xcc768
13815:        -> libc:mutex_unlock(0xfeb3e498, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
13815:        -> libc:_return_zero(0xfeb3e498, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
13815:        <- libc:free() = 0
13815:      <- libndcore:S_free() = 0xcc768
13815:    <- libndcore:PTR_Dispose() = 0xcc770
13815:  -> libndvgm:VGM_LibExit(0x4, 0x5cbb8, 0x0, 0x0)
13815:    -> libndvgm:S_ReleaseCriticalResources(0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)

13815:        <- libndres:RES_SetLoadConstructProc() = 0xfeeae9a8
13815:      -> libndvgm:DsplyNatExit(0x1058, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0)

This one is not so easy to understand, but before this
section, I can saw X just carrying on its normal processing.
Then libndvgm:EVENT_ProcessInval returns to the main loop
in the library and comes up with a 4 return code.
Everything after this is the library shutting down the application.

This might be a little clearer is you look at the output from
this truss command:

truss -f -t'!all' -ua.out /usr/lib/osa/bin/rm6

This is tracing function calls in the main.
It shows the main seeing the About window closing, then
the main looks like its repainting its icons.  It looks to
me like the main then becomes aware of the return code
4 from the toolkit its using and exits its main loop
with return code 4.
Thats the APP_Main() = 4.
Then the main exits with return code 0.

Naturally, I'm making some guesses about whats going on
inside libndvgm.  Based on the function names it looks like
some kind of GUI toolkit, but Google didn't turn up anything.

I think the GUI toolkit doesn't like something that goes on.
Its hard to say what.  It has something to do with the combination
of fvwm and DISPLAY :0, but theres nothing obvious in these
traces.  My guess is that the return code 4 is important.

The main app, the launcher, is interesting.
When it comes up, it must set a hint saying it doesn't want
a titlebar because it doesn't display a titlebar for me.
Whats interesting, is there is no close button in the app
and no menu to use to close the app.  It doesn't want a titlebar,
so it doesn't expect to be closed down with the titlebar close button
either.  So how does this thing want to be closed down?

Well, thats all I have.  Sorry I can't tell you exactly whats
wrong or make some adjustment to Fvwm to fix it.  At least
not yet.

I don't see how I can make any more progress with this without
some help from the rm6 developers.

Is there any plans to add that detailed-look when moving and resizing
windows? Like on WindowMaker, and probably others.

Here is the patch for the new styles:
Closable, Iconifiable, Maximizable and AllowMaximizeFixedSize
and conditionals
Closable, Iconifiable and Maximizable

The style AllowMaximizeFixedSize turns on and off the possibility to
maximise windows that are fixed size (ie. the function Resize is not
allowed).

You may need to write some code in style.c, function
check_window_style_change() and in update.c update.c to take care of
dynamic changes of the style.  The rule is that all styles can be
changed without a recapture.

Yes, but from the names I guess that Iconifyable and UnIconifyable
are complementary, but not opposite of each other, right?

And I think we should not waste our time debugging broken

  OpaqueMoveSize unlimited
  Style * ResizeOpaque

Do you mean opaque moving (if not, please explain what you mean)?

So, either fvwm unmapped the window or the application unmapped
it.  But the application definitely did not ask fvwm to withdraw
the window.  Do you get an XDestroyNotify event for the window
too?

If the client window has a frame is should be a pointer to the
window structure, and NULL otherwise.  The send_event member does
not affect fw.

I don't see any XWithdrawWindow() and XDestroyWindow() calls (as
expected), but there are several XUnmapWindow() calls.  I forgot
to mention XReparentWindow(), which unmaps the window if it was
already mapped.

Perhaps you could just comment out all XUnampWindow() calls on the
client window and all Reborder() calls for the moment.  If this
still happens we can safely assume that the application unmapped
or destroyed the window itself.

I often put in a lot of debug statements, but in general I am only
interested in a few events, but with very detailed output.  One
big debug switch wouldn't work too well - we'd need more control
over the debug level and the verbosity of each event type.

the FANCY_TITLEBAR ifdef
* The syntax is:
MultiPixmap Main {Colorset,Solid,TiledPixmap,StretchedPixmap} {cs,color,file}...
the old syntax is supported.
* Various improvement in MultiPixmap:
- You can really add to title style
- UseTitleStyle use a grouped logic (e.g., LeftButtons Colorset cs applies
the colorset cs to the left buttons rectangle and not to each left buttons)
- {Left,Right}OfText and {Left,Right}End can be StretchedPixmap: there are
"YStretched"
- Sticky lines placement
* New {Title,Button}Style style StretchedPixmap
* New libs interface function: PGraphicsCreateTiledPicture
* Added a global (Scr) alpha GC

I think thats all resolved now, but I thought I'd mention,
I put a macro for XUnmapWindow in fvwm.h, remapped the function
call to print the __FILE__ and __LINE__ information, then
invoked MyXUnmapWindow where the real XUnmapWindow was called.
It seemed to work pretty well.

Well, I did it with one big switch statement.  It worked pretty
well.  I don't know if I should bother to commit it as ifdef'd debug
code or not, its not that hard to recreate.  I agree, most often
its just one or 2 events that are of interest.  I think I'll just
hold onto it.

I'll get a bug report submitted to Sun.  I'm grateful to Tomi, Dan and
Dominik for their investigative work.  The fvwm workers went above and
beyond, once again.

hi
i've sent a mail to Jason L Tibbitts III asking his where to send a screenshot, and he told me so 
to ask you.
i'm not sendding it attached since it's big (600 kb), 'cause i use two 1600x1200 screens (+xinerama).
the weird thing is that since i know .fvwmrc syntax enough to write my config file from my memory i
never upgraded to fvwm2, only edited 1.24 sources to alter window title alignment.
it's a bg desktop in full work (my work is unix sysadmin for a cars manufacturer you can easily tell
from my mail address)
if you want it, i'll send it to you. i'm not subscribed to fvwm-workes, only fvwm@fvwm.org list.

thanks in advance,

m.

Suzanne can you try your various themes and report any pbs?

I saw some pbs with multi part priorities.
The logic is as follows (I tried to do not modify it at any essential
point but maybe I miss something):
 - If we have the space to draw the full text draw it
 - Then, If we have the space for the LeftOfText image draw it
 - Then, If we have the space for the RightOfText image draw it
 - Then, If we have the space for the LeftEnd image draw it
 - Then, If we have the space for the RightEnd image draw it
So the priorities are:
  UnderText, LeftOfText, RightOfText, LeftEnd, RightEnd

Maybe it will be better to make some grouping. Always draw or
do not draw both LeftOfText and RightOfText.  Always draw or
do not draw both LeftEnd and RightEnd. That is using the following
priorities:
 UnderText, (LeftOfText/RightOfText), (LeftEnd/RightEnd)

Also, Maybe it will be better to use the following priorities:
  (LeftOfText/RightOfText), (LeftEnd/RightEnd), UnderText
at least for long title?

Suzzanne, Mikhael?

We don't support fvwm1 and don't encourage anyone to use it.
I don't think I want to put up a screenshot based on fvwm1.

I've added this because I think this useful and because it was a one
line patch after the MultiPixmap merge. But in fact I think that
something like "FitStretchedPixmap" is more useful (an other "one
line patch"): stretch the pixmap only if it is to big for the
destination.  Does someone has a better name than "FitStretchedPixmap"?

About names. I think that we should have a new Style which rotates
(always CW) the TitleStyle decorations. What about

  RotateVerticalTitleDecor / !RotateVerticalTitleDecor

Ive just started using it...

Is there any intention of addng the full geometry setting to it?  Ive
hacked mine to be one button_width wide and a hardcoded x.

Ive also found an undesirable in multirow use.
It tended to add to a row before using all the rows.

     tw = array->w / ((array->count / NRows)+1);	    // old
     tw = array->w / (((array->count+(NRows-1)) / NRows));  // fix


Other wishlist:
For multi-row, tuck clock/mail under Start.
Add its own skip-list. For instance, i killed mailtool since it's already in
the mail icon.
Make the "..." thing turnoffable (i killed it in mine).
If iconname is empty, use non-iconname, optionally truncated on left.
Seprate colroset for background (transparent?) from button colorset.

Thanx

No, sorry. In some window managers, when you move a window the window is
moved opaquely and for instance on the left side of the window there is
a line that goes from the top side of the screen to the bottom lined up
with the left edge of the window, and on the left edge it shows the x
location of that side of the window. It's like that on all the other
sides of the window to. I haven't used WindowMaker in a long time, and
that's the best I could explain it. I think WindowMaker calls this
"Technical Style Moving". Thanks.

Something like this is needed. It even may [be the only way to] activate
an internal cache for tinted images/gradients.

I see several posibilities, like:

  CopyColorset m n
  Colorset n Reuse m, fg yellow

Probably the second is more useful although the first is more clean.

Also real dependancies between colorsets would be nice (you change m, then
n is automatically reapplied), but this is pretty difficult to implement,
a one time copy is good enough.

Mikhael.

Hi,
I've made a new screenshot here:
http://www.xmission.com/~sa/screenshot-1024x768.png

I already have one on the fvwm screenshot page. If you would replace
that one with this one, that would be great!

thanks,
Shawn Anderson.

I hope I understand this correctly. I am sure there is a term in the
image processing field for this. If not, maybe:

  SprainedImage

Yes, I want to start to refer to XBM/XPM/PNG files as "Image" in user
configs as more intuitive. If you want I may rename all new names.

Actually I think that the current TitleStyle Pixmap should behave this
way, so no new option is needed. It seems pretty useless currently and
we may just change it to be more useful when sprained.

If you are at it, can you please fix the problem with Pixmap/TiledPixmap
in 2.5.x. An image is drawn at +2+2 if title is raised/sunken. I think
that the correct way is to handle it as in 2.4.x. I.e. it should always
start at +0+0 and the following commands should only add/remove relief
over the static image rather than shifting it.

  TitleStyle Active -- raised
  TitleStyle Active -- flat

> About names. I think that we should have a new Style which rotates
> (always CW) the TitleStyle decorations. What about
> 
>   RotateVerticalTitleDecor / !RotateVerticalTitleDecor

I would like if it is _always_ rotated by -90/+90/+180 depending on the
rotation of the title text. So this +90/0 flag would be redundant for me.
I am pretty convinced we don't need unrotated vertical title decorations.

  LeftTitleRotatedCW   - rotate both text and decorations by +90
  !LeftTitleRotatedCW  - rotate both text and decorations by -90

The button order is not affected by this, only text/image rotation.
We should remove LeftTitleRotatedCCW, since we have !LeftTitleRotatedCW.

More comments later after I actually try the new functionality.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't think sprain is the right word.

Sprain:
       1.
       (tr.) to injure (a joint) by a sudden twisting or wrenching of its
       ligaments.
       2.
       the resulting injury to such a joint, characterized by swelling
       and temporary disability.


Is the image streched or shrunk?  It sounds like its shrunk,
never streched.

I think the options are:

shrunk (made smaller)
streched (made bigger)
fit (streched or shrunk)

OK.

Expect some delays, but I'll get to it.

Shawn, you seem to be an advanced user.

Can you please spend some time and create an fvwm-themes theme of your
setup, so any user could get a look like this by one mouse click?

It's not hard once you read the fvwm-themes documentation. And you don't
really need to read it if you just copy/modify files from other themes.
When you are finished you should end up with these files (or any subset):

  background
  buttons
  colors
  menustyle
  windowlook

The nice thing is that they are relatively independent of each other, so
you may start with one file, fully test it, then move to another file.
Optionally add modules subdirectory, your pager uses nice images.

Don't despair if your colors@ or buttons@ do not work well with other
themes, I will fix this once you submit an initial version.
I or Olivier may also help you to solve any obstacle. Thanks.

Regards,
Mikhael.

My one word to one word local translator translates it to the synonym of
"streched". Poor bad dictionary, sorry.

Actually there are more options. :)

For example, try the current:

  TitleStyle Active Pixmap /any/image.png

If title width is small, only the left part of image.png is shown.
If title width is big, image.png is centered. Kind of FixedImage.

For me this is useless. What I and hopefully Olivier mean is this:
If title width is small, only the left part of image.png is shown.
If title width is big, image.png is streched.

This time my both dictionaries agree on the word tensile. TensileImage.
Or just Image (alias of Pixmap) if we change the behaviour.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think it makes sense to attack this from the point of view of the
image, not the container.  Ie.

If the image is larger, its truncated.
If the image is smaller, its stretched.

Truncation is a little bit like the null case, Ie. nothing is
done to the image.  So I think I'd still go with stretched.

I think that given an image WxH and a container AxB, there are the
following useful options to fit one into another:

[the first means what to do for x direction, the second - for y direction]

  1) fit,     fit
  2) fit,     tile
  3) fit,     stretch
  4) tile,    fit
  5) tile,    tile
  6) tile,    stretch
  7) stretch, fit
  8) stretch, tile
  9) stretch, stretch

  10) aspect fit

In (10) image becomes AxB/W*A or A/H*BxB whichever is greater than AxB.
I think at least (3), (6) and (9) make a lot of sense for titles.

Do you think there are more options? Do you think some are redundant?
For example, since title has a fixed height (more or less) and fully
variable width, then (1), (4), (7) are not essential for the title design.

There are also partial images (that may fill only a part of AxB).

  11-19) center/left/right, center/top/bottom
  20-28) fit/tile/stretch,  center/top/bottom
  29-37) center/left/right, fit/tile/stretch

For me the first full-sized 10 are very useful for an arbitrary colorset.
Currently we only support (1), (5) and (10).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've no real opinion but no objection. But the "Pixmap" syntax should be
supported.

I am agree. Any objection? There are 2 pbs: (i) backwarde compatibility
and (ii) ressource usage (e.g., when you resize a window at small size
each buttons will be resized).

One can see this as a new functionality: it is useless to draw the
pixmap under the relief. Say you have a 22x22 image button set with
Pixmap on a 22x22 raised title bar button, then it seems clear to me
that we should resize the image button to 18x18 and apply it at +2+2.
Maybe for TiledPixmap we should always start at +0+0, I do not
know. But I do not see pbs for Pixmap.

Yes, but some decoration is symetric (a solid color, a centered gradient,
some TiledPixmap decoration, RootTransparent) and the rotation of the
decoration will use some resource. I see  RotateVerticalTitleDecor as
an attribute of the decoration. Yes, the rotation should follow the
text rotation (but the individual buttons should not be rotated and
the buttons set should be rotated CW).

This is the current Pixmap behavior

The new StretchedPixmap do this, but also if the image is larger it's
resized to fit into the destination. Is "FitPixmap" ok for this?

We may add this behavior (If the image is smaller, its stretched, if
not do nothing) and name it StretchedPixmap (it is easy).

I do not want to add one tone of new Pixmap style type now (related to
tile and x/y directions). I see one style type which is useful *and*
easy to implement (I do not want to spent 2 hours or more to debug 10
new complicate style type): If the image is smaller do nothing (as
Pixmap), if the image is larger resize it to fit into the
destination. Is "ShrunkPixmap" ok?

besides stretching & compacting, is there any plan for other
transformations like mirroring/rotating?

given a small image, say 100x100 pix, i particularly like xv's
"root: symmetrical mirrored" (-rmode 9) option.  this option is best
suited for tile work on large backgrounds like root window or
WindowList menu.

No, that's not possible, and there are no plans to add something
like this.

I would not consider (i) as a problem, it was never documented that the
image is centered when smaller than title, so a user can't rely on this.
But I am not sure what is (ii). I thought that when the image is larger it
should not be shrunk, only truncated, so please explain (ii) again.

If you can shrink the 22x22 icon to 18x18, it is ok (but is it nice?).
It is also fine with me to truncate this icon to the central 18x18 region.
What is not fine with me is to trancate it to the left-top 18x18 region
throwing away 4 right and 4 bottom pixels complitelly.

The problem is that the title width is fixed and it does not take into an
account relief at all, so image should not take relief into account too.
For me, if title height is not changed when you execute 2 commands above,
i.e. when relief is added or removed, the image should not be shifted.
Taking a central part and applying it to +2+2 would be the same.

For me, tiled images and even mini icons should always be rotated too! :)
A centered gradient in titles is rare, so rotating it is not a problem.
Of course for transparent parts rotation is void.

I can't imagine a titlebar design where this boolean flag would be useful.
But if you want to have it as boolean, I have no problem. I just think
that "Vertical" name would not be exact. Maybe [!]UseTitleDecorRotation,
(defaulting to 1) since we may have +180 rotation too.

Mikhael.

The first if-else refers to the current Pixmap that we want to replace.
The second if-else refers to how I understand your original suggestion.

FitPixmap is ok, but sounds unnatural to me. Looking at the dictionary...
AdjustedPixmap or Pixmap (this behaviour is good to be a default).

StretchedPixmap or Pixmap (this is good to be a default too).

The name is ok, but I don't think it is very useful (centered image).
I listed the only useful cases for me in another thread: fit/tile/stretch.

I would only support these image convertion options in Colorset.
All *Pixmap that are not colorset options may be supported, but obsolete.
For me the only good syntax, open for extensions, is:

  Colorset n Image|SecondImage|Shape [Tiled|Stretched|Adjusted] image.xpm

The default is either Stretched or Adjusted, I don't care.

Mikhael.

After some time these bindings stop working:

At the same time window growing and icon manager
die. The mouse support in MidnightCommander dies either.
There are no messages in ".FVWM2-errors".
Restarting does not help, I have to log out and back in.

It seems to be the same bug as in the report No. 935
by Jeremy Slade. Initially I thought it might have been a
specific AMD/K6 problem. However, I get it also
on a Pentium 800 MHz machine with RH 7.3.

Ok, I reformatted the resulting file again to follow the same formatting
as in other our sources. But please never use in the future diff -bB
options, because the patched version will contain a mix of TAB indented
lines and 5 space indented lines at random (very strewn).

I tested the results and seems to work ok with unicode and iso8859-8.
But I can't see iso8859-6 in titles now. I have a lot of iso8859-6
fonts and I was able to see it in the past. I run:

  xterm -name Arabic -title "`env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date`"

Now, I can see joined Arabic with unicode font:

  Style Arabic Font StringEncoding=iso8859-6:*-arabeyes-*/iso10646-1

(so all these font prefixes and suffixes may be useful after all).
But if I use iso8859-6 font directly I see only reversed question signs:

  Style Arabic Font -lbi-naskhi-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-6

This font does work if I use it with xterm -fn '*naskhi-medium*-12*'
and I see Arabic in it after: env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date

So something does not work. Can anyone see iso8859-6 text and font?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not always nice it depends. Our resizing algo a really weak but I
do not think that we have the time to implement elaborated resizing
algo.

I do not know. Any way you will not have this problem with MiltiPixmap
and Colorset.

Dominik, I think it is you whose adds this +2+2 offset so maybe you
can comment on this?

I think it is. All this is essentially for buttons. I will add
StretchedPixmap, AdjustedPixmap, ShrunkPixmap and left Pixmap
as it is now. So everybody will be happy.

I thought I'd removed all the tabs (untabify), but OK - will keep that

Keep in mind that iso8859-6 doesn't spell out proper Arabic visual
support since it doesn't include all the shaped/joined glyphs and
as such you should always revert to an 10646-1 font (which ought to
include unicode's Form-B glyphs).  Also in passing, the encoding
should be UTF-8.

So the following will work,

  Style * Font StringEncoding=UTF-8:*-arabeyes-*/iso10646-1
or
  Style * Font *-arabeyes-*/iso10646-1

(the UTF-8 is implied with a 10646-1 font indicator, per what
 Olivier had wisely implemented :-)

I would also think that the following ought to work (but I've
been told that it doesn't), shouldn't this work (Olivier) ?

  Style * Font StringEncoding=UTF-8:*-arabeyes-*

With regard to your 'naskhi' font - if it contains the required
Form-B glyphs (U+FE70 - U+FEFF), then the following ought to work,

  Style Arabic Font *-naskhi-medium-*-iso8859-6/iso10646-1

No, this will not work, because the string encoding is not utf-8.

If it is iso8859-6 font (not unicode), it can't be promoted to iso10646-1.

Nadim, you seem to imply that the only valid way to write Arabic is
unicode. But this is not correct. Here is a valid Arabic that is not
unicode: env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date

We supported all iso encodings. I see no valid reason to stop to support
iso8859-6. I think the problem is that once shaping is applied fribidi
(or is it iconv?) can't go back to iso8859-6 and uses question marks then,
so we should only apply shaping for unicode encoding of original strings.

Just tried this theory. Yes, if I disable shaping, I see iso8859-6 with:

  Exec env LANG=C xterm -name Arabic -title "`env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date`"
  Style Arabic Font '*-medium-*-12-*-iso8859-6'

You may try these fvwm commands yourself with and without shaping code.
I don't believe you prefer question marks to non-shaped Arabic. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Guys,

I have been experiencing the exact problem that you described in your
various e-mails.

I can't pinpoint what causes the problem, but I experience it quite
often.  It seems that stopping FVWM and restarting will cure the problem
for a bit, but after (something happens) the problem crops up once
again.

The application I started seeing this with is the GUI that accompanies
the EMC Data Manager.  I know immediately if things are working or not
because the window immediately gets closed.  I usually get an error
similar to the following:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GetWindowAttributes)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800001
  Serial number of failed request:  921
  Current serial number in output stream:  922

Today I started to attempt to "debug" this, and looked for help on any
debugging options when I came across this thread.  I shut FVWM down and
restarted it.  I stopped and started the application numerous times with
no trouble.  I'm not sure if the number of windows I had open has
anything to do with things or not, but the problem came back after I had
a few XTerms open.  Now that I don't have that many XTerms open, the
problem has gone away (but then again, I have 5 or 6 Mozilla windows
open).

I also saw the same problem with rm6 (release 06.22.01.54).  I just
installed the app today and started to familiarize myself with the it. 
The initial window comes up with no problems.  When I open any of the
other windows (i.e. Configuration, Status, Recovery, etc.) I get the
window, again with no trouble.  That newly created window closes,
however, when I move the mouse over the buttons near the top of the
window (just below the File, Module, Options, Help section).

Both premature closes happen during the same time frame.  Meaning, if I
start the EDM window and it immediately closes, then I can also get rm6
windows to close just by moving the mouse over the buttons, and vice
versa.  If the action is happening with rm6, then the EDM window will
not start.

Once one application starts functioning properly, the other does as
well.

I'm sad to say that for a while I had moved to GNOME because I was not
seeing these problems there.  But I can't handle GNOME any more and
wanted to come back 'home'.

Please let me know what I can do to help track this problem down.

I'm running on Red Hat 7.3 if that matters.

Am I taking the previous e-mails correct when I say that it appears that
these problems do not crop up on :1, and only on :0?

Thanks for helping!

Thats pretty strange, any chance EMC Data Manager and rm6 use
the same GUI toolkit?  If you do an ldd on the EMC binary do you
see anything that looks like libndcore, libndvgm?

Note that in the case of rm6, the rm6 was not the binary,
it was just a shell, I had to look in the shell to figure out
what the real name of the binary was.

OK, the application is calling XGetWindowAttributes and
getting a bad window return code.  Ie. the window doesn't
exist.  The window id is 0x2800001.  You can see window
id's with the xwininfo command.  The easiest way is to type:

xwininfo -root -tree

The window id will be different each time you run, so run
this command just before you create the problem.  Then
we should know which window its trying to read the
attributes on that it can't find.

Well, I think you've given us some useful hints.

Strange as it seems, thats what we observed.

iso8859-6 is a subset of iso10646-1 -- again, iso8859-6 alone is
simply not usable; its visually incorrect without shaping and one
is not able to shape sans Form-B glyphs (there are a plethora of
posts regarding this topic on the 'net - I can certainly send you
the links if you like so as not to go on a tangent on this forum).

I don't have any Arabic locale on this machine - sorry.  But I do
indeed imply and state that Arabic should be used with UTF-8 and
nothing else (not even CP-1256 :-)  I'm actually curious to why
fvwm doesn't simply default to UTF-8 at all times ?

I don't think its a question of support.  Fvwm is doing the right
thing.  I view this as "faulty/missing font" issue.  The font file
you were using simply doesn't have the _required_ Form-B glyphs and
thus Arabic can't be displayed properly.  Its like wanting to display
chinese without having the correct chinese glyphs and getting question
marks instead.

Out of curiosity, how do
'env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date' and
'env LANG=ar_JO.UTF-8     date' differ ?

iso8859-6 is an code-table representation (ie. an assignment of
integer numbers to characters) where-as UTF-8 is a representation
format (sequence of bytes).  So I'm not sure what you mean above
by "support all iso encodings".  In other words, my ability to do
StringEncoding=iso8859-6 and StringEncoding=UTF-8 seems a bit like
comparing apples to oranges.  I can understand the following encodings
UTF-8, USC-2, USC-4 and UTF-16, but don't quite understand a setting
akin to 'StringEncoding=iso8859-6' (unless fvwm is mapping names to
encodings which is what I thought it did - "convenience magic").

> Just tried this theory. Yes, if I disable shaping, I see iso8859-6 with:

What you see (non-shaped glyphs) is text that most (if not all) Arab
users will dismiss as broken (yup, shaping is that important) and the
reason you see '??' (or other) when shaping is enabled is due to the
fact that you are missing those Form-B (U+FE70 - U+FEFF) glyphs in
your font file (include them and you are fine).

> You may try these fvwm commands yourself with and without shaping code.
> I don't believe you prefer question marks to non-shaped Arabic. :)

Actually I would personally prefer questions marks as it will tell me I
have a setup problem instead of seeing non-shaped characters (which a user
would incorrectly assume a problem within fvwm).  FYI, this is what most
applications do.

In short, with Arabic UTF-8 and iso10646-1 fonts should be used (at all
times).  If iso10646-1 fonts are unavailable, your font file must include
Form-B glyphs.

I too have experienced some problem im not sure its the same...

it is with the GIMP, I can reproduce it by:

1) starting fvwm (cvs version last updated Dec 16 2002) with no rc file
2) open FvwmConsole and start FvwmPager
3) start the gimp (close all of its dialog windows)
4) make sure the gimp window is the last to have focus then go
   to the pager and change to a different page.
5) restart fvwm with the root menu.

after fvwm restarts, the gimp dissapears (no longer listed by ps aux)
and I get this message:

Gdk-ERROR **: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  serial 12833 error_code 3 request_code 15 minor_code 0

I thought this was a gimp/gtk bug, but it seems related to this one.
can any one reproduce this?

gtk-config --version
1.2.10
gimp-config --version
1.2.3
fvwm-config --version
2.5.6
XFree86 Version 4.2.99.2
Linux 2.4.20

thanks,
sa

I switch to the fvwm-workers.

It seems that these cards which support both 8 and 24 depth do not
have 2 hardwares cmaps, so the auto-detection I try to implement is
useless.  I think that if the default visual has depth 8 (and no fvwm
visual option is used), then we can try to see if there is a TrueColor
depth > 8 visual and if it is the case use this "best" visual.  Dan
what do you think?

I know the theory well now. But you miss my point. I want everything to
work, including iso8859-6. You can't deny that there is such charset (and
encoding) and as you said it is not losing for Arabic. So if a user
requested iso8859-6 fonts (without non iso8859-6 characters, of course)
he don't want to see question marks for valid iso8859-6 characters.

Don't worry about this, I may later fix one-byte Arabic charsets myself.
Or not fix, if you are against supporting all existing Arabic fonts. :)

If you use iso10646-1 fonts, it defaults to utf-8, is not it?

What you say is that all existing CP1256 and iso8859-6 one byte fonts
should show question marks and never Arabic glyphs that they contain.
I don't know, it is not hard to fix this situation.

The first returns regular one-byte Arabic and English characters, totally
40 bytes. The second returns the same text, but in utf-8, 56 bytes.
Only ascii characters (the first 127) are the same in both encodings.
Try: cat Arabic+English-utf8-encoded-file | iconv -f utf-8 -t iso8859-6

By the way, FVWM supports CP-1256 encoding without problems, as far as
I can see, when I set CP-1256 encoded title using:

  env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date | iconv -f iso8859-6 -t cp1256

I even see it correctly shaped (I think) if I use unicode font like:

  Style Arabic Font StringEncoding=CP1256:*-arabeyes-*/iso10646-1

The reason arabeyes is not recognized as iso10646-1 is bugs in this font.

Actually, here I meant more "support all charsets, i.e. fonts".

No, they are not apples and oranges. iso8859-6 is both charset and
encoding, like any other one-byte charset, where one char is one byte.
There are iso8859-6 encoded texts (short) and utf-8 encoded texts (use
more bytes). It is possible to convert such text in one direction, but
not always in another. It is always possible to convert between iso8859-6
and cp1256 texts except for maybe some funky chars, I guess.

If you have text stored in some encoding (iso8859-6 or cp1256), you may
find it useful to be able to convert it to something else, like utf-8
to use with unicode fonts. FVWM allows this using StringEncoding.

Out of curiosity, do you have Arabic text files? Are they all in one or
another unicode encoding? I read literature in several languages, but I
should yet encounter utf-8 text. If there are one byte encodings and there
is only one language (except for English) unicode is a waste of space. :)

Of course, to see one byte encoded text, you should replace "set
encoding=utf-8" in your .vimrc that I know you have.

Mikhael.

I do think it is a simp/gtk bug and I don't think it is related.
It looks like gtk is fiddling with one of the windows created by
fvwm and does not catch the situation when this window was already
destroyed.

Sounds good to me.

Sun is making the default visual 8 because there are still a few
apps that won't work at anything but 8 bit.  I see no problem
with apps ignoring the default visual and using the best visual.

Good, that confirms that the EMC problem is the same problem

Run this on the Linux machine, (the display with the problem).

Please send BOTH the error message from EDM and the
xwininfo that existed just before the error message is
generated.  There is a window id in the error message that
I want to find in the xwininfo output.

I think that shows that the problem has some kind of random
component to it.  The same thing with vmware, its not vmware
itself causing the problem, it just changing something enough
to make this problem start to appear.

Well I seem to have confused fvwm I just got a video card that supports
to monitors as one screen.

Fvwm and a 3200 geometry are very confused. Most notablly when I drag
a window from montior one to the second I can watch the x coord go up
until I get to 1600 and then it resets to zero. this really brakes
things like the initail placement of FvwmButtons at -0+0 it winds up at
1600+0. but if i place it where I expect it to be and use FvwmIdent I
get correct screen coordinates in the 3thousandths.

I doubt anyone has the setup to reproduce this but its been a while
since I've done editing and I know you've made substantial event code
changes so some pointers would be helpful.

I rather guess the video card confuses the X server.  If what I
understand is correct, fvwm is not even aware of the second screen
(unless you use Xinerama or dual head).  That sounds as if the
display width is only 1600, not 3200.  What does

  $ xwininfo -root

say?

The video driver actually reports the combined size of 3200 
so as far as X is concenred it is just one wide screen.

I wasn't sure whether you wanted me to run this on the Linux box or on
the EDM, so I've attached the output from both.  The file names are
pretty descriptive as to what each file contains.  (Although, if the
DISPLAY variables are the same, not sure that this really matters
anyway.)

This is certainly interesting.  I'm sure you'll pick this up by looking
at the xwininfo output I've attached.  This seems to be pretty
consistent.  I'm running VMWare when the problem exists, when I exit
VMWare, the problem goes away.  I don't even have to be running the
virtual machine, either.  I just have to have the initial window up and
running.

The problem with rm6 is when I move over those buttons, it trys to
display pop-up text.  When VMWare is running, it causes the window to
close.  Without VMWare, the window stays up.  Sometimes it loses focus,
but once I move the pointer out and back in again, things are fine from
there on out.

Hopefully this helps some more.

I just started :1 and verified things act the same as :0.

I won't argue with that - but in all honesty I don't think anyone will
do that unless its for shear testing/curiosity.

I'm not against it and in theory you are correct - it should work as
well so that fvwm doesn't deviate from "normality".  I'm a bit biased
as a great deal of us on arabeyes.org have been advocating UTF-8/ISO10646
since its solves so many of our problems; do go ahead and fix it, it
shan't affect the proper shaping doing in utf-8.

And fixed it should be (I'm recanting my stance in favor of "theoretical

Again theoretically - cool :-)  but I sure would not advocate anyone to
use M$'s encodings.

So the above is saying take my strings (which are CP1256) and convert
them to UTF-8 (since iso10646-1 is noted) and use the noted font to
display them, right ?  If so it makes total sense - the man page should
note that 'StringEncoding' acts as the '-from' for 'iconv'.

OK, cool - then what I note above ("acts as the '-from'") is correct.

Everything that I have is in UTF-8 (diskspace/memory is cheap); I'd
rather be consistent and correct :-)  If you'd like some Arabic UTF-8
samples, let me know.

:-) and the various emacs settings,

 (setq locale-coding-system   'utf-8)
 (set-terminal-coding-system  'utf-8)
 (set-keyboard-coding-system  'utf-8)
 (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
 (prefer-coding-system        'utf-8)

There were 4 attachments to the last e-mail.  If they didn't come across
properly, let me know.  But the output from before and after should be
there.

All enough just to make it wonderful to track, huh?

There were 4 attachments, but the error message with the windowid
was missing.  I need the windowid of the window, just before the
problem occurs.

Again, I need 2 things, the error message that Fvwm prints,
just before the problem occurs and the xwininfo that goes with
that particular message.

The window id changes every time a window is created, an old
message or xwininfo won't do.  They both have to be from the
same debug session.

I have no idea where the 1600 is coming from.  Fvwm can not have
made it up by itself, it must have been reported by X.  Can you
put some debug output in fvwm.c that prints out Scr.MyDisplayWidth
right after line 1122 where it is set?

Please compress large attachments.  There are people on the list
who dial in with a modem.  Downloading 300k mails is a pain.

Scr.MyDisplayWidth is equals to 3200 at that point.

I seem to have tracked down the problem X was running XINERMA 
and I didn't realize it, I'm still not sure I under stand the 
window placement but now I know what docs to brush up on.

Hi !

I have a button in the titlebar of all my windows, build as:

DestroyFunc Maximize-Func
AddToFunc Maximize-Func         C Maximize 0   100
+                               D Maximize 100 100

Mouse 0         2       A       Maximize-Func

If I have two xterm windows on my screen, and single-click on this button 
of the focussed one, the selected window is maximized, but 'underneath/below' 
the other one.

If the situation is like this:

+----------o
|    1     |
+----------+

  +------o
  |  2   |
  +------+

and the window 1 has focus, when I single-click on its button 'o', the 
result is like this:

+----------o
|          |
|    1     |
|          |
| +------o |
| |  2   | |
| +------+ |
+----------+

Window 1 still has focus, but is below window 2.
I would expect that the focussed window remains 'above' the other one.

I use:

Style * ClickToFocus, GrabFocus

I'm running fvwm 2.5.6 (from cvs) compiled on Dec 20 2002 at 09:48:04.

Thanks a lot, and ... Happy Holidays !

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Focus, Maximize and Raise are independent. I would dislike it if the
focused (or maximized) window would be automatically raised. If you need
this, just add this line:

  AddToFunc Maximize-Func         C Raise

Or maybe this:

  AddToFunc Maximize-Func         C ThisWindow (Focused) Raise

Regards,
Mikhael.

Full_Name: Marc-Jano Knopp
Version: 2.4.14
CVS_Date: 
OS: GNU/Linux 2.4.19 (SuSE 7.3)
X_Server: XFree86 4.1.0
Submission from: (NULL) (141.76.1.122)


I just switched from 2.4.6 to 2.4.14 (self-compiled), and now
fvwm does not recognize my fonts anymore:

[...]
[FVWM][Echo]:  Parsing .fvwm2rc...
[FVWM][Echo]:  Parsing decorations...
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset 7x14, trying:

[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset 6x10, trying: 
        -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
[...]

1. I haven't changed the configuration at all! Now neither the MenuStyle
   font nor the FvwmPager font likes my fonts anymore :-(

2. The fonts work perfectly elsewhere:

      xterm -fn 7x14

   or

      xterm -fn 6x10

   work perfectly!


Marc-Jano, baffled

ok, I understand: I thought that window I was maximizing was already both 
focussed and raised, and I was disappointed that it was remaining 
focussed, but that it was slipping below the unfocussed one.

So even when using ClickToFocus, one can have two nearby window, one 
focussed and the other one raised ?

It seems to me a bit 'unnatural', but ok ...

> If you need this, just add this line:

DestroyFunc Maximize-Func
AddToFunc Maximize-Func         C Raise
+                               C Maximize 0   100
+                               D Maximize 100 100

seems to work as I was expecting.

Thanks a lot !

regards,
Giuseppe.

Well, I finally got around to applying this one.
I did some tests and it seems to work as advertised.

That reminds me, the "tests" directory is not being updated.
There will never be a 2.6 unless there is an adequate set of
tests.


I had a question about this wording in the man page:

.IR AllowMaximizeFixedSize
enables the function 
.I Maximize
to be performed on windows that are not resizable, unless maximisation
has been disabled either using the style 
.I Unmaximizable
or throuth WM hints,
This on by default.
.IR DisallowMaximizeFixedSize
disables the function 
.I Maximize
for all windows that are not resizable.
Note that some applications set the window's minumum and maximum size
the same and and expect this to mean that the size is fixed.
This style forbids maximisation of such windows.


The last 2 sentences seem to say the same thing, and seem to
be out of place. Since this is disabling maximization, I don't
thing anything is necessary.

Simple change that sorts the buttons by name...

in ButtonArray.c AddButton(), i added a string compare to the for loop.

    for (temp = array->head; temp->next; temp = temp->next)
    	 if (strcmp(temp->next->title, title) > 0) break;

Elliot, is it your intention to keep your numerous small changes in your
local copy only or you would like to see them in the official version?
If the later, you should add your changes as an option to make happy
everyone. If you are not sure about the option names, we may discus this.

Once you add a new option/command, you should also document it in the man
page (fvwm.1.in or FvwmTaskBar.1), NEWS and ChangeLog. Then create a patch
that contains the changes to all these files as described in FAQ #5.1, it
is not hard. So anyone could apply your patch using one "patch" command.

I think I already wrote you about this. Someone should do this work.
Please make the work of developers easier by not requiring them to write
a code and a documentation to incorporate your changes. Thank you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm not a developer....but i provide my changes, so that developers can incorperate mthem if they choose if think others would like them. I figger it's better to send out what i did than to merely say "I would like you guys to put in an option that... ".

At present time I think that either:

1 - Title Decoration is always rotated CW (as the buttons order)

Or

2 - title text, title Decor _and_ buttons order should follow
*TitleRotatedC{C}W.

1 is probably more simple and maybe 2 can leads to some unexpected
difficulty. Is 1 unacceptable?

You have compiled fvwm with the --enable-multibyte option. That is
the difference. This option should be selected only if you use
a true multibyte language (e.g., a CJK language). These type of
pbs has been fixed in the 2.5.x series (*unstable* series).

You probably use a locale with a charset which is not "iso8859-1"
and your fonts 7x14 and 6x10 are aliases to some fonts with
such a charset. Moreover, your locale X config reject the
"iso8859-1" charset as an acceptable charset for your locale.
With "--enable-multibyte" you should replace 7x14 by:
  -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
and 6x10 by:
  -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--10-*

Actually according to Dominic, setting min- and max-size doesn't inhibit
maximisation, unless maximisation is explicitly forbidden (through
mwm-hints or such).
And setting style "FixedSize" doesn't automatically disable maximisation
as one expects. So using Style !AllowMaximizeFixedSize always disables
maximisation on windows that are not resizable. Maybe I was=B4a bit unclear
in those sentences in the manual page.

And thanks for applying the patch.

And Merry Christmas, Ein fr=FChlich Weinacht, God Jul and Happy New Year
and so on... to all on this list.

For me, (1) is not very meaningful. Why to enable to rotate decorations
only by 0 or +90, what about -90 and 180? Some texts with shadows may only
look as intended in the same polarity with decorations, so for me it has
no much sence to be able to rotate text by -90 and not the decorations.

I would really prefer (2), this will simplify everything. Dominik
originally implemented such strange button rotation (either 0 or +90) just
so there is the same button order for TitleAtTop and TitleAtBottom. But
now we have a more configurable setup where _each_ title direction may be
separately configured to be rotated in one or another way, so there is no
any reason not to rotate buttons together with the rest of the title -
text and decorations. I am strongly for (2), this way we don't need any
additional option and everything is still fully compatible with 2.4.
Only the button rotation in the TitleAtLeft is changed from +90 to -90 by
default, for me it is a consistent change.

  (1) - complicated to understand together with *TitleRotatedCW, provides
  unneeded functionality, does not fully provide needed functionality
  (2) - intuitive and fully provides needed functionality

Regards,
Mikhael.

(I'm only including what I think is the relevant part to fvwm-workers.
If anyone wants to see the whole think let me know.)

The window that matches the error message is an 1x1 window at location
+1+1.  Based on traces I ran on rm6, I believe this must have never
been mapped so fvwm won't be doing anything with the window.

Its probably there for the toolkit to trace some property.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how this information helps solve the
problem.  It still looks to me like a problem with the application.

You need to send this to the K3B developers.
I really don't know how QT3 works, but I downloaded K3B version
0.7.5 and I saw a few places where they set the minimum size
but not the maximum or aspect ratio.

My guess is that if you set some of the hints, you have to
set them all.

I don't think the K3B problem would lead to the X server
shutting down.

Fvwm is telling you the application has set invalid size
hints.  Fvwm then ingore those hints and carries on.

So, why do you send this to us and not to K3B owners as the message
suggests? :)

Dan, can you please replace English to be not ambiguous, something like
"This is an error in your application, not fvwm, please send a bug report
to the owners of the application that created this window.".

How much work is it to update the tests? I could perhaps "dive
 into" this at the end of next week.

Unfortunatly right now I'm stuck with  a Windows machine. (and downloading
cygwin over a modem is not fun...)

Ideally, there would be a test for every statement made in
the man page.  Given the size of our man pages,  I guess there's
a lot of work to do.

For the changes you just made, it would be nice to have a test that
creates an xterm, makes it uncloseable, pops up a message saying
window should not close, then trys "close", "delete", "destroy".
Then asks, is window still open?  Then something similar
with closeable. And so on.  Perl Gtk might
be helpful, or even command line shell or perl.

Almost all tests may be done non-interactive. It is just a matter of
checking whether a window is still here:

  None (MyUniqueWindow) Echo BUG 1

or it is still has the needed geometry:

  Next (MyUniqueWindow) Exec test $[w.width] = 80 || echo Echo BUG 2

Only visual effects should be done interactive, i.e. I don't see a good
way to test whether the window decorations are transparent or have some
nifty multi colorset look without asking the tester.

Mikhael.

Full_Name: Rene van Bevern
Version: 2.5.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.4.19
X_Server: XFree86 4.2, driver "nvidia"
Submission from: (NULL) (217.226.184.76)


When starting xawtv and hitting the 'f' key to make it fullscreen the xawtv
often stays black until a key is pressed.
another problem, which doesn't occour as often as the first one, is that
the xawtv fullscreen window is located at a wrong position (not in the
center of the screen), so that it is not really fullscreen: just a window
which is as big as the xserver's resolution.

I use NoPPosition, but because it worked with fvwm 2.4.10 it doesn't seem
to be a problem. 

Style "Xawtv*"	Sticky, NoTitle is my style for xawtv windows. it's the same
i used with fvwm 2.4.10, when the problem did not occour

Hello, 

The first patch I send (menustyle_options.patch.gz) adds four new
options for menus: CaseSensitiveHotkeys, CaseSensitiveHotkeysOff,
HotkeysRunConfirmation and HotkeysRunConfirmationOff.

"CaseSensitive" ones are to make hot-key feature see the difference
between upper and lowercase letters. The last two options allow
instructing fvwm to wait for key press or mouse click before executing
selected command (popups are not affected).

Since I don't know the fvwm code really well, I read changes associated
with AutomaticHotkeys options and put mine in the same places. I'm not
sure if I did it right, so I'd be glad if someone could read and comment
my work.

The second patch is definitelly not a ready-to-apply one. I send it just
to show the concept. 
The idea is to add the cursor position limits to EdgeCommand.
If the pointer is within them apropriate function is run, if not
everything stays normal (ex. the EdgeScroll can still be enabled).

I use GetIntegerArguments insted of GetSuffixedIntegerArguments and
probably there are other problems with it. But before making it usable I
wanted to ask if there is a need for something like that.

BTW is there any prefered coding style? I tried to stay consistent with
the code I was changing but it is difficult sometimes.

Regards,

I like the result!
Should buttons (the content) be rotated too in the long run?

I am a bit biased against !UseTitleDecorRotation, since I can't think
about its usage, but if this is not a default it is ok with me.

Nice that you continue to support a 180 rotation.

Mikhael.

I'm not tracking all this fancy stuff but I'm wondering why there
are no man page updates?

Yes, I've some delay with the man page. I need to document LocalePath,
Colorset in decor style and UseTitleDecorRotation and maybe more
soon. I will document all these before 2003-01-07. Sorry.

No I think that buttons must not be rotated. But note that the
UseTitleStyle part of the Buttons decor is rotated.  A ButtonStyle
Pixmap is a brain "mark" image, if you rotate it you will trouble users
(what can even happen, if you rotate buttons, is that a given button x
in a rotated title can look as button y in a non rotated title, with x
!= y).  Ok, some fvwm-themes themes will look better if we rotate
buttons, but it is fvwm-themes which should be fixed not fvwm:
blackbox, mech, metal (maybe), nanoGUI should be converted to
MultiPixmap.  MultiPixmap themes should be fixed by decomposing the
background of the buttons and the real buttons. The bg of the buttons
should be set via UseTitleStyle with the {Left,Right,}Buttons options.

With UseTitleDecorRotation drawing a title window use more X resource
as some Pixmaps should be rotated (FGetImage, rotate an XImage,
FPutImage).  For some decorations it is not useful at all to rotate
the title decorations. !UseTitleDecorRotation allows to really save
resource.

Can you recall my why this is useful ? :o)

My brain says that if everything is rotated, button foreground should be
rotated too. I can see your points if a brain of anyone suggests that
button images should be fixed forever. I don't have a strong opinion here.

One reason for button rotation is this, we may fix fvwm-themes, but not
everyone knows how or wants to do it, or has transparent images.
For example, most of buttons on the Suzanne's page use non-transparent
images, so they look incorrectly for side titles without rotation.

1) For symmetry and consistency with vertical sides.
2) For correctness of some highly assimetrical titlebars that require that
   title is always directed to the center, i.e. rotated around the center.
   Think about a future !TitleBorder - one of 4 window borders is disabled
3) For fun. Are other WMs have this?
4) You never know when the skills to read a 180 rotated text will be
   useful. Think, either your keyboard or display or you is rotated. :)
   Clowns and cosmonauts may appreciate this. :)

Well, I may be a weirdo, but I personally am troubled more by the
not-rotated buttons. I would say that it requires more "brain work" to
assemble the rotated title bar into something familiar if the buttons
are not rotated (because the brain already rotates the whole image (the
text IS rotated) as to "understand" it, and then it has to rotate the
buttons again (because they don't play along with the, already rotated,
text). So it's twice the work for the brain - If you happen to "see" the
titlebar as a whole, and not as "rotated text"+"not rotated buttons".

So I would be for the rotation of the button pixmaps. Pretty please :)
(Of course as an toggle-option)

Furthermore, it's just that there are themes that simply require the
rotation of buttons. The current rotation feature is great, but if
a theme uses not-so-symmetrical buttons you will never *want* to rotate
the titlebar - because the theme will start to look ugly, or it will
simply lose it's "magic". Unless the buttons get rotated together with
the text/background pixmaps.

About text rotation and the brain: say that you have a window with
name "rxvt". When you read the window title you do not read the "r",
then the "x" ... and finally the the "t". Your brain directly recognize
the full word "rxvt". So text rotation is good because you have
the word "rxvt" horizontally written is your brain (as a motif) but not:
   
    r
    x
    v
    t

in any given direction. There is an interesting discussion on which
rotation (cw or ccw) is the best one somewhere in the fvwm-workers
archive.

Let's come back to our ship: buttons. We should recognize the good
button as fast as possible: if I want to maximize a window I want
to find my maximize button. It is clear that if the maximize button
is not rotated you will find it more easily. That's all.
Some examples:

Menu button:  |\   Iconify button:   --   Maximize Button: /\
              |/                     \/                    --

If you rotate cw the buttons, then menu button looks like the
iconify button. If you rotate buttons, which buttons is the
maximize button, which one is the iconify button?

Which themes? themes from fvwm-themes? themes from Suzanne?  All these
themes have been designed before vertical titles.  IMHO, they should
be redesigned (and MultiPixmap may help a lot).  Often a button has
two parts a background (e.g., a grey gradient, often this bg is
"common" to all the buttons) and a "foreground" (the real button:
"maximize", "menu", "iconify", ...etc.). The solution is to use
"UseTitleStyle" in ButtonStyle for defining the background (this
is rotated) and to AddButtonStyle the various foreground buttons.
Note that with a Colorset or a MultiPixmap TitleStyle, "UseTitleStyle"
is powerful as the set of buttons is incorporated in the TitleStyle
decor (for example with a Colorset HGradient the gradient is drawn
on the full bar (title+buttons) and not repeated on each buttons).

Of course, one can implement something like

   {Stretch,Shrunk,Tiled,Adjusted,}Pixmap (AllowsRotation) file

in ButtonStyle. But I am not sure this is a good idea. This may
leads to some terrible fvwm config decoration hack (as the current
nanoGUI fvwm-themes theme).

Do you have an example that cannot be fixed by a clever config?

Actually, even in your example, such buttons usually have a light source,
so they are not fully symmetrical and probably not easily confusable.
But maybe just to have a button rotation flag as a property of buttons?

I would not do this too, a better way is to have one flag for all buttons:

  Style * UseButtonImageRotation  # UseButtonForeRotation?

similar to UseTitleDecorRotation and activated only when the last is set.
Of course, almost noone else can easily implement it and you are pretty
overloaded with all the wonderful recent work, so it is your decision.

> Do you have an example that cannot be fixed by a clever config?

I think Grzegorz says that the brain does more work with title rotation
and no button rotation, so any config would be an example here.

Mikhael.

I will say that light source rotation will add to the confusion.  The
light source come from the top left of the screen (and the brain know
that!). I do not think that the light source should be rotated it is a
property of the all screen (example: with a 180 rotation raised will
become sunk!! with a 90 rotation you have a raised-sunk relief). Note
that for title the relief is not rotated (if you rotate you get
various catastrophic result).

Really I do not understand. How it is possible to say that a rotated
real button (a fg button) will be easily recognized than its normal
version. What I can understand is that some current config will
_globally_ look better with buttons rotation. If we add a new style
for that what will happen is that some config will not be fixed.
Then, as I think that buttons rotation is erroneous from the usability
point of view I do not think that I will have the time to implement
any buttons rotation.

Only if you are lucky (or skilled) enough to be able to actually force
your brain into distinguishing between "title text" and "title buttons".
I can't do this, for me it doesn't matter "text or image". Reading
rotated text and not-rotated buttons is like reading a text in which one
word has it's letters rotated by 90=B0, and the next word is "normal".

But that could very well be only my problem.

The one that points to the "down" side of the title text. That's the way
I figure it out.

It's the same as with text - you don't read it one character at a time,
you see the text as a whole, and the brain rotates it. But my brain does
this not only for the text, but for the whole titlebar at once. The text
is just a "marker" for the brain that allows it to quickly recognize how
the titlebar has been rotated. Rotated buttons are as easy to "read" as
rotated text.

No, my themes. I'm coming from Sawfish, and, well, nobody ports the
themes I'm used to:
http://www.sniper.kolmio.pl/public/hoppke/elberg.jpg
(Here the buttons are asymmetrical enough not to cause trouble in
"understanding" their meaning, but exactly this causes new troubles
- it's very easy to see the titlebar as "one", and not as a composition
of text and various buttons. Because there's so little symmetry, the
brain doesn't pick up enough "patterns" to divide the image into
functional blocks. And it learns to expect the buttons and text in this,
and only this one and special relation.

That's the way I do my decors, but still - it isn't actually the
button background - it's the foreground pattern that counts.

Well, that would be powerfull, as you could choose to rotate button1,
and leave others intact. But I guess that a Style option
"AllowButtonRotation" or something like that would do the trick as well,
and would fit just fine.

Say... Kliin. An IceWM theme, trivial to port. The "magic" concerns the
leftmost and rightmost buttons. A (very bad quality) screenshot is
available on freshmeat, http://images.freshmeat.net/screenshots/30637.png
(I could post a tarball with the decor+sample config after porting to
fvwm, less than 3KB, if the screenshot should really be that unreadable)

The "catches" are the horizontal lines that "sprout" from the sidemost
buttons. If these lines don't get rotated, Kliin just isn't what it used
to be.

It's context-related. When you start to "see" things rotated, it makes
no trouble to "read" a rotated button. You already have "switched" from
"normal view" to "rotated view" when trying to read the title text. So
you just stay in that mode and read the buttons. If the buttons aren't
rotated, the brain has to "switch" more times - "rotated view" to read
the text, then again "normal view" when looking at the buttons. It can
cause confusion, especially if you add a rotated background pixmap,
with rotated shading (light source/background pattern). The trick is
- not everyone distinguishes text/button image. For me, it's just
"titlebar" If it's spotted as rotated, it makes no difference if the
rotated "thingie" is a letter, or a button. The brain "unrotates" it for
me automagically. Yeah, I guess that's the key - do not treat the title
as something special - the title is just a pattern on the titlebar. Just
like every other pixel group.

This will, however, make the whole "rotation" feature quite unusable in
many situations. It will be good only with simple themes, others will
get mutilated. I really appreciate the work you're doing, it's great,
it's just that without rotating buttons it will stop half way up the
hill. Already it is possible to rotate the title-background pixmap. It
can contain more than just a Solid color, it can be a shaded pixmap
that, when rotated, changes it's lightsource relation (I have a theme
shaped after mozilla-modern-2, exactly this case - a pixmap of light
blueish fading into a darker shade of blue - when rotated, the buttons
get a completely new relation to the lightsource (the background
gradient)

So there already exists the possibility to make things look weird and
inconsistant. If the button pixmap isn't a square, circle or something
of equal symmetry, then you really notice really fast that it just
doesn't look right. I don't know how this concernes fvwm-themes or other
equally popular decorations, as I don't use them (too complex and
complicated IMO), but I believe that there are many fvwm-users out there
who invent their own themes. And just looking at fvwm-themes and saying
"It will look good when MultiPixmaped" may not be true for many users.
I just try to point out that there is no danger in implementing a Style
sister-option to UseTitleDecorRotation, and it will most propably make
it way, way more usefull for some themes and people with eyes that
strangely have problems with reading mixtures of rotated/unrotated
patterns. I don't know how much additional work this would cost you, I'm
no coder, but you certainly are the person that could do it best - you
already know the code and know how to do it. I'm not pushing "do it
quickly", I just wouldn't like you abandoning the idea of doing it at
all. Because the title rotation could be a real beauty. If it could
rotate the whole titlebar.

And the rotation thing should not be seen as a way to force people into
transition to MultiPixmap :) It would be enough (and simpler) to put
some bugs into everything different from MultiPixmap ;)

I know why Grzegorz is so ardent about button rotation. :-)
He does not like how his buttons are not rotated here:

  http://www.sniper.kolmio.pl/public/hoppke/screen2.png
  
I thought to send this as a joke, since it is obvious that the buttons
are fully symmetrical, so they don't need any rotation.

But after finding the config, it is unfortunately not a joke. Buttons
include the (non symetrical) background including the hardly noticeable
one pixel line at the bottom. So they look incorrect without rotation.

Here I fully agree with Olivier. Please for the everyone's sake use
transparent images for buttons and UseTitleStyle, this way the buttons are
fully reusable with other titlebar backgrounds too.

For me, button rotation is not the most urgent thing and not even needed
for 2.6.0, but Olivier decides here. Correct configurations should look
acceptably well without it. Of course there are very rare titlebar designs
where it is hard to separate button foreground from button background. But
for me having correct configurations for most of titlebars (like the one
on the screenshot) is more important than supporting a correct rotation of
rare titlebars.

Regards,
Mikhael.

:) Oh. Nah, that's an old config. Guess I should update (delete) it...
(Damn, you've found it ;)

This was the first theme I made for myself. Couple of days after
I started using fvwm. Yes, this theme would do nicely even without
rotation. The buttons are quite easily made transparent, but I never got
to it.

I hope I don't get too many flames for sending a small sample - Kliin
decor. It's a small sample, just unpack it somewhere and "Read" the
"kliin/theme" file in a running fvwm. Should setup itself correctly in
most environments. Mouse bindings are simple, it's just an example, not
meant for real use.

Transparent, multipixmaped, all that stuff. And a little bug after
rotation, the small lines on buttons 1 and 2 look, well, ah, see it for
yourself. But let's leave the boring rotation-thingie behind:

More importantly, it can show a cvs-fvwm bug. The maximize button uses
the MwmDecorMax hint. Somehow buttons with MwmDecor (those of the
"Toggled" art, like ToggledActiveUp etc.) don't get the right background
with UseTitleStyle. Instead the "toggled" buttons seem to use the
HilightBack/BackColor settings (although these should get "overruled" by
UseTitleStyle, at least that's the case with "normal" buttons)

Try removing/changing the HilightBack/BackColor lines from the theme,
and then maximising a window. The MwmDecorMax button will get the
'default color' background, it just doesn't respect UseTitleStyle. This
isn't too much of a problem in simple themes (like Kliin), but any
titlebar background different from a Solid color makes using MwmDecor*
buttons difficult. Or am I doing something terribly wrong? I mean, a
"ButtonStyle All -- flat usetitlestyle" should do the trick, but it
does not.

Just a note. Olivier didn't mean you should always use MultiPixmap.
Only to avoid such hacks as in nanoGUI theme. In your configs (both on
the screenshot and attached) MultiPixmap is not really needed, a mere
Solid or TiledPixmap is enough.

These are actually "overruled" for all states you specified in TitleStyle.
You didn't specify Toggled states, so it uses HilightBack/BackColor as
expected. As a side note, I would suggest to use colorsets for everything
instead.

To fix this, you may specify AllInactive and AllActive in TitleStyle
instead of Inactive/Active. Or specify ToggledInactive/ToggledActive.
Yes, even though TitleStyle itself does not use Toggled states (as well
as some MultiPixmap images too), they are used in UseTitleStyle buttons.

Mikhael.

Aaa... nope. I _had_ to use MultiPixmap, cause the Solid title style
thingy was acting strangely in my CVS snapshot (at the time of writing
kliin). The color "bar" was shifted about 4 pixels from the top and left
side (the titlebar had wide "stripes" of uncolored space at the top and
left. Yes, it was "flattened"). Maybe I just snatched a snapshot in a
wrong moment. Now I'm using fvwm-2002-12-28 and

TitleStyle Height 16 Active (Solid #ccccee) \
Inactive (Solid #dddddd) -- flat

works as expected. But it didn't the last time I tried it, honest.

And it's all in the man page. I must have gone blind and didn't even noticed.
I feel so silly. Sorry everyone :)

Thanks for correcting me :) I simply wouldn't have expected that Toggled
buttons have the ability to get a separately defined background. But,
this is fvwm. The land of pathological configurability ;)

PS. I tried to reply to your mail, but your email provider rejects
connections from my machine, guess it's because I don't have a static
IP. The fvwm-* lists have similar safety mechanisms, but I managed to
fool them. homemail.com however isn't that easy to trick. Perhaps you
have an account by some other provider?

But my answer would be "Yes, I guess I could do it. I haven't seen any
transparent pixmaps, but I've just tried adding the transparency myself
and it should look good. However, I'm not really having enough time
right now. Studying and all... I'll be preoccupied 'till February, at
least.  But if that delay would be acceptable, then it's OK."

I tried the new icon styles that Olivier added yesterday. There is one
thing that is a bit odd. If I specify:
Style * IconBackgroundColorset 1
and I have colorset 0 for active windows and colorset 1 for inactive
windows. Then icons that are monochrome (it seems) still gets the
background set to the colour of the title (as before).
Maybe there shall be different Backgroundcolorsets for active and inactive
and let them default to the same as the title?

And also there seems to be a bug when using IconBackgroundPadding on such
icons (the label doesn't adjust).

I see a bug for icons _with_ a mask (XClock icon), the mask disappear
when there is an icon bg cset: the transparent part has the colour of
the title (Ooops fixed). But on the non transparent part (and so for
monochrome icon without a shape mask) IMO it is normal that the colours
of the icon follow the title colour (fg part of the icon). In the same
way IconTint and IconAlpha colorset option are taken from the icon
title colorsets and not from the icon bg one.

I've just fixed a bug related to this. Can you try latest cvs and report
this bug in a precise way if it is still there.

Sometimes fvwm will show that a window has focus, but it really doesn't.
This has bit me a few times trying to type in a shell window. You can
click in the window, but it does not always take focus. About a third of
the time you need to click on titlebar to get
fvwm's attention that you are actually in that window.

The problem you are experiencing doesn't sound familiar.

Neither does the version 2.2.4-9.

(There wouldn't be a -9 in any version number created by the
Fvwm project.)

However, 2.2.4 is way too old for us to do anything with.
The latest stable version is 2.4.14.  I suggest you install
a current release.

Note that there is a conversion script that will help you
upgrade from the 2.2.x series to the 2.4.x series included
in the release.
