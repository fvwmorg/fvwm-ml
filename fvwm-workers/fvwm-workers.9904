Fixed using truecolor visual if default is pseudocolor: #define PICK_TRUECOLOR

visual of 8 bit pseudocolor? I only have an 8 bit card and may have
the depths mixed up.

Oh, it just me constantlly moving above and below the mason dixon line,
and trying to balance the Northern states tendency to shorten their
english, and that good 'ol southern draw.  Spo you are probablly right
that the official expression is "every once in a while", or "every once
in a blue moon", of course this year a blue moon seems to be occuring a
lot more often.

[For those who don't know the mason dixon line is supposedlly the point
in the US that seperates the North and South]

Well I've been out all week and have been trying to catch up on CVS changes,right now I can confirm that M$ finishes but some where in the initial capture I am having this problem:

I can see that I'm getting hung on a fprintf but I have no idea why, can anyone shed some light on this.  Once I kill fvwm I get all the error messages from FvwmErrorHandler as expected.

Is stderr directed at an ordinary file? Could you send the output?

stderr and stdout go to /dev/console
the error I get over and over after I kill fvwm is:
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 1, Error 8, EventType: 0

This is a BadMatch error from an XCreateWindow and is probably my
fault.  I've been messing with fvwm to get it to be able to use a
Truecolor visual event though the default is PseudoColor with different
depth. I can't test different depth stuff but I committed some changes
today for all the cases I could find in the sources.  Could you try the
latest one (it will have M_NEW_LOOK defined in module.h)?  If it still
fails it may be the the XCreateWindow attributes have to specify a
border pixmap and background pixmap of None.  I may not have time to
hack them in today and I'm off until next Thursday (if anyone wants to
try look for all the .attributes = CWColormap lines).

This stuff shouldn't be activated unless you #define PICK_TRUECOLOR but
who knows.

I guess the reason for the hang is that you're running an xterm -C and
the xterm is grabbing the console device before creating it's window.

Cheers,
Tim.

I still have  this problem.  I now notice  that one of my windows  has
focus, even though  the mouse pointer is on  the root.  I  use these 2
focus affecting commands:

Style "*"           BorderWidth 10, HandleWidth 10,MouseFocus
Style "xmag"	    Icon mag_glass.xpm,ClickToFocus,MiniIcon mini.xmag.xpm

This only happens if the pointer is on the root when fvwm2 is starting.
The window with focus is xsysstats.

well I definetlly am not doing anything to define it, and I only see it
being used in fvwm.c.  The current copy of module.h I have does include
M_NEW_LOOK.  And before someone asks I did do a make clean first.

well I already have the xterm -C up and non iconic when I do the start.
[that is startx; start fvwm; use fvwm; exit fvwm; lots of windows
runnning around including xterm -C; start fvwm]

Unfortunatelly I didn't read this thread to closelly, I had about a week
of mails to catch up on and just skimmed it, so I missed what exactlly
you were trying to accomplish here.

In case you are wondering I am running with a 24 bit display, with a
TrueColor visual, using the Solaris 2.5.1 Xsun server, if you need some
help testing this stuff I would be glad to help as always.

Tim,
I just tried it with this, and there is no change.

Subject: FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 63x0


Full_Name: Tobias Oetiker
Version: 2.2.0
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: Sun OpenWindows
Submission from: (NULL) (129.132.2.209)


Hi,

I have setup FvwmIconBox in the following manner:

[...]
*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 63x0
*FvwmIconBoxSetWMIconSize       32x32
*FvwmIconBoxLines       1
*FvwmIconBoxPadding     0
*FvwmIconBoxSBWidth     8
*FvwmIconBox "Fvwm*" -
*FvwmIconBoxFrameWidth  0 0
*FvwmIconBoxHideSC horizontal
*FvwmIconBoxSortIcons IconName
[...]

This gives me a nice list of programms running (somewhat like a vertical
taskbar)
of a fixed size. It seems that the "FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 63x0" line poses
a
problem to certain applications. It seems to ask the App for a icon of
height 0.
Som apps do not like this at all and crash rightaway ... Couldn't the
iconbox simply
ignore all this Icon stuff when the iconhight is set to 0 ?

cheers
tobi

Subject: Patch: 2.2.0/FvwmIconBox with Icon forced to zero height
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7



  I use fvwm-2.2 with the FvwmIconBox module. I only want icon labels, not
  the real icons, thus I set

     *FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 63x0

  in .fvwm2rc.

  This causes a third-party Java program to display a stack trace before
  even drawing a window:

        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: \
                    Width (73) and height (0) must be > 0
        at java.awt.image.Raster.createInterleavedRaster(Compiled Code)
        ...

  The problem goes away if I set MaxIconSize to something nice like 48x48.

  I don't pretend to understand the FvwmIconBox module in its entirety,
  but I played around with the `max_icon_height' variable, and the
  patch below fixes the problem and hopefully doesn't create new ones.

I've done a little more investigating, without yet digging into the
code.  Here's another data point, but I'm not sure if it's a symptom
or a cause!

Here's how I've gotten things to work:

1. start window system with no window manager
2. start /usr/dt/bin/dtwm (remember: Solaris 2.6)
3. start CodeWarrior
4. kill dtwm
5. start Fvwm with my normal config file

Doing things in this order makes it so that when I resize CW windows,
the insides get painted correctly.  However, if while Fvwm is still
running, I kill CW and restart it, bang! they don't resize.

So it must not be /strictly/ wm related.  I had a feeling maybe
there's some property that's not getting set up right, so I hung a
xprop -spy on the CW windows as I resized them.

When resizing worked, I would get two property changes on
_MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO for every resize.  However, when resizing is
broken, I only get one property change on _MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO
for every resize.  Makes me think that somehow the stuff inside the CW 
window isn't getting the proper event that triggers the app to set
this property a second time.

Should I continue to investigate in this direction?  Would you like
more detailed xprop output, or is this a red herring?

Thanks,
-Barry

I think what we need to know is whether fvwm is generating a
"ConfigureNotify" for code warrior.  The code in borders.c seems
to take a lot of different conditions into account before it sends
the "ConfigureNotify" off to the application.

(The "ConfigureNotify" has the windows new dimensions in it.)

If you recompile borders.c with FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS defined, we should
get a look at the message being generated.

I don't see any part of fvwm that seems to be concerned with
_MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO.

I will include COPYING when I will be sure what to include in it, since
I didn't find anything about 3dpixmaps's license. We will probably drop
it or move to another place if no solution is found.

You can get wm-icons-0.0.1.tar.gz from http://milonka.ml.org/wm-icons/
There are four one-sized sets and a lot of stubs there. :)

Here is the used icon list:

$ ls | sed 's/.xpm$//' | xargs -n 4 printf "%-17s%-17s%-17s%-17s\n"
abc              calculator       cards            cd-player
cd               chess            clock            desktop
display          editor           empty            floppy
folder           folders          game             ghostview
information      keyboard         monitor          mouse
music            netscape         network          shell
sound            terminal         todo             unknown
window           word-processor   xterm            xv

This list (icon names) is much more important to me than any particular
implementation of it (icon contents). I have tried to create it without
looking at what we have, and the implementation is not important for now.
This standartized list will certainly grow.

I would like to get your comments on both the list and its implementations.
For example, do you think having display, monitor, terminal is redundant?
Or, maybe, netscape shoud be replaced by navigator or netscape-navigator or
several netscape3, netscape4, mozilla? And so on.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think it's a bit silly to have the WindowShade state
in ifdefs. Is there a particular reason why this function
should be configurable? With this reasoning we could ifdef
about everything. Comments are welcome. If no objections
arise I'll remove this option.

At the moment I don't get the cursor icons when I move
the mouse over the side bars or corners. XCreateWindow
in add_window.c fails with a BadMatch for all the input
windows at the edges. The CWColormap and CWBorderPixmap
bits in valuemask are both generationg the error. I can't
see a reason why an input only window should need a
colormap or a border pixmap at all. What has changed here?

Any ideas what Bob can do here? Is there a cleaner way than writing
afunction that modifies the style and does a recapture on all windows?

Ahhh! Thanks. So, is it possible then to have only the command bound to
Pause ignore CirculateSkip? If I do the 'Style FvwmButtons CirculateHit'
as you suggest, then all the commands will recogize the buttons. Most of
the time (like skipping between different apps) skipping the buttons is
fine...I just want a hot-key to force it to the top.

Another thing: is is possible to have a function deiconify ALL the
iconified windows on a given page or desk? Something like 'Next [*...]
Iconify -1'. Does this make sense?

BTW, I'm starting to HATE fvwm2! It is so much fun to sit around
tweaking the rc file that I'm getting absolutely NO WORK done.

The current CVS has a function called all, that takes same conditions as
Next/Prev but works on all matches 
All (Iconic,CurrentPage) Iconify off

Well I'm not sure what changed, but it all works for me now with no
warnings at all.  That is it works with a current update of CVS so it
seems one of the other commits last night fixed it.

Well it worked in 2.0.46 2.1.x 2.2 and 2.3.x until recentlly.  And now
that I've fixed my problems with Tim I see that it works again.  The
only thing I can think of is that the slashes with m4 and the slashes in
my font were related and judging by your comment
  * libs/Parse.c (CopyToken): fixed quoting with backslashes
it sounds like they were

But regardless my font now works, and there seems to be a stray fprintf in FvwmPager.c wwich shows:
BalloonFont = -*-lucida sans typewriter-bold-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Thanks.

Well Dominik, since I'm the chief complainer about active icons, I'll
chime in here.  What I now get is, working active icons.  Working
meaning I can start up an xterm do something in it that creates
scrolling output, iconify and I see the icon getting updates, in
addition the behavior of moving the icon and the icon shrinking to just
a few pixels no longer occurs, I'm free to move icons as I see fit
without any ill effects.

The only problem that remains, and it is a new one since Saturday, is
that all of my icons no longer have labels.  Well they have a rectangle
under them for a text string it just doesn't have anything in it, and it
doesn't get the 3d effect I usually see.

I tried out the resize patch, and it seems to work ok, but I think you
need to make the percentages larger. You probablly want to try and
match the percentages to the 9 square grid that gets drawn when you are
actually doing the resize.  That grid seems to break things up nicelly
but your patch often forces me to still move to an edge even though I'm
not in the center square when the resize grid pops up.

Just a suggestion

Dominik, 
you probablly want to commin a man update for this, just so we don't
start getting undocumented features now that we documented the rest.

Hmm, and here I thought I was seeing things.  I hesitated to report the
problem since my Netscape icon labels do have visible text.  All the rest
are missing the text.

I'd  like   to  close the  loop  and  figure   out  some of  the fvwm2
configuration issues.  (I understand this is not only for fvwm2.)

If we have a "music" icon, that tells me we need commands like this:

Style "Workman" Icon music.xpm
Style "xmcd" Icon music.xpm

In this case, I think we are missing  something.  It would be nicer if
we didn't have  to ask every user to  match  the generic icon  name to
specific applications.   I'm not  sure if  we   need a bunch  of  icon
aliases, or  we just want to create  a "FvwmStyle2Icon" file  with all
common applications configured.

If we have icon size choices, perhaps we need commands like this:

MiniIconStyle "*" Size 18x18, Effect Circled
IconStyle "*" Size 64x64, Effect 3D

The proposed "IconStyle" commands have to be able to understand
the directory structure or naming conventions.  I'm not sure if
this is implementable.  Bear in mind that the typical "ImagePath"
will have directories that are not in the "wm-icons" structure.

For example: /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/bitmaps

We need mini-icons for all the window manager operations to decorate
our menus:

Close
Delete
Destroy
Move
Resize
Shade
Raise
Lower
Iconify, etc.

The problem seems to be that fvwm insists that it is told
about the application supplied icon window in a 'XA_WM_HINTS'
property notify. My xterm doesn't send one and thus the
defined icon is used. But if I define no icon for xterm
it works. xterm must use a different way to tell fvwm
about its icon window.

Please folks, we have to be more careful with our ChangeLog entries.
For the n-th time this week I'm fixing a bug (simple typo) that has
no ChangeLog entry. The bug itself wouldn't be a problem, but
please, please, PLEASE, do **always** make a ChangeLog entry when
you touch a function!! This time it was a missing '*/':

icons.c (DrawIconWindow):

  else /* fixme: this only copies one plane, should be min(scr,icon)

should have been

  else /* fixme: this only copies one plane, should be min(scr,icon) */
                                                                    ^^^^

This hasn't changed. If you have an icon pixmap explicitly defined
for xterm you don't get the active icon:

  Style xterm Icon foo.xpm

Strange. As soon as the icon gets focus the title is deleted.
And the string isn't centered but aligned to the left.

Maybe that's my temporary fix in add_window.c? Could you try whatever
you were trying without it? Remove this line:

  valuemask &= ~(CWColormap | CWBorderPixmap);

We'll have to experiment with the numbers a bit. I used 5% so
this is never triggered when you don't expect it, but perhaps
it's too strict. One problem is that if width and height are
too different the rectangle near the corners becomes confusing.
When I tried myself I could not get used to it. I was expecting
a square, not a rectangle.

Of course. I will write a manpage section when it's clear what
repeat does and when it's fully implemented. At the moment it is
in the experimenting state.

Without it the problem reapears so that must be the fix.  The only thing
I was trying was starting fvwm with an already running x server.

Well i didn't think in any of the versions we could have an active icon
plus a regular icon, but then again I never tried having two icons seems
a little silly to me.  If we really want it working I can try and watch
events sent from the xterm and events the fvwm receives from it.

This is true. But I for one have long done this:

Style "Gimp" Icon monalisa.xpm, UseDecor Graphics
Style "Xpaint" UseStyle Gimp

You get the picture...

Point taken. I suppose a simple mapping of what family any of a long
list of apps (and the right string to match its windows) fall into
would be "the right thing to do."

Most of these I had submitted in my icon group (still sans copyright
notice :-<) There are others floating about too. I also made xpms from
the xbms fvwm uses for standard cursors. Thought that could be useful.

I think having generic icons is good for a new non-suported application
or just for generic cases, like:

Style "*music*" Icon normal/music.xpm, MiniIcon mini/music.xpm
Style "*cd" Icon normal/cd-player.xpm, MiniIcon mini/cd-player.xpm

(I think "normal" (or "norm") symlink is better than discussed "std".)

This is an interesting solution, but it makes it difficult to use old
icons, which are not organized in the wm-icons scheme.
Another solution is having symlinks "normal" and "mini" in the system or
even user space (anyone can create such symlinks) and having a directory
where these links are located in ImagePath. See examples below.

Yes, but the point is you will be able to use both non-structured 
and structured icons:

ImagePath /usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/local/wm-icons
Style "*calc" Icon calculator    # old style bitmap
Style "*calc" Icon normal/calculator.xpm, mini/calculator.xpm

Note, no fvwm changes are needed for implementing this solution.

I agree, it would be helpful to specify place(s) for normal and mini
icons and to have something like:

ImagePath /home/john/wm-icons:/usr/local/wm-icons
Style "*" NormIconSubdir "norm"
Style "*" MiniIconSubdir "mini"
Style "*calc" IconName calculator.xpm

And fvwm itself searches for normal icons in:
  /home/john/wm-icons/norm
  /usr/local/wm-icons/norm
and for mini icons in:
  /home/john/wm-icons/mini
  /usr/local/wm-icons/mini

This solution, unlike yours, makes it easy to use old icons which are
not organized in directories, just don't specify MiniIconSubdir and
NormIconSubdir and use ImagePath and Style "" Icon, MiniIcon.

As it is noted in icons.lst of the initial release:
  http://milonka.ml.org/wm-icons/data/wm-icons-0.0.1/icons.lst
these icon names (window-close, window-move etc.) will be included in the
next version. Every icon set will contain them (not only mini-sets),
because there are no functional differences between the sets (you can use
a large window-move.xpm or similar icons in FvwmButtons, for example).

Mikhael.

Maybe:

Style ( \
  "angband"   \
  "*mahjongg" \
  "*tetris"   \
) Icon ...

or/and:

DefineStyle ( \
  "angband"   \
  "*mahjongg" \
  "*tetris"   \
) "[games]"

Style "[games]" ...

I see only four that represent window operations. All are black & white.
I think, I will use the colored ones, which are in fvwm icons/ directory.

Are all icons that go with fvwm free?

Yes. All icons that are not have to vanish from the distribution.

Well, you can't use xterms with active Icons and xterms without
customised icons but without active icons. Apart from this it is
very confusing.

There is a minor bug (#78) that occurs when a window
doesn't exist anymore when fvwm processes a button
press that went into that window (can happen with server
grabs). A way to work around this would be to check if
the window exists before handling the event. Any ideas
how to check if a window with a given id exists (without
generating a BadWindow)?

Bye

Finally I found the time to check this, but I don't see your problem.
Is that still an issue? If it is, fetch a snapshot of the current
development source from our web page and try again. If that doesn't
solve the problem I need more information. Are there any error
messages on the console? Are you sure you made no typo? Is the
FvwmBacker module really running (please verify with ps)?

Perhaps you're out of colours and FvwmBacker can't allocate the one
it wants?

The bug is in events.c (My_XNextEvent):

     /* check for termination of all startup modules */
     if (fFvwmInStartup) {
       for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
         if (FD_ISSET(i, &init_fdset))
           break;
-->    if (i == npipes) {
         DBUG("My_XNextEvent", "Starting up after command lines modules\n");
         StartupStuff();
         timeoutP = NULL; /* set an infinite timeout to stop ticking */
       }
     }

I don't know exactly what this is supposed to do, but startup
is only completed when the if-condition is true. Which is the
case if FD_ISSER returns zero for npipes pipes. Since npipes
is a constant (256 on my system), the conition will be fulfilled
only if you started 256 modules. What the author probably had
in mind was the number of modules actually started, not the
maximum number of allowed modules (== npipes). Tim, is that
part of your changes? Do you know how to repair this? I don't
dare to try it myself since I do not much about modules.

I raised the same question some time ago, 
so I'm in favor of removing it. All these
ifdefs just make the code harder to read
and maintain. Is anybody actually compiling
out some of the ifdef'd stuff ?

Use the All command with the proper condition to select only windows
on the given page/desk (I dont know that condition offhand).

There didn't seem to be any picture for "Geoffrey and Pepper"
and Netscape 3.0 couldn't display the picture of "Blacky and Tiger".
I could download and display it.  Perhaps I'm having a local problem,
I'll try from work tomorrow.

Downloading this on my home machine was pretty slow, if the page
grows much, thumbnails (as links) might be the way to go.

I think what would really round out this page is a picture of someones
dog,  (I think we have at  least one dog person),   but leave the page
titled the way it is, and have the text refer to it as  a cat.  (Well,
it would be funny to me.)

Make 'Restart fvwm2' use the session mechanism to save

that restarting now respects most per-window state.

Still to do:
Check how this interacts with session management, remove code
dealing with state saved in properties (only WM_DESKTOP, I guess)

Because there is none. Today I scanned in a picture of Geoffrey,
but I don't think there is one of his brother.

Hmm, is the filename correct in the page source? Netscape seems
to remember the file in the composer even if you rename it.

Yes, the pictures are pretty large.

I'll upload a new version soon.

I took the effort to download the latest (non-developement?) software
and build it just before reporting the error that I have been
experiencing with older versions since I moved from Red Hat 4.2 to
5.0. (I'm now at 5.2.)  I'm not currently in the mood to do it again.

No hard feelings on either side, I hope.  Maybe I'll try later.

No typos. One line has "Exec xsetroot"; the other doesn't.

My old .fvwm2rc file worked with RH 4.2 and didn't with RH 5.0 is how
I remember it.

The FvwmBacker module is running now at least.

I don't think that's likely. It works with the "Exec xsetroot".
I'm using 16 bpp and just running Netscape & Emacs. 

Thanks anyway.

When I start X with a 24 bit true colour visual
and then run netscape (with or without -install)
the internal icons, menus, ... get only two colours:
a black foregroung and the default background
(netscape 4.05). I assume this is nothing fvwm
could cause (?) Same with 2.2 and 2.3.x.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Starting with Saturday nights CVS, parts of frames are only painted

Once  again  I have  to  apologize for   the sloppy way   a change was
committed.  I'm using pcl-cvs and it seems to have a mind of its own.

I think its all there.

The session saving logic should be changed now to use $FVWM_USERHOME.

You can test the new user installation logic by moving your .fvwm2rc
out of the way.  Any mouse button or the Help or F1 key on the root
should bring up the menu that drives this.

If you choose to create a .fvwm directory, and you read files without
using the full path, you will have to move your files into the .fvwm
directory, and removing leading dots (if any).


I know there  is still a lot  to be done.   I think it would  now make
sense  to remove "sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc" from the distribution.
There are a  couple of  sample configs for  modules  that need to   be
examined.  The list goes on...

Remember that we agreed not to automatically update documentation on each
commit.  If you change something that you want updated immediately, you
need to let me know.  And I don't always parse all of the commit
messages...

The new file is very nice.

Netscape bug, happens with any WM I've tried.  I'm not sure if 4.5 is
better.  I think in essence they neglected to include 24-bit icons.

Hmm... some of these icons are very similar to those found in the MagicWB
icon collection for the Amiga. Since MagicWB is shareware I fear that some
icons in 3dpixmaps is not free.

Works just fine (no visual bugs) on 24bpp Solaris, AIX and IRIX
X-servers (running linux netscape 4.51, every other version I've tried
works as well). From what I've heard, it's either an XF86 or
XF86-netscape interaction issue.

LSM entry on http://www.boutell.com/lsm/lsmbyid.cgi/000284 also says
3dpixmaps is free.

Anyway, wm-icons is already GPL'd (upcoming version) since it uses many
GPL'd icons.

Hey!  You have an AIX machine??  Have you compiled a recent (after 1
April)  version of the cvs sources on it? 

The reason I'm asking is: I had to slightly change the alloca magic
incantation in acconfig.h.  I ended up moving down to the bottom -- so it
appears near the end of config.h.  However, there was a comment in the
magic code claiming "AIX requires this to be the first thing in the file." 
Since that is no longer the case, it would be nice if you could verify
that the code works --- using vendor compiler if possible.

	This is indeed something to do with 24bit color and netscape on
the XF86 server.  This is why it doesn't show up under solaris and
whatnot.  I ran into this almost a year ago.

It is actually due to netscape doing some things it shouldn't.  If you do
a dejanews search for:

"x11 AND bpp AND 24 AND pixmap"

Why was this move necessary?  Whenever possible I prefer to believe the
documentation on these issues; they're almost always there for good
reason.  Simply verifying it works on one system isn't a good enough
test, IMO; for example, AIX 3.x is still in use in some places, and
that's a bletcherous OS.  It might well be that it works to move
alloca.h on some versions of the OS and with some compilers, but not
others.

Unless there're very, very good reasons to require moving this, I
suggest it be moved back again...

PS. That warning is definitely for the vendor compiler; GCC doesn't care
    in what order alloca.h is included on any OS.

I would strongly object to any changes to the FVWM configuration syntax

If we want to have some recommended way of doing this, IMO best provided
with the wm-icons dist. itself, that's fine: say some FvwmCpp/FvwmM4
macros or something, or even the suggested "Style2Icon" file that can be
read by FVWM--there can be various files with different sizes and
effects to handle that case, or even a script that takes a template,
size, and effect and generates the proper style file for use with
PipeRead or whatever, to avoid an exponential explosion of files.

Am I badly misunderstanding the proposal and flaming out for no reason?
Wouldn't be the first time :).

Can we get some kind of short mini-description of these?  Most are
obvious but what is "abc" supposed to represent?

Is the idea that each of these categories will contain a single icon for
each size/effect/etc. directory?

What's the difference between "cd-player" and "music"?

Is it wise to have "netscape" and "ghostview" categories, or should
these be something generic like "www-browser" and "ps-preview" or
s'thing?

Well, it depends on how you want to use them :).  That's why I think a
short description is in order.

For example, Dan has noted we need FVWM style commands to bind these
properly; what kinds of style commands are you envisioning for each of
these categories?

Well, I don't feel flamed yet, you are going to have to use stronger
language, or get personal.

All kidding aside, I  was  trying to make    the point that   whatever
directory  and  file naming  conventions are   chosen,  they should be
parseable  enough that the  user can just say,  "bigger icons", or "3D
icons" and get the desired result.

Since   this mostly  affects  the  "style   appname iconname xxx"  and
"imagepath" commands, I  don't think an actual   new command would  be
needed, perhaps some pre-written config files, or some functions.

I think your point is, why bloat fvwm2 for this wm-icons package which
should not be a required part of fvwm2?  I'd like to go back thru what
I just did  for  new users configurations and  add  mini-icons  to the
menus.  I'm reluctant to do that until these icon issues are settled.

Me too.

As I understand the wm-images directory-structure proposal, one would
have: 

	.../icons/<theme>/<size>/foo.xpm

for whatever combination of themes and sizes the workstation-owner
desires.  There will also be symlinks

	.../icons/<theme>/large --> <large-size>
	.../icons/<theme>/mini --> <mini-size>

[Actually the current proposal uses "std" or "norm", but "large" is a
better opposite to "mini", no?]

Then it is a simple matter of arranging your image path to include
".../icons/<theme>", and use 

	style appname iconname large/app.xpm miniicon mini/app.xpm

in the fvwmrc file.

To change sizes, all you need is to re-do the symlinks.

To change "effect" or "theme", you need to re-do the ImagePath.

Both of these can be done NOW with NO changes to fvwm code.

That depends on who writes the docs.  

How do I know that the quoted statement wasn't written by someone with a
broken AIX setup?  Or by someone who failed to compile something, moved
the pragma to the top of the file, found it worked, but didn't bother
trying to debug the problem further?  It might be only that the pragma
must occur before including some particular system header. 

That aside, the changes I did were not as severe as you might think.  The
old config.h ended up looking something like this:

	#if HAVE_ALLOCA_H
	#  include <alloca.h>
	#else
	... do #pragma if on AIX, else declare it as char* alloca() ...
	#endif
	...
	#define HAVE_ALLOCA_H
	...

As you might guess, this causes an incorrect declaration when we have
<alloca.h>.  At the least, one needs to define HAVE_ALLOCA_H *before*
using it.  So I moved the alloca magic down to the top of the @BOTTOM@
section.  It appears in config.h after all the autoconf'd #defines and
*before* all #includes. 

Now, I can believe that AIX requires the pragma before including some
system headers.  I find it harder to believe it matters whether you do
some #defines first.  Of course, I may be wrong. 

> Simply verifying it works on one system isn't a good enough
> test,

Yes, of course.  I know that.  I welcome some hard facts on this matter. 
I asked the autoconf folks, and got no response. 

In the absence of facts, I will go with my hunch that you can do #defines
before a #pragam.

I think our distribution is clean enough now to put it
under an open source license compatible with GPL. The only
module that isn't is FvwmRearrange. So how about it, Andrew,
may we put it under an open source license?

Grrr, isn't there a way to tell the compiler to generate an error
when the prototype is missing? If you have an 'implicit declaration'
you may as well have done something totally wrong.

Hi gang,

You may have noticed a lot of "gcc -Wall cleanup" commit messages from me
recently.  ;-)

Well, it's basically finished.  I can now compile all of fvwm (Dominik's
commits from yesterday excluded) with "gcc -Wall" and get NO warnings. 

I like to use "gcc -Wall" as a quick stupidity-filter after changing some
code.  It is not comprehensive like "lint", but at least it tells me if I
forget to prototype a function, and it catches some other common errors
like:
	if ( a = b )

Now that the code is clean enough to make -Wall a viable option, I move we
keep it that way. 

Opinions?

I'm using "gcc -Wall -Werror", which does the trick!  ;-)

Mmm... an even more likely bug is when you get the warning "suggest
parentheses around assignment used as truth value"  (builtins.c:620)

Or even: "statement has no effect", generated by a line such as the
following (deep in some module code):

	a == b;

I would like to get such description too! :) This was some not-so-long-
thought list just to start the disscusion.
"abc" must probably be "alphabet" or even "font", I am not sure.

I think, you must revert containment parties in your question.
In my terms, there are icon sets, each of them contains all (real or
linked) icons from the above list. Such icon set has characteristics:
common size, common style (theme). So, I prefer to name it by size-style,
like 32x32-kde (included in the upcoming version of wm-icons).

wm-icons-0.0.1 is built according to the described scheme and I am going
to continue with it.

Maybe music is a more general category than more specific
  * cd-player (as well as midi-player and amp-player)
  * sound-editor
  * cd-writer

I think, we need both generic and common used applications. We really need
to discuss this. Maybe everybody would send their own list of categories
as they see this and we perform a merge.

How _we_ want to use them, right? :)

I will include parts of .fvwm2rc using wm-icons.
The categories are in no way final, and I am not the authority to
decide on them. But this list is like API, it must be finalized as soon as
possible to enable creating new themes according to it. I don't expect
it will be finalized until wm-icons-1.0.0 and without your help.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I still think <size>-<theme> is a better construction, you can see all
installed icon sets (sorted by size) in one level listing.
Why can not one have mini icons from kde and normal icons from 3dpixmaps.

No. :) "mini" refers to MiniIcon directive and "norm" refers to "Icon".
I think "mini" and "norm" are ok. It is configurable and a user can call
them "small" and "large" if he wants.

It is really not very important, but I think it is fair to call
traditional icons on the desktop as normal, not large. Anyone else?

It is "icon", not "iconname". "iconname" is something I have suggested
to simplify things in fvwmrc:

      NormIconSubdir norm
      MiniIconSubdir mini
      
      style appname1 iconname app1.xpm
      style appname2 iconname app2.xpm
      style appname3 iconname app3.xpm

Compare this with:

      style appname1 icon norm/app1.xpm miniicon mini/app1.xpm
      style appname2 icon norm/app2.xpm miniicon mini/app2.xpm
      style appname3 icon norm/app3.xpm miniicon mini/app3.xpm

There is only one single place of linked directories and one app.xpm for
an application.

If it will stay <size>-<style> as it is now, you can change both
size and style without touching fvwmrc at all.

Migo.

Ah! I didn't notice the commit with that. So, what license will we
adopt in COPYING? Is GPL the way to go?

This still doesn't really seem like enough, explain to me again why you
can't just make the sizes the same as the grid box that gets drawn when
you are actually resisizing.  I know you had said something about those
not being square but I don't really think that is a problem.  Just keep
in mind I'm simplly playing devil's advocate here, people have been
requesting something like this for quite a while, and the more intuitive
we can make it the less complaints we will get later.

Let say I have 40 users.  Only I want large icons for myself.  Someone

1. This won't sort properly by size: suppose you have 8x8-foo and
   14x14-foo directories.

2. Having a sorted directory listing is not a high priority for me.

3. You can always get a sorted listing -- no matter what the
   directory layout -- with appropriate shell/awk/sed/sort tricks.


> Why can not one have mini icons from kde and normal icons from 3dpixmaps.

You can; I never said you couldn't!  I can think of two ways to do this:

1. Put just the top-level icon directory ($ICONS) on the ImagePath, with
   symlinks:

	$ICONS/mini --> kde/14x14
	$ICONS/std  --> 3dpixmaps/48x48

2. Put both $ICONS/kde and $ICONS/3dpixmaps on the Imagepath, and make
   symlinks: 

	$ICONS/kde/mini      --> 14x14
	$ICONS/3dpixmaps/std --> 48x48

with neither kde/std nor 3dpixmaps/mini links.


The bigger advantage to <theme>/size is that you can mix multiple themes:

fvwmrc:
	ImagePath $ICONS/theme1:$ICONS/theme2...

$ICONS:
	theme1/std  --> 48x48
	theme1/mini --> 14x14
	theme2/std  --> 48x48
	theme2/mini --> 14x14
	theme3/std  --> 60x60
	...

In fact, this seems necessary: I looked at a couple of icon packages from
themes.org, and discovered that they contain only a half-dozen icons in
each package.  There's no way that a single theme pack will have
everything one needs.

Yeah, the brevity of the first approach is appealing.  But this requires: 

1.  changes to fvwm code
2.  that the mini- and normal-sized icons have thet same base name


Putting on my "fvwm developer"'s hat for a moment, I'd say, "No code
changes.  No way.".  FVWM should be lean & mean, and it already has too
much special-case code that rarely gets used.  Why should we add more to
support a nonexistant wm-icon distribution style that may never be widely
adopted?  Particularly if the current code supports the proposed wm-icon
layout as-is, albeit with a slightly more verbose configuration style.

Putting on my "fvwm-icon developer"'s hat now, let me address both points
in turn.  First, remember that FVWM is not the only game in town.  We need
to get several WM developer groups on board if this is to become at all
widespread.  It is not useful to me if it is confined to fvwm, for then we
might as well distribute the icons with FVWM code.  The goal is to get
non-FVWM code developers to maintain icon sets that FVWM finds useful.  We
cannot approach each WM team and say, "here's how you need to change your
code to support us."  They will legitimately ask "why should WE change to
support YOU?"

As for the second point; in a perfect world, this may not be a problem. 
But this ain't a perfect world: people may be getting the mini icon from a
different source than their standard sized one, so the names may not
match.  Or worse: maybe they use the same mini icon for three or four
(related) apps each of which has their own standard-sized icon.

Touch'e.  

In fact, this is true no matter HOW you do the directory layout.  Even in
a $ICONS/<theme>/<size> style, you can use

	ImagePath $ICONS

with symlinks

	$ICONS/std  --> <theme>/<size>
	$ICONS/mini --> <theme>/<size>

Dominik,
Well after some searching this is the best I could find was:

Status XQueryTree(display, w, root_return, parent_return,
     children_return, nchildren_return)
           Display *display;
           Window w;
           Window *root_return;
           Window *parent_return;
           Window **children_return;
           unsigned int *nchildren_return;

Now this call can can still throw a badWindow error if you pass it
a nonexistent window dispite what the man page says.  But what you
could do is pass the root window as the arg to w and then check the
children_return list for the window before you continue handling it.
The only problem here is that once you get the list back you need to do
a linear search to find it, and then you have to free the elements of
the list as well.

Well that is the best I could find, although it is pretty stupid of Xlib
to through and error but no give you any way to check for it first.

This is a non-starter.  It works fine for Joe FVWMUser's home Linux box,
but fails miserably on my work environment where 100+ developers
NFS-mount a huge directory structure containing free code like fvwm.

They won't be re-doing symlinks in the dist of wm-icons, that's for darn
sure :)

All changes _must_ be do-able from the config file, without even
write-access to the wm-icons archives.

I think it's the only choice.  We have GPL'd code and so everything must
be released under that license or its functional equivalent.

There are two reasons why I don't make it this big:

  a) You can't see the grid boxes anyway when you place the pointer.
  b) I think it's too confusing when the pointer jumps from somewhere
     in the window a long distance to the border. Remember that you
     can't get the pointer to the center of the sides when it has been
     in one corner. If that is what people want I have no problems, but
     I think if the area around the border is too big it will bother
     too many people.

I think it's been long enough since the last release. I'm
building 2.3.0 now so we can refer back to a more recent
code base.

Well, then I'll change the COPYING file to reflect this. But
what should we do with individual files? Can we leave them
untouched or should we put a GPL notice in there?

It has happened again! I was using my current config file
for months no and suddenly it's broken. This worked for a
long time:

  AddToFunc SetDefaultBackground
   + "I" Exec echo -e $0 > $HOME/.fvwm2/background
                     ^^^^

But suddenly I have to use this:

  AddToFunc SetDefaultBackground
   + "I" Exec echo -e $$0 > $HOME/.fvwm2/background
                     ^^^^^

Then I checked with older fvwm version: I tried 2.2,
and 2.1.4 and with neither the first version worked.
Looking at the code I wonder how it could ever have
worked, but it *did*. Am I losing my mind? This is
exactly the same way my '//' stopped working: it
worked well for month and then one day the current
and all previous fvwm versions broke at the same time.
I'm utterly puzzled.

Bye

I'll start working on the GSFR now, so don't expect anything to
compile in the next days. Any help is welcome, of course. For
a start I will create a gsfr.h file with all the GSFR specific
stuff.

I didn't follow the mail thread about the icons package, so I
don't know if this has come up already: we need some icons
for our fvwm modules too. These should be included in the
fvwm distribution, however.

It seems that some of the members in the name_list struct
(misc.h) are style parameters. Can somone identify which
of them should go into the new 'window_style' struct? And
which one should be part of the FvwmWindow struct? I was
to remove everything except the names from this structure.

In the system space (/usr/local/icons) for global configuration
or in the user space (~/icons or ~/wm-icons) for per-user configuration.

Having
  ImagePath $HOME/icons:/usr/local/icons
solves the problem.

~/icons (if any) can contain only two files: symlinks 'mini' and 'norm' to
actual icon-set directories. Any additional directory in ~/icons like
77x33-myown/ or myown/77x33/, whichever scheme we choose, will add to or
overwrite the system-wide icon-sets.

This is also the answer to:

Upcoming wm-icons has a script for (re)doing symlinks in the installed
place or at any other given place such as a user home dir.

You can do it from the config file. Just don't bother with symlinks at
all and use this:

ImagePath $HOME/icons:/usr/local/icons
Style "app1"     Icon my-favorite-norm-icon-set/app1.xpm
Style "app1" MiniIcon my-favorite-mini-icon-set/app1.xpm

Symlinks are optional.
Having symlinks as described above enables easy switch from one icon set
to another for any user without touching fvwmrc at all, why is it bad?

Regards,
Migo.

It seems that the GNOMEButton function is trying to load a module instead
of executing the internal function for root button proxying.  I looked at
it, and it might have somthing to do with the F_MOUSE I've assigned the
function in the functions.c table.  I'm unsure what that enum is for, so I
just guessed.  Could someone who is farmiliar with that function table
look at it or better yet clue me in on how it works so I can fix it?

You are right you can't see the grid lines but at least to me they seem
to be a fairlly intuitive division of a window.

I'm sure no matter which way we go it will be wrong.  I don't really
care one way or the other, I never really thought it was that big of a
deal anyway.Otherwise I think the patch does exactlly what users have
been wanting so good work.

My vote, 1 week.  (I would imagine we would never go for more than 1 week
without at least one snapshot being useable.)

A while ago, I added comments at the front of the command table,
Dominik added his observations:

 * Note: the 3rd column of this table is no longer in use!
 * Remove the field "code" from the structure "functions" in misc.c.
 * Then remove the values from this table.
 * dje 9/25/98
 *
 * Note: above comment is incorrect. The 3rd column is still used in
 * find_func_type which is called from menus.c. Some work has to be done
 * before it can be removed.
 * Dominik Vogt 21/11/98
 *
 * My   mistake. However,  they  are  no  longer  used for their original

 * dje 12/19/98.

Therefore, I suggest  that we  continue  this (using  F_NOP) until  we
either eliminate  the column, or  only put values   in the column when
they serve a useful purpose.

I believe this #define in fvwm.h tells the story:

#define ALL_COMMON_FLAGS (STARTICONIC|STICKY|WINDOWLISTSKIP| \

Everything seems to point to your preprocessor changing, not
any part of fvwm2.  Possibly fvwm2 is finding a different
preprocessor than it did in the past, but you should be able
to coerce fvwm2 into using any preprocessor you like.

Me, I keep hoping I won't have to resort to using a
preprocessor.

Well good news Dominik its not just you all my functions that use $<n>
fail now. Now I they did and still do work with yesterdays CVS, that is
before these three commits:

1999-04-07  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>
   
    * acconfig.h:
    * INSTALL.fvwm: Finish the removal of the NO_SAVEUNDERS and
    WINDOWSHADE configure options.

1999-04-07  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>
   
    * fvwm/functions.c (expand): some clean up
   
    * fvwm/Makefile.am (fvwm2_SOURCES): added gsfr.h
   
    * configure.in: changed version to 2.3.1
   
    * fvwm/repeat.h:
    * fvwm/repeat.c:
    * fvwm/functions.c:
    * fvwm/functions.h:
    moved all code for Repeat command to repeat.c and repeat.h
   
    * fvwm/Makefile.am (fvwm2_SOURCES): added bindings.h, repeat.c,
    repeat.h

1999-04-06  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>
   
    * fvwm/fvwm.c (CaptureAllWindows):
    (CaptureOneWindow):
    fixed coredump
   .
   .
   .
   * fvwm/functions.c (ExecuteFunction):
    additional input parameter: expand_cmd (suppress expanding '$...' on
    the command line).


I'll try and back through them unless you want to fess up and tell us
what you broke, (not to point fingers but your name is all over those
commits).  The last comment I grabbed from the changelog sounds auwfully
suspicious.

I did check and my prepocess output for the 2 versions diff exactlly the
same, so that is not the culprit

I'm not sure how long this was a problem since I haven't tried it in
a whilebut the following fix is needed to fix a core dump at startup,
the problem as far as I could tell was a division by zero problem on
window_w, now why window_w was == 0 I don't know.

 JP)  It seems that the GNOMEButton function is trying to load a module instead
 JP)  of executing the internal function for root button proxying.  I looked at
 JP)  it, and it might have somthing to do with the F_MOUSE I've assigned the
 JP)  function in the functions.c table.  I'm unsure what that enum is for, so I
 JP)  just guessed.  Could someone who is farmiliar with that function table
 JP)  look at it or better yet clue me in on how it works so I can fix it?

Jay,

GNOMEButton seems to work fine here with all three root buttons on
gmc.  Do you have the update so that your GNOMEButton is in all
capitals in the table (I committed this fix a couple of days ago,
since it changed for 2.3.x)?  Otherwise it thinks it is a module.

Nice work on the patch!

Regards,
Andrew

Dominik,
alright the problem seems to be in functions.c:expand
you do a 
if(input[i] == '$')
    {
      switch (input[i+1])
        {
        case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5':
        case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9':
          n = input[i+1] - '0';
          if(arguments[n] != NULL)
        {
          for(k=0;k<strlen(arguments[n]);k++)
            out[j++] = arguments[n][k];
          i++;
        } 

but arguments is NULL so it never gets filled and you just wind up
putting the int into out.  Now I'm not quite sure where this should be
handled, I figured I would let you look since your name is all over the
annotation.

Okay I lied here is the fix to functions.c, just 2 lines that put the
dollar in the string if there are no arguments.

Hi,
  Whenever a window is closed, the icon is always moved to the bottom
of any windows that may be in the way.  If this is a feature (I found
the subroutine call that explicitly does this everytime a window is
closed) then could it be made an option?  It is a real pain to go 
hunting for icons of windows that have been recently closed.

Thanks,
s.baker

Hi,
   I still haven't fully quantified this problem, but here are the
initial indications.  Sometimes when clicking to raise a window, it
won't raise.  This also occurs when using a key bound to the same 
function.  The only way to raise a window that exibits this characteristic
is to lower all the other windows that are on top of it.  This seems to
work fine, but is a pain, and it doesn't seem like it should work that
way.  I would be happy to try to pin it down more if you can give me
some pointers where to look.

Thanks

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm using fvwm2-2.0.46-11 in RH 5.1, XFree86-3.3.2-8. I have the same
problem I found in your bug tracking web site, under the unreproducible
section, message number 155.

The problem is that the buttons on either side of the title bar stop
responding to mouse clicks. Also, a resize using a mouse binding on the
window frame corners doesn't work either. This behaviour isn't present
when fvwm2 first starts, but invariably occurs eventually. Identical
functions, when invoked from a pop-up menu, work just fine.

I was surprised to see this under "unreproducible", because I found
another post in one of the linux newsgroups describing the same
behaviour.

I can imagine you'd like various information about my system, but would
rather not guess about that, and clutter things up with uneeded
attachments, info, etc. Please let me know what I can supply which will
help figure out what's going on here.

Unlike the poster of #155, I'm not using AnotherLevel - just plain
fvwm2.

Thanks for any help you can provide,
Jed.

Actually, it will (the name is 08x08-foo). Until someone decides to use
huge icons 100x100.

Yes, but the main reason for <size>-<theme> scheme is not sorting.
I just think there are no better schemes.

I don't like the second way. It is too complex compared to how it is now.

Mixing multiple themes?
Is not the purposes of a theme to be of one style (not several)?
I prefer to create a new theme composed from several, if you already mix.

This would be an advantage if it was a reality. The reality is there are no
icon sets with any arbitrary style AND any size. You must suppose, there is
one size in every given theme (sometimes two) and even suppose there are
no other themes with a given theme size.

For example, you wrote above: kde/14x14, 3dpixmaps/48x48. But there are no
such icon set and in fact never will be unless someone is going to rewrite
hundreds of icons from kde or 3dpixmaps. You can automatically resize
an existing icon set, but it will lose quality and color optimizations.

No, please, never speak of partial icon sets and wm-icons. These are things
that simply can't go together. The reason wm-icons is started is to
standardize existing chaos in icon sets. If your icon set is not complete,
there are several ways to try together to complete it. First, try to merge
it with other partial icon sets (like it is done for general icon sets).
Second, link absent icons to todo.xpm or to more appropriate existing icons.
If you start building your new icon sets from the provided template (full
with links) and replace some or all of the links, you will not need to worry
about completeness of your icon set.

You, anyway, can't use any existing icon set (partial or not) directly with
wm-icons, you must at least sit down and rename all icons to our
standartized icon names. Actually, it is much harder than just renaming,
since it is not always one to one.

All wm-icons icon sets are complete (in the sense of a current wm-icons
version) and will always stay such. It is very easy to keep them up to date,
just copy the new links from 01x01-template (which is always up to date, see
the next release) or better replace them by actual icons, if any.

Not exactly. Their base names must be provided in ImagePath and can be
different. The first icon found in the base directory from the path plus
subdir wins. So you can overwrite/add your own icon sets, just put your
new base directory first in the ImagePath.

A new version of wm-icons is out. It is already very usable. There is an
installation procedure and instructions how to use it with your .fvwm2rc
(very easy). And I can even switch between icon sets (4+4) from within a
menu.

What is new (there is file NEWS, which is more detailed):
  * 2 new icon themes (actually 5 new icon sets).
  * New icons including those for window operations.
  * Some useful scripts.

You can download wm-icons-0.1.0.tar.gz from http://wm-icons.dhs.org/ .
I would like you to install and test it.

If you want write access to the files (especially to FAQ), just send me
the modified file (I don't think we need a CVS).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think you've done the right thing. I added to colormap and pixmap
flags for the frame and forgot that it got passed on down to the other
windows. I'll clean up add_window.c a bit though, there is no need to do
bit manipulation on this stuff when it is only going to generate a fixed
number. It should be easier to see what's going on if it is spelled out
explicitly.

Cheers,
Tim.

Dominik, 
you seem to have missed a deletion when you applied the patch I sent, x_pager.c currentlly look like this at line 1534

      sx = 0;
      sy = 0;
      if(window_w != 0)
    sx = (100*(x*(Scr.VxMax+Scr.MyDisplayWidth)/window_w- Scr.Vx)) /
      Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
      if(window_h != 0)
    sy = (100*(y*(Scr.VyMax+Scr.MyDisplayHeight)/window_h - Scr.Vy)) /
      Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
#ifdef DEBUG
      fprintf(stderr,"[scroll]: %d %d %d %d %d %d\n", window_w, window_h, x,
          y, sx,sy);
#endif
      sy = (100*(y*(Scr.VyMax+Scr.MyDisplayHeight)/window_h - Scr.Vy)) /
    Scr.MyDisplayHeight;
      /* Make sure we don't get stuck a few pixels fromt the top/left border.
       * Since sx/sy are ints, values between 0 and 1 are rounded down. */
      if(sx == 0 && x == 0 && Scr.Vx != 0) sx = -1;
      if(sy == 0 && y == 0 && Scr.Vy != 0) sy = -1; 


if you look close sy gets set twice you want to delete the one after
the #ifdef DEBUG, this one doesn't matter to much sx was the one that
was giving me troubles because window_w was 0, but we should cover them
both.

Can you try to find a step by step description to create this problem?
What might help is to lower the said window before raising it. Does
this help? This would indicate that fvwm thinks the window is already
raised and thus doesn't raise it again.

That's a feature called 'icon boxes'. Somewhere in your configuration
file you should find a 'Stlye' command with an 'IconBox' option. Throw
away all icon box related styles:

  Style * IconBox <parameters>

Please tell us if this solves your problem.

The 'invariably occurs eventually' part most likely means that you
pressed the num-lock or scroll-lock key (or some other locking modifier
key except caps-lock). Unfortunately X treats them as ordinary
modifiers. Thus you would have to grab a long list of modifier
combinations if you wanted to ignore all of them for key bindings.
I have tried it and it is *really* slow.

Should this not be the problem in your case, please fetch a recent
snapshot of the sources and try again. We won't spend time debugging
the outdated 2.0.46 anyway. The current official release is 2.2.
In the current development source there is the command
'IgnoreModifiers' that switches off specific modifier keys with
aforementioned drawback. A better solution is to disable the
modifiers with xmodmap. I've done that a few weeks ago and I'm
perfectly happy now. There is a detailed description how to do
this in the latest FAQ.

Well, that doesn't help us. If there is a bug the developers have
to reproduce this and if we can't we need some cooperation. In the
end we have the choice to clutter up the 'open bugs' section or to
move bugs to unreproducible some day. I hate to do that, but what
else can we do? I can't spend a week in hunting down elusive problems
that may not even be bugs.

None required for now.

Not a high priority, but definitely nice to have. When Linux grows

directories.

I wouldn't assume everybody uses a theme. Personally I'd be happy if I found
a series of icons for my FvwmButtons in one place, but in the end I'll look
through all available icons. A directory for each icon size is acceptable,
but I wouldn't like diving into dozens of theme subdirectories.

I thought that's where the new mailing list would come in ;-)
But joking apart, this may be the biggest problem. There are
thousands of icons in many collections out there, but it is
very difficult to find one that is complete enough to decorate
your desktop with.

To me, five complete icon sets are much more valuable than 500 incomplete.
If the main purpose is to 'standardize existing chaos' (which I interpret
to say implicitly 'not to provide complete standard icon sets' - I may
be wrong) the idea loses much of its appeal to me. Viewing a thousand icons
isn't too hard with a good icon browser.

Since I'll never be downloading a snapshot I'd say one day
suffices. But if people want to keep it a bit longer I have

in misc.h called 'name_list' that seems to contain some style
specific values.

The fix should work, but what utterly confuses me is that $0
doesn't work when I use 2.2 or 2.1.4 executables. I can see what
I've done wrong, but still...

Why not both?

Put all the files grouped by size into a "size" hierarchy:

	share/fvwm/icons/sizes/16x16
	share/fvwm/icons/sizes/32x32
	share/fvwm/icons/sizes/64x64
	share/fvwm/icons/sizes/misc

Then, add the theme directories, with each of their component icons as
symlinks into the size hierarchy:

	share/fvwm/icons/themes/dragnet
	share/fvwm/icons/themes/metal
	share/fvwm/icons/themes/angryfruitsalad
	.
	.
	.

This allows you to have icons appearing in multiple themes, etc.

Also consider:

	share/fvwm/icons/titlebar
	share/fvwm/icons/buttons

etc.

Dominik has fixed the problem with the resize handles, I fixed one with
the border not being drawn today.  To test the non-default visual use
you have to configure your Xserver to have a 8 bit pseudocolor as the
default visual, and compile fvwm.c with -DPICK_TRUECOLOR. After that
fvwm should use a truecolor visual for all the border and title
decorations, menus and the feedback  window. Applications that use the
default visual will have a border that doesn't look right but
applications that use the truecolor visual (netscape -visual TrueColor)
should have a border that looks right when their colormap is switched
in.  If you have a fancy graphics card and server that can display two
colormaps at the same time everything should look peachy.

I've tested this with 8 bit colormaps (honest I did and I didn't see any
BadMatches with the resize handles, very strange) but I'd feel happier
if someone would test it with different depths.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS does anyone know where I can copy some -visual argument parsing
from?  I know xv does it but it's not GPL so I don't want to look at the
source.

xscreensaver does something, but I didn't really understand it.

Unfortunatelly I don't have any of the 2.1.x's laying around, to check
I suppose we could look in CVS archive to find it, although I don't
remember how to get an old file version based on tag.

hey but it doesn't matter to much it worked in 2.2 and it works again
now so we are free and clear of seeing any bug reports on it

Don't look at the xscreensaver source itself look at one of the smaller
hacks like worm.  Failing that hit ftp.ora.pub and get the example
for vol1 of the x refrences, as I recall their is an example in their
for handling quite a bit of visual stuff.  But I would try some the
xscreensaver hacks first.

Some questions:

Should I mirror this on ftp.fvwm.org?

Should this be announced on fvwm-announce@fvwm.org?  If you think so, go
ahead and post it there and I will approve it.

If you ever do decide to use CVS, I'll be happy to set things up at fvwm.org.

cvs update -r version-2_1_4

This may stick the tag; you may need to do cvs update -A to unstick them
and track the head again.

I added a bunch of stuff to the cvs.html file, including how to do this.

Yes, it will stick.

Alternatively, rather than whacking your existing workspace, you can
just check it out into a different directory:

  cvs -d :pserver:... co -d fvwm-test -r version-2_1_4 fvwm

then just delete the fvwm-test directory when you're done playing with it.

Thanks Jason, and Paul, that worked.

Dominik, it looks like it was a slight off by one error on the
incrementing of i, and after staring at this expand function for a day
now, can I suggest we all agree on an indentation style that actually
moves left as you increase the level.

But anyway, now that it all works, good work on the expand function I am
noticing a definite speed up on executing functions with params as well
as an overall speed up in start time. Thanks,

Brad

Are you sure you don't use any theme? Unless you have NoIcon, you must use
some set of icons. I think you can call this theme 'domivogt'. :)

If you only search for icons to use with your FvwmButtons, wm-icons will
not serve you. You need not standartized sets for this. There are lots of
nice icons 48x48 at:
  http://nether.tky.hut.fi/iconstore/
  http://icons.themes.org/archive/

Maybe my English is not very rich, but I think I was very clear saying
that all icon sets used within wm-icons are (designed to be) complete.
This means you can use such single set on your desktop and be able to
switch to another similar standartized set with a mouse click.
Standartizing existing chaos does not contradict with providing complete
standard icon sets, there are enough existing resources to choose from.

For now we can only acquire icons created by others, since we are
programmers, not artists. But I hope, sometimes artists will create new
complete themed icon sets especially for wm-icons, using its standardized
name list.

Mikhael.

I don't know.
If you are asking about the tarball, it is GPL'd, can be mirrored freely.

I will announce it if there will not be reported fatal problems with it,
like scripts failed on different platforms.

I also think, the project must be announced outside fvwm, since it is
really window manager independent and we would like to know what other
people think on this subject. I think about freshmeat and newsgroups.

Thank you. Currently it seems to be faster with one motivated man, which
can not always be true.

I downloaded fvwm-2.3.0 ran configure and typed make.  The make had failed
telling me that file gnome.c was missing.  Sure enough that file is missing from
the tar file.  I downloaded the file from
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/fvwm and everything compiled
correctly.

I had the same problem with one of the snapshots.

It seems that make dist doesn't know it has to add that file.  How is this
supposed to work?  Perl uses a MANIFEST file, but it seems that automake
has some sort of autodetection (and it's not working).

Are you building with gnome?  This is in the Makefile.am:

if GNOME
GNOME = gnome.c
else
GNOME =
endif

fvwm2_SOURCES = add_window.c			\
	...      				\
	$(GNOME)				\

Perhaps it would be better to have it compile gnome.c as an
empty file.  At least makedist would work.

Does fvwm own xpmroot?  If so, would it be possible to add an option to xpmroot
that would expand (or shrink as the case may be) a XPM file to the screen size
instead of tiling it?

I don't like to use "xv" as it is slow (plus I don't think there is a command
line option to maximize an object).

So I have several xpm's that are 1280x1024 and 2.6 megs.  It would be nice if I
could store smaller versions that xpmroot would expand to fit the screen.

Well it's just an idea.

Yes I compiled with gnome.

The problem seems to be that gnome.c is not in the tar files.

This is wrong.  If you do it this way then, unless you build the _dist_
with GNOME support so that GNOME is defined, the sources won't include
the gnome.c file and thus the dist tar file won't include it either.

Just as we're seeing.

That's one way to go.  There's another way, too; you can probably add
gnome.c to the EXTRA_DIST variable and take care of getting it compiled
without adding it to the fvwm2_SOURCES variable so it's not dup'd.
Putting "gnome.o" in one of the extra objects variables oughta do it.

On the other hand, if you build the dist without GNOME support you don't
get any dependency info for gnome.c either.  What kind of a problem is
this (I thought we'd already decided on a solution, but now I don't
remember it)?

Well, I'm not when I do the snapshots and whoever did the dist probably
didn't either.  But building with Gnome and running 'make dist' are two

regardless of how things were configured.

Subject: new read logic

the new read logik doesn't quite behave as advertised:
I have $HOME/.fvwm2rc and no $HOME/.fvwm subdir and I don't export
FVWM_USERHOME. If I start fvwm from my home dir, everything is ok,
but if I start from somewhere else, it doesn't find my .fvwm2rc and I get

[FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file 'fvwm2rc' not found, looked for ..fvwm2rc and
/usr/local/etc/fvwm2rc

(note that there is a '/' missing in the error message between '.'
(the value of user_home_ptr) and '.fvwm2rc'.)

The problem is that fvwm never tries to look in $HOME/.fvwm2rc, since
user_home_ptr is either $FVWM_USERHOME or './.fvwm' or '.'

What remains is a bit clean up and debugging. I have noticed
three problems up to now:

  1) Modules have to be adapted to new style flags
     (e.g. the window background of the pager is black).
  2) The right title buttons are not displayed.
  3) 'Maximize grow' doesn't work.

Most of the code is in fvwm.h (all the important structs).
The window_flags struct has to be accesed with the macros in
gsfr.h. There are similar macros for the style_flags struct
in style.h.

I'm very tired now. Please, everybody should help fixing the
bugs and especially porting all modules. Look around the code
to get comfortable with the changes (I'll answer questions
tomorrow, but not now).

Bye

To expand an image with xv use "-max" or "-maxp"

I've found "xli" faster than xv.  With xli I use "-fill" or "-full".

Maybe someone else knows xpmroots history.

I can't answer your question, but the '-max' option to xv does this.
Speed depends heavily on the original dimension of the picture. And
if you already think xv is slow you will hate it (it can easily take
15 seconds).

Really? I simply replaced a list of if's with a switch. I wouldn't think
that has a noticeable impact.

I think we have to configure with --enable-gnome as we has to
with --enable-extras in the past. I never though of this.
Could someone put this step in the DEVELOPERS file again?
I just follow it step by step when I built tarballs.

We have to put this into CVS. Jason, I'm still an illiterate
when it comes to CVS. Can you install the fvwm-cats page
in a separate module (we don't want to download pictures
with the sources, do we?) in CVS and give the same commit
privileges as for the fvwm module?

Of course, any pet can be a 'fvwm cat' 8-)

Yes, I am sure because I didn't find the icons I was lookig for. Six of
the eleved icons I have are mostly black, three of them are a bit
lighter and two are too colourful to fit into the set :(

What I wanted to say (but didn't) was that I consider a theme complete
only if it has the same icons for a wide range of sizes. This will be
a lot of work.

In the meantime I noticed 2 and 3 are the same problem:
The MWM hints seem to be misinterpreted, so maximize,
iconify and windowshade are forbidden.

Well, I read it seven hours after you sent it.  we can check the headers to

Seeing as individual files may be used outside of the FVWM project
environment, they really all ought to be labelled with the standard
GPL notice.  To quote from the GPL file:

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

===============================

Hope this helps.  It will add a little bloat, but it's probably worth
it in the long run.

Seeing as we're now using the Linux-type numbering scheme, we should
probably say something like this on the FVWM web page:

"The latest stable release series is version 2.2.x and can be
downloaded from <here>.  Beta releases are currently numbered 2.3.x
and can be downloaded from <here>.  Daily development snapshots are
available from <here>, although you are warned that they may not even
compile!"

And they have stable/ and unstable/ directories on ftp site to help
make the distinction even clearer.

   Julian

Since gnome.c is suitably #ifdef'd, it can be compiled without trouble on
non-GNOME systems.  So it is probably easier just to put it into
fvwm2_SOURCES unconditionally.

As Paul observed, this will generate bogus dependency info (no
dependencies except config.h) for gnome.o if the dist-maker doesn't have
GNOME. It is not clear to me that this is much of a problem, though: any
non-developer is going to download the package, configure && make && make
install.  The dependency info does not come into play unless one touches a
file and then does "make" without "make clean" (i.e., until one starts
doing development work).

I was  hoping to avoid  the condition  created by starting  fvwm2 from
other than  $HOME.  I don't  think everything  worked correctly in the
past  when this  was  done.    For   example, FvwmAnimate saved    its
configuration in  the  current directory.   I  would guess this  would
cause havoc with fvwm2    created processes  that don't reset    their
current working directory.

If I attempt to make the logic work from any directory, I've got to
do more parsing, mallocs and strcats to put $HOME where its needed.

How would you all feel about documenting this as a restriction?

I'll look at the message, under some conditions the logic actually takes
a 3rd look which isn't in the message either.  I was concerned about
the message logic exceeding the complexity of the actual read logic.
It might make more sense to just generate "file .fvwm2rc not found".

I'm still not  happy with the  current colorlimit logic being applied.
Here is the basis for the current limit:

 * The ColorLimit command is  ignored if the  user has no reason to limit
 * color.  This is so the   same configuration will work on  colorlimited
 * and   non-colorlimited  displays  without    resorting   to using    a
 * preprocessor.
 *
 * Lets assume  the display is  no more  than  2000x1000 pixels. Ie.  the
 * display can display no more than 2,000,000 million  pixels at once.  A
 * display depth of 21 will display 2  million colors at once.  Hence the
 * logic below.

I can  refine  this by using  the  screen dimensions to  get the total
pixels instead of 2000x1000.  But the idea that each pixel will have a
unique color is  flawed.  Also  all the xpms  I've  ever seen use  256
colors or less.

What I would like is for the system that I currently have access to
(1600x1200, 65K colors) to disable Colorlimiting.  Any suggestions on
a better algorithm for this?

Right now, I lack any sort of tool that will work with a 16 bit display
that will tell me how many colors are in use.  Maybe I should hack up
"colormap" to get some kind of baseline numbers.

Other  than that, has  anyone with a  16 bit  display  ever run out of
colors?

Well I was able to notice it on my dual processor ultra2, and then
I really noticed when I brought fv up on a sparc 2.  I think if
I remmember correctlly it has to do with the number of assembly
instructions needed for a switch vice an if-else construct.

But switches were made for char to char compares like this if-else's get
to clumssy and hard to read

That's because you have a static palette, you don't alloc any
colors/modify colormaps, you just use them.

Only PseudoColor displays runs out of colors... 16 bit displays are
usually (99.999%) TrueColor.. Same for 15 bit.. I'd say disable the
colorlimiting if bpp >= 15 ...

One has to think about the case with mixed visuals tho (I haven't had
time to investigate the recent visual stuff implemented), like default
visual 8bpp but possibility of 24bpp...

If I remember correctly, switch statements (especially large ones) can
get "optimized" to use hashing by the compiler.  This could profoundly
affect performance if the code is executed repeatedly.

I don't think using the screen size is going to give anything useful
since windows can overlap (and be iconified), you could have thousands
of windows each with a unique colour per pixel.

Somewhere in X.h or Xlib.h is a bit of blurb about visual types. I think
it says that if the visual class is odd it's a static type and if it's
even it is one you allocate colours out of. You could use that to
disable ColorLimit on static displays.  For non-static displays you
could use the depth to decide what to do with ColorLimit.

Tim.

Personally I would argue for a solution where the descision is based
mainly on the class of the used visual. If the X-server already has
decided on a static set of colors that we are allowed to use, there
is no point for us to try to save slots in the colormap for later use.
Probably this should be combined with a test for visuals with
ridiciously large writeable colormaps.

I have attached a patch implements this.

The 16 bit displays I have been using have been TrueColor.

Yes, I know that switches are faster. That's the reason why I used
them. But there were 6 if statements that had to be checked for
each parameter of a function for every call of a fvwm function.
I can't believe it makes a noticeable difference unless you use
tons of functions.

Yes, I know that switches are faster. That's the reason why I used
them. But there were 6 if statements that had to be checked for
each parameter of a function for every call of a fvwm function.
I can't believe it makes a noticeable difference unless you use
tons of functions.

I don't think GNOME has external dependencies. It compiles
well when I explicitly enable GNOME support although I don't
have GNOME on my machine. Hope that will never be a
prerequisite for the developers.

* Removed unused variable in gnome.c.
* Rewrote style parsing to get rid of those horrible macros. On my machine
(gcc, i386) this saves 3696 bytes. Macros should be forbidden!!!
* Moved icon code and prototypes to icons.[ch]. icons.h is new.
* Added GPL notice to all .c and .h files in fvwm and libs.
* Reformatted comments in style.c. Can we agree to put comments always on a
separate line? It's much easier to change the code then.

I think changing  6  ifs to a   switch might be  faster,  but Domink's
reasoning about the overall impact seems  sound.  The recent change to
the   command table, (using strcmp    vs.  strcasecmp during a  binary
search) might be a better candidate for explaining a visible speedup.

Heres another expression that might not translate too well, "looking a
gift horse in the mouth".

I've got a  sparc 1+, about 1/2 the  speed of the  sparc 2.  I haven't
noticed any recent improvement, but I haven't rebuilt  for a few days.
I'll check it out.

If its style.c, those must be my comments, inserted and lined up
like that by hitting M-; in XEmacs:

  if(lastptr != NULL)                   /* If not first entry in list */
    lastptr->next = nptr;               /* chain this entry to the list */
  else                                  /* else first entry in list */
    Scr.TheList = nptr;                 /* set the list root pointer. */
} /* end function */

Seems to me like a good way to code.  The comment doesn't simply
repeat the code, it explains what I thought I was doing.

I'll take a look at what you did to it.

I don't care too much for modules not getting this right, my main
concern is that fvwm should always be able to find $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

I would be more happy about a return of $HOME (the session code needs
that directory as well, so maybe some mallocs and strcats can be combined),
but if it doesn't return, the documentation for Read has to be changed
(sed s/\$HOME/\./g).

Yes. You could leave the more detailed search info in a debug message.

WIBNI there was an option to fvwm which told it to automatically focus
transient
windows when they are mapped (or created, dunno about the right
terminology)?

This allows people who use MouseFocus or SloppyFocus to just type Alt-F in
Netscape, say, and immediately continue to enter the string to search for,

rather than having to use the mouse to focus the transient window.

This feature was implemented in ctwm 3.5.2, and I have found it to be
sufficient,
but a potential improvement might be to focus the new transient window
only
if it is a transient_for the window which currently has focus.

In bug report 293, I requested fvwm to automatically focus new transient
windows if in MouseFocus or SloppyFocus mode.

A possible enhancement would be to keep a history of such windows so that
the disappearance of a transient window would cause focus to return to the
window which had focus before that transient appeared.

Example: user hits Alt-F in Netscape.  A transient window appears which
asks the user for a search string.  User enters search string, then a new
transient window appears which says `End of document reached, continue
from beginning?'.  Hitting ESC now causes the second transient window to
disappear, and it is clear that the user now wishes the first transient
window to have focus again.

The ctwm 3.5.2 implementation referred to in bug report # 293 does not
offer
this feature.

Has anyone seen the following:

http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/

It is a library for recognizing "gestures" made with the mouse and doing
things based on them.  It's a really neat technique.  But the interesting
thing is that a patch to FVWM (2.0.45, alas) is provided which enables
strokes.  A compressed .fvwm2rc excerpt:

# Strokes
#       num             button  context mod.    action
Stroke  14789           2       A       N       Exec exec xlock -mode blank&  
Stroke  258             2       A       N       Exec exec xterm&
Stroke  563214789       2       A       N       Exec exec exmh&
Stroke  7415963         2       A       N       Exec exec netscape&
Stroke  741236987       2       A       N       Destroy
Stroke  1478963         2       A       N       Popup "Apps"
Stroke  74123           2       A       N       Module "winlist" FvwmWinList transient
Stroke  74159           2       A       N       Move

Imagine a grid like:

  1  2  3

  4  5  6

  7  8  9

Then just plot those strings of digits on the grid and you have the stroke.

The author announced this way back when (two years ago) but things were
pretty dead then.  Perhaps someone might want to take another look at this;
the patch is actually pretty minimal and the parsing cleanups should make
it even smaller.

And this "address" spells 'e "*'.
I've got another one that spells "Wind".

I also added a little debugging and got fvwm2 to start.

Plainly some string is overlaying the icon_name pointer.
The one above looks like part of a style command:

Style "*" xx
    ^^^^

the only "Wind" I could find in my configuration was "WindowFont".
If we don't get this one, this weekend, I'll try Purify at work.

Heres the original IconFill value parser:

/* Check word after IconFill to see if its "Top,Bottom,Left,Right" */
static int Get_TBLR(char *restofline,unsigned char *IconFill) {
  *IconFill = 0;                        /* init */
  if (ITIS("B") || ITIS("BOT")|| ITIS("BOTTOM")) {
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLBOT; /* turn on bottom bit */
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLHRZ; /* turn on vertical */
  } else if (ITIS("T") || ITIS("TOP")) { /* else if its "top" */
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLHRZ; /* turn on vertical */
  } else if (ITIS("R") || ITIS("RGT") || ITIS("RIGHT")) {
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLRGT; /* turn on right bit */
  } else if (!(ITIS("L") || ITIS("LFT") || ITIS("LEFT"))) { /* "left" */
    return 0;                           /* anything else is bad */
  }
  return 1;                             /* return OK */
}

And the new one:

/* Check word after IconFill to see if its "Top,Bottom,Left,Right" */
static int Get_TBLR(char *token, unsigned char *IconFill) {
  /* init */
  if (StrEquals(token, "B") ||
      StrEquals(token, "BOT")||
      StrEquals(token, "BOTTOM"))
  {
    /* turn on bottom and verical */
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLBOT;
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLHRZ;
  }
  else if (StrEquals(token, "T") ||
	   StrEquals(token, "TOP"))
  {
    /* turn on vertical */
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLHRZ;
  }
  else if (StrEquals(token, "R") ||
	   StrEquals(token, "RGT") ||
	   StrEquals(token, "RIGHT"))
  {
    /* turn on right bit */
    *IconFill |= ICONFILLRGT;
  }
  else if (StrEquals(token, "L") ||
	   StrEquals(token, "LFT") ||
	   StrEquals(token, "LEFT"))
  {
    *IconFill = 0;
  }
  else
  {
    /* anything else is bad */
    return 0;
  }

  /* return OK */
  return 1;
}


Careful examination will show that the  initialization of *IconFill at
the  top was  removed,  and I think the   intended replacement is  the
assignment in the case of parsing the "LEFT" argument.

Since the original value is not initialized, and since the other
values only turn on selected bits, this can lead to the command being
parsed with the error message:

[FVWM][ProcessNewStyle]: <<ERROR>> IconFill must specify a horizontal and vertical direction.

So the fix is to initialize on the way in, and do nothing if the word
parsed is "LEFT".

I would commit the fix myself, but the rules are code, test, commit.
Right now, all I get is core files.


I can't say I care  for the coding style, but  it seems to me that the
rule seems to be, "the last person to make a significant change wins".
Although in this case I think the  extent of the change didn't justify
changing the style.

I don't think that coding styles can be enforced when people are doing
volunteer work, and I know  how hard it  is to work  on code thats not
written "your way", so I may be complaining, but  only to suggest that
a little restraint is called for, and this may be a borderline case.

One alternative is to simply put the comment in a line or two *before* the
stanza in question.  Some find it easier to read a sentence that explains
a clump of code, rather than short note at the end of each code line.

Also, I think you can assume that anyone reading the code understands what
a linked list is.  So you should be able to shorten the comment to 

  /* Add nptr to the end of [whatever Scr.TheList is] list */

To the contrary, gnome.c says:

	#include "config.h"

	#ifdef GNOME
	...
	#include "fvwm.h"
	#include "screen.h"
	#include "misc.h"


If GNOME is not defined, the only dependecy in the makefile is config.h. 

But as I said before, I don't think this is a huge deal.  If thi really
bothers someone, you can alway put the other include before the #ifdef
GNOME line.

I just had a look at the read logic, and read.c has this to say:

/*
 * func to do actual read/piperead work
 * Arg 1 is file name to read.
 *   If the filename starts with "/", just read it.
 *   Otherwise we need the user home directory which is either
 *   "." or ".fvwm/".
 *   If the file starts with a dot, and  no ".fvwm" dir, read
 *     .x, sysconfdir/x.
 *   If the file starts with a dot, and  a ".fvwm" dir, read
 *     .fvwm/x, sysconfdir/x, .x.
 *   If the file doesn't start with a dot, and no ".fvwm" dir, read
 *     x, sysconfdir/x.
 *   If the file doesn't start with a dot, and a ".fvwm" dir, read
 *     .fvwm/x, sysconfdir/x.
 *
 * Arg 2 (optional) "Quiet" to suppress message on missing file.
 */
static void ReadSubFunc(XEvent *eventp,Window junk,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
                        unsigned long context, char *action,int* Module,
                        int piperead)



Umm... does this seem overly-complicated to anyone else?

I particularly don't like programs second-guessing me based on whether the
filename has a leading dot or not.

I would favour a simpler logic:

at startup time:
	if environment variable FVWM_USERHOME is set
		fvwm_userhome = $FVWM_USERHOME
	else
		fvwm_userhome = $HOME


then read( filename ) does one of exactly two things:

	if filename is absolute (start with leading slash) 
		read filename
	else
		try fvwm_userhome/filename
		if not found try configdir/filename

where configdir is the system-wide config directory.  Currently this is
${sysconfdir}, but since we're dumping lotsa stuff in it, we ought to
change to ${sysconfdir}/fvwm.

Subject: icon reliefs

Fvwm2 seems to create a relief around icon bitmaps that don't have
a mask specified for them. Is it possible to disable this relief
altogether without disabling the relief for the associated
icon text?

Thanks.

FvwmWinListworks incorrectly (ie., it only reports the geometry of an
application at the time it was launched. Once an application changes its
own
geometry by resizing itself FvwmWinList does not update the width and
height
values.

Hello,

It would be nice if Fvwm2 could be given the option to use dynamic
resizing of windows, rather than "rubber band" resizing.

Hello,

It would be nice if a Style Option called StartsBelowFocusWindow
or something like that were introduced. This option would be very
useful, especially on small screens. It would have the application
with the given style option start below the window with the focus.
Once the application is launched, it can be repositioned, raised,
etc...
The advantage of this feature is that if, say, you are typing in
an xterm while netscape is being fired then you can actually finish
your sentence while waiting without having netscape pop up in
front of the xterm and take the focus away from your xterm.
So, in general, the StartsBelowFocusWindow style option would be
nice to use with anything that either occupies a large amount
of desktop space or takes a long time to appear on the desktop.

Best Regards.

I think I have already implemented what Neil is asking for...
look for the StartLowered style option.

Hi gang,

Am I wrong in thinking that 

	char c;
	scanf( "%d", &c );

is illegal?  

I thought that "char c" promised only a single writable byte of storage,
whereas the scanf is going to assume a pointer to an integer.  Hence we
run the risk of SEGV, no?

If you are referring to session.c then I'm sorry, its my fault.
Dominik had an int there.

Yes, that's what I'm referring to.  The original code was reading into a
"char".  I changed it to an int.  Then it got changed back to reading into
a char. 

Since I was outvoted by two changes to one, I thought maybe my
understanding of this was flawed.  ;-)

Yes, it is very complicated for the user. This entire comment must go into
the man page. But I understand every step in this logic and why it is
needed. It tries to be both new and backward compatible. Actually to be
truely backward compatible, '.' must be replaced by $HOME and .fvwm/ by
$HOME/.fvwm/ . Even if this requires additional malloc.

I think, Dan wanted to introduce $HOME/.fvwm, so the last line, probably,
must be (perl):
                fvwm_userhome = (-d "$HOME/.fvwm")? "$HOME/.fvwm": $HOME

In the implemented logic, current directory (must be home directory)
is treated specially, all configuration files must start with a period.
So,  Read .fvwm2rc  will search in:
    $HOME/.fvwm2rc and/or $HOME/.fvwm/fvwm2rc

I think it is acceptable that home directory is not treated specially.
In this case the suggested new logic (by Steve) is ok.

The problem with segfaults in the BroadcastName call from AddWindow 
seems to be that tmp_win->icon_name can go uninitialized
now that tmp_win is no longer calloc'ed, but safemalloc'ed.

The relevant initialization of icon_name is:

  if (XGetWMIconName (dpy, tmp_win->w, &text_prop))
    tmp_win->icon_name = (char *)text_prop.value;
  if(tmp_win->icon_name==(char *)NULL)
    tmp_win->icon_name = tmp_win->name;

This may fail to initialize icon_name if XGetWMIconName returns 0.

I have inserted an 

  else 
    tmp_win->icon_name = NULL;

to cure the problem. To prevent similar problems with other parts
of tmp_win, it may be safer to put a       

  memset(tmp_win, '\0', sizeof(FvwmWindow));

after the safemalloc.

I didn't want to mess anything up, but in this case I simply couldn't
understand the code the way it was formatted. The result: a bug. I'm the
last person to say anything against commenting code, but to be honest:
*this* extend of comments confuses me more that uncommented code

I guess you are right, since compiling the current session.c with
-Wformat (causes gcc to check sscanf arguments) gives:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../libs  -I/usr/X11R6/include
-DFVWM_MODULEDIR=\"/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.1\"
-DFVWM_CONFIGDIR=\"/usr/local/etc\" -Wformat -c session.c
session.c: In function `LoadWindowStates':
session.c:391: warning: unsigned int format, different type arg (arg 3)

I think  I've misled some of  you.  It isn't a  case  of icon_name not
being  initialised, I've now discovered that  the entire style section
of the window structure is overlayed.  Check it out:

So far, I haven't tracked down the source.  I think Purify will
catch it right away, but I have to go to work to use Purify.
(Well, I never tried running fvwm2 remotely.)

The comment reflects what the code accomplishes, not the implementation.
(There aren't as many ifs/ands in the implementation.)

For relative paths, there are a maximum of 3 probes for the file.
I didn't think documenting the 3rd probe was necessary since its there
for the case where you have created a ".fvwm" directory, but you have
existing reads of files in $HOME for files that don't have a leading dot,
and reads for files that have a leading dot that you haven't moved,
for example, "read .myconfig/.myfile".

I'm sorry this is complicated.  My first inclination was to have all
config files have a leading dot.  Once I agreed to remove the dot
when the file was not in $HOME, it became a little bit more involved.

Except for using $HOME, thats what I'm doing.  Note that the original
code also dealt with the getenv on $HOME failing.  I was trying to
keep it simple, and decided to avoid $HOME.

I must be missing something.  I think the 3rd probe is needed for
backward compatibility.  Do we get that with this proposal?

Note that the first read when there is a ".fvwm" directory must
be in the ".fvwm" directory.  This is to avoid old .xxx files
in the users home directory.

I agree with this, in fact I install with sysconfdir set this way.
Any hints on how this can be made the default?

I understand, code with curly braces on separate lines, and even
worse ifs without curly braces do the same thing to me.

I often change code to the coding style I use just to understand it.

Unless we all get transplanted with the exact same brain, theres
not much I can see to do about it.

According to Hamish Moffatt <hamish@debian.org>:

: It would be excellent if fvwm2 had support for strokes.
: www.etla.net/libstroke/ has the library libstroke (which I have already
: packaged as libstroke0) and patches for fvwm2.

I haven't checked it out myself, though.

Why are we aiming for backwards compatibility on such a trivial matter
at the expense of making the docs *so* complicated?  I think that
small changes in logic between version 2.2 and 2.4 are not that
disasterous, especially as there will be many more significant changes
as well.  I think that users should always be encouraged to look at
NEWS files, which should contain the key points first.  Maybe have the
fvwm2 manpage begin "If you have recently upgraded your FVWM, please
remember to look at the NEWS file for imporant notes about changes in
this version."  And the worst that will, most likely, happen is that
some of their config files won't be read, and they'll wonder why,
figure it's 'cos they've upgraded and maybe, just maybe, they'll read
the docs.

Or is there something much subtler that I'm missing here?

Oh.  Hey, you're right!  

So it looks like gnome.c mostly messes with X server atoms.  Is there a
heavy memory penalty for compiling it?  Is there any reason not to default
GNOME to be "on" ?

Why?  

If the user wants to use $HOME/.fvwm, let them set the FVWM_USERHOME
variable.  That's what it's there for.

  ^^^^^^^^
Yes, that's pretty handy, I find.  I am now compiling fvwm exclusively
with -Wall (which turns on -Wformat, among others).  I highly recommend
doing this.  Of course, it only works well if you have fully-prototyped
system- and X-headers.  Otherwise you might investigate shutting off
prototype warnings, or grep out stuff in /usr/include and /usr/...X11.

No, the code also plays games with leading dots, and treats "$HOME/.fvwm"
as magical.

That's rather complicated to understand, and seems unnecessary to me.

Simple.  Change the line in configure.in from

	FVWM_CONFIGDIR='${sysconfdir}'
to
	FVWM_CONFIGDIR='${sysconfdir}/${PACKAGE}'

I think people expect programs to read config files from ~, not from
the current working directory.  So fvwm should be able to find ~ even
with FVWM_USERHOME unset.

Just MHO.

The installation form creates the users .fvwm directory by executing a
mkdir.    Any  hints as   to how  I   make   the users  profile export
$FVWM_USERHOME?

I'll repeat, my first pass on this was to leave the leading dots on
config files.  I thought there was concensus that all config files
stored in sub directories would be stored without the leading dot.

When I change the man page so that it reads this way, I don't think
thats terribly complicated.

I think you are missing something.

The extra read for compatibility is NOT documented.
Its not meant to be used intentionally by a user.
It only kicks in when the read command encounters an non-quiet
read, that has otherwise failed, and the file name is such that
read.c thinks it may be a file created before the sub-directory
feature was created.

The issue seems to be the complexity of the comment in read.c.

The actual code in read.c is a little simpler than the comment,
and the man page is simpler than the code.

Don't get me wrong.  I'll change the code if we can come to an
agreement.

In this case what I'm after is being able to store config files either
in $HOME or a sub-directory off $HOME, and no additional hand editting
of configurations.  The "dot flipping" was not my idea, although
I see some logic to it.

Yes, that's what I had proposed; $FVWM_USERHOME is an *override* for
those who want the config stuff somewhere else. 

To reiterate, the user config files will be searched for

	* in $FVWM_USERHOME if set, else
	* in $HOME

and no games with leading dots.

This was discussed before and most people thought there was no reason to
not leave it on all the time.  I personally don't care.

I don't care much either.  However, I was not suggesting it be on all the
time.  Rather, I was suggesting: leave it switchable as it is now, but
set the default to be "on".

I would suggest that if your site is going to standardise on FVWM_USERHOME
= ~/.fvwm, then you can wrap fvwm in the following script:

	#!/bin/sh
	test "$FVWM_USERHOME" || FVWM_USERHOME=${HOME}/.fvwm
	export FVWM_USERHOME
	exec real_fvwm

There was a lot of discussion about FVWM *installing* dotfiles in SYSTEM
directories.  The consensus was that *that* is a poor idea. 

I don't recall any discussion about leading dots in USER config files.
What the user calls these files is up to the user.

Which is my point: I don't want fvwm second-guessing me about things like
leading dots.

Istanbul was Constantinople,

Why did Constantinople get the works?

Most of this is already implemented (GrabFocus style option).

With GrabFocus, it is possible to have a newly mapped transient
grab the focus with the cursor staying over the parent. Unfortunately,
the focus isn't reverted back to the parent (which I would expect with
Style * SloppyFocus) when the transient is unmapped with the pointer still
over the parent. 

I have fixed this by doing a CoerceEnterNotifyOnCurrentWindow
in HandleUnmapNotify if the window being unmapped has the focus
and uses GrabFocus. It seems to work, but perhaps the implementor
of GrabFocus (Dominik ?) should have a look at this.

Btw what is the recommended way to apply GrabFocus to all transients ?
There seems no easy way to do something like this: Have the main netscape
window use GrabFocusOff, but have all transients use GrabFocus ?

Style Netscape* GrabFocusOff
Style "Netscape: Find" GrabFocus
Style "Netscape: Print" GrabFocus
Style "Netscape: Preferences" GrabFocus
...

feels unpleasantly low-tech (how many transients does netscape have ?!)

Perhaps we need something like a GrabFocusTransient style option
(analogous to DecorateTransient). It might even be nicer to extend
the syntax of the Style command to allow

Style "Netscape*" GrabFocusOff
Style ("Netscape*" Transient) GrabFocus

Currently Transient seems to be the only condition which makes sense
for a style command, but we add window group support some day, it may
also make sense to apply a different style to group leaders. Note
that this syntax would also make the DecorateTransient style option
unnecessary.

Jay,

while hacking HandleUnmapNotify, i noticed that you put a call to
a GNOME hook at the very end of that function, even though it has
more than one return path. I have changed the logic of HandleUnmapNotify
to get to the end whenever something substantial is done. But 
perhaps you should check the other GNOME hooks for similar pitfalls.

* Removed the old flag definitions from fvwm.h. Because of this a number of
modules do not compile anymore. I'm still hoping someone else will help with
the GSFR port of the modules. I'm *really* fed up for now.

To use the GrabFocusTransient style I'll implement in a minute, now that
we have plenty of room for new style flags :)

Ah, we're thinking alike.

That would require about a thousand changes. I don't think there is
an easy way to do this.

To do this we need a sound plan that minimizes the changes and
prevents code bloat at the same time. Any ideas?

I took some time out once to carefully work out all the flags to
indent that made code look more like how I wanted it to look (of
course, indent can't do everything); this went a long way towards
making other people's code readable.  Of course, I guess you'd want to 
be careful when committing CVS changes to not commit files that appear 
to be modified but in fact have only had indent run on them.

Purify didn't help.  It hangs  before startup is complete.  It doesn't
find the problem before it hangs.

No, and since we now have GrabFocusTransient, I'd say we leave this
until 2.4 or whenever I'll get back to window group stuff. I'll file 
an extension request to keep track of the idea.

There was a discussion of active icon issues some time ago.
I have started to look into the problems with xterm +ai
today.

First, I found that the problem of the Icon style option 
overriding a client-supplied active icon is an old one, it happens
with 2.0.46 (the one shipping with RH 5.2) too.

Second, I tried to find out why turning the active icon on/off with
the "Enable Active Icon" menu entry of the main xterm menu (C-M2)
doesn't work even if there is no applicable Icon style option. To be
more precise, the active icon refuses to disappear once it has been
enabled.

I think the problem is a bug in fvwm, not in xterm. If I toggle the
active icon, xev shows a PropertyNotify for WM_HINTS. But I think
(xev doesn't show any details) xterm just resets the IconWindowHint
flag and sets the icon_window to None. Thus when disabling the active
icon, the resulting PropertyNotify has neither the IconPixmapHint
nor the IconWindowHint set, and the following code in 
HandlePropertyNotify will prevent any changes to the icon.

      if((Tmp_win->wmhints->flags & IconPixmapHint)||
         (Tmp_win->wmhints->flags & IconWindowHint))
 
I have a test program for which toggling active icons works, by having
it send a PropertyNotify with IconWindowHint set and icon_window == None.

Tonight I will experiment with the following logic

      if ((new_flags & (IconWindowHint | IconPixmapHint | IconMaskHint)) ||
          (new_flags & (IconWindowHint | IconPixmapHint | IconMaskHint)	!=
           old_flags & (IconWindowHint | IconPixmapHint | IconMaskHint)))

where {old,new}_flags are the flags of the {old,new} wmhints.

Well, I've implemented this partially. Things have had to change.  You
can't pass GC's around as they are pointers to Xlib malloc'd
structures.  I've had to pass GContext's instead and use "#define
XLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS" in the module code to do some deep down dirty
hacking since Xlib doesn't let you do an
XCreateGC(GContextMask,GContext).  Funny thing is, it does let you do
something very similar with Font's.

The new M_NEW_LOOK packet goes:
header
  0xffffffff
  M_NEW_LOOK
  packet length
  timestamp
body
  XVisualIDFromVIsual(Scr.viz)
  Scr.cmap
  Scr.depth
  XGContextFromGC(Scr.drawGC) - used for rubber bands
  Colorset 0 (set by DefaultColors & DefaultFont) {
    struct colorset_info {
       0; (only does background pixels)
    } info
    Scr.StdColors.back
    XGContextFromGC(Scr.StdGC)
    XGContextFromGC(Scr.StdReliefGC)
    XGContextFromGC(Scr.StdShadowGC)
    Scr.StdFont.font->fid
  }

Also, due to the way config reading is implemented (GetConfigLine() eats
all packets until and M_END_CONFIG is received) I've had to put the
sending of M_NEW_LOOK after the config is sent rather than before.  This
makes it a bit messy to decide whether to use Fvwm's defaults or the
modules.  The only way around this is to create a new (module only) Fvwm
command (Send_Look) that a modules would use before asking for its
configuration.

Also, Also, HilightColor is subverted into the decors so I've only
implemented one color set (set by DefaultColors).  The only way of
getting more color sets I think, is to have a ColorSet command which
would create a list of colorsets that could be used in MenuStyles and
Decor definitions, rather than try to work out what to send as colorset
packets.

Anyway, what do you all think?  Is it worth continuing?

Cheers,
Tim.

No one  likes to admit   failure, but I'm  not happy  with this change
either.  I'll back it out as soon as I can.  As someone once said,
you code the first one to throw away.

	Hi, folks. Sorry I've been out of touch the past 3 weeks - changes in
my work situation have had me preoccupied with other matters, and I've
barely been able to follow half the threads.

	I just did my first update in about 3 weeks this evening, and started
to attack the first module that failed to build (FvwmIconBox).

	Unless I've missed something in the past few days (not at all
unlikely), there's a fundamental incompatibility between the venerable
word-oriented module interface and the new flags. In module.c,
CONFIGARGS has had the old flags replaced by gsfr_flags, but the
packet-sending logic is expecting a list of long ints: gsfr_flags no
longer qualifies. No matter how the compiler aligns the bitfields, some
of them are going to get dropped on a 32-bit machine.

	Is somebody currently hacking away at a solution to this conundrum, or
should I continue looking into it?

You can look at window.c of Scwm where I've a bunch of functions that
convert from the bit fields to the old-style bit fields for module
support. See FlagsBitsFromSw.  If you don't feel like getting the whole
source to Scwm, you can access it via cvsweb at:

http://vicarious-existence.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.new/~checkout~/scwm/window.c

Incidentally, I noticed that my author contribution snippet didn't make
it into fvwm2.2. I hope this was just an oversight (though based on Dan
Espen's response which he perhaps conveniently did *not* cc me on and I
just found now [see http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9902/msg00718.html 
and Dan's followup] I'm not sure --- my email of congratulations to this
group was sincere and meant as a peace offering in case of any hard
feelings from the Scwm/fvwm2 merge discussions; Dan, I hardly expected
this response given the significant contributions I made to fvwm2 while
development was otherwise stagnant for quite some time.  I wish fvwm2
developers and fvwm2 development well, and have continued to try to be
helpful here when I can -- search for my name in the mail logs if you
don't believe me).

In any case, here it is again-- I'd appreciate it if someone with CVS
write access could get this put in.

Greg J. Badros:
Substantial rewrite of fvwm2.0 menuing code to support arbitrary depth
menus, animated menus, Win95 look, better logically-based shortcut keys,
auto-splitting of long menus, check for re-used hot-keys, integrated
LEFT_MENUS option.  Added primitives: animated-moves, SetEnv, fix to
Echo. Improve modules: Make FvwmM4 pass args on to m4, font-related
seg-fault bug fix in FvwmButtons

Thanks, and keep up the good work!

Greg

If we are going to pass al the flags over we have to be able to make the
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet be of arbitrary size and have some common code
between fvwm and the modules for packing and unpacking the packet.  We
are going to break backward compatibility with modules not maintained by
us if we do this.

Is this possible/compilable?

union {
  struct {

Now I'm getting the impression you have hard feelings. I reread Dan's
reply and can't find anything but pure joy. If it's the sin of omission
not to have sent a personal reply to you I beg understanding in the
name of all fvwm developers. You must know yourself how hard it is to
keep everybody posting to the mailing lists happy and get some work
done at the same time.

I do believe you and I don't have to check the mail logs to remember
your help and I think highly of you for this since myself I don't
find the time to even look at other window managers.

Well, I was a bit annoyed that my author snippet wasn't put in and didn't know 
how to interpret it (plus was surprised that I wasn't cc'd by the
message following up);  I definitely think I over-reacted here, though--
my apologies -- especially to Dan!  Sorry Dan!  It's been a long day...

Reading the message w/o the context of my petty annoyance does make it
sound like pure joy! (And well-deserved joy!)

Thanks-- it's silly not to be mutually helpful since code is still
shared between the projects.

I understand (I think).  Hmm.  What files would be created that would
need looking at in the new version?  Can we list all of them?  If yes
(presuming they are something such as module config files), then write
a short shell script such as:

#!/bin/sh
cd
if [ ! -d .fvwm ]; then
  mkdir .fvwm ||
    { echo "Couldn't make ~/.fvwm directory!  Aborting...." >&2; exit 1; }
fi

for i in FvwmAnimate FvwmFoo FvwmBar; do
  [ -r ".$i" ] && cp -p ".$i" ".fvwm/$i"
done

Then in the README tell users to run this script during the upgrading
procedure.

I hate the thought of unnecessarily coding for legacy stuff like this,
which will only lead to worse problems in the future, and which is so
easy to fix.  ("Why doesn't my config file get read?"  "Have you
checked whether you have any of the following 17 other files on your
system?")

Its been a long day for me too, and its only 8:30 AM.

I thought, for sure, you were on the workers list at the time.
Sorry the author update got missed, and that my thanks to you
for your comments and contributions didn't make it to you at the time.

It was; I think because it was tucked at the bottom of the congrats
message (which was much appreciated!) it got lost.  A separate message
might have made more of an impact on our psyches--although at that
point, maybe not :).

Others have responded re the intent of the message, but on a technical
level I'll just point out that many of us don't _ever_ CC the author
when messages are sent to fvwm-workers, unless it's obviously a bug
report from someone we've never heard of (or we forget to trim the
headers).  Your message didn't fall into either of those categories,
obviously :)

It's probably a poor assumption but generally we assume folks posting
here are subscribed to the list and we try to limit the number of copies
of a message people involved in the discussions see, by trimming out
everyone but the list address from the reply.  We'll have to be more
careful about this in the future.

Thx!

Ouch.  This makes me cringe :).

You have no idea how many times you'll be forced to answer that question
or how tired of it you will get until you do something like that.  Trust
me.  It doesn't matter how often you document it in how many different
places, you will get message after message after message on changes like
this if they're not backward-compatible.

And after you patiently explain it for the umpteenth time, you'll have
to suffer abuse from those same people saying "why in the world did you
change that?"

Backward-compatibility _IS_ an extremely important goal.  Not only does
it make our lives easier by avoiding reams of questions, but it gives
users a sense of comfort that they can install new versions and not
rework their entire environment, and that's critically important
esp. for fundamental tools like fvwm.

I personally am willing to put up with an _AWFUL_ lot of crufty smelly
code in this area to preserve compatibility--after all, we're the only
ones who have to hold our noses.

My $0.02.

Is there a way to send this packet along with the other config info?
I'm thinking of setting M_NEW_LOOK and M_CONFIG_INFO on at the same time?
Is the binary data in the M_NEW_LOOK packet the problem with doing this?

The capability is interesting.

Are there    enough  common elements  in the   modules    to make this
worthwhile?

I thought that everyone realized that this would have to happen anyway as
part of the GSFR.  The question is: can it be done in such a way that it
doesn't have to break again?  Can it be done such that you don't have to
recompile the modules when new flags are added (i.e. send the flags as
strings or send a byte count before the flag bytes and never change the
order of any flags)?

It gets sent after the config info if the module has requested
M_NEW_LOOK

It was easier to code with binary but it could be sent as a config line
with a series of numbers.  That would make it possible to send before
the rest of the config.  Sounds like a good idea to me, we could remove
the M_NEW_LOOK packet and have a DefaultGraphics command sent along with
the ImagePath etc.

> Are there enough common elements in the modules to make this

That I don't know. Most of the graphical modules are different ways of
doing a window list.  It might be more interesting for the
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet to pass the window decoration GContexts over
so things like the pager could display in the same color scheme as the
windows by default.  There are a few modules that may benefit from
inheriting fvwm's defaults: FvwmButtons, FvwmIdent(done), FvwmScroll,
FvwmTaskBar, FvwmWharf, FvwmIconBox, FvwmScript and FvwmForm all
have widgets and my fvwm2rc has lots of lines for specifying background,
foreground and font (all set to the same with FvwmM4).

Cheers,
Tim.

But the packets already contain a length field, don't they. After all,
we already have variable length packets (the name packets). Of course
the modules have to be educated that M_CONFIGURE is now a variable length
packet. This plus not changing the order of flags should be enough. 
Note that it would be enough to guarantee the order of the flags in the
packet to stay fixed, fvwm's internal order can be changed (not that
that would be a useful or fun thing to do).

Subject: Style Icon issues
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I have just tried to find out the difference between the
following commands

Style * Icon bla
Style ** Icon bla

which everybody would expect to be completely equivalent.
It turns out they're not. fvwm contains an ugly undocumented
hack to special-case  Style * Icon bla  to just set the "default
icon" to be used if no other icon could be found instead of
forcing all windows to use the same icon like  Style ** Icon bla
does.

I'd propose to remove this hack and add a proper DefaultIcon
command instead. Any objections ? We should probably adding
a warning for  Style * Icon  explaining the change.

Another thing which I would like to change is that there is
currently no way to get back at the client-provided icon
once there was an  Style foo Icon bar  command, ie after

Style foo Icon bar
Style foo Icon

you still get icon bar, not the icon provided by foo. Even

Style foo Icon bar
Style foo NoIcon
Style foo Icon

doesn't help. I propose to change  the NoIcon and  
Icon (without argument)  style options to reset 
Tmp_win->icon_bitmap_file. This change shouldn't affect
many users, but it increases the expressiveness of the
Style command. You can than, eg set a default icon for 
all windows of  foo, but use the client-provided icon 
for foo_main easily by

Style foo* Icon foo-default
Style foo_main Icon 

Any objections to this change ?

But if we don't want to change the order of flags we're using
#defined bits again. Compilers in general make no guarantees 
where and in which order bitfields are stored in a struct. I
believe with packed structs it will definitely happen that
this is not reliable.

No, I wouldn't have expected that for a second.

Yes. A new command makes no sense. The icon is a style, so
why make a new command? If checking for "*" is a problem,
why don't we check for an arbitrary number of asterisks?

No objections. What I always do with new commands is to
reset to default when no parameter or 'default' is given.

BTW, your fix for xterm's active icon didn't fix anything
for me. The 'Style xterm Icon foo.xpm' still overrides
the ai. No chance to get one.

I think we have a choice to make:
1) keep backwards compatibilty and use Greg's code from Scwm to put
bitfields int fixed bits.
2) dump the bitfield over the wire and mandate that all modules are
recompiled using fvwm source for every release of fvwm.

We could do both by having the official fvwm modules use a different
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet.  The existing M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW would be
constructed with Greg's code and be used by external modules, a new
packet would be used by all our modules.

Cheers,
Tim.

After importing the fvwm-cats tree into cvs with this command:

  # cvs -z3 import -m "Created directory structure" fvwm-cats fvwm-cats start

I'm unable to check out the fvwm-cats module:

  # cvs -z3 checkout -P -d fvwm-cats fvwm-cats
  cvs server: existing repository /home/cvs/fvwm does not match /home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-cats
  cvs server: ignoring module fvwm-cats

What have I done wrong?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I'd propose to change the syntax of the Style command to 
something like

Style (conditions...) options

Where conditions could be the traditional name like in the
old syntax or other conditions which we find useful for
matching styles to windows more precisely. Currently I'm
mainly thinking of Transient to allow to differentiate
styles for transient vs. non-transient windows (rendering
the special ...Transient style options unnecessary). 
If window group support gets added to a future fvwm, it might
also be interesting to decorate group leaders differently.

The old syntax should of course still be accepted.

Full_Name: Nathan Sidwell
Version: 2.2

Submission from: (NULL) (137.222.102.67)


This is about the stacking order of toplevel windows managed by fvwm. 
bug id 232 mentions stacking, but appears to be a different problem.

If an app raises one of its own toplevel windows, fvwm does not update its
idea
of the stacking order, this means
1) the fvwmpager shows the wrong ordering
2) things like RaiseLower do the wrong thing

You can reproduce this bug with a copy of netscape
1) open the colaborative discussions window
2) open a mail item from that window
3) make sure these two windows partially overlap. Make sure you've got a
third window underneath these two -- this helps show the problem
4) sink the mail item window and raise the collabrative window (using
fvwm)
5) double click on a mail item in the collabrative window. this will cause
netscape to raise the mail window to show the new bit of mail. If you have
the
pager, you'll notice that it doesn't show this.
6) If you've got RaiseLower bound to a mousebutton on the title bar, click
on
the collaborative window. You would expect it to be raised, as it's not on
top,
but fvwm thinks it is at the top and so lowers it. Surprise!

This occurs on both Solaris 5.6 with the openwindows X server and
redhat linux 5.2 with XiG Xserver.

Should be all done.

BTW, there should probably be an index.html somewhere in there.

No, the default icon is not a style, it is a part of the Scr
struct. It is used only if there is no WM_HINTS or Style-supplied
icon. This is different from normal Style foo Icon bar which 
does override WM_HINTS supplied icons. Thus I think a new command
would make a lot of sense.

Ok, I'll do this then.

I thought I had made it clear that I didn't change this.
It has always been like this (well, at least it is also the case  
in 2.0.46) that icons supplied via Style Icon override WM_HINTS.
The code responsible for this is in add_window.c:

  /* find a suitable icon pixmap */
  if(SHAS_ICON(sflags))
    {
      /* an icon was specified */
      tmp_win->icon_bitmap_file = SGET_ICON_NAME(style);
    }
  else if((tmp_win->wmhints)
          &&(tmp_win->wmhints->flags & (IconWindowHint|IconPixmapHint)))
    {
      /* window has its own icon */
      tmp_win->icon_bitmap_file = NULL;
    }
  else
    {
      /* use default icon */
      tmp_win->icon_bitmap_file = Scr.DefaultIcon;
    }

If DefaultIcon needs to be a new command, where do MiniIcons fit in?

How about the DefaultIconBox?

I didn't see anything wrong with "Style *" setting the default.

I certainly wasn't worried about "Style **".

Shouldn't there be a link from somewhere in our docs to the cats
page.  Unfortunatly, the only reference to cats we have right now
is in the FAQ which we agreed to keep in text form instead of
converting it to html.  (I guess it could still have a link.)

If we want to keep this up, you might consider also using -Werror to be
sure you don't allow any warnings through :).

Also, if you have grungy headers (like SunOS 4.x, for example) and
you're using GCC, you can win a little bit more by adding the
-D__USE_FIXED_PROTOTYPES__ option to the compile line; GCC will muck
through your headers and rewrite them to be more conformant, and this
flag will enable prototyping for various functions.

I didn't think about these...

First of all, I couldn't find any hint in the docs that "Style *"
is special and second its just counterintuitive. The Icon style
option overrides WM_HINTS, except for that special case where it
behaves differently. I don't know who said it, but "different
concepts need a different syntax", otherwise its just confusing.

If there are more defaulted things, a better different syntax
might be Style default ... (with the slight disadvantage that
you can't match for the name default anymore) or
DefaultStyle ...

Neither am I - it was just a short way of demonstrating
the behaviour in question.

OK, but watch out for menu style, from the man page:

The name "*" is reserved for the default menu style.

I looked again and found that Icon is the only option which 
is treated specially for Style *.

Yes, I consider this  a  unfortunate choice for a default.
MenuStyle default or DefaultMenuStyle would be better.

I've hacked in a 'fix' for your problem. Give the window the
'ResizeHintOverride' style. This will allow you to resize it beyond
the program specified limits.

No, it's because there is a style option to turn this on and off. Try

  Style netscape* UsePPosition

Some background on this problem:

There is a bug and netscape and at least in xterm too (and I assume
in many other applications). If the user sets the preferred position
explicitly the application forgets to tell the window manager that
it was the user, not the application that set the position. There
is a window manager hint called USPosistion (user specified position).
Unfortunately there seem to be a lot of applications that don't set
this bit. In most fvwm config files you will find a line like this:

  Style * NoPPosition

This tells fvwm to ignore the program supplied position hints (but
not the user supplied hints). You must explicitly set UsePPosition
again for all applications you want to place yourself :-(

Ah, now that I see a new bug report with something similar I remember where
I have seen it again. The problem might be that the window refuses to
raise over windows that were not raised by fvwm but by the application
itself. I think emacs does this some time. Can you check this?

Yes, a link would be nice. But I'd put it on the web page. We
don't want to make a secret of this page, do we 8-) If someone
you know our html pages better than myself would do that...
And by the way, can anybody tell me what 'index.html' is good
for (or even better: add one if it is important)?

Hmm, why not. I suggest we make a configure option for this backwards
compatibility and remove it from the documentation or at least mark
it as obsolete and add a sentence that no work at all will be done here
if the integer overflows. This option should be off by default so
people realise that the module interface has changed.

Dan, what's the status of this problem? Has it gone away? I think
I saw the same once, but recompiling solved the problem.

I don't understand what you want, now that the change seems
to be in. On one hand you are complaining that Style * Icon
behaves differently than all other styles that override WM_HINTS
and make a new command to be consistent. On the other hand
you don't remove the "*" hack. So now we have two ways of
doing exactly the same. What is the gain?

Apart from this I really see no reason to make a change here.
*Nobody* wouuld be happy if 'Style * Icon foo.xpm' enforces
the same icon on all applications, even if they provide their
own. Defining a default icon is exactly what you would expect
here. Having the same icon for all applications makes no sense
at all. If you're so crazy about having a 'DefaultIcon' command,
okay, but changing "*" behaviour will make many people unhappy.

Another place where this is used is in the function check_if_function_allowed().
Since it still seems to be useful and removing this column would only
save 230 bytes (115 shorts) I see no real reed to remove it.

Because I'm used to names in fvwm being symbolic names and not
really wildcard patterns. I don't care much about this, but if
this will be cleaned up some day I won't object.

I don't care if it is implemented in the style structure. From the
user's point of view it is assigned to windows (potentially on
a one by one basis). That is the quality expected of styles. The
difference to the othe 'Default...' commands is that those are used
in other contexts too. The would be no 'DefaultFont' command if the
only place to use this font would be in window titles.

I wouldn't consider it unfortunate at all if the menu style
would behave like normal styles, i.e. if the asterisk indicated
a wildcard. This is recorded as an enhancement request and
will be coded when I find the time.

index.html is the default page shown when visiting a directory.  Go to
http://www.fvwm.org/fvwm-cats/.  You get a directory listing because there
is no index.html.  Rename fvwm-cats.html to index.html, visit that URL and
you get a nice page.

This is actually a web server configurable, but index.html is essentially
standard.

Add one myself?  Well, if you want to rename it as Furball VWM so I can add
pictures of my rodents then perhaps.  Otherwise they'd just be cat food.

	Or, a symlink - index.html --> fvwm-cats.html - would do the trick.

	By the way, I've noticed that under certain lighting conditions the
names of the cats and honorary cats look a little washed out against the
paws background. Anyone mind if I embolden them?

	Yikes! This is getting hairy. I hadn't really given much thought to the
issue of backward compatibility, since I looked on that as effectively
broken already by the GSFR. And what I had in mind was getting away from
the word array packet style, and moving to regular structures (suitably
mapped in some FVWM header file which the modules would have to
include). Of course, older packets that didn't need anything more
complicated would just continue to be composed of a sequence of long
ints - but with intelligible names to them, instead of something like
buffer[7] (oh, hell, was that the y position or the x width...???).

	This would make module code a lot easier to work with, but it doesn't
offer much help for Jason's idea of not needing to recompile modules.

	Let me play devil's advocate for a moment. Does anyone have a sense of
just how many 3rd-party modules are really floating around out there,
outside of the FVWM distribution? (Obviously, I don't.) Are we worrying
about a problem that doesn't really exist?

	As to backward compatibility - I think Jason's suggestion was for what
we might call "future backward compatibility": present backward
compatibility can't really happen because 1) the new flags have already
overflowed a long int on 32-bit machines, and 2) one of the old flags
(STAYSONTOP) no longer exists. So, at the very least, any module that
looks at the M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet will have to be modified.

	I think we can partially achieve binary compatibility - i.e., no
recompiles - by making every effort possible not to change the order of
the packet elements, always adding anything new at the end, and
prefixing anything that might be variable (like the flags struct) with a
length.

	This can never be 100% foolproof. As we've seen, flags can cease to
exist. 

	Hmm...there's also a potential gotcha if a module got compiled with a
different compiler from the one used for FVWM itself (bitfields could be
allocated in a different order). I think I'd prefer to document that the
module and FVWM must be compiled with the same compiler rather than
translate the flags to specific bit positions in ints and have modules
continuing to use the old "if (body[8] & STICKY)" style syntax.

The Tk buttonbar replacement, the Perl and Python interface stuff (although
at least some of that is internalized now, I think), the CDE panel (though
I don't think it's being maintained any longer), various hacked versions of
the wharf and the windoze taskbar that people use.  Not a big list,
certainly.

Well, it's only something that's nice to have.  Is it is possible to change
everything once such that changing it in the future doesn't require any
worry?  It's like converting a function taking positional parameters to
taking named parameters.  Adding parameters later becomes really simple,
but there's always a tradeoff (argument parsing is required and slows
things down).

I don't know why I didn't notice this, must have been not paying
attention.  I thought npipes was set to the largest modules pipe
number.  I think it still works though even though npipes is set to a
fixed number.

What the code is testing for is for any module that was started during
startup.  These modules have a corresponding bit set in init_fdset. In
the present code:

       for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
         if (FD_ISSET(i, &init_fdset))
           break;
       if (i == npipes)
         StartupStuff();

As soon as the first set bit is found in init_fdset the loop is
terminated and "i" will be set to the number of the first set bit i.e.
it will not be equal to npipes, the biggest it could be is (npipes -
1).  It could be rewritten:

       Bool none_left = True;
       for(i=0;i<npipes;i++)
         if (FD_ISSET(i, &init_fdset))
           none_left = False;
       if (none_left)
         StartupStuff();

or

       if (all_zeroes(&init_fdset, GetFdWidth()))
         StartupStuff();

but I don't think there is an all_zeroes function that works on
FD_SETSIZE structures. I suppose you could use a memcmp() with an empty
area.

Correct, the is an FD_ZERO(&init_fdset) before any modules are started,
an FD_SET(i, &init_fdset) for every module started during startup, and
an FD_CLR(i, &init_fdset) whenever a module quits.

No, it will be fulfilled when all the modules you started during fvwm's
startup have finished.  There is an annoyingly long timeout that
overrides this condition so fvwm will not lock up totally if you start a
permanent module during startup. You should not start any permanent
modules in your .fvwm2rc, you should use the
InitFunction/RestartFunction.

I really don't want to go back to the old way (start up after the first
file is read) because you end up having to do Recapture after Restart to
get your window decorations to work. I could change it to wait only for
modules started by the command line to finish, this would be bad only
for people who run FvwmCpp from inside their .fvwm2rc (speak up now if
you do).

Cheers,
Tim.

Feel free. I don't like the colours or the background anyway.

Hm, if starting modules from the config file during startup we could
write a temporary complex function that records all attempts to start
modules and delays them until InitFunction is executed. Would that
solve the problem?

I may be annoying, but the default icon cannot be assigned to windows
on a one by one basis. It is just a global thing. What you say is true
for all other uses of the Icon style option. The "Default" in DefaultIcon
means that it will not override WM_HINTS, unlike other Icon style options.

Well the same argument can be applied to other uses of the Icon
option. Why should they ever override WM_HINTS ? Remember your complaint
about "active icon toggling" not working ?

Ok back it out then, I certainly don't want to appear crazy about 
this... I just thought a little consistency would be nice... perhaps
we should at least document the overriding behaviour of Icon then.

I'm not sure. I'll change it to only wait for modules started on the
command line which will have the same effect but will be a lot simpler
to implement.

I didn't claim the 'default icon' is assigned on a one by one basis but
the 'icon'. Well, you can try to convince me. Please explain: why do you
consider breaking existing config files and making lots of users unhappy
a good thing? I can't believe consistency of syntax can justify this.

Let's consider this situation: a new user sets up his config file.
He works with fvwm and notices that some applications have no icon.
He looks into his config file and notices icons being set via the
'Style' command for some programs. He knows about the '*' style, so
he sets up 'Style * Icon foo.xpm'. He restarts fvwm and hates what he
gets since even his xv and xemacs which both provide icons use the
supposed 'default' icon. He's back at reading the FAQ/manpage, asks
at the mailing list or simply lives without icons. So, where is the
gain in usability? Give me an example where the user would wish that
'Style * Icon foo.xpm' enforces foo.xpm on every application. I simply
can't imagine one. If you have one, open my eyes.

In general it is easy to make an application 'consistent', but the user
is not interested in consistency but in usability. Did you ever hear
a user say "why does every command have a different syntax" when the
commands simply do what he expects when he simply copies existing
examples and modifies them a bit? The user thinks about consistency only
if things don't work as he expects. The secret of a comfortable user
interface is to guess what the user can do wrong and help him to prevent
his error. In this case it is very easy. There is no reason why the user
could want the consistent behaviour. So why should we let him bang his
head when there is such a simple solution?

Yes, I remember it quite well. There is a difference: aactivatin an active
icon is a conscious decision. If you dont start xterm with '+ai' you won't
get one. I bet the chance that the user really wants to override the active
icon is close to zero. Someone who wants to switch the ai off already knows
how to do it. Why should he want to override it from the config file?

But I'm crazy about it ;-) (See my other mail for more flaming :)
I'm not against a little redundancy in the config files if it helps
users to customize fvwm (i.e. we can keep the DefaultIcon command).
I would just write some code to handle the "*****..." style name case.
Not that I think that is a serious matter, but a little consistency
can never hurt ;-)

I don't quite understand what 'started on the command line' means?

fvwm2 -f /usr/local/X11/etc/system.fvwmrc -cmd FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm/config.m4

FvwmM4 would be waited for so any style settings in config.m4 would
work, any modules started from system.fvwmrc would not be waited for.

Cheers,
Tim.

I agree that there is no memory use issue.

It still seems to me that using F_NOP (or some other value that indicates
that the value is not being used) is a good thing to do.

(Its better documentation.)

I've been having this problem until this mornings CVS.  (My last
complete rebuild might have been 2 days ago).  Today everything
seems to be in order.

I also reported frames not being painted until the window got
focus.  This is also working now.

Hmm, wouldn't that prevent other uses of this field? If we can't remove it
we might as well put useful information in there. Well, not that I care
about it. I guess we will never use one style or the other as the single
one because it will be a lot of fruitless work to change the table.

Ah!  Here's the (to me) missing piece.  So, what we have now as far as
an algorithm for finding an icon is this:

 1) Use the icon in a Style (including "Style "*" Icon ..." if there is one)
 2) If not, use the icon built into the app (WM_HINTS)

Right?  And what you're proposing is this:

 1) Use the icon in a Style (including "Style "*" Icon ..." if there is one)
 2) If not, use the icon built into the app (WM_HINTS)
 3) If there's no built-in icon, use the DefaultIcon

Is that it?

That seems useful to me.  Maybe I have this wrong, though, since I don't
see how this breaks compatibility with existing config files...

Tim, I still didn't really understand what the reason for this delay is
(perhaps I'm not reading mails carefully). Is it some kind of deadlock?
I.e. fvwm waits for the modules to complete their startup and the modules
wait for fvwm's startup?

No, that's not what we have now. It's like this:

  1) Use the icon in a Style but don't look at the "*" style.
  2) If not, use the icon built into the app (WM_HINTS) if there is one
  3) If there's no built-in icon, use the DefaultIcon

The default icon can be defined with the DefaultIcon command as well
as with 'Style * Icon default.xpm'

Yes, that's right. The objection I have against this one is this:
Old config files often define a default icon with 'Style * Icon default.xpm'.
Look at step 1. The new logic will force the default.xpm upon any
application. No application supplied icons are possible anymore.
That does break existing config files because at present 'Style *'
just defines the default icon that is used in step 3.

I'm perfectly happy with the current solution. The only (small)
problem I see is that 'Style * Icon foo.xpm' and 'Style ** foo.xpm'
don't do the same thing (the first command defines a default icon,
the second one stores it in the style as any other style name would).

There is not a single line in the man page telling him that 
Style * Icon foo.xpm sets the default icon rather than forcing foo.xpm
on all windows.

Well, especially for cut-n-paste configuration by modifying examples,
consistency is important.  Otherwise modifying examples doesn't work
too well.  I agree that the point of Style ** Icon is probably moot
and if you prefer it, I'll revert the changes I have done (ie
remove DefaultIcon and add the "hack" back), and just put a note
in the man page about the whole issue.

Yes, the delay is there to get you out of deadlock.  I made it large to
annoy people into fixing their configs and to make it work on busy
systems.

In order for FvwmCpp to work relieably fvwm has to wait for it to finish
before decorating the windows.  Since fvwm can't tell if a module is
going to send back config commands (like FvwmCpp) it waits for all
modules to finish. If you start a module directly in your .fvwm2rc (not
from the InitFunction) fvwm will wait for it to finish (if it's
FvwmButtons it won't finish, that's why there is a timeout)

What happens now is that fvwm only waits for modules specified on the
command line to finish before it decorates everything.  You can still
experience the large delay but only by doing "fvwm -f .fvwm2rc -cmd
FvwmButtons".

Cheers,
Tim.

PS Just to see why I did all this try "fvwm -cmd 'Echo hello'" with fvwm
version 2.0.46.  You get a complete deadlock (reset your server if you
can) because fvwm is waiting for the first read to complete (which won't
happen because the only command it will start is 'Echo hello') or read
section 4.3 of the FAQ.

Duh, isn't there a nicer way to have proper decorations? Couldn't we make
some 'wait_until_i_finished' command that is sent to fvwm by the modules
that need to complete before fvwm starts up? Are there other modules that
have this requirement?

That's right. Although it is what the user probably expects it is not
documented. We have to fix the documentation.

Hmm, I still don't see this supposed change in the code. Are we
referring to the same code? The last few lines of style.c:

  /* capture default icons */
  if(StrEquals(tmpstyle.name, "*"))
  {
    if(tmpstyle.flags.has_icon == 1)
      Scr.DefaultIcon = tmpstyle.icon_name;
    tmpstyle.flags.has_icon = 0;
    tmpstyle.flag_mask.has_icon = 0;
    tmpstyle.icon_name = NULL;
  }

It's still there. What we have to do is remove multiple asterisks
from style names (Style netscape** and Style netscape* would cause
unnecessary memory consumtion too).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

P.S.: I hope there are no hard feelings because of the hot discussion.
      I didn't want to get personally, I simply care a lot about this
      change.

Well, you're right. Perhaps we should just tell people not to use
more than one asterisk in a row in the man page.

No, because fvwm doesn't read anything from any modules before going
into it's event loop so by the time the 'wait_until_i_finished' command
arrives fvwm has already done the decorations.

You can't have a 'decorate_now' command because the first file/module
that had it would cause decorations to happen and what you really want
is the last 'decorate_now'.  The only way to detect the last
'decorate_now' command is to wait for all sources of config commands to
fvwm to finish, in which case you don't need a 'decorate_now' command,
you just assume it when everything finishes.

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes we are. Sorry, I was confused, since I removed the hack from my
working directory, but forgot to commit it. No need to put the hack 
back, since it is still there! And no need to remove DefaultIcon
either, unless someone *really* dislikes it.

Yes, thats another argument for collapsing *'s (not that I expect 
star sequences to be a common phenomenon in users rc files).

Then perhaps we could hard code FvwmCpp and FvwmM4 as a last resort.
Those two modules are probably never renamed (why should you). Or are
there more modules that require this?

This suggests a possible solution: let the module tell fvwm what it
intends to do (i.e. a "wait for me" indicator).  But I'm not really
knowledgeable in ways of the module interface, so this could be
impossible.

Alternately, let the fvwmrc file indicate what modules to wait for
decorations from.  Or is that a chicken and egg problem?

I first noticed this using today's CVS.  I can't reproduce it with
2.2.

If I grab the resize handle with the mouse, and move the pointer along
the top edge of the screen, fvwm can lose its grip on the rubber band.
The pointer  continues  to  be   the  resize pointer, but  it    moves
independently of the resize frame.

The top edge of the screen I'm on should not have a pan frame.

It is impossible without adding to the module protocol to require fvwm
to wait for each module it starts to send back a wait/dont_wait
indicator.  This would slow things down and you still have the
possibility of deadlock if a module doesn't follow the protocol.

It's a problem in situations where fvwm is installed in a way that it
reads a site wide setup file and then a user defined file.

We could but I think that is ugly and unnecesary.  I think we should go
with what we have and see how many people complain because they start
fvwm with:

fvwm -f .fvwm2rc -cmd FvwmButtons

These are the only people that are going to get the 42 second delay and
my guess is that there isn't anyone.

Is there any need to use bits for packet types ? Wouldn't different numbers
be good enough ? If so, we shouldn't run out of new packet types soon...

They all get OR'd together to form a mask the determines which messages
a module wants so they have to be bits. It doesn't have to be part of an
int though.  If we really want a new type we will have to do a GSFR on
the type bits.

Tim.

You will want to check the archives on this, I think the thread

Ah, that was the piece I was missing: they're ORed together in a mask.
But doing a GSFR there and adding more packets will enlarge all packets,
and what is worse, will make the header variable-sized over time (ie if
enough new packets are added, the header grows)...
Before doing so, it may be worthwhile to check if there isn't some 
cruft among the existing packets. Eg why do we need to separate packets
for WINDOWSHADE and DEWINDOWSHADE. Is any module using them at all ?
And related to this: if there are ICONIFY/DEICONIFY and 
WINDOWSHADE/DEWINDOWSHADE packets, why don't we have the same information
for maximization ?

Not necessarily.  They only need to be bits for fvwm. In packets they
could be just the number log2(x).  The modules tell fvwm what bits they
want with the Set_Mask command so there is no restriction om the number
of bits there.

Cheers,
Tim.

	Ok, I've sketched out a modification that I think will do minimal
violence to the existing packet logic. Barring any major interruptions,
I might even have a chance to try it out today.

	My idea is to create a make_new_vpacket function, which takes as its
args a list of lengths and variable pointers, and returns the aggregate
length of the resulting packet. I'm not suggesting we immediately try to
rewrite all the existing module packet logic, which doesn't need it.
I'll only change the M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW (well, and M_ADD_WINDOW, which
is the same thing with a different name) so it'll pick up the gsfr_flags
in their native form, allowing modules to use Dominik's gsfr macros just
like the main code.

	If this works (hey, why wouldn't it? - it compiles!), then I'll start
attacking the half dozen or so modules that don't grok gsfr.

	Tim, I haven't done an update since earlier this morning, but I see
you're doing some stuff with M_OLD_CONFIGURE_WINDOW, etc. Are you in the
process of rewriting the logic also? Are we about to trip over each
other?

I'm done (he who commits first gets away with it). M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW
has a new number but that shouldn't affect you.  I have added some stuff
to SendConfig() and BroadcastCinfig() which might give you conflicts
when you update.  Save your module.c into a backup before you update.
All my changes are bounded by #ifndef DISABLE_MBC blocks.

Cheers,
Tim.

	Heh-heh.

	It doesn't look like anything you've done gets in the way of my change
(which is still in one of my "play" directories, not in my CVS, so no
problems there).

	Are you using this code with some modules compiled pre-GSFR? If so,
how's it working?

	Does my approach for new-style packet building seem reasonable? (I just
had a couple of interruptions, so I haven't had a chance to try it yet.)

Much better, the pager seems OK, but I think FvwmWinList isn't getting
the winlistskip correct, could be a bug in my packet generation or in
the flag setting.

Sounds good, Do you put the variable length stuff at the end of the
packet? Have you got a method for modules to unpack the data?

Cheers,
Tim.

That reminds me of my (terribly incompetent) predecessor at my job:

Needless to say that I was still making these 'minor changes'
when he was gone for half a year :-)

Ah, I must have misunderstood something in an earlier mail. I thought
you stil couldn't start modules outside InitFunc. In the present state
it works and I really don't care for command line arguments.

Success! My Pager immediately cored out because, now that both words of
the gsfr_flags are going through, everything's out of alignment.

hippo>  Sounds good, Do you put the variable length stuff at the end of
hippo>  the packet? 

	Hmm...I hadn't thought about it yet, but I suppose the gsfr_flags need
to be moved to the end, since they're now potentially variable. After we
add the next 25 styles or so from the enhancement backlog, we'll be
expanding into another word.

hippo>  Have you got a method for modules to unpack the data?

	I'm still thinking about that one. It depends on what kind of things we
want to put in future packets (like strings 'n things).

	I may have been unclear about the make_new_vpacket function's taking a
list of argument lengths and pointers. It doesn't put the lengths into
the the packet (we could do that, but I don't think it's needed), just
the argument data items. So the M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet still just
looks like a bunch of long ints, only the gsfr_flags will occupy two of
them on 32-bit machines (and I'll move them to the end). The inbound
buffer can then be covered with a structure definition like

struct  my_packet {
Window         thiswindow;
   ...
unsigned long  thisthing;
unsigned long  thatthing;
unsigned long  totherthing;
   ...
window_flags   gsfr_flags;
};

Dominik's macros will work nicely with this structure, and we don't have
to try to remember what body[15] is supposed to be.

	I'm still ambivalent about the idea of including a length-of-flags
field in the packet. I'm not sure that a module could reliably do
anything with that information other than do a sanity check to see
whether the flag structure is of the length it expects, and bail out if
not. Although we can keep the flags defined in the same order, we can't
control how the compiler will allocate the bits within a word, and more
importantly, across words. So, if the flags expand from two to three
words, I don't think a module can safely determine where to look for the
flags it understands.

	Now, on to the Pager....

I can reproduce this too. Grab the resize handle, move the pointer to
the top or left edge of page 0x0, wait for a second. If I then continue
to move the mouse, the resize frame doesn't follow any longer. This
doesn't happen at edges with pan frames.

How about attacking the whole thing from the other side?  How about
specifying that `Style foo Icon bar' *never* overrides an icon
specified by a program, unless OverrideProgramIcon or something is
also specified?

This would enable me to say `Style * Icon unknown.xpm' to specify
icons for `unknown' programs, and `Style XTerm Icon unknown_xterm.xpm'
for unknown xterms.  And xterms started like `xterm -name rlogin' can
use special icons.

This is probably a stupid suggestion, but maybe someone can actually
come up with a useful suggestion.

Most of the time, I turn off icons.  I find I almost never use them.
But now that I've found out about the +ai option for xterm, I think
I'll use more icons...

further diagnosis of the resize-on-edge problem: If I "loose" the rubberband
on an "inactive" edge of the screen and then move the cursor over an "active"
edge to switch to another page, the rubberband follows the mouse again.
Thus I think that fvwm forgets to update the rubberband until a HandlePaging
call returns true, but I haven't quite figured out where in InteractiveResize
that happens.

I just added a forgotten protection by NON_VIRTUAL to my last
commit. Doing so i noticed that NON_VIRTUAL has no configure
support. Is this #define needed at all ? If we don't remove it,
we should perhaps change the name of the binary to fwm if compiled
with NON_VIRTUAL ?

Not when you know what to do.

> EdgeResistance 500 1

These two lines are enough to show the bug. It happens whenever you
move the resize cursor to the edge of the desktop and leave it there
at least as long as you defined in the EdgeResisteance command. It
works on the other page boundaries.

Since it seems to be cause by the rewrite of the HandlePaging function
I did recently I'm looking into this.

------------- five minutes later -------------

Hah, that was easy to fix. I simply forgot to reset the
fForceRedraw flag in the resize function. Once it was set the
resize frame wasn't redrawn anymore.

CDE has a nice feature: Whenever the pointer is over an
icon window CDE raises the icon title window above all
other windows. Is this easy to implement with the current
stacking order code?

I vote for removing the define. I don't think things work well
if you do set NON_VIRTUAL.

Only partly.

You can make -Wall the default by always remembering to configure with

	CFLAGS=-Wall ./configure ...

BUT: you can't set CFLAGS='-Wall -Werror' before running configure because
many of the tests that configure does *do* generate warnings, so configure
craps out.

What I do instead is just configure normally, and then run

	make CFLAGS='-Wall -O2 -g -Werror'

Around  line 1760  in fvwm.c  there is logic  that  prints the restart
commands args to stderr.  If there are less than 10 args, its attempts
to print "NULL" with "%s".  This is not good.  I'd fix it, but I don't
understand why anything should be printed to stderr at that point.

On my home Sparc 1+, iconification of a window is taking up to 7 seconds.

For some reason, its slowest on "contool" which supplies its own icon.

I've been trying "gprof" but I think the startup time is drowning out
the iconification time.
>From the man pages, I'm not completely clear on whether profiling can be
turned on and off programatically.

The server seems to be grabbed during the delay.

I see this in 2.3.0, 2.3.1, but not before.

Interesting. You fix a bug caused by a rewrite of HandlePaging
by changing resize_window :-).

I independently found a different fix: I found that
the HandlePaging function will return true if you leave the pointer
on a pan frame for long enough, regardless if it actually did switch 
page to a different page or not. I changed this to return true only
if it actually switched pages, thereby fixing the ill behaviour of 
resize. 

I'll commit it, since I think it is correct and will be easy to
back out again (tell me if my conclusions about the return value
of HandlePaging are wrong).

This is probably debugging code I forgot when I changed Restart
to use the session save/load mechanism. I'd say that 
fprintf(stderr,...) is a sure sign of forgotten debugging code,
since normal fvwm messages should go through fvwm_msg, no ?

It doesn't have much to do with the stacking order code.
It can be implemented by adding some 20 lines to DrawIconWindow
(the function which is also responsible for the resizing of
the icon title). I have just committed the change. Do we want
to make this controllable via a style option or global option ?

I found that the slowdown of iconification only occurs for the
first time a window is iconified, thus CreateIconWindow is the
culprit. Further research showed that the following part of
CreateIconWindow takes the most time:


      XSaveContext(dpy, tmp_win->icon_w, FvwmContext, (caddr_t)tmp_win);
      XDefineCursor(dpy, tmp_win->icon_w, Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT]);
      GrabAllWindowButtons(dpy, tmp_win->icon_w, Scr.AllBindings, C_ICON,
                           GetUnusedModifiers(), Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT],
                           True);
      GrabAllWindowKeys(dpy, tmp_win->icon_w, Scr.AllBindings, C_ICON,
                        GetUnusedModifiers(), True);


So the GrabAll functions may slow down things here.

I don't think it's stupid. On the contrary, considering what you want
to do most of the time when specifying an icon it's a very good
suggestions. Why do people specify their own icons?

  a) Because the application doesn't provide an icon.
  b) Bacause the application supplied icon looks crappy.
  c) Because they use some fancy theme (that may be simply personal
     taste).

At present we can only make people with reasons b and c happy. 
Personally it bothers me that many of my icons are identical
although they're not from the same application, but the reson here
is that e.g. xterm and rxvt both don't provide an icon. This
idea would warrant a code change only if there *are* types of
applications that share the same resource/class where one application
defines an icon and another one doesn't.

Dan, are you using the IgnoreModifiers command? Although I can't
believe you do it sounds like it. The buttons/windows grabbing
code was rewritten (by me) and moved into the library, but I don't
thint there should be any noticable slowdown unless you have
lots of unused modifiers. Did you perhaps test IgnoreModifiers
and forgot to remove it from your config file? With each ignored
modifier the number of keys/buttons to grab doubles. The XGrab...
can be very slow, especially if you have a slow network connection.

That's because the interface of HandlePaging changed and I had to
adapt resize and move. The bug was in resize_window, not in
HandlePaging.

Gack! I'll trust you. I don't want to look at the code again, it
gave me plenty of headaches. What you have done sounds right
(provided you did consider the case that the desktop may wrap around
when you're on the desktop edge). But in the end it doesn't fix
the bug in resize_window, it only hides the symptom.

Only in theory. There are some places where ouputs are done with
fprintf(stderr, ...). But most or all of them should be in some
modules.

Can't imagine a reason why someone shouldn't like it. It may
be a bit surprising at first, but it is definitely an enhancement
in usability. The wax it was coded before you sometimes had to
raise the icon from the window menu to be able to see the full
title.

------ a while later ------

Ah, there is one thing that should be changed: the title
is raised only when the icon receives the focus and lowered
when it loses focus. This works well only with MouseFocus. With
NeverFocus the title is never raised, with ClickToFocus only when
you click on the icon (it's too late then, but I'll check what CDE
does with ClickToFocus) and with Sloppy focus the title stays raised
above overlapping windows when you leave the icon. Is it difficult to
make it behave like for MouseFocus in all four cases?

When I iconify a window and the bottom edge of the window
is not on the current page, the window simply vanishes.
No icon can be seen anywhere on the desktop. In the pager
I still see the full window. FvwmIconMan indicates the
window has been iconified. However, I wouldn't take
module behaviour too serious with the GSFR for modules
still not completed.

Before we put a lot of work in rewriting all modules: the name 'gsfr_flags'
is only temporary. It will be changed back to 'flags' soon. The file 'gsfr.h'
will be renamed or removed too. How about a 'window_flags.h' file?

I recall a while back some folks going on about pie menus.  I also recall
more recent work on using Gtk for menus.  So check this out:

http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~0rfelyus/GtkPieMenu/

Perhaps pie menus could come for free if the Gtk menu stuff is done?  I'm
not sure what this pie menu thing is all about, personally, but I've been
using the standard menus since they started sticking mice on computers so
you could say I'm used to them.

I get the slowdown  every time the window is  iconified, not  just the
first time.

Can't remember putting that in my config file...nope.
No "IgnoreModifiers".
I see the slowdown at home, while I'm not connected to any network.

This is  probably the logic that  trys to determine the  percentage of
the window that is offscreen  and directs the icon  to the screen that
the window is mostly on.

Theres been a   bit of discussion of  this  before, although I   don't
remember any consensus.    It seems to  me   the intuitive  choice  is
iconify to the current screen, regardless of the window position.

I've used piewm (like tvtwm with pie menus) for a while, and mostly
used pie menus to implement moving around the virtual desktop.  I had
a menu which had `up one page' at 12 o'clock, `right one page' at 3
o'clock, and so on.  Further, there was `go to upper left page' at
half past ten, and so on.  This kinda made it intuitive to drag the
mouse on the root window to change pages (on a 2x2 desktop, if you
haven't guessed yet).  I found it wasn't difficult at all to
discriminate between these eight directions, maybe even more are
possible.

A colleage had a pie menu of host names where each would open an xterm
on that host.  Many hosts...  It seemed to work well for him.

I think the general idea is that people can move the mouse in specific
directions quite accurately whereas distances are not so easy.  Or
something like this.

Though maybe one should implement mouse gestures (strokes?) rather
than pie menus, such that one can do an X to close a window...

OTOH, I haven't used pie menus in five years now, and I haven't missed
them.

I just inserted a check immediately before actually doing the 
MoveViewport that delta_x and delta_y are nonzero. If they are zero,
MoveViewport doesn't change the page and we should return false.
I hope this catches all desktop wrapping, since it should be taken 
into account when calculating the deltas.

I guess we have to move the raising/lowering into HandleEnterNotify
and HandleLeaveNotify then.

I'd like to request a brief moratorium on changes to the following:

		module.h
		module.c
		FvwmPager.h
		FvwmPager.c
		x_pager.c

while I try to debug possible problems with the new-style packet code.

	Several types of interaction between the Pager and FVWM cause FVWM to
crash, and I've just got to go through them one by one to see whether
they're caused by my changes (I'm certain that at least one of them is).

	The one I've tracked down so far (fix committed a few minutes ago) had
nothing to do with the new packet logic, but showed up whenever I used
the Pager to switch desks.

	If anyone has a problem with this, please let me know.

I have done this now. I have also changed the logik of DrawIconWindow
to do the icon title clipping parallel to the raising /lowering, since
it seemed silly to raise a clipped title (would have happended for 
ClickToFocus or NeverFocus with the old logic).

Another enhancement, which is related to the raising icon titles is
loosing a focus and focusing another icon, when a mouse is over another
icon's non-focussed title. It might be an option. This seems to me very
useful, since an icon with a very long title blocks all other icon titles
in a line.

Other possible solution is making icon titles not a part of an icon.
Something like balloons, which are reduced to the icon width in non-active
state and expanded when an icon is focused.

Just my thoughts.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There are some other places where the current screen is used when at least
a single pixel is on the current screen. Maximize does it this way and
Iconify should do the same. But I noticed something else here: I can't
remember what I did exactly, but once the icon suddenly appeared on the
right page and position. It was as if the icon was invisible.

Could you debug into the GrabAllWindow... functions and see if some
loop is repeated suspiciously frequently?

	Ok, I've committed the changes to these.

	The new-style M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet has a temporary dummy word of
zero in the slot where the old flags were. The new gsfr flags are at the
end.

	The Pager has been converted to use the gsfr flags. I have temporarily
reverted all the "Silent" commands in x_pager.c to their, ah, noisy
equivalents. Something is amiss with the Silent logic: FVWM segfaults
everytime Pager sends it a Silent command.

	I'll probably work on the other half dozen non-gsfr-compliant modules
tomorrow evening.

I haven't tired them out yet but I seem to remember the last scqm
release included them, and they had a couple of pictures on their web
page with a link to the guy who came up with the idea and did seeminglly
way to much research on the subject.

Hello,

It would be nice to have a NeverFocus style.
This would be useful with a small number of applications
that don't take input from the user but rather just display
some statistics.

Thanks.

Hello, everybody!

Living in a country where we have to use several keyboard layouts, I
wrote a Fvwm module to make our life a little easier ;)

from README:

----
FvwmKb -- a module for Fvwm window manager that makes it more
convenient to work with several Xkb keyboard layouts. It does two
things: 

1. For the focused window it stores currently locked Xkb group
   (keyboard layout) in its internal database and restores it when the
   window is focused again making an impression that different windows 
   have different selected keyboard layouts simultaneousely (like KDE
   program kikbd does).

2. It tells Fvwm to reflect currently locked Xkb group in the window
   decoration - making it possible to tell which windows have which
   locked groups easily.
----


FvwmKb is available at the following url:

http://www2.cybercities.com/s/sparrow/software.html

sample screenshot:

What do you think?

Regards,
Alexander

What were we just saying about there being only one externally maintained
module?

	I overlooked this message when it came in. I just noticed I had a stray
unread message while cleaning up my inbox, and this was it.

	The changes I've applied were done against the "flags" version, so
that's not a problem.

	gsfr.h is sourced from vpacket.h, so the one include in that file is
all that should need to be changed for the modules if you rename gsfr.h.

	I've gotta take a break from the GSFR for the rest of the day and get
some work done.

	I think he should be invited to join the Worshipful Company of FVWM
Developers...once we get a look at the module, of course!

	Has anyone been able to get through to Alexander's FvwmKb page yet?
I've tried several times this afternoon, but my browser just hangs and

One thing we should remember is the modules wee took out of the main
tarball. We may still want them to run.

A little brainstorming:

I want to close applications with ctrl-d like any shell.
My shell windows require to be properly shut down with
this sequence (or exit) so that they can save the command
history (multiple zsh's can easily share a common history
file without trashing the other shells history :) ). But
I want to be able to close any window with ctrl-d (or
to be honest I want to close all windows that don't interpret
ctrl-d in some way, but I could live without that).
For several reasons binding ctrl-D to Delete/Destroy is out
of the question (one being that I often have recursive shells
in one window and I don't want to close all of them at once).

Any ideas?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Well, then we'll have to make it an internally maintained module :)
Sounds like a thing we should have in either the main or extra distribution.

Ah, Bob, is there a special reason why you don't put the ChangeLog entries
for the modules in the ChangeLog in the modules directory? I tried to figure
out from the ChangeLog why the 'silent' code in functions.c is commented
out and I find only your entry about disabling this in the pager. Did you
make that change in functions.c? Or maybe I did that while working on the
repeat command and forgot to undo it.

The one window cannot be the child of the other one. A parent window can never
be raised above a child and a child can only be displayed inside its parent.

Can you send me the output of 'xwininfo -all' for both windows. It might
help too if you could capture the output of xev for these two windows
when you try to raise/move them.

Dominik,
   My main complainer (I mean tester) is on vacation this week, but one problem
that
I can reproduce involves 2 windows in the Simplicity application.  One of them
seems
to be a child of the other.  There are two windows, I will call them 1 and 2.

Window 1 cannot be raised above window 2, no matter what.  It can be made to be
above
    window 2, but only by moving window 2.
Window 2 can be moved below window 1.
Window 2 can be raised above window 1.
When Window 2 is closed, it closes.
When Window 1 is closed, both window 1 and window 2 close.

S. Baker

??? But icon titles already work this way. The only problem I see is when
you only have icon titles but no icons. When the expanded title overlaps
other titles you may have to move it away to make these visible again.

Bob, you must have overlooked something in IconMan. I still
get my FvwmButtons window displayed in there although I use
Style FvwmButtons WindowListSkip. This works in the builtin
WindowList command.

For each iconification, there is one call to GrabAllWindowKeys
and GrabAllWindowButtons.

The  for  loop  in each   makes about  400 calls  to  GrabWindowKey or
GrabWindowButton.  (I take this to indicate I have about 400 button
and key bindings.  This seems a little high.)

These routines have changed a lot.  The old logic included this:

if ((tmp->Context & C_ICON)&&(tmp->IsMouse == 0))
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the new logic seems  to like any context.  (I  admit, I'm lost in this
code.)

I did run a test where I just disabled all of the above code,
and the slowness went away.

Since there is a server grab in each of the GrabAll routines,
I would think it wise to have a GrabAllWindowButtonAndKeys routine,
with only 1 grab for both and only make one pass thru the bindings.

This would halve the grabs and cut 800 function calls to 400.

But  I'm really not  sure  whats going on   in this routine, I assume,
since a key or button is  pushed, its trying to  tell the server, fvwm
has read the key.  Why isn't this done earlier, when  the key event is
associated with an fvwm2 command?

	Um, lack of sleep, probably.  :-(

	No, that's the way I found it. I figured someone was probably in the
middle of working on this code, so I didn't try to tinker with it.
That's why I commented out the Silence of the Pager. (Took me quite a
while to figure out that this segfault wasn't something I'd caused with
my changes!)

It occurred to me sometime this afternoon that we could reclaim a
couple of packet type mask bits and postpone the inevitable "GSFR on the
type bits" for a while.

	I left a dummy zero int in the old flags word position in the new
M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW/M_ADD_WINDOW packet. I intended to leave this in only
while things were in transition - i.e., some modules were converted and
others not. But what if we left it permanently, and used the SETOLDFLAGS
macro (and the DISABLE_MBC conditional) to set this word. We could then
drop the M_OLD_ADD_WINDOW and M_OLD_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packets, and
restore the regular packets to their old numbers.

	Any opinions?

	Yup, I did. The flags were slightly misplaced.

	I just committed the fix for this. Now for some of that sleep I
mentioned earlier....

I am not sure if this is a bug, but...

In fvwm/modules/FvwmGtk/FvwmGtk.c at line 1245, GetNextOption(...) is an
undefined function. After looking through other parts of the source, I think
this should have been replaced by GetNextSimpleOption(...). Right?

As right now, it gives a compilation error.

I have committed a fix to the FvwmButtons X error handler yesterday.
It *might* have some effect on this problem. Could you check this
with the latest development snapshot? (The development source is
quite unstable at the moment, so don't use this for work).

Good idea, my only concern is that SETOLDFLAGS is quite expensive (32
bit twiddles, not in the same league a 400 XGrab's though) and I was
going to put in a hack that would skip it if the module didn't ask for
M_OLD_CONFIG_WIN.  If you merge the packets you won't be able to tell if
the module is going to use the old flags or the new flags and will have
to run SETOLDFLAGS always.

Cheers,
Tim.

Right. I changed the name of this function and didn't update the
modules that are not in the tarball.

It would also be really helpful to try to reproduce the problem with a
2.3 version of fvwm, since the stacking order handling has changed 
considerably.

But not perfect. I'd like to get rid of the new style flag again by
splitting the current DrawIconWindow in three functions DrawIcon, EnterIcon
and LeaveIcon (the first would only redraw, the other two would do the
resizing/raising). Then we could directly call {Enter,Leave}Icon in
Handle{Enter,Leave}Notify instead of setting the flag.

Yes, using GetNextOption became a bug at the time this function was removed.
I have forgotten to commit the trivial fix you mention, but I'll do it
eventually.

Yes, but a title is a part of an icon, unlike a balloon.
Ok, balloons are not good for icons, since they require visible icons.

This is a real problem. But even with a visible icon there is an
unexpected behaviour. I have two icons of the same height and SloppyFocus.

My pointer is the star. I _expect_ that by moving my pointer left-right,
two icons get (and loose) focus alternatively. Instead, the first title
overlaps the second title and is not deexpanded until I focus another
window or icon, which is unexpected to me. What if there are no other
windows or icons in the page and the title is too long to be nice.

I think that deexpanding focused title, when the pointer is outside of the
icon box, is a good global or style option, like RestoredIconTitleOutside.
Icon box is defined by the (icon + non-expanded title) rectangle.
Note that the icon remains focused, but with a non-expanded title.

I can fill out the web-based form for this enhancement request, if needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Good point. An alternative would be to add a run time option -
GlobalOpts or whatever - to use SETOLDFLAGS, which would be off by
default. I guess we should think about this one a bit more.

With the version in CVS, it should be enough to leave the icon (title and 
image) to deexpand the title. Even if there are no other clients on the
page, there should be enough room to leave the icon title :-)

This won't be trival to implement. Right now we deexpand upon the 
LeaveNotify from the icon title. to implement the proposed behaviour,
we would have to add an inputonly window of the unexpanded size or track
pointer motion or ...

Maybe a simpler way to handle this would be to give users a way to suppress 
overly long icon titles, something like Style * IconTitleSizeFactor 2.0 
to indicate that icon titles should never be longer than 2 times the icon 
image size or just a plain IconTitleMaxSize 64 to indicate that icon title 
should expand to 64 pixels but not more. Would that be acceptable ?

I thought 400 was a little high.

A little debugging in "libs/Binding.c AddBinding()" reveals that

Key g R A Beep

results in 2 bindings being added to the list of bindings.

Added binding: keyname g, context 8, mod 8000, action Beep, type 1, bk 88
Added binding: keyname g, context 8, mod 8000, action Beep, type 1, bk 88

(The 2 bindings added seem to be identical.)

All my keybindings appear to be doubled this way

Can anyone think of a way to get FvwmAnimate to not save the Width or
Color settings if the user uses the FormFvwmAnimate or MenuFvwmAnimate
to alter some settings but not those? e.g. the user changes the Effect
and Iterations but not the line width or color. At the moment saving
anything causes a *FvwmAnimteWidth to appear which causes FvwmAnimate to
not use the fvwm default next time it is started.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'd make expanding the title independent from focusing the icon.
Expand it when the pointer is over the icon, collapse it when the

How about allowing the width and color to be set to "use default"?

Hi!

For some unknown reason my homepage at the url I gave in my initial
message stopped working, so I've just moved all my files to another place:

http://linuxfan.com/~sparrow/software

and the screenshot

http://linuxfan.com/~sparrow/software/FvwmKb.jpg

I'm sorry about any inconvenience it caused.

Please let me know if you have any problems downloading from that new
site.

Regards,
Alexander

Try "regular expressions".

Most of the discussion was in Dec 98.

I have yet to find the culmination of the discussion, but as I
remember:

Style [name Netscape, class x*] ...

I added a note to enhancement 304.

This may or may not have something to do with FvwmCommand itself,
but after upgrading my Linux system to glibc I can't run FvwmCommand
anymore (yes, I did recompile everything). When I try to start
FvwmCommandS it just says 'FvwmCommandS: dead pipe' and exits.
Any ideas?

Bye

I get the same message, but mine runs anyway.  Is it possible that you
already have FvwmCommandS running when you start the second one?

No. There's nothing in the process list and when I try to run
FvwmCommand I get an error message.

How about bubble help windows like in the pager?  This wouldn't be the
same as CDE but maybe also useful?

Well I haven't had time to check out the CVS sources since about 4/12,
and I just updated and built everything.  And thanks to all the work it
seems everything is fine except for some strange icon behavior.

If i move an icon below midpoint on my screen and then release the mouse,
it will jump to the left edge of the screen and then animated move over
some number of pixels.  I haven't changed my iconbox setting which looks
like:

Style "*" NoIcon, MiniIcon jball.xpm, IconBox -135 -402 -0 -50

When apps start up their icons land inside the iconbox correctly,I only
see this if i move an icon.  And only if I move this to the lower half
of the screen.

Did I miss something in the traffic about icons stuff, do I need to set
something, or should I go digging to find out what is going on?

I put this in Bindings.c:

	(*pblist)->NextBinding = temp;
        fprintf(stderr,
          "Added binding: keyname %s, context %X, mod %X,\
 action %s, type %x, bk %d, m %d\n",
                (key_name ? key_name : "?"),
                contexts, modifiers, action, type, i, m);

and I get this:

Added binding:
  keyname e, context 8, mod 0, action WarpTo xemacs, type 1, bk 63, m 0
Added binding:
  keyname e, context 8, mod 0, action WarpTo xemacs, type 1, bk 63, m 2

So whatever "m" is (modifier index?), it adds a  binding for values of
"0" and "2".

For some of my function keys it adds a binding for "0" and "1".

The "simple minded fix" would be to check the binding about to be added
against the binding last added, and if identical, don't add it.

Ah, yes, I thought you referred to calls of AddBinding() itself.
The reason why there are two table entries is that every binding
is duplicated for caps-lock. I didn't see this on my system because
I disabled the caps-lock key in my xmodmap. But that still doesn't
explain why this is slower than before. It was done this way before
the changes. Is AddBinding really called 200 times with different
bindings? Are all of these bindings really in your config file?

Yes, I have about 200 bindings in my config file, resulting in
400 entries in the binding table.  Resulting in about 800 function
calls to iconify a window.

If one is for CAPS LOCK, and one for NOT CAPS LOCK, something is
wrong, since both entries in the binding table appear to be
identical.

	Be happy to...later this afternoon. I've got a few other (non-FVWM)
things to get out of the way first.

	Larry, are you the one who recently took over TkGoodStuff? Or, if not,
do you have a current url handy? I thought a note was posted to this
list recently about the change in ownership, but I just did a couple of
quick searches that turned up nothing.

	I also need to update the html pages in docs.

1.  Yes.  I have taken over tkgoodstuff, and will be releasing a
    version 8.1 "real soon now" (I was waiting for Fvwm 2.2 to be
    released, and now I have a lot of deadlines coming in at work).

2.  I haven't released 8.1 yet, but I could possibly put together a
    "pre-8.1" release in a day or so.  I'll attach the current change
    log to the bottom of this message.

3.  I am looking for a "home URL" for the new tkgoodstuff.  I believe
    that Mark Crimmins had offered to use his site (which has the 8.0
    "final" version of the program), but I won't have direct control of
    that site.

I'm interested in the GSFR stuff mostly so that I can continue using
the program once I load fvwm 2.3.(GSFR)+ onto my system...!

Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-Description: ChangeLog

8.1: *** New development started by lar3ry gensch
         <lar3ry@mediaone.net>

    - Maintenance
      All maintainable files are under RCS control now.  I also
      converted makefiles to use automake for more GNU compatibility
      (it's still a "foreign" distribution, though).  I'm currently
      considering the use of CVS.

    - Startup
      Added new "Splash Screen" that displays at program startup.

    - WindowList/Fvwm
      Added mini-icon support.  Now enabled via a checkbutton.  If set,
      WindowList ignores its internal array of icon/Window
      associations and uses the mini-icon files specified by fvwm.

    - New Client:  Switcher
      This emulates the Win95/98/NT4 "ALT-TAB" task list.  Only works
      as an fvwm module.  As with WindowList, mini-icon display is
      optional (although I cannot see any reason WHY it would be
      disabled).

    - Added http "preferences" for clients that want to use the
      tcl "http" package (Outside, Markets) -- mostly for supporting
      web proxies for people within firewalls.

    - New directory:  extras/
      These are "extra" programs that are either undocumented, have a
      limited audience or utility, or are untested.  These can be
      installed by using the --with-extras option to the configure
      program.  Even if these aren't used, they can be examined as
      more example clients for people that wish to write their own
      client.

    - Load
      Balloon text is now customizable and can take a %L parameter to
      show current system load.

    - Clock 
      Made the "analog" display more configurable.  You can now set a
      clock format (refer to `man n clock' for a description of the
      format tokens) for the main display, the "hover" display, and
      the balloon text.  Thus, by setting these as follows:

	Time display:		%I:%M %p
	"Hover" display:	%I:%M %p
	Balloon display:	%A, %B %d, %Y

      you can emulate Win95's date/time system tray item.
      
    - Preferences/Clients
      A lot of places where a Unix command was specified, I've added
      options for a Tcl command as well.  I think I am going to
      eventually replace these with an "exec-preprocessor" that will
      either exec a process or run a tcl command, depending on whether
      or not the first "word" in the command is "Tcl".

    - Preferences/Colors
      Balloon window background color may now be specified

Dominik,

pre-2.2 I had sent a patch to the pager to make its focus handling
ICCCM compliant by having it send a Focus command to fvwm. The patch
was backed out before 2.2, since it had the side effect of switching
the page. Now that you have implemented `NoWarp', we could
perhaps resurrect the patch and have the pager send `Silent Focus NoWarp' ?!

	Sure. As I said earlier, I'll need to update the module-writing HTML
pages in the docs directory, but here it is in a nutshell. A few things
are still in a state of flux, so minor changes may yet happen.

	First:

	if (! YourmoduleLooksAt(M_ADD_WINDOW | M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW) {
	  return (NothingToDo);
	  }

	The ADD/CONFIGURE packet is the only one that's changed. The old flags
word (the 9th word, not counting the 4 header words) is now a dummy
placeholder just to preserve alignment: it's always zero (but we might
change that). The window_flags bitfield structure (may be one or two
words depending on your machine architecture) is added to the end of the
old packet structure.

	Your module needs to inclued fvwm.h and vpacket.h, in that order.
vpacket.h defines structure layouts for all the new-style packets (all 1
of them!). If your module has a private structure in which it stores the
flags, these need to be included before your structure definition.

	To access the new packet, map the body of the packet to the
ConfigWinPacket structure defined in vpacket.h. If TkGoodStuff follows
the example of all the standard modules, it probably calls the body
"body", so you'd do something like this:

ConfigWinPacket  *cfgpacket  =  (void *) body;

	If your program copies the flags into a private structure of its own,
you'll have to 1) replace the flags word in your structure with an item
of type window_flags, and 2) replace the simple assignment (usually
something like MyStruct->flags = body[8]) with a memcpy for the length
of the structure - something like

    memcpy(&MyStruct->flags, &cfgpacket->flags,
sizeof(MyStruct->flags)).

	To reference or manipulate the flags, you'll need to use Dominik's
macros, which today are contained in gsfr.h (tomorrow that file may be
renamed to something else). gsfr.h is included by vpacket.h, so you
shouldn't need to change anything if/when the name changes.

	So now all you have to do is to track down all the old-style references
to the flag bits...well, actually, the comnpiler will track them down
quite nicely, you just have to change them. All the lines like

	if (body[8]&ICONIFIED)

need to change to something like

	if (IS_ICONIFIED(cfgpacket))

	The important thing to remember about the macros is that they expect a
window_flags structure to be within a larger structure (like
FvwmWindow).

	That's about all there is to it...unless (heh-heh) the module has a lot
of functions that pass the old flag word around as calling arguments and
return values. In that case, you may have a lot of grungy work cut out
for you. But you may not. I thought that would be the case with
FvwmTaskBar when I first looked at it, but the only flag it actually
cared about was the ICONIFIED flag; so I left its infrastructure intact
and just set an arbitrary bit in its private flags word to indicate
ICONIFIED.


	----------------------------------------------------------------

	Now, as for what's not yet cast in concrete....

	As I said, the gsfr.h header file may undergo a name change.

	Also, we may add a compatibility option for the old flags word to be
emulated, so far as is possible, in that dummy 9th word. Tim did some
magic over the weekend to emulate the old packets, and renamed the
actual ADD/CONFIGURE packets with new id's, so that old modules compiled
before the GSFR could continue to run (probably), and only recompiled
modules would know about the new packets.

	These issues shouldn't concern you in modifying your module. We're
simply trying to provide as much backward compatibility as possible so
that older modules that haven't been recompiled can still hope to run
(unless they care about a flag that no longer exists, like STAYSONTOP).

That's exactly the reason why I wrote NoWarp :-) It should be in
already.

Brr, problem solved. This has come up in early Ferbruary. The
module pipe was close because a block of size zero was written
into it. I had applied a fix on 12-feb-1999 to SendText
(libs/Module.c), but some kind soul took it out again. In the
ChangeLog I find entries by Paul (PDS) and Matthias that could
have caused this. Was there a special reason to remove the
check for a zero length just before the final 'write'?
For now I fixed this FvwmCommandS.c, but it's still buggy.
On a 2.2.x Linux kernel a zero write seems to close the pipe,
so doing this is illegal. Perhaps we should put there an
error message if a module attemtps to do this.

Is finding a home at fvwm.org out of the question for you? Both,
fvwm and tkgoodstuff should benefit from this.

Nothing comes to my mind and I can't see this here. Before debugging
into the code I would update to the current CVS however. On 12th of
April the GSFR on fvwm was just completed and the GSFR on modules
hadn't begun yet. Strange things might happen with this code.

Yes, now with the GSFR done we made a big step towards the next
release. Yesterday I got a copy of the brand new SuSE Linux 6.1
and to my disappointment I found the old 2.0.46 there. The SuSE
distribution has been perhaps the one with the best fvwm support
in the past. Although fvwm is still the first window manager
listed on the box their standard window manager for GNOME seems
to be enlightenment (if I read the comments for the GNOME
packages correctly). We have to move fast now before the train
has gone. 

KDE is growing rapidly with GNOME stil not being fully stable
and we need to add KDE support (and maybe even a sample
fvwm/KDE setup) soon. 

I suggest we make some kind of semi-stable GNOME release fast
and try to add KDE support before summer so that we can make
the next stable release in June or July.

BTW, I'll be making 2.3.2 tonight.

(Drats, now I'm pushing decisions again! Where is our new
pumpking? He forgot to take the pumpkin from me.)

You forgot some DBUG messages that won't compile in events.c
(line 1466 and 1502).

We have a "message-window" feature in Scwm that you guys could use code
from.  It's a generalization of the move/resize window.

Sorry,  stupid last-minute change to replace fprintf(stderr,...)
I noticed it immediately after starting the commit and thought
I would commit the corrected version (since the compile of the 
corrected version was ready long before cvs commit spit out its
first message.

I've commented these lines out. Could you decide what to do with them?

Well, the currently released Debian (2.1) also has 2.0.46 or
thereabouts, but the current development version (potato) has 2.2 and
will hopefully have 2.3.x soon, when I have a chance to package it.

Subject: loosing center line in pager window

Full_Name: paul novak
Version: 2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: linux 2.0.34
X_Server: X11R3.3.1
Submission from: (NULL) (208.133.79.154)


Well, I hope this is a bug and not something silly I'm doing; I'm pretty
new to
fvwm2.

Here' the problem:

Given the following .fvwm2rc file:

++++++++++++++++
DeskTopSize     2x3
Style "Fvwm*"           NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+               "I" Exec exec xterm -geometry =90x40+300+70 
*FvwmPagerBack springgreen
*FvwmPagerFore black
*FvwmPagerGeometry 200x300+3+3
*FvwmPagerHilight springgreen
++++++++++++++++

to create one desktop with a pager window with 2 columns and 3 rows in the
top left of the desktop, the pager window comes up looking like this
(Letting X represent the sticky pager window in the virtual page (sorry
if I am butchering the language...)

-----------
|X   |    |
|    |    |
-----------
|    |    |
|    |    |
-----------
|    |    |
|    |    |
-----------

That's correct.  I can click on either of the other two virtual pages in
the
leftmost column, and the "X" moves to the top left of the virtual page
that
I clicked in.  However, whenever I click on any of the virtual pages in the

right column, the "X" moves, but I lose the center line in right below the
X.
That is, the display looks like this:

-----------
|    |X   |
|         |  <-note the missing "|" below the X
-----------
|    |    |
|    |    |
-----------
|    |    |
|    |    |
-----------

I do not have the same problem using 2.2 releases using the same .fvwm2rc
file.  I do have the same problem in 2.2 on a Solaris 2.5.1 machine at
work.

The .fvwm2rc file is pared down as much as I could to keep reproducing the
problem.  In reality, my .fvwm2rc is more complicated.  I have discovered
that when I'm using my full blown .fvwm2rc file, sometimes (but not
always...)
when I restart .fvwm2rc, the problem  fixes itself.  I hope that's useful
and not misleading.....

I'm beginning to change my mind about Gnome.  Nice idea, but it just isn't
working out too well.  KDE is going to continue to gain in prominence, but
unfortunately it seems that they want to put forward the image of a single
window manager.  Of course you can hack around it if you like but that's
"unofficial".

I have to agree, but has anyone seen any info on KDE compatibility?

RedHat 6.0 will be released this comming Monday on the FTP sites. It will
hit the stores on May 10th.

KDE and GNOME will both be included in RedHat 6.0.

On 04/22, Bob Woodside blathered some nosense about:
>

	Which was true enough, for the average C module; but yours is anything
but average.

	I just took a quick look at the 8.0 final that Mark left on his site.
I'll assume that my remarks still apply to your latest version.

	Passing the flags word as a hex string to Tcl, obviously, is out. This
part of the C-Tcl interface could get ugly...I certainly haven't thought
it out. What you really want to see on the Tcl side is for flags to
become an array in its own right, with members like flags(is_iconic) and
flags(do_window_list_skip), etc. - all the flags defined in
common_flags_type and window_flags in fvwm.h.

	Oh, yeah...watch out for those 4-state bits! (focus_mode is a two-bit
field - no offense intended to the author!  :-)  )


	I haven't had a chance to think it through much further than that, but
I hope I've given you a little help.

I think the introduction of layers has confused the logic behind
the RaiseLower function. It used to keep track of the last window
which has been explicitely raised in Scr.LastWindowRaised. This
made sense as long as there was only one window which couldn't be
raised any further, namely the window at the very top of the stacking
order. But now there are many windows for which this is true, namely
all windows which are on top of their layer. Thus I'd like to propose
to remove Scr.LastWindowRaised and instead use a little function

Bool CanWindowBeRaisedAnyFurther (FvwmWindow *) 

to decide wether we should raise or lower in RaiseLower. There is
one more use of Scr.LastWindowRaised in HandleButtonPress, which should
also be replace by this function (or just be removed completely).

Any objections ?

I also plan to collect all code which manipulates the stacking order in
new files stack.[ch]. 
 
Any objections to this ?

Uh, I hope 2.3.x in addition to 2.2.x. I really wouldn't want to have
alpha releases running anywhere (well, my home system excluded :-) )

I've reorganized an X i18n-patch (previously, for fvwm 2.0.46) to fvwm
2.2. It adds (partially) multibyte support to fvwm. Maybe have some
dirty codes, but it works 5 years before (yes, FIVE years before. This
patch was born when the fvwm version was 1.20).

Interesting? Try:

ftp://ftp.ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/pub/CFAN/fvwm-users-jp/I18N_MB/fvwm-2.2-I18N_MB-1999042001.patch

I've not sent to this list because it is about 162KB!. Instructions
are shown in the head of this patch.

If somebody wanna put into fvwm repository, do it in anyway. Since I
have very few time to keep this patch up-to-date, I do not want to get
the access rights to commit fvwm CVS repository.

***

Notes on users of FreeBSD: Fvwm in FreeBSD ports is quite OLD,
however, today (a few minites before:) the updated version (fvwm 2.2)
is send-pr'ed. Please wait until the greatest FreeBSD committers do
their jobs. If you don't wait, check PR database number 'ports/11277',
or fetch a package 'fvwm-2.2.tgz' for FreeBSD 3.x-STABLE/4.0-CURRENT
(check the same directory shown above).

Yes, very interesting. It's almost embarassing to say that the current
2.3.x version is already very different from 2.2 so I have little hope
of applying it without lots of problems.

Are you sure about this? Applying a patch is one thing, but keeping
it up to date when you don't even have a system than can use the patch
is a different story.

Nonsense. I'd love to have full internationalisation support for
fvwm, but it's *so much* work. I still have a real job and simply
can't spend anywhere enough time to make such changes. The other
developers have the same problem. Please do not understand this
as criticism but try to understand what our problem is:

We are making a lot of changes now in the development tree. None of
the developers fully undestands what your patch does and how it does it.
The chances of applying it without conflicts are close to zero. When
someone comes saying: "Hey, I have a patch that makes large changes
to fvwm, but sorry, I've got no time helping you to apply it," we
have a problem. I'm sure you put a lot of work into the update. But if
you had asked at the list we would have immediately asked you to do the
patch for the development version. Now we have a patch that most
likely won't apply, a frustrated committer (i.e. you) and a bad
conscience here. That doesn't help us much.

Well, I'll try to apply it, but without a way to test the patch I
can not do much. As you correctly noted: the fvwm developers live
mostly in Europe and America and do not have the slightest idea how
this works or how to test this.

Bye

Okay,  one more rule for the operation:

this).

I didn't quite make myself clear I did an update yesterday 4/21 and saw the problems with the icons, my previous update was 4/12 and I wasn't having icon troubles.  I was trying to say that the problem crept in some time between 4/12 and 4/21.  I did just to an update this morning and nothing that got checked in fixed it.  But I can try and track it down on Monday.

Can you give some ideas as to what kinds of changes are included in this
patch?  What needs to be modified in fvwm2 to support i18n?  There're
obvious things like output strings in different locales, but fvwm
doesn't do much printing of anything except debugging messages; there
must be more to it than that.

Thx.

>From a quick glance at the patch, it seems to be mostly concerned with
getting the various strings from hints using multibyte methods,
handing them to modules as mb strings, drawing icon and window
titles and menu entries as mb strings. All this is protected 
by #ifdef I18N_MB. 

The patch seems to be fairly large partly because it is not only
against fvwm, but also against numerous modules.

Actually, I changed the tkFvwm.c file (there were some quirks in it and
I wanted to support mini-icons, etc.).  The only states that I think
that tkgoodstuff is interested in is whether a window is iconified or
currently selected (I could be wrong).

In any event, I can make the current sources available on my home
system at:

	http://amberthree.dynip.com/~lar3ry/tkgoodstuff-8.1-rc3.tar.gz

(rc == release candidate)

The coding is complete; the only reason it's not ready for release is
that I have not updated the doco for it, and some things have changed.

Yes, you have.  Thanks a lot!

Not out of the question at all.  tkgoodstuff is currently suffering the
same problems that plagued Chuck and Brady with fvwm 2.0 -- real life
is getting in the way of the maintainers.  [smile]

Almost yes. Thank you.

Some dirty hack (replace XTextWidth() by C macro) also exists,
however, most of changes are protected in #ifdef I18N_MB. 'I18N_MB' is 
defined if and only if you do './configure --enable-kanji', you can
compile patched fvwm without --enable-kanji and you'll get usual fvwm.

Some of you say '--enable-kanji' is not a good name; I think so too, but 
that's the way of Window Maker, so I follow it.

clasen> The patch seems to be fairly large partly because it is not

I've also write a patch for modules which may *display* multibyte
character. Only patching fvwm is not enough :-)

Converting a patch from 2.0.46 to 2.2 eats my weekend, but maybe 10 or 
20 hours (including test running and make a FreeBSD package).

The only thing I want to say in previous mail is that I don't have
enough time to commit this change (iff it is allowed), so if anybody
interested in this patch, do it without my approval. Sorry if you
misunderstand my message; it's my fault, I'm too nervous yesterday...

I'm also in doubt that this patch is maybe only for asian
people. However, other window managers, Window Maker and AfterStep, 
already have a code of multibyte support (Note that Window Maker also
does catalog file support by gettext library; maybe gettext is not a
good implementation (hehe, it's just a runtime string replacement),
but practical solution).

Fvwm forks does not consider obiously such a situation for many many
years. You say it's a hard work, however, you'll soon find that my
I18N_MB hack is ONLY a typical code conversion from *font* to *fontset*. 
Yes, of course more and more hacking for multibyte support is needed,
including error/infomation message handling. I hope I18N_MB patch will 
be the first step for it...

Applying I18N_MB patch to fvwm 2.3.1 needs some work, maybe. If much
of workers are interested in, I'll try to rearrange this patch against 
to 2.3.1 (or whatever latest beta version).

Hmm, does fvwm need multibyte support which is not debuggable for most
of workers? Should we really need a code of multibyte support such
does in AfterStep, twm (not R6/xc, but you can find R5/contrib), olwm,
olvwm, mlvwm, (your rival name here:), and Window Maker? Anyway,
what's multibyte handling ? Is it happy for us ?

We first do a decision about these issue, and applying this patch into
core fvwm code is the next issue, doesn't it?

I'd start with applying the patch and then rework large parts.
Having #ifdef's in dozens of places is no solution. I hope we
can shift all multibyte code in a separate .c file and have no
ifdef's in the code anywhere else.

Subject: Problem compiling FvwmGtk.c

Full_Name: Paul Martin
Version: 2.3.1 + recent snapshots
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.6
X_Server: XFree86-3.3.3.1
Submission from: (NULL) (163.1.146.155)


Drops out reporting an error in FvwmGtk.c after configure --enable-gnome,
make. I 
can't find a similar error on the list of bugs and don't know enough to fix
it
- sorry. I do want to run a recent fvwm since enlightenment is *s-l-o-w*
but I want
to run gnome.

Gtk configuration on the system is:

~~/stud005% rpm -qa | grep gtk+
gtk+10-1.0.6-4.1
gtk+-1.2.1-7
gtk+-devel-1.2.1-7

The actual error message is as follows:

There is something wrong with arg passing or parsing in 2.3.1.

I have a function like this:

destroyfunc test
addtofunc test "I" Exec exec echo "arg 0: $0." "arg 1: $1." "arg 2: $2."

And tests like this:

test val0 val1 val2
test val0 "" val2

With 2.2, it produces:

arg 0: val0. arg 1: val1. arg 2: val2.
arg 0: val0. arg 1: . arg 2: val2.

With 2.3.1 (04/22/99) it produces:

arg 0: val0. arg 1: val1. arg 2: val2.
arg 0: val0. arg 1: . arg 2: .
                             ^

This is a simple test case, I have some functions where passing NULL
args has to work.

Its been like this a while.  Work has had me to occupied to report it.

When moving a window using the pager from desktop to desktop (disjoint
desktops)
FvwmPager from 2.2 dies.  Using my 2.0.4x binary it works fine.  Moving
within a
virtual desktop works fine (for both 2.2 and 2.0.4x).  Could this be my own
fvwm2rc
bug (since I am using a modified version of my old one since the 2.0
betas)?

I got this once:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
/home/blc/bin/fvwm22/:/home/blc/bin/ MoveToDesk

(MoveToDesk doesn't appear anywhere in my .fvwm2rc)

but usually I get this:

X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  1623
  Current serial number in output stream:  1626

Can this be reproduced on other machines?

	Sounds like the way to go.

	Yes!

	I'd hoped to do something like this post-2.2, but I haven't had time to
dig into the layer code to see what may have changed here. 

	I'd also wanted to abstract a set of chain-manipulation primitives into
library functions - I had in mind some functions that would let you move
a contiguous (in the chain sense) set of elements from one spot to
another (or even to a different chain) in one operation, rather than one
at a time.

	Moving all the stacking order code to one location would make it much
easier to study this notion.

	The MoveToDesk command is piped to FVWM by the Pager. This sounds like
a 2.2 Pager trying to talk to a 2.0.4x FVWM. The MoveToDesk command is
new with 2.2: it replaces the old WindowsDesk command in 2.0.xx. So it
looks like the FVWM that's running is your old one, which doesn't
recognize the new command.

Yet another patch of I18N_MB is already written which introduces *wrapper*

Sorry, I wasn't clear.  The 2.3.x version will be labelled
"experimental -- for the brave only!" or similar.  2.2.x will be the
standard FVWM.

Keep up the good work (and sorry for being so quiet recently),

Are you by any chance using an old FvwmPager on the Solaris machine?

Hi,
During parsing, the FvwmGtk module calls the obsolete (removed)
function GetNextOption. I have made a small patch that changes this to
GetNextFullOption which, according to the dockumentation, have the
same functionality.

Some times when I re iconify a program or start a program (gtk, motif so
far)
the window will jump to something like > 3000 vertical size.  The window
does
seem to be resize able to a smaller size execpt via a maximize/grow
function. 
At first I thought is was just netscape. But I have save size on for
Netscape
so that when I resized it smaller and closed it then restarted it should
start
at the smaller size but doesn't always.  And just now when I de-iconified a
gtk
window it did the same thing, but the horz size doesn't seem to change.  I
have on
desktop size at 1x2 and it is always off the lower screen.

A quick glance at the console message says in the following order:
The first one is stated once, the second is stated 5 times in every
instence.

This is a request of an enhancement not a bug list.
Someone on the fvwm mailing list suggested I submit this.  From the talk on
the
list I gather this feature is being worked on by someone, but I thought I'd
spell
out what IMHO it should do.

The having a window shaded and the title bar at the bottom of the screen
but when
the window is unshaded to have the window pop up X pixels and then unshade
rather
then just unshade off the screen.

Basiclly what I believe should happen is this: make a new style
Popupwindowshade<?>
When a window is shaded and at the bottom or close enough to the bottom of
the
screen so that unshading the window will place most of it off the screen
the window
shade function should reason this way.  If distance to bottom of screen is
> then 
40% of vert screen size pop window up difference between the two then
unshade window.
Then if said window is not moved between the unshade and a reshade function
shade
window and move the title bar back to where it was before.

Ofcourse 40% is just a number and can be anything or even a user selectable
size.
This method differs from some that are mentioned on the mailing list in
that the 
window doesn't shade upward which IMHO whould almost be a waste of the
function
however neat it would look just for a cool features sake.  Mine is at least
totally
for functions sake rather then a neat feature.

Gnome Pager shows all windows in one desktop even if the windows 
are on different fvwm desktops. The number of desktop in Gnome Pager
should also be settable by fvwm.

I have spent some hours today with this patch... I have tried to
resolve the rejects in libs/ and fvwm/, ignoring modules/ for now.

The biggest part was builtins.rej, due to the fact that some menu
code went to menu.c. I do have a 2.3 binary built with -enable-kanji
which seems to work reasonably well (for my single-byte locale, don't
know how much that proves). I could produce a patch for libs/ and fvwm/
if you want, but I don't think that it should be put in CVS in its
current version. The patch contains *tons* of changes 

isspace(*p) --> isspace((unsigned char)*p)

If this is really needed, it should definitively be handled differently.  
Other than that, I wouldn't like to see hundreds of #ifdef I18N_MB
littered all over the code. We really should abstract font handling in
in one .c file.

Thanks, I really should have done this long ago...on the other hand,
it is nice to leave a bug in, so you see by the bug reports that people 
actually try the new module :-)

clasen> isspace(*p) --> isspace((unsigned char)*p)

I'm not sure about this changes, but I've heard that some system
(sorry I do not know) requires this change.

Maybe isspace() was implemented as a macro (not a function), and the
argument is used as an index of array, and maybe *p was treated as
'minus' value. Maybe the 7bit-character world does not need to fix
such a change ('cause MSB is always zero).

Just a thought: rather than trying to apply a patch to fvwm-2.2 to current
sources, there is the alternative approach of 

	cvs checkout -r version-2.2 fvwm
	[apply patch]
	cvs update -A

Now resolve all the conflicts.  

I dunno which approach is easier, mind you.

Ick, no!  My POSIX book says isspace() takes an "int" argument.  Ditto for
all the other is*() functions from ctype.h.  

If any cast is necessary, it should be isspace((int)*p).

But is a cast necessary?  A sytstem with prototyped headers wouldn't need
a cast.  And in the absence of a prototype, don't C compilers promote
'char' arguments to 'int' anyway?

Absolutely.

The proper fix would be to use unsigned char throughout, I guess.

Nice idea, but since I have already done most of it manually...

Yes, but the standard says:

The header <ctype.h> declares several functions useful for testing and 
mapping characters.  In all cases the argument is an int, the value of
which shall be representable as an unsigned char or shall equal the value
of the macro EOF.  If the argument has any other value, the behaviour
is undefined.

I don't know if "representable as" means that you have to do the cast.

Now that would be truly redundant, wouldn't it ?

Well, this could be the problem, no ? If I have a character with the high bit
set, it would be negative as a char, so would be promoted to a negative int
and thus not be "representable" as an unsigned char.

Precisely.

However, is*() functions are almost always implemented via macros, not
functions.  This means that no promotion is done.

I know that newer GCC's, for example, often complain about "char array
subscripts" when you use these without a cast because isspace() etc. are
really macros that resolve to array lookups with the argument as the
array subscript.

Nevertheless, I do _NOT_ recomment adding (int) casts all over the
place, just to shut up these warnings.  The compiler really ought to
handle this correctly.

Maybe the author of the patch can give the reason for applying the
(unsigned char) cast?

Ouch... you're right.

Kind of a PITA, since most functions, even standard ones, take char*
arguments (for example), not unsigned char*.

Maybe we should create ISSPACE(), etc. macros that invoke isspace(),
etc. but cast the argument to unsigned char.

Since the "isspace"  works without a cast,  outside  the I18N locales,
this must  have something  to do  with forcing double  byte characters
into 256 byte range?

The first time I saw this patch there were cases where I saw:

isspace(*p & 0xFF).

At the time, I favored dealing with it as a macro.

#ifdef I18N
#define ISSPACE(X) isspace(X & 0xFF)
#else
#define ISSPACE(X) isspace(X)
#endif

(Caution, untested code.)  The macro might accomodate a cast also.
It would seem to me that compilers on machines with signed characters
would have to build their isspace arrays accordingly.

That wouldn't make any sense. You really can't use isspace and friends
on multibyte or wide characters, thats why the standard says the int
argument has to be representable as an unsigned char.

The standard mentions an additonal header wctype.h with "isw" analoga
of the "is" functions from ctype.h. These operate on wchar_t. Thus
i guess the correct way to do character classification on multibyte
strings is to first convert them to wide chars (using mbtowcs)
and then use iswspace and friends. Not that I think any of this is
needed for the uses of isspace in fvwm. We should just make sure
we parse the rc file in the "C" locale and then use 
isspace((unsigned char*)*p) or a macro for this.

I know there _was_ talk about cleaning up the module directory (not in
the literal sense of moving and updating files, but in the "incorporation
sense"), was there any consensus ?

For example:
  FvwmButtons   vs. FvwmWharf     vs. tkgoodstuff    vs. FvwmGoodStuff
  FvwmWinList   vs. FvwmIconMan
  etc..

What I'm getting at is this, could we see what feature(s) one module has over
the other and try to have one module that would incorporate _all_ the
feature(s).  For example, I think you can accomplish everything you want with
FvwmIconMan vs. FvwmWinList (keep in mind that I'm a FvwmWinList user) except
for two things that I know of:

  a. FvwmIconMan does not allow one to have the title names be
     centered-justified on the button versus left-justified (ie. one
     can't get the same FvwmWinList look from FvwmIconMan).

  b. FvwmIconMan shows a window is iconified using a button-like indicator
     instead of parentheses.  In FvwmWinList "  title1  " means non-iconified
     while " (title1) " means iconified.

Could FvwmIconMan be modified to accommodate the above noted (and other) minor
changes ??  I think there is virtue in doing that -- redundancy ought to be
avoided and frowned upon :-)

I've never used FvwmWharf but I wonder whether the changes are cosmetic as
well.  Even if they are a bit more beefy, couldn't you include all of
FvwmWharf's/tkgoodstuff's features into FvwmButtons ??

Should I enter a bug/enhancement entry ?  Thoughts ?

Thanks

There is already the Current function which allows you to define
different actions if the current window is an xterm, but what's
missing is a function which passes the event on to the underlying
application.

I think.

Naive question: does this work if people use Chinese (say) menu
entries or have windows with Chinese (say) window titles (and use
window titles in Next [...] constructions)?

GNOME stuff improvements:

(ie fvwm obeys the hints if the client sets them before mapping - unless
fvwm styles override them)
* _WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT is no longer fixed to 1

Ah, I noticed this problem too, after sending the comment above.
I guess it won't work unless you are lucky and your mb locale
uses the same single byte characters for spaces as latin-1. These
issues really should be resolved by someone with first-hand 
experience with mb locales. 

I have taken a closer look at the I18N patch and have written
up what I think we need to get away without an #ifdef mess:

#ifndef MB_H
#define MB_H

#include "config.h"


/* return a text property, doing locale specific conversions,
 use this for WM_NAME and WM_ICON_NAME, this has to be defined
using XGetTextProperty and mbTextPropertyToStringList, probably
discarding all but the first returned strings */
char *GetTextProperty(Display *, Window, Atom);

#ifdef I18N_MB

#include <X11/Xlocale.h>


/* Font should be used as the type of MyFont.font 
   and as the return value of GetFontOrFixed */
typedef XFontSet Font;


/* use DrawString where we currently use XDrawString,
   note that DrawString has an additional font parameter */
#define DrawString(dpy,win,font,gc,x,y,text,len) \
        XmbDrawString(dpy,win,font,gc,x,y,text,len)


/* use this instead of directly setting the MyFont.height variable,
   this has to be implemented using XExtentsOfFontSet */
void SetFontHeight(MyFont *myfont); 


/* use FreeFont wehere we currently use XFreeFont */
#define FreeFont(dpy,font) XFreeFontSet(dpy,font)


#else /* !I18N_MB */

typedef XFontStruct *Font; 


#define DrawString(dpy,win,font,gc,x,y,text,len) \
	XDrawString(dpy,win,gc,x,y,text,len)


#define SetFontHeight(myfont) \
  (myfont)->height = (myfont)->font->ascent + (myfont)->font->descent


#define FreeFont(dpy,font) XFreeFont(dpy,font)


#endif /* !I18N_MB */

#endif /* MB_H */

Recently I've been playing with making my own themes setup.  I basiclly
have
a menu item destroy the "default" decor and read in a new one then do a 
recapture.  Seems to work pretty good.  Execpt for things that I have 
defined in styles such as back and fore colors, and I have to do a full
Fvwm2 restart to update them.  The man page clearly states that a
recapture
command sould do this.  And just now I tried out a new .fvwm2rc someone 
send me.  It has a click to focus style while I have sloppy focus, after
trying it out I just copied over my old fvwm2rc file and restarted to find
I'm still in clicktofocus, and only a full X restart will fixes the
problem.

Hello,

I run a virtual desktop of 4x4 viewports each of size 800x600 pixels.
I have an image of size 1280x1024 and try to view it with the xv
application.
Instead of appearing full size, the image appears shrunken to
my desktop size.

I know xv has nothing to do with Fvwm2 but I feel that somehow
Fvwm might be responsible for the shrinking.

On the other hand Electric Eyes (ee), will display larger images
than the viewport (although I failed to save images larger than
the viewport).

It really looks like there is bug in xv but I am not of whether
Fvwm has something to do with it at all. After all, xv must
ommunicate with the window manager to obtain the viewport size
(I believe).

Is there a way into triking xv to make it think the viewport is
as large as the whole 4x4 desktop? Does Fvwm have an option to
set up this trick?

Thanks.

Best Regards.

Neil

fvwm is not responsible for this resizing, xv by default applies -maxp
(proportional maximizing) option. There is -nolimits option to do the 
trick you want.
You can also specify a geometry you want: xv -nol -geo 1600x1200 image

There are many xv options (xv -h), but man page is useless. There is,
however, xvdocs.ps.

I just managed to find the website of "fvwm2gnome" again
after looking without success for some time. It is about
providing themes for fvwm nicely integrated with the gnome
environment. Perhaps we should add it to the "links" page? 

It is at

http://fvwm2gnome.fluid.cx/todo.html

My fault, probably affects FvwmScroll too, I'm fixing it.

Submission from: (NULL) (209.128.29.234)


Hello,

I have some some very simple applications I made with the dialog
utility for my system. Due to some bugs in the current version of the
dialog program I would like to prevent certain windows invoked through
menus to be non-resizable.

Unfortunately, there are many applications out there which tend to act
erroneously when resized.

Hence it would be nice to have a NoResize Style option to prevent the
displaying of erroneous applications.

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

Since   it would be   easy  enough for  the  user  to just  not resize
applications,  that don't  handle it well,  I  would  favor, not doing
anything to fvwm2 for this.

I'd be interested  in the reaction you got  from your vendor  when you
submitted this bug report to them.
Is this a commercial vendor?  Are you paying them for support?

You might want  to consider using a distinct  border color, or perhaps
the  "hiddenhandles"   style  as  a  warning  to  yourself   that  the
application is broken.

Make sure you aren't using "ResizeHintOverride".

I've asked about KDE window manager compliance on the KDE
mailing list but got no response until know. Perhaps
someone here can tell me where to ask with a better chance
of getting a response.

BTW, as a first step, shouldn't we simply realease 2.2 with this
patch (or better: 2.2.1)? Can someone who fiddled with the patch
do this?

Apropos 2.2.1, although there has been a bit of work in the 2.2
branch we still did not release 2.2.1. I'd be grateful if someone
would take the responsibility of making this release out of my
hands (I'm not comfortable enough with CVS to try it).

Dan, can you tell me exactly what you've done? I don't recognize
it iin the code. Does it help with the slow iconification?

All the  code is  in libs/Bindings.c.   Look for  this comment and the
following code:

    /* If this is a mouse binding we'll fall through the for loop (maxmods is
     * zero) and the if condition is always true (type is zero). Since min ==
     * max == button there is no loop at all is case of a mouse binding. */

The change I  made checks the  entry about to be  added to the binding
table to see if  it is identical  to  the binding just added.   If the
entries are identical, the duplicate entry is not added.

For me, this cut the  number of entries in  the binding table from 400
to 200.  This cut my iconify time from 7 seconds to 3 seconds.
Still way too slow.

The change you made didn't have a measurable impact.

After all the recent changes, I counted the number of grabs being
done.  For each iconify event, I count 200 key grabs.  About 2/3 of
them are in the logic with the comment "dead key grab".  I think
the "IgnoreModifiers" command my have something to do with this,
so this evening I want to run another test with no modifiers being
ignored.

By the way, the man page says this command is slow on a network.
I don't see how networks come into this, my X Server is on my
desktop.

Many bugfixes and code cleanup.

The biggest fix was to restore the ability to read
FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc file, which got lost sometime in the
past week or two.

Rewrote CatString3 to dynamically allocate the buffer, so it is more
generally useful.  If you find yourself doing lots of mallocs &
strcats, check this function out!

I tried the latest cvs fvwm yesterday, and noticed that many window hints
are now handled by gsfr (I'm unsure what this is).  The "sticky" hint, as
in sticks to glass, seems to no longer work.  I'm unsure if this is a
problem with stickyness in general with fvwm, or if the order of hints
being set in add_window has changed.

I'm also working on some updates to GNOME support which will remain
isolated in gnome.c.  These have to do with needing to detect if the GNOME
proxy windows already exist, and use them if they do.  Currently,
restarting fvwm results in GNOME functionallity going away.

Regards,
Jay

This:

${FVWM_USERHOME}.fvwm2rc

was changed to this:

${FVWM_USERHOME}/.fvwm2rc

but fvwm.c makes sure FVWM_USERHOME always has a trailing slash.

I think double slashes are OK on all platforms,  I just don't see
what the problem was.

Actually,  the  replacement  was to use   the setup  form  to create a
.fvwm2rc file in  the users   home  directory and restart.   The  file
created is a minor update and reorg to the system.fvwm2rc.

If you think we still need the old functionality, I have no objection.

GSFR stands for "Great Style Flag Re-write"; basically all the flags for
window styles, etc. used to be stored in a single 32-bit int.  A long,
long time ago we ran out of flags, but still had lots more styles :(
Various hacks like global styles, etc. had to be invented.

So, the GSFR changes the style flags from an int to bitfields, which are
infinitely expandable.

FYI.

Also, note that "gsfr.h", etc. will be renamed to something much less
cryptic When We Get Around To It (definitely before 2.4.0 :).

I've just finally gotten the nerve to rename my config and try starting
FVWM bare, to see what the new config stuff does.  It's definitely pretty
cool!  

The idea of chopping up the config file into pieces will hopefully pave
the way for GUI configuration.

 
> If you think we still need the old functionality, I have no objection.

I do, for two reasons:

#1.  There is no reason for the upgrade to further[1] surprise old users
who have a functioning system.fvwm2rc file.

#2.  I think the chopped-up config could be even more useful if the base
config file remained FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc, rather than being
installed as a private .fvwm2rc.  This allows the sysadmin to define stuff
system-wide (like menus for remote login, say).  With the old logic
restored, you can have it *both* ways!  If the sysadmin likes a central
config file, they create system.fvwm2rc; otherwise with your config form,
they can let the users take care of themselves. 

At startup time, FVWM again[2] looks for the first of the following to
source (unless given -f or -cmd on the command line):

	FVWM_USERHOME/.fvwm2rc
	FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc
	FVWM_CONFIGDIR/.fvwm2rc

The last is a sop to backwards-compatability.  I don't imagine -- though I
could easily be wrong -- that FVWM_CONFIGDIR/.fvwm2rc was really intended
as the name of the system-wide config file.  It seems just to be an
artefact of the `Read' function searching in two directories. 


Footnotes:

1. In fact, they will be surprised anyway -- see new FAQ #3.13.

2. I changed the ordering of the last two files, to prefer
   FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc over FVWM_CONFIGDIR/.fvwm2rc.

Hi,

Could someone familiar with make (hi Paul!) remind me of the most portable
way of writing an "always do" rule?

The issue is that our makefiles generate a few scripts that have
${moduledir} embedded in them; FvwmCascade, FvwmTalk, and FvwmTile, to
name three. 

By default moduledir has the version number embedded in it.  But, the
Makefile rules for these scripts have no dependency, which means that mine
always have the WRONG version number.  

Even worse: the installer can do "make moduledir=/blah". 

So there is nothing we can depend on.  These scripts must be generated
each time.  How do we do that?

Let's make this a separate thread - it's not shedding any light on
Jay's problem with STICKY not working.

	To recap our story thus far, we have the following suggestions:

Tomas:
	flags.h
	styleflags.h

Dominik:
	window_flags.h

Bob:
	window_flags.h
 
	I go along with Dominik's idea, because this header really deals with
window state flags as well as window style flags. Not only that, but it
deals with the flags contained in a structure called, oddly
enough...window_flags.

This does happen.  Dominik merged a couple modules into FvwmRearrange, and
Dan replaced FvwmTalk with a form of FvwmForm.  I think the only thing
stopping this from happening is that someone has to sit down, go carefully
through the code of both modules, and combine them.

I heartily agree with the remark on redundancy and repetition.

If someone submitted a clean patch merging the features of one module into
another, I suspect it'd be applied in a second.

It has been suggested that Wharf be dropped in favour of Buttons, but one
or two people pointed out something that Wharf has and Buttons lacks.

Ditto for IconMan vs. IconBox.


Other modules that seem to be redundant:


** FvwmAudio -- hasn't this been totally superceeded by FvwmEvent?  The
leading comment suggests it is a direct descendent of Audio:

 * renamed & cleaned up so that FvwmEvent (TaDa !!) is a general event
   handler module.
               -- 21.04.98 Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)



** FvwmSave and FvwmSaveDesk -- how do these compare/interact with the
session-management stuff?  Superficially, they seem to have similar goals.
Is that true?  I haven't looked carefully at this, but I assume the
session-guy did.  (Matthias?)

Hm.. Maybe window_flags is better/best afterall.. flags is too general
and there's more than style in the flags..

I hereby officially (and unofficially too) change my vote to
window_flags.h

I'm not disagreeing, but I sort of think fvwm2 is next to useless
with our system.fvwm2rc, but if an administrator modifies it sufficiently,
maybe.

One thought  I   had was to  add:   "read SiteDefaults  quiet"  to the
ConfigFvwmDefaults file.   I didn't  think  that  the "system.fvwm2rc"
file was a good candidate for this file.  (In other words, adding
"read system.fvwm2rc quiet" would probably not be a good idea.

Wasn't the old logic:

 	HOME/.fvwm2rc
 	FVWM_CONFIGDIR/.fvwm2rc
 	FVWM_CONFIGDIR/system.fvwm2rc

I think whatever the intent was, it wasn't completely thought out, and
only documented in "INSTALL.fvwm" after the fact.

I think this answers my question above, but I thought this was for
compatibility?

I've added "IgnoreModifiers" to my ".fvwm2rc" and I can now iconify
windows in about 1 second.  It looks to me like its now back where it
was in the past.

I counted about 50 grabs per iconification.

I'm not so sure this switch has the correct default value. Or maybe the
documentation should be clearer about the impact.

Submission from: (NULL) (128.208.37.26)


I am not using rplay. If I leave
 
*FvwmEventRplayHost $HOSTDISPLAY  
*FvwmEventRplayPriority 0  
*FvwmEventRplayVolume 127

in .fvwm2rc then FvwmEvent will dump core. I Comment these lines from
.fvwm2rc to prevent core dumping.

Fvwm should ignore these lines instead of dumping core if rplay is 
not being used.

I have not tested rplay support since switching from 2.0.46.
HTH!

Use the ol' FORCE hack:

  foo: FORCE
          ...do some cool stuff...
  FORCE:

as long as the file FORCE doesn't exist, you're golden.  This is due to
a special dispensation by standard make: if there are no dependencies or
command script, and the target doesn't exist, make pretends it's been
updated whenever it's seen--so it's always newer than targets that
depend on it.

.PHONY is safer, since you don't have to worry about some joker creating
a file FORCE.  Also, it's slightly more effecient.

But it's obviously a whole lot less portable :)

Hmm.  Well, except for the second point you can have the script target
depend on both the source (foo.in) _and_ the Makefile; then whenever the
makefile changes the script will too.

That doesn't help for command-line overrides, though.  Forcing the file
to update every time is OK w/ me.

Indeed.

That's it. 200 grabs can take a considerable amount of time. We
have to figure out why this enormous amount of grabs is done.

The network may be involved because the grabs contact the server.
Running the X server on the same machine as your desktop doesn't
necessarily mean the network is not involved. There are definitely
X servers (e.g. the X server supplied with AIX 4.2) stupid enough
to use the network if you set your 'DISPLAY' variable to
'<hostname>:0.0'. To prevent network access this should be ':0.0'.
(This forced me to do some complicated shell setup to get DISPLAY
set right in the past). Coult this be part of the problem?

Jay, I recently did some Gnome support updates. The reason why
the sticky bit didn't work is that GNOME_GetHints writes directly
in the flags of the FvwmWindow struct and those are later overwritten
in AddWindow (when the flags from the style are copied to the window).
I have changed the logic somewhat by using a new function GNOME_GetStyle
which is used to initialize the style flags with the Gnome hints (you
can find this in style.c)

This seems to be more in sync with the general logic of Fvwm configuration
that user-supplied styles override hints from the program (If your setup
would have worked, the user would not have a way to override gnome hints).

I don't care much about the name anyway as long as you can guess from the
name what is in the file. The main problem in my eyes is that it's
extramely difficult to separate the style/flags related types and
structures from fvwm.h. I would like to have all style/flags related
stuff in one or two separate files, but as long as it refers to things
like FvwmWindow of icon boxes this won't work.

My home  machine  definitely has $DISPLAY  set to  ":0".   It was slow
before  I set  "IgnoreModifiers".  Now  its  OK.  Perhaps the man page
should say, this option  can be slow on very  slow machines, or with a
lot of key or mouse bindings, or when the X Server is on network.

But the default shouldn't be slower than before. Only if you add
additional modifiers to be ignored it should have any impact.

thats slower than before.

IgnoreModifiers

is the same speed as before,  so I think that should be the default.

I tried

IgnoreModifiers L25

it wasn't any slower than just "L".

If you are saying  "L"  should be the  same  speed as before, I'm  not
finding that to be true.

Just a note here to point out that while tkgoodstuff can probably
subsume most of the functionality of FvwmButtons or FvwmWharf (and even
FvwmIconMan) it uses a completely different configuration language than
other modules (tcl/tk), and as such, the other ones cannot really
replace it.  For another thing, it has a completely GUI-driven
configuration.

Actually, it would be "neat" if Fvwm2.x had a GUI-driven configuration
capability, but always such a suggestion gets bogged down into
implementation details:  language (tcl/tk?  python?  Java?  perl? 
Scheme?) and environment (GNOME?  KDE?  CDE?), to name a couple.

I don't think this will ever be resolved to everybody's liking.
 
tkgoodstuff is written in tcl/tk, so the choice of implementation
language is moot.  This is OK with tkgoodstuff, since it remains an
"external Fvwm2 module."

Caps-lock was ignored as a modifier before I touched the code.
I can vaguely remember that there was some bug that missed a few
bindings, but not to an extent that should matter here.

That should be *faster* since caps-lock works like any other
modifier then.

Duh, I can't explain that one. Should be a lot slower.

Yes, exactly.

Uh, oh, I can see what the problem is. In GrabWindowKey (Binding.c) there
is a loop doing the grabs:

  register unsigned int max = dead_modifiers | binding->Modifier;
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  /* handle all bindings for the dead modifiers */
  for (mods = 1; mods <= max; mods++)
    {
      ...
    }

Because of the '| binding->Modifier' it multiplies all bindings.
I'm working on a quick patch.

Okay, here we go. It's a patch for key bindings only for now. Dan,
can you check this? I can't test at work. Just replace the code
piece in Bindings.c (GrabWindowKey) with this one (you'll know where).

  {
    register unsigned int mods;
    register unsigned int max = dead_modifiers; 
    register unsigned int living_modifiers = ~dead_modifiers;
    
    /* handle all bindings for the dead modifiers */
    for (mods = 1; mods <= max; mods++)
      {
        /* Since mods starts with 1 we don't need to test if mods
         * contains a dead modifier. Otherwise both, dead and living
         * modifiers would be zero ==> mods == 0 */
        if (mods & living_modifiers)
          continue;
        if (fGrab)
          XGrabKey(dpy, binding->Button_Key, mods|binding->Modifier, w,
                   True, GrabModeAsync, GrabModeAsync);
        else
          XUngrabKey(dpy, binding->Button_Key, mods|binding->Modifier,
                     w);
      }
  }

Hi All,
        Title says it all. With the current CVS PlaceAgain without the
Anim option works fine, the Anim option makes fvwm dump core.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well, we're moving that way now with the work Dan has been doing; he's
using FvwmForm scripts as the "language".  Check out what happens if you
start the latest CVS fvwm with no .fvwm2rc or system.fvwm2rc files
available...

The environment isn't really relevant here, is it?  If you have GNOME
apps (that set the GNOME attributes on their windows) you get GNOME
support... I assume that if/when we support the others similar things
will happen.

I tried to compile the FvwmGtk module recently, but it already
fails during configure. I don't have the necessary gtp library
version on the latest SuSE Linux distribution (which probably is
the most up-to-date distribution at the moment - it's about a
week old). Where can I get the necessary gtk version?

v1.1.x shouldn't be used for anything nowadays... 1.2.2 is the latest
released...

Hi,

I tried sending a reply from the BUG-tracking page, but I'm not sure I
succeeded.  Can you let me know if you got some response from it?

If not, here's the patch.  If you can check to see if it works, I'd
appreciate it.

Roberto, didn't you someday write some documentation regarding window manager
complicance? Can you please send this to Dominik?


Regarding the hints: All window manager communication in KDE is handled in a
single class, called KWM. This class is in libkdecore/kwm.[h,cpp].

There's heaps of documentation in the kwm.h file, describing what the hints are
supposed to do. Please have also a look at the kwm.cpp file that contains very
straightforward code how the properties are applied.

While I really appreciate fvwm becoming KDE-aware, I have to warn you a little
bit: I'm currently working with other window manager and/or desktop "vendors"
on a new standard for all these things (together with people from gnome and
other projects).  

That means: for KDE-2.0 we plan to implement a new, common,  better, cleaner
and more documentated window manager protocol which is supposed portable among
the different desktops.

That sounds way cool, of course, but the question is... what is the
timeframe for KDE 2?  If it's around the same time as we're planning
2.4.0 (early summer?) then maybe we should wait for it--being one of the
first to support the new protocol would be a nice feather.

If it's much later, I wouldn't bother waiting; we can always cut a quick
release if we want to.

But, we might also reconsider supporting KDE in 2.4.0 in light of this
new info, and also since none of the KDE people seem that interested in
doing the work for us :).

And to be honest, KDE's window manager, while definitely not as great as
FVWM :), is certainly nowhere near as annoying (IMHO) as E, so KDE
doesn't need FVWM support nearly as urgently as GNOME does (again IMHO).

I didn't really like what I wrote, and didn't find a way to make it
better, so it never advanced that much, but here it is anyway.

If I may add something: for the desktop switching code, looking at the
source of kpanel helps a lot.

1: Reporting as a KDE aware WM
------------------------------

On startup, all KDE aware window managers should set the KWM_RUNNING property
of the root window to a non-zero value.
In the same way, on exit, they should set it to 0.

Applications that need to communicate to a KDE aware window manager will
wait until they see this before attempting to communicate.

1.1: Sample code
----------------

  Display *display;
  Window root;

  kwm_running = XInternAtom(display, "KWM_RUNNING", False); 
  long data = 1; 
  XChangeProperty(display, root, kwm_running,
  kwm_running, 32,PropModeAppend, (unsigned char*) &data, 1); 
  

1.2: What should happen
-----------------------

If your window manager does this correctly, kpanel should start without
need for extra arguments.
If your window manager doesn't do it correctly, kpanel should print a
message like "waiting for window manager" and do nothing.

###############################################################################

2: Communication to modules
---------------------------

A KDE aware window manager should report of certain events to some special
programs, known as "modules".

The window manager should keep a list of all registered modules, and use
that list to report to them when other parts of this document say it
should.

A window belongs to a module if and only if it has the property KWM_MODULE
set to a non-zero value.

When a module wants to register itself, it will send a message to the root
window (using something like sendClientMessage below), with a atom
KWM_MODULE and the value of it's window.

A KDE aware window manager should watch the root window for changes on the
KWM_MODULE property, if it wants to register the modules.

2.1: Sample code and helper functions
-------------------------------------

This is a snippet that checks for the event type and either registers or
not the window as a module. The addModule function just adds w to the
modules list. 

This should go in the WM's event handler.

      if (e->xclient.message_type == kwm_module)
      {
         Window w = (Window) e->xclient.data.l[0];
         if (isKWMModule(display,w))
              addModule(w);
      }   

This is a function that sends a message to a window w, which is a module. 
A message consists of a Atom a, that indicates the kind of event, and a
long x that contains data, often something like a Window to which the
event happened.

NOTE for myself: ask Matthias what timeStamp is supposed to do!

void sendClientMessage(Window w, Atom a, long x){
  XEvent ev;
  long mask;

  memset(&ev, 0, sizeof(ev));
  ev.xclient.type = ClientMessage;
  ev.xclient.window = w;
  ev.xclient.message_type = a;
  ev.xclient.format = 32;
  ev.xclient.data.l[0] = x;
  ev.xclient.data.l[1] = timeStamp();
  mask = 0L;
  if (w == root)
    mask = SubstructureRedirectMask;        /* magic! */
  XSendEvent(display, w, False, mask, &ev);
}  

This functions sends a message about window w, with message Atom a, to all
modules in the modules list (modules in this example is a QList, you can
use anything, of course)

sendToModules(Atom a, Client* c, Window w){
  Window* mw;
  for (mw=modules.first(); mw; mw=modules.next())
    sendClientMessage(*mw, a, (long) w);
}    

This is a function to check if a window belongs to a module.
Every window should be checked when created, and added to the module list
if this returns true.

int isKWMModule(Display *display,Window w)
{  
  static Atom kwm_module = 0;
  if (!kwm_module)
      kwm_module=XInternAtom(display, "KWM_MODULE", False);
  long result = 0;
  getSimpleProperty(display,w, kwm_module, result);
  return result !=0;
}

The last function uses these helper functions:

int _getprop(Display *display, Window w, Atom a, Atom type, long
                    len, unsigned char **p)
{
  Atom real_type;
  int format;
  unsigned long n, extra;
  int status;

  status = XGetWindowProperty(display, w, a, 0L, len, False, type,
           &real_type, &format, &n, &extra, p);
  if (status != Success || *p == 0)
    return -1;
  if (n == 0)
    XFree((char*) *p);
  /* could check real_type, format, extra here... */
  return n;
}  

int getSimpleProperty(Display *display,Window w, Atom a, long &result){
  long *p = 0;

  if (_getprop(display, w, a, a, 1L, (unsigned char**)&p) <= 0){
    return False;
  }
  result = p[0];
  XFree((char *) p);
  return True;
}

2.2: What should happen
-----------------------

If all this makes sense (and you implement it the way I mean it ;-),
then starting kpager, kbgndwm, kpanel or any other application that
communicates to a KDE aware WM should add a window to your modules list.


###############################################################################

3: Multiple desktops
--------------------

KDE supports the concept of multiple disconnected desktops, each one with
a name. One of those desktops is the current desktop in any given moment.

The number of desktops is set in the KWM_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS property of
the root window.

The current desktop is set in the KWM_CURRENT_DESKTOP property of the root
window.

Your WM should make sure those a re coherent with it's own internal
representation.

If the WM doesn't support multiple desktops, then it should just set both
properties to 0.

The name of each desktop is in the KDE_DESKTOP_NAME_XX property of the
root window, where XX is the number of the desktop. So, the name of
desktop 1 will be in the KDE_DESKTOP_NAME_1 property.

Some KDE modules will want to change the number of desktops available, or
the name of a desktop. Therefore, the WM should monitor if they change,
and if they do, it should report to all modules.

3.1: Sample code
----------------

This code should go to the event handler. It monitors for events on the
root window, and reacts to events that affect desktops.

The currentDesktop() function returns the value of the KWM_CURRENT_DESKTOP
property, while numberOfDesktops returns the value of
KWM_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS.

XPropertyNotifyEvent *e;
Atom a;
Window root;
Display *display;

  a = e->atom;
  if (e->window == root)
  {
    // kwm observes a few properties of the root window for an easy
    // communication with all kind of clients.
    if (a == kwm_current_desktop)
    {
      // current desktop changed => switch to the new current desktop

//NOTE: this needs to be explained/replaced, not done yet
      switchDesktop(currentDesktop());
      sendToModules(display, module_desktop_change, 0, (Window)
      current_desktop);


    }
    if (a == kwm_number_of_desktops)
    {
      module_desktop_number_change=XInternAtom(display,
                           "KWM_MODULE_DESKTOP_NUMBER_CHANGE",False);
      // the number of desktops changed.
      number_of_desktops = numberOfDesktops();
      sendToModules(module_desktop_number_change, 
                    0, (Window) number_of_desktops); 
    }  
  }

3.2: What should happen
-----------------------

If you set the number of desktops correctly, kpanel should show a button
for each desktop (if there's more than one, of course), kpager should show
all desktops.

If you set the current desktop correctly, the right kpanel button should
appear depressed, the right kpager window highlighted.

If you handle desktop number changes modifications correctly, kpanel and
kpager should update themselves correctly when the number of desktops
change.

If you handle current desktop's number change correctly, kpager and kpanel
should be able to switch desktops correctly.

To maintain a user base, perhaps?  If KDE is the way of the future then
FVWM could become largely irrelevant.  And I certainly don't want to be
stuck with KWM.

Free software projects like this one shouldn't really have to do
"marketing" but it does help to anticipate what the users are going to want
in the future in order to keep those users.

What version of gtk is that ? You can find it out via
gtk-config --version
The configure script checks for a version >= 1.1.0. The 
current version is 1.2.2 (I think). But I haven't had any
problem with compiling FvwmGtk with 1.1.13 or 1.2.0.

One possible problem is that gtk-config might not be present
if you haven't installed the devel package of gtk. But that
is needed anyway to have the headers.

  dv> I couldn't have phrased this better.

This is a fine argument for including KDE support, and I agree with it.

But if we're going to have to write KDE 1.x support ourselves for 2.4.x
then just chuck it all out in order to support the new, improved,
completely different KDE 2.x soon thereafter, my question is why bother?

Maybe I'm optimistic but I don't see FVWM losing serious "market share"
in the near term due to lack of KDE 1.x support.  How many people who
use KDE _really_ want a different WM?  My _impression_ is that most
people who use KDE do so precisely _because_ it's a complete package,
and they're not interested in taking bits here and there.  GNOME, on the
other hand, needs a good WM and those folks appear to be much more
comfortable mixing and matching.

Well, I'm certainly not going to tell anyone what to work on and if
someone does the work, cool.  I just hope we don't hold up 2.4.0 waiting
for KDE support.  I'd like to see us start to move more aggressively to
a 2.4.0 release: now that the GSFR and GNOME are in what major
components are we waiting for?  Let's start thinking about
feature-freeze and revving up the beta/bugfix cycle.

PS. I realize I'm shouting from the peanut gallery since I've been too
    busy with GNU make stuff to do any actual FVWM work :-/.  Feel free
    to ignore me.

I've noticed recently that lots of the messages here are responses to
commits.  Unfortunately, it's hard to tell what the subject matter
really is, so it'd be nice if people would get in the habit of changing
the subject line (e.g., as I did here) to reflect the conversation's
topics.  That way, it's easier for people who may have helpful
suggestions but not a lot of time to pick and choose which messages are
most worth their time looking at.

Thanks,
Greg

Ugh, that code had a good bug-to-lines ratio (in ten lines of code).
I assume that was hacked in really late :-)

 - Memory leak in PlaceAgain_func: token acquired with GetNextToken
   has to be free'd. Better use PeekToken (no need to free it and
   faster).
 - PlaceAgain_func called AnimatedMoveOfWindow which is documented
   not to work with FvwmWindow's.
 - AnimatedMoveAnyWindow happily referenced a NULL tmp_win
   (IS_FIXED()).

Log message:
The IconPath -> ImagePath conversion broke some of the modules'
parsing: lines like "CopyString(&imagePath,&tline[9])".  The '9'
refers to the next character after "ImagePath" in "tline".  I didn't
make this a "10" for fear of running off the end of the buffer if
"ImagePath" is the last thing on the line.  CopyString skips
whitespace, so no harm is done in the normal case.

Also fixed printf's for 64-bit machines.

Since i'm not subscribed to this list (I'm on too many mailingslists
already), please send comments to me directly.

This patch makes fvwm2 a better GNOME citizen. It sets the desktop
properties of windows when they are deiconified. I can iconify a
window on desk 0 and de-iconify it on desk 1. The window appears on
desk 1, but in the gnome-pager, the windows is still shown on desk 0.

And for todays bug...

I'm not sure when this crept in, but for a while now, if I
deiconify a window by clicking on the icon, the window gets focus
even though my pointer is still on the root window.
This is how I've configured focus:

Style "*" MouseFocus
Style "xmag" ClickToFocus

Is it all windows or just transients?  The new style flag
GrabFocusTransient is on by default (I think it should be the same as
GrabFocus i.e. on for ClickFocus only) so that would explain any
transient windows getting focus on de-iconify.

Cheers,
Tim.

I just noticed that there is a problem with the Gnome panel and 
Gnome-enabled fvwm:

Changing the panel orientation from horizontal to vertical shrinks
the panel width to the correct value for vertical, but doesn't enlarge
the height, so you end up with part of the panel being drawn in a
small square. 

This does only happen for corner panels, edge panels work ok. 

If you use Gnome-ignorant fvwm, the panel makes its window override-redirect
and has no problems.

I haven't had time to try this with other Gnome-compliant wms, thus
I cannot say if it is a panel problem or a fvwm bug.

Further investigation showed that it doesn't occur any more if the
panel is converted to edge form and them back to corner form. Thus
it looks more like a panel problem to me. I'll report it as a Gnome
bug.

Subject: Problems running Citrix ICA Client
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Anybody running the Citrix ICA client under FVWM?  (This program allows
NT windows to be displayed on Unix.) 

We are seeing problems with xhost, fvwm2 and the Citrix ICA Client for
AIX version 2.70.76.  The AIX level is version 4.3.1. 

When you issue the command to start the ICA Manager:  
~> /usr/lib/ICAClient/wfica -desc 'wts10' & 
then the Citrix logo box appears 
then a connecting message line on the top line of box 
then a connected message line on the top line of box 
then a long wait of several minutes 
Finally, a a pop-up window appears with the error: 

Citrix ICA Client error 
49: Cannot connect to server "wts10"  
[QUIT] 

(Generally) If you change the xhost settings, (xhost + localhost +
wts10) you can connect. This doesn't make much since since the wfica
code is running locally and has already written to the display. 

>From what we've seen, the Citrix client code works fine on mwm, cde and
other window managers. 

We are running an old version of fvwm2.  I was waiting for the
"official" 2.0 version to be released but since that has happened I've
been swamped and haven't had any time to get it up and running.  This
Citrix problem maybe the reason I need to make time to get the latest
and greatest Fvwm. 

Thanks for any help, 
-Bill

I use it, but not with "-desc" on the command line.
If thats the X Server you are trying to identify, perhaps it
should be "wts10:0"?

Ditto to what Dan said; I use it on my Linux box at home and I have used
it on my Solaris and SunOS boxes at work, and I just run it as "wfica"
with no arguments (and $DISPLAY set).  Works fine with fvwm 2.2.  I
never tried it with earlier versions of fvwm.

I'm a little confused here the version of ICA I have says 
Usage: /usr/local/lib/ICAClient/wfica [options] [Connection File]
       -help                      Show this message.
       -desc <description>        Connection to use from Connection File.
       -description <description> Connection to use from Connection File.
       -file <connection_file>    Connection file to use.
       -protocolfile <filename>   Set alternative protocol file.
       -clientfile <filename>     Set alternative client configuration file.
       -nosplash                  Turn off the splash screen.
       -version                   Display version information.
       -icaroot <directory>       Set Location of Client Installation Files.
       -quiet                     Suppress Connection dialogs.
       Connection File  is a .ica connection file (similar to -file option).

so I can connect with one of the items I get from the menu
/usr/local/lib/ICAClient/wfica -desc "NT"

now unless wts10 is one of your menu items then it won't work.  I don't
do an xhost for the other machine but my display is set to jojo:0.0 and
i do have an xhost +jojo set.

ICA works with this setup under 2.0.46 2.1.x 2.2 (2.3.x betas)

You might want to check out there web site and make sure you have a
current client. I had some trouble with displaying the client with some
older versions right now I'm using 3.00.20 Citrix ICA Client for Solaris

I have hacked the script a bit to include the first line of the log message
in the Subject: header.  Hopefully this will help things a bit.  (Hopefully
it will actually work; the whole thing is a rather nasty hack.)

Hi All,
	FvwmIdent and FvwmScroll are now capable of following the colours
specified by the DefaultColors command in fvwm if you don't specify any
colours in their configurations.

What I'd like to do now is to expand the DefaultColors command to be
able to specify the background as a pixmap/gradient.  I'm no good at
parsing or designing syntax so I'd like some suggestions (preferably in
C).

What I'm thinking of is something like the ButtonStyle syntax:

DefaultColors pink maroon -- (TiledPixmap weird.xpm)

I don't know what the -- is for or why there are parens around stuff,
maybe it shouldn't be there.

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Tim.

I'll do it.  

Making a 2.2.1 with what we have is easy enough, BUT we should put some
effort into fixing the most egregious bugs -- those that crash FVWM. 

I went through the bug-tracker database, and found a number of crash
reports.  

HOWEVER, many, many, of these reports have been moved into the file
"fixed" without a note to indicate how or when it was fixed.  This makes
it more than a little difficult to track down and apply to the 2.2 branch. 

May I suggest the following:

  1. add a note to the report *every time* you move it to another folder

  2. if you commit anything to CVS to fix it, stick the PR# in the
     ChangeLog

  3. if a report comes in that has *already* been fixed in CVS, 
     attach a note to the report giving the changelog entries of the
     fix (or at least note the commit date so that one can track down the
     fix later)


Of course, that's for the future.

For the present, can I ask you to scan the "fixed" folder for crash
reports that *you* moved in there, and figure out what the fix was?  Feel
free to backport the fix to the 2.2 branch if you like.  If not, email me
all the details: what caused the bug, how it was fixed, and the commit
times, and I'll dig through CVS to find the patch.

If we release a 2.2.1 without doing this, we're liable to get:

    (a) a whole bunch of reports for bugs that have already been fixed
and
    (b) a reputation for not fixing bugs!


Thanks in advance.

	All of these are in the 2.2 release.

I looked at the man page, and found a notice that dates from 2.0.47d: 

	NOTICE
	       FvwmAudio has been superceded by FvwnEvent and is no longer
	       supported. Please start using FvwmEvent as soon as possible.


Then I searched the mailing list archives, and found a discussion from the
end of July/98 about dropping FvwmAudio.  It seems that FvwmAudio was
dropped in 2.0.47c.  Three days later 2.0.47d came out with FvwmAudio
restored.

As far as I can see, the issue was that FvwmEvent did not support being
aliased.  To quote Dan E:

	FvwmEvent doesn't support being invoked with an optional second
	argument as a substitute to being sym-linked.

	The code to do so is quite simple, if argc = 7, use argv[6] as the
	program name.  FvwmForm is a good example.

	<http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9807/msg00000.html>


Now, it looks to me like FvwmEvent never *did* get this code added!  It
also looks like it is a simple matter of inserting two lines in main():

    if ((s=strrchr(argv[0], '/')))      /* strip path */
        s++;
    else                                /* no slash */
        s = argv[0];
+   if (argc>=7)                        /* if override name */
+       s = argv[6];                    /* use arg as name */


Is that really all it takes?

If so, how about we make the change, ditch FvwmAudio, and fix up
sample.fvwm2rc not to refer to it anymore?

I have no objections. Of course users shouldn't be required to
completely rewrite their config, so if there is a simple way
like aliasing FvwmEvent to FvwmAudio...

It's more likely to have something to do with the icon-label-raising
stuff. Matthias, any ideas?

Yes! Don't use that horrible syntax. It's totally unintuitive, hard
to remember and so on. Using positional parameters with cryptic syntax
should be in the past. Two suggestions:

 - DefaultColors pink pixmap weird.xpm

 - DefaultColors pink maroon
   DefaultBackgroiund pixmap weird.xpm

I'd prefer the second version.

Oh, I forgot in my previous mail: I was thinking abount putting this
gradient/pixmap stuff in the library. No use to have the same parsing
and drawing code at n different places. If you like to make a shot at
rewriting this, feel free.

Has anybody an idea why I get these errors when clicking on window buttons;
the buttons don't work. The title area does.

I have only added 

  if (IS_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win))
    {
      SET_ICON_ENTERED(Tmp_win,1);
      DrawIconWindow (Tmp_win);
    }


to HandleEnterNotify and 

  if (Tmp_win && IS_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win))
    {
      SET_ICON_ENTERED(Tmp_win,0);
      DrawIconWindow (Tmp_win);
    }


to HandleLeaveNotify. I can't see this influencing focus anyhow.
Maybe the NoWarp changes had a bad influence somewhere ?

Good point.

I believe that a symlink FvwmAudio -> FvwmEvent would do the trick.  I can
do the Makefile magic, but I can't test it, as I have no way to play
sounds...

At least I know why the buttons didn't work now: It was a Scroll lock 
without IgnoreModifiers gotcha. Still no idea about the Xlib error though.
I didn't happen again after a restart so far.

I don't have an exact date, but this could have been happening
for more than 2 weeks.  I wouldn't normally notice it.

I have noticed it as well for about a week, but haven't been able to
determine the cause so I haven't tracked it down yet.  Could it be
something to do with the GC changes??

	Hmm...now that you mention it, I've occasionally spotted these in my
console logs lately. I've not noticed them as they were happening, only
some time later, so I don't know what actions they were associated with.

	Ah, scrolling back through my xconsole, I see a couple:

Xlib: sequence lost (0x102f9 > 0x2fb) in reply type 0xc!
Xlib: sequence lost (0x10455 > 0x457) in reply type 0xc!

	There've been a couple of restarts since then, so I'd guess these
happened a couple of days ago.

	I don't think this error is related to your button problem, but I have
no idea what I was doing when these occurred. I don't recall anything
weird happening that might have been related to the errors.

	I'll kill xconsole and start a new one, and try to keep a closer watch
on it. If anyone else has seen this, and knows how to cause it to
happen, please tell.

If you're not running FvwmIdent, FvwmScroll or FvwmAnimate then it won't
be. The changes I did to fvwm went in ages ago and were most changes
from:
XFreeGC();
XCreateGC();
to:
XChangeGC();

Could you do a cvs update -D "various dates" to find out when it
started?

Cheers,
Tim.

I haven't seen the messages, but if you can run "contool" instead of
"xconsole", its easy to configure "contool" to take a specific action
based on the message content.  (For example, playing a sound file, or
deiconifying when this message occurs.)

I'm running only FvwmPager and FvwmButtons, and I see the messages, also.

In order to apply a fix for 2.2.1, I looked at the tags:

        version-2_3_1                   (revision: 1.5)
        version-2_3_0                   (revision: 1.5)
        branch-2_2                      (branch: 1.5.2)
        version-2_2                     (revision: 1.5)
        version-2_2_0                   (revision: 1.5)
        version-2_1_13                  (revision: 1.5)

Seeing this, I assume that "branch_2_2" is the right thing to checkout.
I did that, but as I went to update the NEWS file, I see that there is
no post-2.2 news.

I know bug fixes don't normally appear as NEWS, but I have 2 questions.

1. Was this the right branch to check out?

2. Don't we need a little more than the ChangeLog to explain whats
in the 2.2.1 release?

Yes.  Note I greatly expanded the stuff in cvs.html and in DEVELOPERS
a while back describing how this works and the naming conventions we
(appear to be :) using.

If, at the time of release, there's nothing NEWS-worthy then typically I
put a note in the NEWS file that says something like "Bug fixes--see the
ChangeLog entries".

I think that's sufficient, myself.

Believe it or not, I read cvs.html.  You've added a lot of great stuff.
Whats confusing is that you check out 2.2, but you really have 2.2.1.

Agreed.  I added one entry.

Wish I had remembered about the automake/autoconf version difference...

Yes, that's because the _branch_ is 2.2, but the tagged points on the
branch are 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, etc.

If you check out a version like 2.2.1 (if it existed), then you'd get
exactly that version and update would do nothing (just like if you
checked out 2.3.1 on the main branch).

But if you check out a _branch_ like 2.2, then you always get the latest
code in the 2.2.x series and can update to later code in the 2.2.x
series, just like if you check out the main branch.

Does this make sense?

I can test this if someone sends me a configuration for FvwmAudio
(I never used it myself).

I wanted to make a profiling session on fvwm soon, but I don't have the

Any hints for me?

The old behavior of fvwm was that all new windows got focus anyway
when in ClickToFocus mode, wasn't it?

GrabFocusTransient is most useful for MouseFocus and SloppyFocus -- it
allows you to type Alt-F in Netscape, say, and then immediately enter
your search string in the popup window.  Without GrabFocusTransient,
you'd have to move the mouse first which kind of defeats the purpose
of a keyboard shortcut.

GrabFocus shouldn't be applied when an application is de-iconified,
only if it's newly created.

Jason,

  Dave is right, our online fvwm2 man page is seriously out of date.
I know the script I wrote to generate this stuff is a little primitive.

  I'll see if I can't put something a little cleaner together, if
you promise to run it...

Another thing we need to be sure gets into 2.2.1, but I can't remember
if it is, is that in 2.2 if you didn't have a C++ compiler the configure
script would fail.  That's bad.

Did that get fixed?

Jason,

  As I threatened earlier,  I've updated the run_man2html.sh script
to do a better job.

  I was going to commit it to the 2.2.1 branch, but the way its written,
it doesn't need to be there.

  If you take the copy now in 2.3.2 and run it like this:

run_man2html.sh dir_where_2_2_source_is dir_where_you_want_the_html

we should be in good shape.

  This does not handle the NEWS, FAQ, and TODO files, they still
need to be done individually using txt2html.sh.

  By the way,  the subject  lines look  much better with  your  latest
adjustment.  I just have to remember that the  first line of the change
text should be the most descriptive line of the overall change.

IIRC, this won't work right now... It could probably be made to work,
but I'm pretty sure that there's at least a little bit of twiddling
that needs to be done to convert from the above to something that'd
work in FvwmEvent... The situation's not helped by a couple
documentation errors in the manpage, which are remnants from FvwmAudio
I think, that are no longer true of FvwmEvent... Most importantly in
the above, the PlayCmd doesn't exist... You now need to do something
like

FvwmEventCmd Exec exec audioplay

And there's simply no equivalent to FvwmAudioDir...

This is all based on memories from a couple months ago... I submitted
a documentation patch way back to fix all these doco bugs, but it
seems to have been dropped or partially applied.

Hmmm.  I rebuild these things for every new release, but it seems I left
out the main page (!).

#!/usr/local/bin/zsh

This will need updating for new modules, of course.

I'll check out the 2.2 branch and rebuild this.

BTW, the worst part of man2html is that the manpage has to be installed
before it works.  This isn't a terribly big deal for me but it is annoying.

I see that it just changed; I was just in the process of updating the
script I use to do this; now I don't have to.

Unfortunately this script is broken big time for me; no /bin/find, no
/bin/cut.  And it produces names like FvwmAudio.1.html instead of
FvwmAudio.html.

I'll have time to mess with it in an hour or son.

Hmm.  I didn't realize 'man' would take a path and render the page directly
from that file.  I think this is heavily OS dependent (which is fine with
me, honestly, but it didn't work on the Perl version I use across all of my
platforms).

OK.

I'm just being compulsive with using full paths.  Are find and cut in
your path?  If so, the fix should be easy.

The "cut" is needed to get the man page names to not include the ".1".

No, "man" won't take a full path.  The new script creates /tmp/man/man3
and puts each page it finds there, and exports MANPATH=/tmp/man.
It cleans this up when its done.

I'm not sure what you mean about running this script for every new
release.  Probably we should only run this against non-beta releases,
unless we create "production" and "lastest beta" man pages...

Right now, I assumed we would want to run this for 2.2.

Yes I can, (if I had thought of it).

The script now just invokes   "nroff -man", doesn't use /tmp,  invokes
find and cut without a  full path, and doesn't  put that extra ".1" in
the file names.

I guess we treat "leaving window x" as "entering root (or another)
window"... ie it is enough to handle focus changes in the enternotify
handler.

BTW, to whoever's handling 2.2.1, the current version of
fvwmrc_convert should go in it ;)

That would be OK by me.  (Feel free to send me ID/passwd
PGP-encrypted.)  At the moment, I am still working through 2.2
Debian problems (there were a lot of them, you may recall, most of
which have thankfully turned out to be non-problems) and haven't even
looked at 2.3.  But that would come soon, I hope.

I can produce these more or less repeatably by moving and lowering a window

Xlib: sequence lost (0x128ea > 0x28ec) in reply type 0xc!

diffing in xlib source revealed that reply type is Expose
and the error message is produced if the condition

 dpy->request - dpy->last_request_read < 2^16

is violated. Now don't ask me what this means or how we could
cause it. Perhaps we are producing tons of exposes without reading them
off the queue ? 

Btw I also get these error messages for reply type 0x0 (that is: Error)

DE> I'm just being compulsive with using full paths.

I usually am, too.  But then different operating systems like to put things
all over the place, so for portable scripts I end up setting $PATH to the
collection which works on all of the various platforms I have to use.

DE> Are find and cut in your path?  If so, the fix should be easy.

Yes.

DE> The "cut" is needed to get the man page names to not include the ".1".

Hmmm.  I guess I've been using zsh way too long; doing stuff like that is
an expansion:

XYX:epithumia:~> i=blah.1; echo ${i%.1} 
blah

DE> No, "man" won't take a full path.

On Linux it does:

XYX:epithumia:~/fvwm/fvwm> man fvwm2.1
No manual entry for fvwm2.1

XYX:epithumia:~/fvwm/fvwm> man ./fvwm2.1

       fvwm2 - F(?) Virtual Window Manager (version 2.xx) for X11

Well, every "release" release.  I.e. not testing or beta releases, at least
after 2.2 came out.  Before then I did run it for every beta but now
there's not much point.
