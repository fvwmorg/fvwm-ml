OK.

This doesn't have to delay 2.4.

I still think fvwm should only have 1 FAQ.

I think we should release the last candidate beta 2.3.32 now.

And set the exact date of 2.4.0 release to be sure we don't postpone it
any more. Maybe May 10 or 15?

I don't have critical problems which may stop the new stable release.
There is a report of Olivier about MouseFocus, which I can reproduce.
If possible it could be carefully fixed before 2.4.0.

I myself get PositiveWrite failed timeout in some theme switches. I will
see if I can narrow the problem. If no, this may be fixed in 2.4.1+ or/and
I will do a workaround for this in fvwm-themes.

If we compare to other software, FVWM has a good quality, size, speed and
functionality.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Rats.  I _knew_ there was something I was supposed to do last night; I
saw Dan's message about 2.4 and wanted to retest it at home, but I
forgot.

OK, let me try to do that on my work system (I have to stop my Gnome
environment and start X using my old environment to test it out at
work).

Someone here should assert ownership of the freshmeat FVWM page; after
the re-org it's owned by N/A.

I can do it, or someone else can (probably should be an FVWM developer);
it doesn't matter.  You need to have a freshmeat account to do so.

I think Dominik had this problem before?

Anyway, I just upgraded to the very latest stuff and did a completely
clean build.  The compile failed in FvwmGtk:

  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../fvwm/modules/FvwmGtk -I../.. -I../../../fvwm  -I/usr/X11R6/include     -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2 -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib/glib/include -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2 -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib/glib/include -I/usr/X11R6/include     -g -O2 -c ../../../fvwm/modules/FvwmGtk/FvwmGtk.c
  ../../../fvwm/modules/FvwmGtk/FvwmGtk.c:36: gdk_imlib.h: No such file or directory


This is on a Debian GNU/Linux woody (testing) distribution, with the
standard Debian GNOME 1.4 packages installed (not the Ximian packages).

I have the imlib and imlib-dev packages installed, and the libgtk1.2 and
libgtk1.2-dev packages installed.

I also have the gdk-imlib (gdk-imlib1) package installed, but apparently
I also need the gdk-imlib-dev package, which I currently don't have.

I think we'll need to test for the gdk_imlib.h file separately, since it
appears that on at least one major distribution it's packaged separately
from anything else we test for when deciding whether to install FvwmGtk.

I think you mean the N/A thats here:

 =A0FVWM
=A0by N/A - Friday, December 4th 1998 20:07 EST

I don't see how to change that.
I didn't think that was the owner, I was able to update information
without any problem.

I'm playing with the very latest FVWM, and I see the following weird
behavior.

I am running the "unclutter" program, which hides the X cursor after
some amount of mouse inactivity (5 seconds or so).

  ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/unclutter-8.tar.Z

Among other places.

Whenever the cursor is hidden, the window that currently has focus loses
focus, and in fact no window then has focus as far as I can tell.  Not
only does the border turn to "unfocused", but even the application
thinks that it doesn't have focus.

I have to move the mouse so that it hits the window border before focus
comes back; just nudging it so the cursor reappears doesn't fix it.

This pretty much completely breaks unclutter :)

I think this must have just happened within the last few days, because
I've not noticed this behavior before.

FYI there are some lingering debug statements left in
event.c:HandleLeaveNotify().

I really would recommend people take a look at the debugging macros,
etc. I added in libs/fvwmlib.h.  It would (I think) save a lot of
wear-and-tear on the CVS archive, with people checking in debugging code
accidentally, then having to go back and remove it again, etc.

What you could do instead is use the debugging library, and set the
debug level for your messages to something appropriately large, then
_leave_ the debugging messages in the code.  You don't have to worry
about removing them and even re-adding them later if something goes
wrong there again.

OK, I've restarted my system in "non-GNOME" mode using the latest code.

On my work system I cannot reproduce the FvwmAuto raise problem
(although as you see I did find a few other problems :).

However, my work system (PII800, 256M) is significantly faster than my
home system (PII450, 128M).  So, I will try to reproduce it at home
tonight just to be sure.

Something else must be at play.
I've been using unclutter for years and its still working for me.

I think you've previously reported using FvwmAuto right?

Still that doesn't do it for me either.

The unclutter invisible window is override redirect...

When did you last update your FVWM?

There were some changes just made this last night/this morning...

  de> I think you've previously reported using FvwmAuto right?

Yes.

  de> The unclutter invisible window is override redirect...

I didn't change anything in my ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc, I just installed the
latest FVWM (and restarted X of course).

Yes, and I missed them, sorry.
It doesn't work for me either.
I'm not using FvwmAuto.

Thanks.  Done.

I wonder if I'll ever get the hang of these guis?

Dominik, you applied that patch, but also added this:

  if (!(sf = get_focus_window()) || HAS_MOUSE_FOCUS(sf))
  {
    DeleteFocus(1);
  }

around line 1880, that causes the problem Paul and I see with
unclutter.

And as Paul reported, you left some debug stuff too.

I can still reproduce this problem on my system here at home.  It
appears to be somewhat timing related.

Note I can never make it happen by selecting a window from the
windowlist, for example.  I think that's because doing so warps the
mouse to the upper-left corner, which "fixes" the problem.

It has to be a deiconify command.  I can make it happen both with and
without FvwmAnimate active: I just have to click mouse-2 on an icon to
de-iconify it.

...

OK, I think I have more details.  If I have mouse-2 bound to my
Iconify-and-Compact function:

  AddToFunc Iconify-and-Compact
  +       "C" Iconify
  +       "C" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

  Mouse 2         I       A       Function Iconify-and-Compact

then I see this behavior.  It's very easy to reproduce; create an icon
box like "IconBox 2 -20 -1 -1", for example (I don't use any of the
module icon managers, just the builtin IconBox).  Now place an xterm over
the icon box.  Then iconify the xterm.  Then click mouse-2 on the
xterm's icon in such a way that the window will appear underneath your
mouse cursor when it de-iconifies, even if you don't move it (the mouse).

If I change mouse-2 to run just "Iconify", I can't make it happen
anymore.

So, maybe this behavior is no longer supported?  It used to work until
fairly recently; someone on the workers list suggested it (although I
checked and it's not listed in the FAQ).

If we can come to consensus on this, and the unclutter problem and the
configure check for gdk_imlib.h are fixed, then as far as I'm concerned
2.4 is a go.

Full_Name: Marc-Jano Knopp
Version: 2.3.31
CVS_Date: 
OS: GNU/Linux 2.4.2
X_Server: XFree86 4.0.2
Submission from: (NULL) (145.253.20.218)


As I am lazy, I defined a few useful key+mouse bindings
a few years ago (fvwm 1.xx). One of these bindings is:

  Mouse   1       WTFS    M       Move
  (Press [Alt] and then mouse button 1 anywhere inside a
   window to move it)

Besides the desired effect of not having to point exactly
to the title bar to move a window, moving windows is notably
FASTER than the normal way of moving it by dragging
its title bar.

This is true for

  - vtwm
  - fvwm 1.xx
  - fvwm 2.2.4
  - fvwm 2.2.5
  - probably ALL window managers

but NOT for fvwm 2.3.31.

Moving windows using Alt-Mouse 1 inside a window is as
slow as moving it by dragging the title bar :-(


The symptom of slow (actually jerky) window movement
when using the title bar is maybe due to masking
the mouse cursor over the background for some reason,
although that would not be necessary, as the standard
mouse cursor should only extend to the right and to
the bottom, i.e. over the window, and NOT over the
background.  An evidence for this assumption is that
Alt-Mouse 1 lets you move windows smoothly only when
the pointer had a certain minimum distance to the
border before you clicked button 1. If the pointer
is too close to the border, then even using Alt-Mouse 1
for moving windows is jerky.

This is true for both hardware and software cursors
(configured via the appropriate XFree86 option).

So here are my requests/suggestions:

1) _PLEASE_ fix that bug! (It is one, isn't it? Don't
   tell me it _has_ to be that way, coz then I won't
   see another day :-(

2) While you're at it, could you also try to think of
   a way of fixing this behavior for normal window
   movement (by using the title bar)? There seems to
   be no reason for this behavior, it is most likely
   a bug - but maybe in XFree86...

It gives me strange feelings to see that Windows 98
lets me move windows very smoothly... although not
synch'ed to the VBI (just like Linux/X :-(


Best regards,

  Marc-Jano

No, he didn't have imlib problems. This problem was only on distributions
with separate imlib and gdk-imlib packages.

FvwmGtk may be installed without imlib (actually gdk-imlib) support.
I fixed the gdk-imlib detection, please retest.

I didn't create an rpm for 2.3.31, because it had 2 problems fixed later.
We also recently did several changes (including configure), which
are risky to include into 2.4.0 without more testing.

We need a final candidate 2.3.32.
Dan, can you build it now? If no, I may do it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

If my now you mean in the next 5 hours, no.

I've been resisting creating another candidate release because
we don't seem to see a flow of problem reports coming in
from these releases.  I'd guess a lot of users using betas just
go for CVS or nightly snapshots.

I feel like the next release we build should be 2.4 but I
wouldn't object to anyone else doing it.

The only thing I think we should do is rerun our tests
one more time before 2.4.

Ok, so I am building it now. Hopefully the last one.

I think there are tens times more users using beta releases (tarballs,
rpms, debs or what is available) than ones using CVS or nightly builds.

Hello,

fvwm-ewmh is almost ready. I will send  the announcement that
follow to the world when FVWM 2.4.0 or 2.3.32 will be released 
(if there is no serious objection). I do not know if it is better to do
the announce with 2.4.0 or soon with 2.3.32.
Oops, fvwm-2.3.32 has been released, during I wrote this mail.
The download links at the home page are not active, however,
if you want to test fvwm-ewmh you can download a pre-version at:

http://fvwm-ewmh.sourceforge.net/testing/

you just have to use the 2.3.32 tarball and follow the instructions
given in the README or at the home page.

Any suggestions or comments are really welcome.

Regards, Olivier

Subject: fvwm-ewmh-0.1 is released

I am glad to announce the first version of fvwm-ewmh.

fvwm-ewmh is constituted by a module, FvwmNetHints, and a patch
against  the last stable FVWM version/candidate: fvwm-2.3.32/2.4.0.
With these FVWM can handle Extended Window Manager Hints from the
freedesktop group.
This allows, for example, to run FVWM with KDE version 2. 
 
This package is alpha, however, it works not so bad on my machine.

Home Page (Download, Installation, Running, FAQ):
    http://fvwm-ewmh.sourceforge.net/

This is a suprise to me. Seems like a serious work.
I guess we should just include FvwmNetHints module and patch FvwmPager.
Including a module, which does not need a configure support is as simple
as adding one word in modules/Makefile.am.

I probably can't test the functionality for some time, I don't have KDE2.

Mikhael.

The disk on ftp.fvwm.org is full, but I think Jason will fix that.
If this happens in 24 hours, please someone update the web pages.

At any rate, the 2.3.32 tarballs are here for now:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/tmp/

I also created rpm packages for RedHat 6 and 7 distros in the usual place.

Unbinding a key by supplying the command "-" to a key binding command
only seems to fully take effect for new windows created after unbinding
the key.  The original effect of the key binding is removed for all
windows, but the key doesn't seem to be passed through to any of the
existing windows.

I warn the fvwm-workers a few weeks a ago:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0104/msg00141.html

but maybe I was not clear. Also, I was not sure that I will finish
the work at all (but it was so funny to see kicker respecting all my desire;
on the other hand kdesktop is really a problem).

I am not sure that we have to include fvwm-ewmh in FVWM now. Maybe,
we can include it in the 2.4.x series. The reasons are:
- We should not do anything that delays 2.4.0
- fvwm-ewmh needs some change to fvwm2 source codes (for the (mini)icons
functionality and for applications of Desktop type). 
- The FvwmPager patch is a bit sensible: there is a "big" change to the
windows stacking Pager code.
- In fact, FvwmNetHints needs a change to the configure procedure: the
FVWM configure procedure define IMLIB if it found the gdk imlib as
FvwmNetHints needs only the imlib (this save a lot of memory).
- The code and the man page are really alpha.

There is one functionality that does not need any "compliant" applications
and that you may found funny.
If you use:

*FvwmNetHints: SendMiniIcon All
*FvwmNetHints: MiniIconSize w h

Then, all your mini icons (from the MiniIcon Style option) will have size wxh.

    - fvwm 2.3.31

For me there is indeed a noticeable difference (moving an rxvt
window with an xpm background).

Fvwm does not draw the mouse cursor itself.  This is the task of
X11.  If there is a performance problem, then it has to be fixed
in X.  In general, moving windows with 2.3.x is slower than
previous versions because fvwm does more things in the motion
loop than in the past.

I can verify this, but as I said before, there is nothing we can
do about it since the responsible code is not part of fvwm.

There are a number of things that affect the speed of window
movement.  First, the geometry window in the center of the screen
obscures parts of the moved window which slows things down.  You
can put this window in the top left corner of the screen with

  Emulate Fvwm

Or disable it completely with

  HideGeometryWindow Move

Second, try to turn the BackingStore and SaveUnders features on
and off.  Most modern graphics cards can write data much faster
than read it, so it's often better to let the application redraw
the obscured area than let the X server cache it.  Try

  Style * BackingStoreOff, SaveUnderOff

and

  Style * BackingStore, SaveUnder

and see which gives you better performance.  The default setting
depends on the X server (XFree 3 does backing store per default,
XFree 4 does not).  Next, all drawing directives to the X server
go over the network.  To make sure the packets are delivered
locally on your machine, set your DISPLAY variable appropriately:

  export DISPLAY=":0.0"

Do *not* put a host name in front of the ':'.  If you do, packets
are actually sent over the network adapter (if you have one).
Other reasons for jerky movement can be Snap Attraction and
paging during movement.  Turn them off explicitly if you don't
need these features:

  SnapAttraction 0

and

  EdgeThickness 0

to disable paging completely, or

  EdgeResistance 10000 <any value>

to disable only paging during window movement.  Another thing you
could try is to disable the mouse cursor during window movement:

  CursorStyle Move None

or if you want it only for Alt-Button1:

  AddToFunc MoveWithoutCursor
  + I CursorStyle Move None
  + I Move
  + I CursorStyle Move

  Mouse   1       WTFS    M       Function MoveWithoutCursor

Also, it may help to use only simple, flat decorations on the
title bars, buttons and borders to keep redraws simple.

The reason is probably that some day in the past the X consortium
decided that X was good enough and did not need much improvement
anymore while M$ kept tuning their system :-(  And then, many
graphics adapters don't have good drivers for XFree.  I have been
using the non-accelerated SVGA driver for ages now.

Hope this helps

Please don't make it a requirement, though; I truly dislike having to
compile all sorts of extra things for something that should be pretty
simple.

Version: 2.3.32

When icons are focused on via the keyboard (e.g., binding 'Next [Iconic] Focus'
to a key sequence), the icon title expands (as expected), but when focus leaves
via the keyboard, the icon title stays expanded instead of contracting or
retracting or whatnot.  This doesn't appear to happen when focus enters and
leaves via the mouse.

With the most recent cvs I see this too, and also the icon title appears
to remain in the topmost layer above all other windows.

I only meant that we need to autoconfigure support for both, not only one.
You will be able to turn them off, like it is possible with xpm now.

Really, I'm fully aware of these macros, but they do not match my
needs.  Whenever I have a touch problem to debug, I throw dozens
of fprintfs all over the code.  If I left them in I would get
thousands of messages later when debugging other bugs.  I am
missing a way to select only the debug output for a specific
problem.

What about the more esoteric features of the spec like unicode
icon titles?  The spec demands that the window manager provides a
unicode window title even if the application did not.

Believe it or not, it *is* the problem ;-)  But what I said was not
100% correct.  "!Iconify" matches any string in title/class/resource
except "Iconify" of course.  I guess you did not try the lines I
wrote.  They do work as expected.

Right.  I wasn't correct, but that does not mean the lines do not
work.

The Tzafrir's problem is stopping circulation, not incorrect windows in
circulation.

Your lines work of course, but only if there are no windows on the way
that do not accept focus, like FvwmPager, as I wrote in my messages.

If you want to reproduce the Tzafrir's problem, execute in FvwmConsole:

  Style xclock CirculateHit
  Exec exec xclock
  # Yes, conditions are not correct, just to show they are not the problem
  Key Tab         A       M       Next (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus
  Key Tab         A       MS      Prev (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus

Regards,
Mikhael.

Nothing about unicode is implemented (yet ?) in fvwm-ewmh. This does
not cause problems with applications that I known and which respect the
spec.

This works perfectly for me:

  key f6 w s move

(hit shift-f6 over a shell window, the move cursor appear)

  key f6 w s -

(hit shift-f6 over a shell window, the escape sequence is printed
into the window)

Please provide an example that shows the symptom.  As a last
resort you can use the Recapture command to redo all key and
mouse bindings on all windows.

No, that's not expected at all.  Expanding the title should only
occur when the pointer enters the icon, it has nothing to do with
the focus.  It never occured to me that this could be useful.  Can
you please strip down your config file as much as possible so that
this still happens and send it along with step by step
instructions so that I can try to reproduce it here?  The simple
binding you gave does not show the bug for me.

I'd expect problems with the desktop environment, not with the
applications.  I'm not a big fan of that unicode "feature" in the
spec anyway.  The corresponding paragraph in the spec can be
interpreted like this:

  The window manager should implement unicode window titles.  If
  it does not, it must implement unicode window titles instead.

The spec forces the window manager to translate eight bit
characters to unicode.  I reported this to the list along with
other inconsistencies in the spec several months ago, but nobody
seems to care :-(

Hi folks,

'make install-strip' fails due to the perl scripts. Could you please
check?


Many thanx

Basically this is true, but in practice, IMHO, this is not a problem:
1. The ewmh spec is build on the ICCCM draft.
2. The client (application) should set _NET_WM_NAME (utf-8 encoding), this
is not a problem for the wm. 
3.  "*if* the Window Manager displays a window name other than
_NET_WM_NAME the Window Manager MUST set  _NET_WM_NAME_VISIBLE
to the title displayed in UTF-8 encoding.", So: 

  A desktop environment, should see if _NET_WM_NAME_VISIBLE
  is set, if not set then it has to look at  _NET_WM_NAME and if this
  one too is not set  then the desktop env should respect the ICCCM and
  use the usual WM_NAME. Of course KDE do that.

4. An application should set WM_NAME, and the wm can use it (we just
have to do not say that to the free desktop group :o).

The situation is the same with icon name, so it seems to me that a wm can
be ewmh compliant without using utf-8 encoding. There is also the
 _NET_NET_DESKTOP_NAMES which use utf-8 string, but it is clearly say
in the spec. that this is not an important thing (but I've got problems with
KDE here :o) for an other reason I think)

Any way, I am interested by the utf 8 stuff. It is a good solution for
supporting all the languages. So, maybe I will implement the utf-8 part
of the spec. in the future. At the present time I have to take a look at
the different C libraries available. Any suggestion is welcome.

Yes, there are problems in the spec., there are also good ideas and
things that I do not like (e.g., Desktop applications implementation).
Also, the spec. is young and there is only one "full" implementation
of it. So, we may hope that version 2 will be good enough. And it
seems to me that the current version is "OK" for an implementation.

This is a feature of autoconf/automake, it fails for any shell script.
If you take a look at INSTALL.fvwm it recommends "make -k install-strip".

I moved this bug to "no fix" section.

Mikhael.

    When had this changed?  Fvwm 2.2.4 had this behaviour at least with
AnotherLevel (i.e. the icon title shown expanded while the icon had
focus)...  and the users got accustomed to it.

Yes, that's absolutely correct.  As long as the pointer stays over
the icon, the title is not collapsed.

Ah, yes, now I can see it too.  Thanks for the nice instructions.
Somehow fvwm misses that the pointer leaves the icon.  I will try
to fix that.  BTW, the expanded titles are indeed above all other
windows.  The purpose behind this to improve their visibility.

Hm, now that you say it, I can vaguely remember.  Expanding the
title when the pointer is over the icon was introduced in 2.3.2.
I guess there is some relation to the new feature.

Hello,
I do not know if we have to take care of that now.
Moreover, this problem is maybe a bug of the applications
and not a FVWM bug (I do not know).
Here the problem.
Say that we have a NeverFocus window A and a window B with the
focus (say SloppyFocus and ClickToFocusClickRaise).
Now if I pop up (and pop down) a menu of the window A (override redirect),
then some times: 
   (i) window B lost the keyboard input (always happen if A is a qt app)
   (ii) I cannot raise window B by clicking inside it (tested with Xemacs)

But with fvwm-themes at least, Alt-Tab warps the pointer to the window,
allowing free movement of the mouse to other windows and desks/pages,
while the icon title remains still expanded and raised?
In other words it doesn't collapse until it is mouse'd over again. And
moving the pointer into a thusly raised icon title then raises the icon
to the topmost layer too. If you just leave the icon normally with mouse
movement, it behaves normally. It is only moving the pointer from the
icon via a keyboard event.

    AFAIK, the most ubiquitous charset conversion library is libiconv.  GNU
libiconv is available at
http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-libiconv.html .

    If you wish to *display* utf8 strings, there is a Xutf8* family by Bruno
Haible in XFree86 >= 4.0.2, but these are experimental and their inclusion
caused great scandal in i18n@xfree86.org (CJK people disliked this interface
very much).

I had already given up trying to reproduce this but then I got it
too.  This problem seems to be a specific xterm problem:

 1) Make the settings above.
 2) Start an xterm.
 3) Follow the procedure above.

==> Problem is there.

 1) Start an xterm.
 2) Make the settings above.
 3) Follow the procedure above.

==> everything is fine.

Use rxvt, aterm, Eterm or wterm instead of xterm and it works all
the time.  It seems that xterm looks at the key combinations that
are grabbed on its window by some other application upon startup
and ignores them even after they are unbound.  Let me think about
this.

Unfortunately this change nothing. I've not yet tested

With the following as my .fvwmrc file:

key f6 w s move
Key   F10       FTIWS   N       key f6 w s move
Key   F10       FTIWS   C       key f6 w s -

S-F6 initially works to move the window.  I then hit C-F10 and
S-F6 then does nothing, including not putting the escape sequence
into the xterm.  Hitting F10 will turn on the move-windows function,
and C-F10 again will cause the key to do nothing.

If however, I just have

Key   F10       FTIWS   N       key f6 w s move
Key   F10       FTIWS   C       key f6 w s -

Then S-F6 initially causes the xterm to print the escape sequences,
hitting F10 causes the move function to work, and hitting C-F10
causes the escape sequences to appear.

On the otherhand, as you suggested, if I have the following:

key f6 w s move
Key   F10       FTIWS   N       key f6 w s move
Key   F10       FTIWS   C       key f6 w s -
Key   F10       FTIWS   1       Recapture

Then turning off the move binding does not let the function key
through to the xterm, but doing a M-F10 to Recapture does fix it
so that the xterm sees the function key.

I tested these latest examples using fvwm-2.3.32 under RedHat 6.0
kernel 2.2.5-15 using Xnest and a .fvwmrc file with nothing but
what I listed above for each example.

I hope this helps isolate the problem.

It seems to be more than just an xterm problem.  I noticed when testing
with xev, that when I unbound the key, it would see a keypress for
F6 and the shift key, then it would get some extra focus events and
then a release for the shift key but no release for the F6 key.  I
also found that xemacs wouldn't see the function key after unbinding it.

Ok, thanks.  At least for now, the Recapture seems to work well enough.

I don't think this is a good change. We discussed this 2 years ago and
agreed (at least Dominik, Matthias and me) that leaving an icon should
collapse the icon title.

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9904/msg00609.html

The opposite behaviour is very annoying if you don't have other focusable
windows on a page just to shutdown that long icon title.

Dmitry, are you sure you prefer that old behavior? :)
I think we should restore the behavior we had for more than 2 years now.
We may have an option later if anyone really prefers another one.

Regards,
Mikhael.

    Well, in fact for *me* it doesn't matter -- I rarely use Iconify, since
multiple screens/desktops are better.  A quick poll between our personnel
shown that they simply don't realize the difference -- "Style * SloppyFocus",
so in presence of many windows on the screen both behaviours are very
similar.

    As I understand, the "new" behaviour is the same as in Win98/ME/2k --
those show yellow "tips" containing long titles when mouse enters the icon.
The only difference is that the "tips" are of different color and are
understood as such.  But this isn't important, so the current expand-when-
mouse-on-icon is good.

Ignore this, I can't reproduce it. It only happened after a restart from

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Attached is a patch to make FvwmEvent pass the window-id in hex. The
reason is that Fvwm uses hex when it expands $w so this makes matching
$w with FvwmEvent strings simpler (I used to have to use PipeRead "bash
-c '(( $w = $0 )) && echo got_it'").

Low priority so after 2.4 probably.

Cheers,
Tim.

Full_Name: Cameron Kerr
Version: 2.2.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: Slackware Linux 7.1
X_Server: XFree86 4.0.2
Submission from: (NULL) (203.96.111.200)


I would like to have a FvwmButton that responds to inputs from the scroll
wheel of my
mouse. I would like to use this to change the volume on my system. Idealy,
I would do
this my specifying the (Mouse 4) or (Mouse 5) option in the call to
FvwmButtons.

I know that FvwmButtons can accept such inputs, since if I scroll over a
button which
has no (Mouse X) option (let's say its a button to bring up the `top`
program), then I get
a whole lot of xterms running top starting to load.

If I specify (Mouse 4),  then the FvwmButton module fails to load.

I've currently got mouse 1 to lower the volume, and mouse 3 to increase the
volume, thusly,

*FvwmButtons(3x1, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec exec echo "vol Vol +" | smixer -s
-`,\
                  Action (Mouse 3) `Exec exec echo "vol Vol -" | smixer -s
-`)\
                  "Volume Up(M1)/Down(M3)"

Which works perfectly well, except that I can't scroll on it.

Thanks in advance.

Starting from 2.3.24 you may do the same for Mouse 4 and Mouse 5.
I have moved this bug to "existing enhancements" section.

This bug should be related to keyboard grab changes done on 2001-04-15.

Execute Move (or similar command) without a window-context, press Escape,
woops, the keyboard is locked. The mouse works, so hopefully you will be
able to Restart, which restores the keyboard.

Mikhael.

After choosing "Rebuild Sample 95" from a menu, configuring it and
restarting (via FvwmScript-Setup95) the following happens:

I don't know when this started.

  AddToFunc TestFunction I Wait "unexisting window"
  TestFunction

Now, click or drag using the mouse anywhere. Woops, mouse is mostly
locked. The keyboard works well (did I say something similar before?),
so you may quit this mode by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape.

I don't remeber anything :-)  I thought this awas changed by
accident.  I can easily disavble the fix if need be.

Partially.  The lockup was there for a long time, but fvwm did not
balance XGrabKeyboard versus XUngrabKeyboard calls, so it got
unlocked after a while.

That's not really new.  This was always the case if the function
used anything else but 'I'.  I don't know what to do about that.
The pointer must be grabbed during function execution for the
reasons I explained in the thread with Paul's deiconify problem.

I think something is going wrong. With this function everything seems
fine except when a window closes (ctrl-d in xterm). The application
window goes away but the fvwm frame remains. EscapeFunc causes the frame
to go away. I played around with this a bit and by running the function,
createing two windows, closing them, switching desks and hitting the key
that does EsacpeFunc I got the following core dump:

I use some weird functions driven by FvwmEvent to warp the pointer back
to the focussed window when a window dies which might have something to
do with it, I don't see the wait cursor like I should.

Cheers,
Tim.

I notice this about two months ago and really didn't think much about.
I usally build and the do make install-strip and all is well.  However I
have recentlly had trouble with FvwmAnimate.  When I runned the stripped
version I get:

FvwmAnimate: error in loading shared libraries: /home/bgiaccio/fvwm23/Linux/libexec/fvwm/2.3.33/FvwmAnimate: unsupported version 2 of Verneed record

This is on a stock redhat 6.2 system built on the box and run on it.
Now this may just be something I'm doing or its just a bug in glibc.
But if someone else could comfirm this before I try to track it down I
would appreciate it.

Brad

Hi developers,

Below is a small wording change to the README file that I think is appropriate.

By the way, I think section 5.1 of the FAQ should be modified to say that
you should make your changes against the latest CVS version of fvwm, and 
section 5.2 should be updated to say how to create patches with 'cvs diff -u'
instead of creating a .orig file. Would a patch that does this be accepted?

FWIW, I don't see this on my Debian woody (testing) systems.  I do run
FvwmAnimate.  I don't have any Red Hat systems handy.

Hello.

If you use fvwm2 and run Nautilus, bad focus stuff happens.. You won't
get any keyboard focus in the Nautilus window for instance. The Nautilus
people says it's an fvwm bug.. If anyone with knowledge of WM hints and
focus stuff could look at http://bugzilla.eazel.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8273
it would be great..

Version: cvs (May 8th)

I ran across something strange recently with FvwmPager. 

1. Set up the pager like so, and *without* mini icons:

    *FvwmPagerWindowColorsets 1 2
    *FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x7

2. Set up colorsets 1 and 2:

    *FvwmThemeColorset 1 fg white, bg lightblue, Pixmap
    *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg lightblue, bg navy, Pixmap

3. Start up the pager any way you want.

4. Move around windows, focusing them, unfocusing them, and so on.
   All the colors should be right.

5. Now, change the colorsets:

    *FvwmThemeColorset 1 fg red, bg pink, Pixmap
    *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg green, bg black, Pixmap

6. Move around the windows, focusing them, unfocusing them, and so on. 
   On the current viewport, everything is obviously okay.  

7. Now change the viewport (scroll left or right or up or down by
   100%, or change desktops).  
   
8. Now, change back to the original viewport.

9. Now move around the windows, focusing and unfocusing them.

Result: The unfocus windows colorset foreground for the pager has fallen 
back to the previous version (e.g., no longer red, but white).

If one restarts the pager, then the colorsets are correct no matter what 
one does, up until the colorsets change again.

I think I see this thread and I can't find where is explained why the
cursor grabbing is needed. What is the date of the message you mention?

This locked cursor behaviour is not good. Wait is mostly used in "I"
functions. It is used in many places, including fvwm-themes, FVWM FAQ.

In any case I think Wait command may have additional optional parameter
"timeout" and probably one more optional parameter "timeout-command".
And we should have a built-in command Break, which finishes a function,
it may be used in Wait's "timeout-command" or in conditional commands.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Maybe just pass a heximal id in PassId instead of additional PassHexId?
I think it is safe.

It sounds like the Nautilus developers have chosen to follow the
OpenLook model of focus management. That model is, IMO, just plain
broken. You might be able to improve the situation by using:

Style * Lenience

and maybe some other settings that I no longer recall. There was a
thread about this a while back -- I think Dominik came in with a
fairly final assessment.

I read the bug referenced in the URL, and also the bugs that _that_ bug
references, etc.

It seems pretty clear that the Nautilus guy is a reasonable fellow, and
he wants to do the right thing, but it also seems clear that he feels
the ICCCM "blesses" the behavior he's using.

As I understand it, he's trying to allow for drag'n'drop without
focusing the originating window (that is, if you have a window without
focus and you move the mouse over it (click to focus obviously) and
click and drag something out of the window somewhere else, he _doesn't_
want that window to get focus in that case.

Since no WM will do that "normally", he wants to do his own focusing
rather than let the WM do it.  Personally I think that's a hell of a lot
of extra work for a relatively minor feature, but there you go.

He believes that the ICCCM allows that if you mark your window as
WM_TAKE_FOCUS, then even if it's marked as not accepting input the WM
should still send it a focus event.  Then the code will assert focus, if
appropriate.

Here's a relevant passage from jsh@eazel.com in the response to bug
#7823:

  http://bugzilla.eazel.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7823

  My reading of the ICCCM is that if WM_HINTS.input is false, but
  WM_PROTOCOLS includes WM_TAKE_FOCUS, then the window manager should
  never focus the window itself - it should just send the window a
  WM_TAKE_FOCUS message

If that's not the right way to interpret this combination (or anyway we
don't _think_ it's the right way :), I think it would be good if folks
here who understand the issues had a conversation with him explaining
our interpretation, etc.

If there is no meeting of the minds, so be it: we can add a note to the
FAQ and/or some special new BugOpt for Nautilus, if that's reasonable,
but at least everyone will understand everyone else's position.

Hmm, my reading of ICCCM2 (finally took the time to find it) 4.1.7
agrees with their assessment.

http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#s-4.1.7

He's describing what ICCCM2 defines as "Globally Active" Input Model.
Ick, but if that's what they want...

Fine by me, I didn't want to upset anyone. Attached is a patch to do it,
[de]windowshade now returns a window-id too.

Maybe this is documented somewhere.  Set up some environment stuff, like
so:

  SetEnv fvwmdir ${HOME}/.fvwm
  SetEnv bindir $fvwmdir/bin

'Exec echo <blah>' should fully expand these variables, then.  However, 
this happens:

  Exec echo $fvwmdir
                ===> ${HOME}/.fvwm
  Exec echo $bindir
                ===> $fvwmdir/bin
  
The second one should be something like maybe '${HOME}/.fvwm/bin'.  Unless, 
of course, SetEnv's not supposed to expand environment variables.

Some more possibly strange things:

  SetEnv fvwmdir ${HOME}/.fvwm

  ImagePath /usr/share/icons
  ImagePath +:$fvwmdir/pixmaps

doesn't work either.  However, using

  SetEnv fvwmdir /home/viper/.fvwm

*does* work.

Use the notation:

Exec echo $[bindir]

Yes, in the man page. Enter /environment and press 'n' several times.
You will find everything you wanted to know, including the fact that only
3 commands ImagePath, ModulePath and Restart expand environment variables
$var and ${var} themselves, and for other commands $[var] should be used.

 if (Fw && !IS_LENIENT(Fw) &&
     Fw->wmhints && (Fw->wmhints->flags & InputHint) && !Fw->wmhints->input &&
     (sf = get_focus_window()) && sf->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk)

sf here "always" becomes null (i haven't seen it become anything else),
so the region you patched is "never" affected. If I add that
g_f_w()==NULL is ok, it becomes slightly better.. I mostly get focus..
but I can lose focus while moving the mouse within the window etc.. very
weird stuff.. It is alsy very laggy.. If I move the mouse in and out of
the window, it gets focus very randomly and can leave it in the wrong
state (nautilus having focus when I'm outside etc).

If I do 'Style * Lenience' it works perfectly.

I've checked the source for twm (from xf86/4.0.3) and it has some simple
stuff in there...

		if (Tmp_win->title_w && Scr->TitleFocus &&      /* 4 */
		    Tmp_win->wmhints && Tmp_win->wmhints->input)
		  SetFocus (Tmp_win, ewp->time);
		if (Scr->NoTitlebar && Scr->TitleFocus &&       /*4a */
		    Tmp_win->wmhints && Tmp_win->wmhints->input)
		  SetFocus (Tmp_win, ewp->time);
		if (Tmp_win->protocols & DoesWmTakeFocus)       /* 5 */
		  SendTakeFocusMessage (Tmp_win, ewp->time);
		Scr->Focus = Tmp_win;

And with twm it works perfectly too...

Also tested: sawfish and enlightenment with perfect results
blackbox - no input focus but it raises the window when the cursor is
inside the window...

/Tomas - confused and with lacking knowledge of ICCCM/focus stuff

I don't see anything wrong here, I suspect something in the Solaris
X library.

Both Purify and gcc seem to be confused about where the real problem
is.  "where" gave me one thing, and "list" gave me another.

The problem is in this code in Graphics.c:

    case S_GRADIENT:
      {
        register int w = t_width - 1;
        register int h = t_height - 1;
	register int t_scale = w * h;
	register int myncolors = ncolors * 2;
        for (i = 0; i <= w; i++) {
          register int pi = min(i, w - i) * h;
          for (j = 0; j <= h; j++) {
            register int pj = min(j, h - j) * w;
            XPutPixel(image, i, j,
		      pixels[(min(pi, pj) * myncolors - 1) / t_scale]);
          }
        }
      }

In this case, t_width = 1 and t_height = 18.
Since it subtracts 1 from t_width, it ends up with w=0.  Then t_scale
= 0.  Then the division dies.

The fix eludes me right now...did Sir Boris write this too, or just
the Y Gradient?

I already get the core dump you describe.
But, I fail to find a method to reproduce this problem. 
I suspect a mini icon problem. I will try to work more on this.

He did and here's a patch that I think fixes it. It works over the small
number ranges and I guess it works over large ones too but I'm not a
mathematician. The original gradient codes in Graphics.c were designed
to have fixed pixmap sizes to draw in, they were later generalized to
work with arbitrary sizes and this core dump is the result. A square
gradient in a 18x1 pixmap does not make sense. I think you can have a
similar core dump with Cgrads and YGrads.

Cheers,
Tim.

Thanks Tim.  I extended what you supplied to cover the other
two gradient types you mentioned.

I lack test cases that give me visual confirmation that the gradients
still look the way they should.  They wouldn't do me any good anyway
since I haven't used them enough to know what they should look like.
I guess I could figure that out, but right now, I have some other things
I should be doing.

With those fixes, the Purify tests run under Purify with no problems
being detected.

import utility from ImageMagick without parameters works well.
With -frame it behaves strangely now. It worked well some time ago.
It seems that import and fvwm do not agree about what is window frame.

On my machine "import -frame image.gif" on xv or xcalc produces an image
without client window (it is empty). If trying to capture xterm, it exits
with "Can't allocate memory" error. rxvt being captured does not exit
itself, but eats all memory and then is killed by kernel.

Tried with ImageMagick-5.2.2 and ImageMagick-5.3.3 - the same problems.
Tried with fvwm-2.2.5 and fvwm-2.3.22 - everything is fine.

Please comment.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I tried an rxvt and an xv with titlebars and pixmap border,
both worked fine.

Can you try a more current ImageMagick by a chance?

For me "import -frame" works fine with fvwm-2.3.22 release and no rc.
And the same "import -frame" fails with fvwm-2.3.32 release and no rc.

Mikhael.

With 5.3.3 I got a cpu loop with an rxvt.
It didn't seem to growing, but I didn't watch it long.

The rest will have to wait til tomorrow, its getting late.

For me it works but does weird things (how do I find out the IM
version?).  With an rxvt window, the client part of the window is
shifted about 23.5 rows upwards and 10 columns to the left before
the image is captured.  With xterm it is the same.  An xv client
window is reduced to about 10 pixels in height before capturing.
The windows stay in the screwed up state until they get a
ConfigureNotify (e.g.  after moving or resizing the window).  The
frame is included in the image in both cases.

To me it seems that import is making assumptions about the
internal layout of the window manager frame and fiddles with
windows of other clients.  This looks pretty broken to me, but I
will look at what happens in fvwm anyway.

Yes, it seems that some client windows are resized first depending on the
original structure and size. Some clients don't survive this resizing.

Giving it a really long time, it eventually completes,
using a serious amount of CPU.  It does capture the rxvt window
and its borders correctly.

With xv, for some reason, when I click in the xv window
it doubles the size of all the information in the xv window.
Other than that, it captures the borders without a problem
except that it cut off the right and bottom borders from the resized
window.

These tests were run on Solaris, using XSun.

So, what do we do about this? A possible solution is to ungrab cursor
before some commands (Wait) and then grab again. If there is no solution,
I think we should disable this commit, because it is problematic. I run a
version with this commit disabled during a week now, so I may do it.

Since you quoted the entire answer, I think the link
would be better in our links web page, but I can't seem to find
an official source.

Theres an entirely different one at the OpenGroup.
The one I found seems to be culled from the newsgroup and archived
at www.faqs.org.

I'll keep it in mind.

Yes, this is fixed, nice. The problem was using 0/1 instead of 1/2 in
WindowShade. On/Off works, but accourding to the man page this is as
obsolete as 1 and 2. The only non-obsolete arguments for toggle commands
(Iconify, Maximize, Stick, WindowShade) are True/False/Toggle.

Mikhael.

No I do not think so. The fvwm2 man page say that:
"yes",  "on", "true",  "t" , "y"  and  "no", "off", "false", "f",
"n" are all valide arguments for a boolean argument
(section BOOLEAN ARGUMENT, and WindowShade section
just say that 1 and 2 are obsolet but equivalent to On and Off).
Moreover, this seems natural for me (as 1,2 are really not good
as the bug shows).

I can make time to build 2.4 if no one objects.

Sorry, I should object because there are at least 3 problems:

1) Locking on Wait in I functions, I am still waiting for Dominik's answer.
   If nothing else I will undo that problematic commit.
2) IMHO "import -frame" problem should be fixed, it worked previously and
   it is inaceptable that existing window screenshot functions are broken.
3) There are several problems in function parsing, see my other thread.
   I will try to fix them all soon.

Also configure.in should be changed to have 2.4.0 (if we decide that there
will not be 2.3.33) for "make_fvwmdist.sh -r" to work. Also dates and
release numbers should be updated in several documentation files.

I suggest, after we fix these problems or agree not to fix some of them,
someone releases 2.4.0 (i.e. tags cvs), some people (I will) test that the
tagged version works (cvs checkout -r version-2_4_0), if not I will care to
move the tag manually. I and Olivier build rpms (this also sometimes unveils
problems with a tarball). And only then we put released tar.gz and announce.

I am optimistical even if this means some more days. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

I have been thinking about this a lot.  The main problem is the
way 'Wait' is implemented at all.  The man page claims that fvwm
stays fully functional during a wait which has not been true for a
long time.  The wait function implements its own inferior version
of the event loop which will fail in a lot of cases.  For example
it does not handle the module queue properly, so modules are not
able to issue commands during a wait.  Furthermore it expects that
DispatchEvent() never handles more than one event.  This may be
true for MapNotify at the moment, but if HandleMapNotify() would
ever check for a matching DestroyNotify() in the future, 'Wait'
might miss the MapNotify and hang forever.

This solution will work, but it's not trivial to implement:

 1) When 'Wait' is called, it inserts the information about the
    window to wait for in a table.
 2) 'Wait' returns immediately.  It does not do any event handling.
 3) 'Wait' has a special flag in the function table that tells
    execute_function() to return immediately without finishing
    the function.  Instead it builds a new function with the rest
    of the actions that would have to be taken as soon as the
    window appears.  Then it returns and tells the function from
    which it was called to do the same.
 4) Finally, function execution ends with a more or less long list
    of pending commands.  The cursor is ungrabbed and fvwm resumes
    execution in the normal event loop.
 5) Whenever a new window is mapped, fvwm checks the list of
    pending waits for a matching window.  For the first matching
    window it executes the recorded function and deletes it after
    execution.

There are still some problems in this solution that would have to
be solved:

 a) How can ctrl-alt-escape be implemented?
 b) How can the busy cursor be implemented?
 c) What happens to function parameters?  When leaving the current
    function they have to be recorded in some way.  One way would
    be to store them in the recorded function somehow (new
    command?)  Alternatively the commands could be executed as
    usual but instead of executing them the string that would have
    been executed is recorded.

Bye

Right.  I coded every "true/false" pair I could think of for
boolean arguments :-)

I think the current focus problems and the Wait command have to be
fixed first.

The current command parsing is done in this order:

  1) Handling the module command (if starting with '*')
  2) Getting the first word (command name)
  3) Expanding the first word and the entire command separately
  4) Handling the internal command

This leads to several problems, like:

  * The command starting with '*' is not a subject for parameter expansion,
    thus making it impossible to construct module commands or have generic
    module templates (without an overhead of forking using PipeRead echo)
  * In module commands extended variables like $[fg.cs1] are not
    expanded, sometimes making it hard to have functional module configs
  * Calling function named "echo twice" does not work, although calling
    function named "print twice" works. This just shows how bad is the
    existing parsing order.

The problems are real, for example a sample in FAQ 7.13 does not work now.
I am not sure why it worked at all (2 bugs eliminate each other?).

Currently I am learning now how hard will be to implement a more correct
order without breaking anything:

  1) Expanding the entire command
  2) Handling the module command (if starting with '*')
  2) Getting the first word (command name)
  3) Handling the internal command

This would fix all 3 problems above together with more inconsistencies,
say, a leading '-' (meaning don't expand) would work for all commands.

Of course, for backward compatibility single-letter variables in module
commands should not be expanded (this is unfortunate, but needed, since
FvwmButtons and FvwmForm expect this). However $[] variables is a new
invention and there is no reason not to expand them in module commands.

Does anyone see any problem if $0 to $9 are expanded in module commands
inside functions? I can't think of any except of really exotic examples,
in which the raw '$0' could be escaped like in any other place - '$$0'.

BTW, I think it is not late yet to reduce expanding collisions and use '%'
instead of '$' in the new FvwmButtons constructions: %fg, %right, %width.
Or a less conflicting syntax $(fg), like the one already used in FvwmForm.

This is not the best time for this reworking, but the existing command
parsing problems should be solved (at least FAQ 7.13 sample should work).
As usual I will not change anything without a thorough testing first.
Any comments are welcome.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm rather reluctant to open this can of worms again this close to
2.4.  The problems you mention are not nice, but everything works
as it used to right now.  I already tried to fix some of this, but
was not able to do so without breaking backwards compatibility.
May this be a candidate for the ominous 3.0 release?  I'd really
like to throw away the whole parsing stuff and write it from
scratch in a clean, well designed way.  Of course that will break
a lot of config files :-/

I know about these issues, because I write a lot of config stuff. But I am
concerned that fvwm-themes should work with fvwm-2.4.x not fvwm-3.0.x.

I see how to fix the "space in function name" problem, it just requires
some duplication - second PeekToken after expand and reevaluation of bif.
But this problem is not important, and we may just leave it as is.
However the module command processing is way too limiting.

I patched execute_function() locally and other problems mentioned by me
are fixed. Tomorrow I will patch expand() so it will not expand too much
for module commands, then test everything and send the resulting small
patch. I want to keep backward compatibility as much as possible.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Which 2 bugs?

I'm pretty sure 7.13 worked at one time.  As I remember, more than
one of us looked at it.

I'd expect function args to be expanded during function interpretation
regardless of the command in the function.

That does not necessarily mean that the example worked at a time
when parsing was compatible with the 2.2.x versions.  The example
may have been written at a time when parsing was broken.

Yes, but:

 $0 to $9
    The positional parameters given to a  complex  func-
    tion  (a  function  that  has  been defined with the
    AddToFunc command).  "$0" is replaced with the first
    parameter, "$1" with the second parameter and so on.

Currently my FvwmButtons setup relies on the fact that these
variables are not expanded for module config lines, e.g.

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow xload `Exec xload -fg $[fg.cs6] -bg $[bg.cs6]`)

When I go over an icon that's partially covered by a window, the icon 
title is raised, but the icon itself is not (see .jpg)  Is this correct 
behavior?

Regards,
Nils.

I noticed a problem that probably has its roots in bug report #664, 
and is demonstratable through Sun's beans development kit.  This bug 
does not appear in any other window manager I've tried, ranging from 
the simple (flwm) to the complex (enlightenment), so it's odd that it 
pops up in fvwm.

Instructions for reproducing:

1. Download the BDK from Sun.  I can send you the original zip archive 
   or a tar/gzipped archive.

2. Unarchive the BDK, and change into the beans directory.

3. Execute 'make run'.

4. Notice that there are three tiny windows: the Beanbox, the Toolbox,
   and the properties window, which definitely shouldn't be that size.  
   The other windows are of the right size.

5. Resize the windows. You might have to bind some form of Maximize to 
   a key stroke in order to be able to get a handle on the window to 
   resize it.  Everything works more or less properly from this point.

6. Now start up Xnest with an unused display:
     Xnest :1 &

7. Start up an xterm in it:
     xterm -display :1 &

8. In that xterm, start up another window manager, preferably something 
   light like wm2, flwm, aewm, or twm.
     twm &

9. In that xterm, enter the beans directory and make run.

10. Everything is happy on the first go for some reason.

True, but there is also this line (I hope it will not be valid tomorrow):

    Note that module configuration lines (i.e. lines beginning with '*')
    are not subject to parameter expansion.

Here is a small patch adding partial expansion to module config lines;
function parameters and new inventions like $[page.nx] are expended.

I tested it during the day and verified that it does not conflict with
any of our 27 modules accourding to their man pages.

With this patch FAQ 7.13 works. I plan to apply it tomorrow.
I don't want to do any other changes to command parsing before 2.4.0.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi guys,

I just tried compiling the 2001-05-23 snapshot on my Debian/GNU Linux box,
and the compilation failed rather quickly with this error message:

make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/andre/software/fvwm-snap-20010523'

The last version of fvwm that I have tried to build is 2.3.32, which worked
flawlessly.

Let me know if I should provide additional information.

I see... You (and me in fvwm-themes) should have to escape $ here as $$
or not to escape it, depending on which value we want (at definition time
or at run time). Like in every other command. I hope you can accept this?
Your example is not different from what we have now with these commands:

  Exec echo 'Exec xload -fg $[fg.cs6] -bg $[bg.cs6]' >auto.fvwmrc
  PipeRead `echo 'Echo $[bg.cs0]' | sed s/0/1/`

Both can have $ escaped as $$ or not, depending on what is actually meant.
It is not complex, it is just our needs are complex, once we want $[fg.cs6]
to be expanded immediately (FvwmButtons: Back) and once not (your example).

I really want to solve this so that everyone is happy. It seems we agree
that $0 should be expanded, "$." is good to be expanded too, for example
for specifying full path for local images/sounds in FvwmButtons/FvwmEvent.
I am applying this patch, so we may see this in action. Disabling expansion
of $[fg.cs6] variables in module commands, if you still want it, is easy.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Only icon title raising was intended when it was implemented 2 years ago.
So the behaviour is expected.

I can confirm that fvwm-snap-20010523 and all snapshots starting from
20010506, when we had "Building problem" email that Jason asked to ignore,
have this problem. fvwm/Makefile.in has libs/header.h dependencies
instead of the correct ../libs/header.h. I have no idea why this happened.
"make dist" from cvs has no this problem.

Jason, was there something interesting in how you solved the problem then
on 20010506? Anyway, creating the tree from scratch should solve this now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Are you saying that every single snapshot has this problem?  The snapshots
are just built from a cvs update; I don't do a make clean but everything
including the binaries are built.

MG> Jason, was there something interesting in how you solved the problem

Not really.  We had a couple of days of problems; one night a machine went
down, and on another I left the fvwm-web tree checked out in the build tree
which caused some weird CVS problems.  But I didn't actually do anything to
the tree to fix it, except rm -rf fvwm-web.

I just cleaned out the tree and checked it out again; we'll see how
tomorrow morning's build goes.  I admit I'm at a loss as to what is causing
the snapshot to fail, but it definitely is broken even on the machine it
was built on (so there's not something special about this machine that
makes the snapshot work).  If this doesn't work then I'm going to have to
assume that a needed file is getting left out of the snapshot.

The FvwmWharf Module doesn't appear to update itself when its 
colorset is changed; moving a window over the module will cause 
it to repaint itself correctly on areas covered/uncovered by the 
window.

Hello 
Fvwm should __not__require gtk to compile
In the autoconf script __should__ be  a switch --with-gtk or --without-gtk
That was quiet a silly thing to include gtklibs in fvwm

The snapshot built OK and I downloaded it and built it on another machine
as well.  Everything seems OK now; can everyone check it?

As was already pointed out, the behavior was intentional.
Plus, I think its correct.  It does look a little funny in this case,
but with the icon is other positions (to the side), and a little more of
the icon visible, it makes more sense.  And, with FvwmAuto running,
you can get the icon to raise too.

I have no problems to swallow asfsm, works like with any other window.
I used a usual (Swallow "asfsm" `Exec exec asfsm`).

Please post your FvwmButtons config if you still have problems.

I can't get raise_window/lower_window events in FvwmEvent at all.
Not using a module (FvwmTaskBar, FvwmConsole) not in any other way.

It seems that lower_window event is not sent at all anywhere in the code.
Probably someone else knows more about this.

Mikhael.

Configuration Information [Automatically generated, do not change]:
uname output: Linux cumulonimbus 2.2.18pre24 #1 Thu Nov 30 21:45:24 EET 2000 i686 unknown
Compiler: gcc
Compilation CFLAGS: -g -O2
prefix: /usr/local

FVWM Version:	2.3.33
FVWM_MODULEDIR:	/usr/local/libexec/fvwm
FVWM_DATADIR:	/usr/local/share/fvwm
FVWM_USERDIR:	unset

Description:
	I have been running CVS-versions of FVWM for quite some time,
	however in last few days the compilation has failed with:
	
	 In file included from ../libs/fvwmlib.h:19,
                 from Graphics.c:20:
	 ../config.h:145: #error The stuff above TOP goes to the top of 
	 config.h.in
	 ../config.h:146: #error What appears below BOTTOM goes to the bottom
	 ../config.h:147: #error This text should not appear anywhere!

	This seems to be caused by the new autoconf 2.50, which has 
	recently became the default autoconf version on Debian "unstable"
	distribution.

Repeat-By:
	Use autoconf 2.50 to generate config.in etc.

Fix:
	The ugly solution is of course to use autoconf 2.13.

Our INSTALL.fvwm file suggests that the user should export LDFLAGS
on Solaris (for example).  The Solaris man pages for Solaris 2.6 and
2.8 identify LD_OPTIONS as the right variable.
HPUX11.11 uses LDOPTS.  AIX 4.3 doesn't seem to have anything.

Anyone know where LDFLAGS works?

Hm.  The problem is not that *my* config might break but that
other users will complain.  I have no idea how far sppread this
kind of config is.

I can't confirm this.  FvwmWharf updates as it should for me.
Please provide your config file and detailed instructions to

*FvwmWharf music music.xpm MaxSwallow "wmusic" wmusic -t -u -x -w

None of the *.xpm's exist.  (Hmmm.  Is that the problem, I wonder?)  There 
are no folders, only swallowed apps.

Anyways, the instructions are rather short and I'm not sure what else 
to add to them:

1. Define colorset 8 to be something.

    *FvwmColorset 8 fg blue, bg black, Pixmap

2. Start up FvwmWharf like normal.  

    Module FvwmWharf
    
   This may or may not completely update itself; in my experience, on a
   restart of the fvwm session it doesn't, while starting it up in the
   middle of a session does.  Sometimes.

3. Change colorset 8 to something different.

    *FvwmColorset 8 fg red, bg white, Pixmap
   
   Anything else with colorset 8 will change appropriately, while FvwmWharf 
   merely sits there.  This happens on both plain colorsets and colorsets 
   with pixmaps/gradients.

   However, forcing expose events on FvwmWharf (iconifying and uniconifying, 
   covering with windows and then removing them) will redraw the expose'd 
   portions of the Wharf correctly.

The patch I submitted fixes this problem (on my machine, anyways)
by calling XClearArea and telling it to generate an Expose event.
(Before, no expose events were being generated on changing colorsets).
I also commented out the many calls to XClearWindow/XClearArea (before,
XClearWindow was called for every folder/button) in that function,
but maybe these are needed for folders that pop out.

I looked at other modules (like FvwmPager) and apparently they do generate 
Expose events in such a way, sometimes, when colorsets get changed.

I tried this out and can reproduce (ii) (fixed) but not (i). I
tried with kedit, kfm, kmag and xterm for window A and FvwmConsole
and xemacs for window B.  I opened various menus of A, but I never
saw any problem with the focus.  I started testing this thoroughly
only after I wrote the fix for (ii), so the problem may have gone
away in the wake of the patch, but I don't believe it.  Can you
give more details?

Neither command is correct ;-)  FvwmTheme does not use new

  *FvwmTheme...

config lines after it has already started.  The correct syntax is

  SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset ...

Anyway, with this config I was able to reproduce and fix the
problem.  I guess the patch you sent worked also (I did not try),
but it would have caused a redraw for every colour set packet,
even if FvwmWharf did not use that specific colour set.  Well,
FvwmWharf *did* redraw its folders for each packet, but that is a
different story.  Actually, the two lines

  XClearWindow(dpy, main_win);
  RedrawWindow(&main_win,0, -1, num_rows, num_columns);

in change_colorset() somehow went into the loop

  for (x = 0; x < num_folders; x++)
  {
    ...
    XClearWindow(dpy, main_win);
    RedrawWindow(&main_win,0, -1, num_rows, num_columns);
  }

which was meant to redraw the folders.  So, if the wharf had no
folders, the main window was never redrawn.  If it had folders it
was redrawn once for each folder.  The simple fix is to move these
lines out of the loop.  I'll commit that in a moment.

It seems that this is somehow related to the commit mails.  The
commit itself works, but not mail is sent to the list.

That's correct; the CVS operation went fine, but the MTA (Exim) wouldn't
start up because of the password/group database messup.

This shouldn't have existed for more than an hour and a half.  Have you
seen problems further back than that?

    All the following supposes that you refer to Make (is there such a thing
as non-GNU autoconf?).

    Well, of course in GNU `Make' it is well documented ;-)

    * Solaris 2.5 (uname -sr: SunOS 5.5.1) make(1): mentions $(LDFLAGS) in
all LINK.* rules.

    * Digital UNIX (OSF1 V4.0) make(1):
        LDFLAGS
            For ld flags. Default is null.

    * IRIX (IRIX64 6.5) make(1):
        LFLAGS= LDFLAGS=
and later
        .c:
                $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $<

(what is interesting that it actually places $(LDFLAGS) *at the end* of
commandline:
    sky:~% export LDFLAGS=-zzz
    sky:~% make -n -f /dev/tty req
    req: req.c
    <Ctrl+D>
            cc -O -o req req.c -zzz
)

    * FreeBSD (very old, FreeBSD 2.2-970625-RELENG): make(1) doesn't mention
LDFLAGS, but it works exactly as specified in IRIX make(1).

    * OpenBSD (OpenBSD 2.7) behaves exactly as FreeBSD.

    * BSD/OS (BSD/OS 3.1, old -- 1998) doesn't mentions any *FLAGS (except
MAKEFLAGS) in man(1), doesn't seem to honour $LDFLAGS and "strings `which
make`" shows that the binary doesn't contain any references to it.

Whatever you mean with "BDK" (I could not find this name on the
Sun web page) I downloaded the Netbeans 3.2 executable
distribution.  It has not makefile anywhere and dumps core when I
try to run it.  All attempts to download the source distribution
ended in netscape crashes until now.  I'm still trying.  (Please
do *not* email the sources to me).

I can confirm that (ii) is fixed. (i) is still here. I will try to give more explaination on
(i) (however, I really do not think that this is a critical bug):
    
Reproduction:  - Style "kedit" NeverFocus
                     - start kedit and an xterm
                     - give the focus to the xterm (say the xterm is SloppyFocus )
                     - go to the kedit window (the xterm have still the focus)
                     - Popup the file menu and cancel it by a click somewhere (on the
                      root window or on kedit or on the xterm).
                     - Then, the xterm is still decorated as a window with the focus, but
                    the xterm has no more the keyborad focus.

So that the xterm get again the keyboard focus I need to give the focus to an other window
and come back to the xterm. In fact, kedit (or the kedit menu?) take the keyboard focus
when I popup the file menu so that  the arrows key can be used for menu navigation.

Maybe an important point is that I used KDE version 2 (2.1.1) with QT 2.3.0. Also there
is a QT option --nograb (say to do not grab the keyboard and the mouse), but this change
nothing to the problem.

Really, I think this is not a critical bug at all: who want to use kedit with a NeverFocus style?
The only K apps which may need a NeverFocus policy are apps as kicker (kpanel KDE
version 2 analogue) or kpager which do not work with FVWM. So this is a fvwm-ewmh
problem and not a FVWM problem and if you do not see an obvious solution I think you
do not have to lost your time with this. When I will have some time I will take a look on this
problem, but I think we can safelly release 2.4.0 whithout a fix to this.

I feel dumb.  I was looking at ld options.  LDFLAGS seems to be
a standard part of make.

I meant the 'Beans Development Kit', from www.java.com.  For easy access, 
I am temporarily providing it at 

 http://srh1171.urh.uiuc.edu/~anle/misc/bdk1_1.zip

You need unzip.

LDFLAGS is the variable used by the Makefile when invoking the linker.

Actually both syntaxes (module configuration and sending a message) work
the same, i.e. fvwm and FvwmTheme are synchronized until FvwmTheme
reevaluates the new colorset value.
(Propogation of the new value to modules is not synchronized I guess.)

And the first syntax is even preferable in most of situations, because
after restarting (killing/starting) of FvwmTheme the current value is used.

Mikhael.

I see that in your example, without UseOld asfsm is not swallowed.
This seems a problem of asfsm after all. :)

The man page of asfsm suggests "-i sec" to change a scanning interval.
But in fact, asfsm with -i starts iconic and immediately deiconifies
itself. This confuses FvwmButtons. So either don't use -i or use UseOld
or bother asfsm developers to conform to the man page or bother fvwm
developers to fix swalowing. A note, if I don't use UseOld and then
iconify/deiconify asfsm it is swallowed after this action.

Don't underestimate a complexity of conditions in large programs.

I can only add that I do get raise_window events when I enter gnome
panel's subpanel, it asks (version 1.4) to raise itself when entered.
I also sometimes enter a mode when usual RaiseLower or Raise generate
raise_window. But right now they don't generate it while panel does.
And lower_window is simply not sent as I already mentioned.

I used for testing:

  *FvwmEvent-Test: Cmd "Exec xmessage"   # "Echo"
  *FvwmEvent-Test: raise_window "raise window"
  Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Test
  #KillModule FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Test

(I also currently have FvwmEvent-Sound with raise_window defined.)

I don't consider any of the problems in this message critical for 2.4.0.
They may be fixed later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There was a cvs commit that did not generate email (missing email events):

	* fvwm/stack.c (LowerWindow):
	(RaiseWindow):
	restored sending M_RAISE_WINDOW and M_LOWER_WINDOW that was
	accidentally removed somewhere after 2.2 - fixes missing
	raise/lower events in FvwmEvent

Now, lower_window works well for me, but raise_window is often duplicated.
Wait more than 4 seconds, Raise - one raise_window event is sent.
Wait less than 3 seconds, Raise - two raise_window events are sent.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Dominik, do you work on this now? I think this is a good solution, but
it requires so many changes in several places that we may need 2.3.33.

Can we restore the previous behaviour of Wait in "I" functions now and
release 2.4.0? And this solution may be implemented in 2.4.1 or similar.

I think we don't need to fork to 2.5.0/2.9.0 (which is going to be
incompatible) immediately after 2.4.0, this may be done later in 2.4.x.

Mikhael.

hi workers!

the sentence in the subject is *NOT* my opinion! that's for sure!

i just found a funny lil program called "wmfishtime" [1] which does
nothing than display a clock. when i start it under my fvwm2 [2], it
just shows a gray box.

in the tarfile, there's also a file called "ALL_I_GET_IS_A_GRAY_BOX"
which refers to the INSTALL file. there it says that my windowmanager
sucks because it's broken, i should use -b to run it.

i don't really know much about c programming, even less about
xwindows-coding. all i found in fishmon.c was this:

...
 /* actually draw the rgb buffer to screen */
  if (!broken_wm)
      gdk_draw_rgb_image(bm.iconwin, bm.gc, 4, 4, 56, 56,
        GDK_RGB_DITHER_NONE, bm.rgb, 56 * 3);
  else
      gdk_draw_rgb_image(bm.win, bm.gc, 4, 4, 56, 56,
        GDK_RGB_DITHER_NONE, bm.rgb, 56 * 3);
    }
...

that's it. i don't know what's so bad bout using either of these
methods. but the author of this program says my fvwm2 sucks, and i
wanted you to know. perhaps there's really a bug or sth you didn't
notice.

thx

andr

I have looked into what happens for hours, but I can't make any
sense of it.  These windows specifically request or are even 
created with the bogus size.  Sometimes they come up with the
correct width and a height of one or vice versa.  This seems to
be totally random.

I tried several other window managers.  The application behaved
well under icewm, olvwm and enlightenment but had the same problem
under blackbox.  The application is definitely freaking out, but I
do not understand why this happens with some window managers but
not with others.  There is little doubt that the same problem
would occur with other window managers if the application sent the
same size requests to them, but it doesn't.

No, I didn't dare to start this.  Of course it would be much
cleaner to dump backwards compatibility and make the 'Wait'
command take the name of a function as an argument instead of
collecting commands when it is called.

We'll need a 2.3.33 anyway.

How about this:

 1) I'll implement a new wait syntax that takes a function name
    to execute with all the stuf necessary to maintain a list of
    waits.  Perhaps the id of the new window could even be passed
    into the function.
 2) The current wait is kept exactly as it is now but we'll ungrab
    the pointer during execution.  This will break 'I'-only
    functions in a few cases and will not work well if the pointer
    was grabbed multiple times when the wait was called.
 3) The paragraph claiming that "Fvwm remains fully functional
    during a wait" is scrapped.  It has never been true and will
    never be true with the old syntax.  Only the new syntax can do
    this.
 4) A warning in the conversion tool is added.
 5) Anybody complaining about this will have to use the new
    syntax.
 6) Unless someone else comes up with a good idea, the busy cursor
    feature in waits is dropped for now.

This app is broken itself, although funny. :)
It ignores delete window protocol, so only Destroy works on it.

It lists E and kwm as broken WMs too, but I see nothing broken here.
It asks to draw on the icon window not on the main window, so if you
iconify wmfishtime (without -b) in normal WMs, you will see an animation.

The --broken option should be correctly named --not-in-icon.
And I think it should be a default, while --in-icon may be an option.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It simply does not request to be iconig.  If I change this line

    wmhints.initial_state = WithdrawnState;

to this, all works well:

    wmhints.initial_state = IconicState;

Furthermore the applications uses the USSize hint without user
request which is absolutely forbidden.  I think I'll send a patch
to the author.

Right.

Ok, but whoever builds it should use "make_fvwmdist.sh -r -M" to ensure we
don't have 2.3.34.

What would be a problem with the busy cursor in the new implementation?
When a total Wait counter is 0 the normal root cursor may be restored.

(2) is needed, but are other items are needed for 2.4.0? If Wait worked
badly in 2.2.x and users didn't complain, maybe this was enough?
We may even add (2.5) Re-set $w or a new variable $m after Wait.

If I understand you correctly, the new non-blocking Wait has the syntax:

  Wait "window-name" callback-function

If we already do this, I would extend it to:

  Wait "window-name" callback-function [timeout [timeout-function]]

and EscapeFunc may trigger timeout-function too if the last is defined.

I have no problem if this new syntax is implemented after 2.4.0.
but I will support your decision.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I just restored the old behaviour (2.2.x) as close as I could.
The duplication of raise events was already there, as far as I
understand.  In my eyes it does not make much sense to send
M_RAISE_WINDOW for whole trees of transient windows and possibly
multiple times when a single window is raised by user actions.

Full_Name: Christian Lacunza
Version: 2.2 compiled on Nov 17 2000
CVS_Date: 
OS: freebsd 4.3
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.6
Submission from: (NULL) (64.161.130.84)



unclutter is a program that makes the mouse pointer disappear if it
hasn't moved in 5 seconds.  the pointer comes back if you click or
move the mouse.

the problem is that fvwm ignores that first click if the click is on
the window manager decorations (title bar, handles, iconify button,
etc).  this is kind of annoying because then you have to click again
to get the stupid window to iconify or whatever.

note that the click is not ignored when the mouse in a netscape,
emacs, or xterm window.  furthermore, the click is not ignored
by FvwmPager and fvwm responds to the click properly when it is on
the root window.  the only place where the click is ignored is in the 
fvwm window manager decorations (the problem does not occur with twm
window manager decorations).

to reproduce:

1. install unclutter-8 from one of the servers listed here:

     http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=unclutter

2. run it like this:

     unclutter -jitter 1 -root &

3. put the pointer onto an fvwm title bar, lift the mouse up off the
   mouse pad so you don't accidentally move the mouse when the thing
   disappears, and then wait a few seconds for it to disappear.

4. after it has disappeared, click.

5. observe that fvwm did not respond.

If the author said *what* the bug was he would be much more helpful.

I've always wondered about this....

Whenever I download other packages that require XPM, I never have to
explicitly set LDFLAGS (SunOS-5.7); in fvwm is has to be set by hand.
Why is that ? Why is there a distinction and can't configure.in (Paul S. :-) 
be fixed in fvwm ?

For instance, xscreensaver-3.32 doesn't require this explicit setting
(www.jwz.org/xscreensaver).  My command lines for xscreensaver looks as 
follows,

$ ./configure \
     --prefix=/download/xscreensaver-3.32/done \
     --with-xpm=/download/xpm-3.4k-solaris

xscreensaver even adds the include/lib subdirectories appropriately
to the compile procedure.

Couldn't fvwm do the same exact thing ???

Today with fvwm I have to do the following,

$ setenv LDFLAGS -R/download/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib
$ ./configure \
     --prefix=/tools/download/fvwm-2.3.32/done \
     --with-xpm-library=/download/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib \
     --with-xpm-includes=/download/xpm-3.4k-solaris/include


Thanks

This is probably a misfeature of Netscape, which uncompresses the archive
on the fly, but don't change the file name from .tar.gz to .tar.

Yes, it could be fixed in FVWM's configure.in.  But, it's difficult to
do correctly.

Note that just adding -R with the same path is _not_ always what you
want, if you have a more complex installation.

JWZ went to horrific amounts of effort to get xscreensaver's
configure.in to work the way he wanted.

The XEmacs folks also had similar experiences.


I'm hoping that autoconf 2.50, just released, will work better in this
respect (which is where it _should_ be fixed, rather than in each
package's configure.in).  At any rate, we will try to revisit this
problem when we convert to 2.50, if it's still a problem there.

I thought that the pointer has to be grabbed to change the cursor.
This is nonsese, of course.

I've coded this with little effort.  Still, windows can't be
destroyed while the function in running, so I added a patch that
at least unmaps a window in DestroyWindow() when it can not be
destroyed immediately.  I hope this does not break someathing
else.

Yes, something like this.  Perhaps a new name for the command
would be better to stress that the syntax has changed radically.
For example "WaitForWindow".

I think this would be a bit cleaner:

  Wait [timeout <secs>] [timeoutcommand command] command window-name

The 'fix' works for me at the moment, so the final solution can
wait.  If too many people complain we may have to provide the new
syntax soon after 2.4.

Yes.  At work netscape unzipped it, at home it didn't.  Pretty
strange behaviour for two installations off the same CD with the
same config file.

It seems that autoheader in 2.50 was changed so it does not remove this
part anymore, so I disabled this #error part. The new version of autoconf
works well for me with no other changes, which is quite surprizing.

Still we should have autoconf-2.13 as a reference until we all together
move to autoconf-2.50. Probably immediately after opening fvwm-2.5.0.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks for the bug report.  I have fixed this in the current
development sources that will become the new 2.4 stable release
soon.

I don't have the slightest idea why, but the order in which keys
are grabbed seem to play a role.  If we grab all keys on the
client window first an then all keys on the decorations, the bug
is there.  If keys are grabbed on all parts of the windows
simultaneously, the problem goes away.  Althoug I don't understand
why, we have a fix at last.

I installed Java2 and tried to run your sample program, but the
VM dumps core withut doing anything useful.  The same problem
occurs when compiling the program with javac.  Could anybody
else try this?  (sample program attached again).

Jason,

  I did searches on our mail archives using the keyword "unclutter".

  I guess the problem with the mail archives is that we don't archive
fvwm-workers?  I wish we could.

The archives are there. The problem is that there are incomplete glimpse
search indexes. I suggest to reindex all archives starting from 1995.

I tried running this program, and it seams to work. It is a small app with
a button in it. I have the normal toolbar buttons, but I noticed this
message in my .xsession-errors file:

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> Hello World window 0x1a00028 has broken 
(max_width) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
hint override = 0

width_inc = 0, height_inc = 0
min_aspect = 0/0, max_aspect = 0/0
base_width = 0, base_height = 0
win_gravity = 1

Let me know if you need more help.

that would be excellent, I packaged it for debian and then handed over
to Marcel May <Marcel.May@consol.de>, he is still working on the
package, it is yet to be put into debian.


here's an some code from wmtime which I think does a similiar thing.
It looks like it just draws both.

void RedrawWindow(void) {
       =20
        flush_expose(iconwin);
        XCopyArea(display, wmgen.pixmap, iconwin, NormalGC,=20
                                0,0, wmgen.attributes.width, wmgen.attribut=
es.he
ight, 0,0);
        flush_expose(win);
        XCopyArea(display, wmgen.pixmap, win, NormalGC,
                                0,0, wmgen.attributes.width, wmgen.attribut=
es.he
ight, 0,0);
}

wonder if that's a solution. I don't really know much about this stuff.

Is there any chance to compile a stand alone executable for a
Linux 2.4 system (SuSE 7.1) from this?  You can find the original
bug report in our bug databes (#707).

I've attached the bytecode file to this e-mail, which should run on your

I should add that fvwm2 obeys the call to frame.setResizable(false) in
this application, because I can't resize it.

This may or may not be fvwm related.  When launching some applications 
(proprietary; no source available) I get the following message from X, 
and the applications shut down.  SOmetimes I think I get fvwm hanging 
on login from the Sun session manager, but I'm not sure if this problem 
is related or not.  The hang on login happens randomly and I don't know 
how to reproduce it. I've also attached a truss output of the 
application.  I'm not sure if it's helpful since it forks off a child 
at the end; is there a way to truss the child?


X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range 
for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  53 (X_CreatePixmap)
  Value in failed request:  0x8
  Serial number of failed request:  865

  $ man truss
    ...
       -f        Follows all children created by fork() or  vfork()
                 and  includes  their  signals,  faults, and system

HTH.

I also typically build strace for Solaris; I find it gives much more and
better information than truss.

Not sure that this will help anyone find your problem though :).

I looked thru the truss, but I didn't see anything helpful.
I didn't really expect to, truss doesn't help much for errors coming
out of X.

The man page for XCreatePixmap has this to say:

     BadValue  Some numeric value falls outside the range of
               values accepted by the request.  Unless a specific
               range is specified for an argument, the full range
               defined by the argument's type is accepted.  Any
               argument defined as a set of alternatives can gen-
               erate this error.

You can read the man page for yourself, I won't quote the whole thing,
but the args are the pixmap dimensions and the depth.  Either one
of them being out of range can cause this.  Since the value thats
bad is 8, I'd have to guess its the depth that its looking at.
Perhaps the application needs 8 bit color and you are using 24?

I think the issue you have with fvwm hanging is separate.  Are
you using fvwm session management?  I don't use it myself, so
I don't have any experience with it.  If you have fvwm hanging,
if you can log in from another machine and get a stack, with
dbx or /usr/proc/bin/pstack, that might help.

thanks for the patch however there are a few things one needs to consider:

* dockapps run as withdrawn windows. its pretty simple. one could run a
  dockapp in a normal window, but they are sure as hell never run as an
  "icon". If I am going to provide an option, it's going to be "windowed"
  or "withdrawn", not "windowed" or "iconified" because well, uhm, say,
  blackbox won't even display iconified windows.
* thanks for the size hints stuff, that will be useful.
* thanks for the window group info
* thanks for delete window / user position /etc

The biggest reason that stuff was under #ifdef originally (until stupid
debian zealots said that nobody compiles shit anymore), is performance
reasons. If the user is only seeing win or iconwin, there is no point
drawing to both of them.

No shit, sherlock. And that's the problem. Try drawing the same shit
twice 33 times a second, when the user only sees one? This behaviour will
stay the same way, however I plan to include the position / size hint
changes, and also replace -b with "withdrawn" | "normal window". There is
little point supporting iconic stuff.

If you have a PIII1024 you probably wouldn't care.

No, that can't be true.  In X, "withdrawn" means "not visible at
all".  A withdrawn window can't be seen anywhere, not as a window,
not as an icon, not swallowed in a dock, nowhere.  That is the
whole point of windows being withdrawn.  The only thing I could
imagine is that the dock application maps these windows.  In this
case, another option might be useful: --in-window, --in-icon and
without any of these options, don't map the application at all.
However, mapping the window with the StateHint set to
'WithdrawnState' is still incorrect and leads to undefined
behaviour.

Well, it's almost no effort to let it run in an icon because the
code without my patch does exactly this.  It provides an
IconWindowHint and afterwards draws into the icon window.  I guess
the dock maps the icon window itself - which would be a blatant
violation of everything that X and the ICCCM2 demand :-P  If this
is the case, I suggest to simply keep the map/unmap handling I
wrote, set the StateHint to withdrawn/noram/iconic, whichever the
user demands.

It's easy to keep track of which is visible.  Whenever the
application gets a MapNotify on its main window, the main
window itself is visible, whenever it gets an UnmapNotify the
application has become iconified (which does not necessarily mean
that the icon window is actually visible).  The patch already
takes care of this.

Is xsetroot run from fvwm's InitFunction?

No it  won't make any  difference.   exec fvwm2  just  gets rid of the
.xinitrc process.

I don't think either of those commands would make any difference.
For me, just typing in "svenv -env" doesn't print anything.  I don't
see any man page for it.

If fvwm is in its main event loop, then I'm not sure its actually
hung.  Does the mouse pointer move?  Do windows focus?  If you log
in from some other machine, can you create windows?

Maybe someone else has some more ideas?

That's what I thought; I see no difference.

Well, on the screen it looks like FVWM's never even started (the 
process and pager processes are running, though); I get the openwin 
startup screen with their X/hourglass cursor, and that's it.  Sometimes 
it goes to the clock-busy cursor and back to the X cursor  The cursor 
moves fine; a few versions ago (around .26-.28 maybe?) it sometimes 
would let me right-click to get a menu.

 I'll try starting a window.  It shows the rubber band and the 
coordinates (I can even middle-button resize it while placing), I can 
place the window but it disappears (visually; the process is still 
running).  When I move the cursor to the area where teh window should 
be and try to 'touch' a file, the file does not created so the window 
appears to not really be there.


>Maybe someone else has some more ideas?

Thanks for the help so far...

Nils.

Which XPM lib do people use for fvwm?  I've tried xpm3.4k (I think 
that's the latest I have) but it doesn't compile easily.  imlib doesn't 
seem to do xpm; anyone have a URL for an XPM lib that works well witl 
fvwm?

Thanks,
Nils.

Seeing you have a @debian.org address I assume you are running Debian. I am
too, and I just used the version of XPM that is shipped with XFree86 4.0.x.

If I were running debian, an 'apt-get install fvwm' would suffice, but 
as I am not (using solaris here at work, with plenty of GNU tools 
compiled) I need to compile it myself.  Openwin doesn't have it by 
default.

Solaris right?

I'm using xpm3.4j, but I just compiled 3.4k using the Makefile.noX
proceedure and Suns compiler without a hitch.  (I just built the
static library.)

In the past I've built the shared library, thats what I normally use.
I think I followed the xmkmf procedure but did the make install step
by hand, by looking at what the Makefile wanted to do and doing it
myself.

Glimpse is just busted.  It was a good choice at the time (six years ago)
but it won't even compile on modern systems and the license terms on later
releases were changed to something unreasonable.  htdig (or however you
capitalize/punctuate it) would be a much better choice, but I haven't had
the time to work on it yet.

Hi All,
	Not a bug so no bug report

This function sets a variable set_focus_to that is the window that focus
is going to get moved to due to a window with focus going away. The
process loks like this:

1) if the window going away is a transient set set_focus_to to the
transient_for window

2) if set_focus_to not set and the window going away is a click_focus or
sloppy_focus got to set set_focus_to to the next window on the window
list on the same desk as the window going away.

3) if set_focus_to is set to a window on the same desk as the window
going away transfer focus to set_focus_to.

I think this has a couple of defect:

A) transient windows with parents on a different desk cause the focus to
get set to none. A fix is to either transfer focus to the parent and
switch desks or not look on other desks for the parent so 2) becomes
operative.

B) in 2) I think CirculateSkip should be honoured (and
CirculateSkipIcon) like the Prev command. I would prefer to skip iconic
windows too but I can work around that with a function.

Cheers,
Tim.
