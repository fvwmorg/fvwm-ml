Subject: xine: GUI hidden in fullscreen mode

Full_Name: 
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Debian GNU/Linux (Sid, i386)
X_Server: XFree86 4.3
Submission from: (NULL) (80.146.115.126)


When using Xine in full screen mode the GUI (to control Xine) never becomes
visible. It is hidden _under_ the movie window. If I use Twm or other
window managers (or no window manager at all) then the Gui is above the
movie window, as expected.

This problem exists even if I use Unmanaged style for xine.

Xine is 0.99.1. 

The .fvwm2rc file to use is in fvwm-2.5.10/sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc.


Regards

Harri

Hi, it seems to be a problem with xine-ui 0.99.1, because previous
versions of xine worked fine with fvwm in fullscreen mode.

mabey you could ask the xine folks what they think about this?

I've been using FVWM for almost ten years, now, so in a sense, every piece
of work I've done in the last decade owes at least something to FVWM. So,
my sincere thanks to the team.

Lately I decided to overhaul my setup, and I've been making heavy use of
the State portions of window states and styles. I've primarily been using
a snapshot from April 28, just after the State style was added. Something
odd was happening, so I started looking poring through and debugging the
code. Wow. Impressive code base.

Now, all I know about the code base is what I've learned from printf
debugging over the last week, so please pardon me if I sound like a
numnut. Here are is what I think I've learned, and I am intentionaly
stating the obvious to make sure I'm not making any stupid mistakes, and
my conclusions:

1. Using the WindowStyle command adds a style to the all_styles that is
   specific to a given window ID.
2. The UserState is stored in the flag portion of a style.
3. There are four copies of the flags. The actual flags are stored in
   "flags". The mask of which flags have actually been set is in
   "flag_mask". To be honest, I haven't figured out how "flag_default"
   and "change_mask" are used.
4. The flag portions of styles are merged, bit-by-bit, at the end of
   merge_styles (style.c).
5. The flag sets for the State style are set toward the end of
   style_parse_one_style_option (style.c:~3650). In this chunk of code,
   states corresponds to the old states value, mask is a mask of which
   state bit is being set. This mask is then used to update state.
6. The common flags (SCF) are set to state. This appears to be
   correct.
7. The flag mask (SCM) is currently set to 1. I think this is
   incorrect. I think this should be set to
   S_USER_STATES(SCM(*ps)) | mask. Right now, only the bottom bit of the
   mask is ever changed.
8. I'm not sure how the change mask is used, but I suspect that it needs
   to be set differently.
9. I have no idea how the default mask is used.

I'm loathe to actually change the code in CVS, since I'm not even remotely
on the development team, so here is the snippet that I think needs to be
changed:

	else if (StrEquals(token, "State"))
	{
		spargs = GetIntegerArguments(rest, NULL, tmpno, 1);
		if (spargs == 1 && tmpno[0] >= 0 && tmpno[0] <= 31)
		{
			unsigned int old_state;
			unsigned int set_mask;
			unsigned int new_state;
			unsigned int flag_mask;
			unsigned int change_mask;
			unsigned int default_mask;

			old_state = S_USER_STATES(SCF(*ps));
			set_mask = (1 << tmpno[0]);
			new_state = old_state;
			if (on)
			{
				new_state |= mask;
			}
			else
			{
				new_state &= ~mask;
			}
			flag_mask = S_USER_STATES(SCM(*ps))
			flag_mask |= mask;
			change_mask = S_USER_STATES(SCC(*ps));
			change_mask |= ~(new_state ^ old_state)
			default_mask = S_USER_STATES(SCD(*ps));
			default_mask = ????;

			S_SET_USER_STATES(SCF(*ps), new_state);
			S_SET_USER_STATES(SCM(*ps), flag_mask);
			S_SET_USER_STATES(SCC(*ps), change_mask);
			S_SET_USER_STATES(SCD(*ps), default_mask);
		}
		else
		{
			fvwm_msg(
				ERR,"style_parse_one_style_option",
				"bad State arg: %s", rest);
		}
	}


Thanks again for all of your hard work. Hope this is useful.

The change_mask indicates which flags have been changed recently
but not yet applied to the corresponding windows.  The
flag_default is used to allow for non-zero default values if the
style has never been set (or its last instance has been deleted).
It is used only for a couple of old styles to allow backwards
compatibility.  It's usually not necessary to fiddle with the
defaults.

Yes.

The mask has to be or'ed into the change_mask too.  As far as I
know, the flag_mask and the change_mask are always treated the
same when a style is used.

> 9. I have no idea how the default mask is used.

It's irrelevant here.

Make that

Not that it matters.  For the "State" style, the change_mask is
never used because it applies only to new windows.

Just delete this.

o The change_mask indicates which flags have been changed recently
o but not yet applied to the corresponding windows.  The
o flag_default is used to allow for non-zero default values if the
o style has never been set (or its last instance has been deleted).
o It is used only for a couple of old styles to allow backwards
o compatibility.  It's usually not necessary to fiddle with the
o defaults.

Ah. I see.

o > 			change_mask |= mask;
o
o Not that it matters.  For the "State" style, the change_mask is
o never used because it applies only to new windows.

I assume you mean that "change_mask" is only for new windows. Right? I
mean, calling "WindowStyle State 3" during application should work...

Thanks again.

Forgive my ignorance of anything more than the basics of xlib stuff here,
I've read the XReparentWindow and related man pages, but I'd like to double
check i'm heading in the right direction..

I had assumed there was some reason why when I swallowed a window with
FvwmButtons (or Scott's FvwmTabs) it wouldnt get ConfigureNotify events
when moved (double checked with xev -window ..), not a big problem but it
meant that things like transparent terminals didnt work properly...but
messing around today, it seems pretty easy to pass the events to the
swallowed windows and it works exactly how I'd expect...am I missing
something?

Is it worth submiting the patch? Should it be optional, eg
Swallow(PassEvents, UseOld, etc...).

I've been using FvwmButtons to make some cool shaped window effects, like
this rounded aterm :)

Thanks.

Hello, looking in fvwm/conditional.c the Test command defaults to a match
being found, so checking for Test (True) Blah.. (around line 1611) is
essentially useless, shouldn't it default to no match, for example:

$ cvs diff conditional.c 
Index: conditional.c

This way Test ($0) in functions can look for True/False or similar :)

And what if $0 contains some meaningful Test option like "Version" or
"Quit"?  No, if you want to extend Test, you should add [!]IsEmpty or a
similar option and use quotes here, for example: Test (IsEmpty "$0").

IMHO, the Test condition should default to true just like with all other

There is a strong bug, with apple shake. if you get some windopw to the
surface of opengl, beginning a hard procesing, everything slowing down. 
So, you can't handle the opened window on shake. the frame is vibrating,
and you cant move the windows. 

thnx, nihylius

I see, how about changing the test for "True" to check for "False"?

Maybe I should expand on that, for example, right now:

Test (True) This will happen
Test (False) This will happen
Test (Blahblahblah) This will happen

but True is still tested for as an on-condition, if this was changed to
check for False and set match accordingly:

Test (True) This will happen
Test (False) This wont happen
Test (Blahblahblah) This will happen

so Test still defaults to a match, what do you think?

The last command should produce a syntax error, bad if it does not.
The Test command does not check that an arbitrary string is true, it
checks that the named condition is satisfied.

I think you misuse the intended condition syntax. As I said, you just
want a new IsEmpty or maybe IsTrue condition, i.e.:

  Test (IsTrue "$0") happens conditionally

Mikhael.

Ok, now Test behaves correctly in the False and Blahblahblah cases:

  Test          always-happens         # rc is Match
  Test ()       always-happens         # rc is Match
  Test (True)   always-happens         # rc is Match
  Test (False)  never-happens          # rc is NoMatch
  Test (!True)  never-happens          # rc is NoMatch
  Test (!False) always-happens         # rc is Match
  Test (Blahblahblah)  never-happens   # rc is Error
  Test (!Blahblahblah) never-happens   # rc is Error

It is not difficult to add IsTrue condition if you still need one.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've found the iconfile and miniiconfile variables really handy, but the
only limitation is that without knowing the ImagePath, their use is limited
to within fvwm image settings..with a minor alteration to get the full
path, they can still be used this way, and externally...

What do you think? :)

The ManualPlacement documentation says that if you hit Escape during
manual placement, the window is put in the top left corner of the
screen.  That was true in old (2.2?) FVWMs, but for some time it has
actually put the window at (-1, -1), ie one pixel off the upper left.
The following fixes this, but I don't know whether it has other
consequences.

What is exactly freeze for you? Please explain.

1) Does pressing Ctrl-Alt-Esc help?

2) Does adding line like "ModuleTimeout 5" to your config help?

3) How do you run fvwm, for example directly from .xinitrc, or maybe from
some session manager like gnome-config?

4) Other relevant info.

Mikhael.

I want to remove the ancient files TODO and BUGS, they only cause

I don't know. If X works well when started from MC, then it should be ok.

But you didn't say whether you experience the same problem when you start
X from the plain shell.

Are you sure? I mean Ctrl-Alt-Esc, not Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.

This is incorrect. It should be "exec", not "Exec". Do you have some
shell/unix command named "Exec" on your system?

> 4) Other relevant info.
> Please don`t kill me.

Why should I do this?

Please do the following.

Ensure /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm is the right version (I don't think you have
2.5.10 installed in this location, but who knows.) Run something like:

  /path/to/fvwm -V

The last line in ~/.xinitrc should look like:

  exec fvwm

But first try "exec fvwm -f /dev/null" line to see whether the problem is
in your .fvwm2rc configuration.

The man page says it should be now:

  Mouse 1 R A -

P.S. Can your mailer add "> " to quotes on reply, for easier reading?

Please write to the list, not to me privatelly. You are welcome to discuss
problems with 2.5.x on "fvwm-workers" list and to ask questions on "fvwm"
@fvwm.org list, see the web site for details.

And it`s continies on infinite loop! I think fvwm can`t print message to stderr/stdout.

I must say you that before xfree4.4.0 i`ve got 4.2.0 and i instold 4.4.0 over 4.2.0.
I think where may be old Xlibs. I don`t know. But fvwm compiled after instlling 4.4.0.
If you say i totally reinstall my X with removing current.
My mc is 4.6.1-pre1 and i`ll try to upgrade.

Sorry, my full .xinitrc:
----------
exec /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm
----------
Where "fvwm" is a link to the "fvwm2".

For my bad bugreport.

Oh, yes, i run configure with "--exec-prefix=/usrX11R6/fvwm"

Yes! It`s works with -f /dev/null! I think that problem in modules or modules interface.
See output from strace.

Hello, 

In regard to the bug report I submitted as brennanzl@xtra.co.nz (address discontinued):
incoming message #1107: 
Subject "disappeared window retains focus?"

I am now using v2.5.8 in combination with a newer version of the software that led me to report the problem.
The problem seems to have cleared.

Subject: Patch: New style, CenterPlacement, places new windows in center of
 screen

This is the first time I've ever submitted a patch to FVWM, so if I've
missed something, please let me know.

The below patch to the CVS sources adds a new style, CenterPlacement.
This style causes FVWM to place new windows in the center of the screen
if they do not request a position using window manager hints or a
geometry specification.

Example usage:

	Style * CenterPlacement

The patch includes an update to the man page describing the new style.

I hope people find this useful.  I was motivated to code this patch
because my previous method for getting new windows to appear in the
center of the screen was to use FvwmEvent's add_window command, but that
requires that the window appear first before it is moved to the center
of the screen, which is too jumpy visually.

Hi Mikhael,

Is there a way to find out the mini icon associated with a window
via the perllib interface?

I suppose I could issue the following command from within FvwmTabs:

WindowId $winId SendToModule FvwmTabs fn setMiniIcon $winId $[w.miniiconfile]

but that seems a bit cumbersome ... is there a better way?

Is not this the last (name) field of M_MINI_ICON event?

Hi Mikhael,

: Is not this the last (name) field of M_MINI_ICON event?

Ah, of course.

: Of course you clomber all names in your WindowList patch as far as I
: understand it.
: I had some idea about how to fix this.

Do tell.

Would you like me to fix it?

SCoTT. :)

You may submit an updated patch if you have one. But this is optional, I
planned to improve it anyway before commiting. Maybe in a week.

Fvwm version: 2.5.11 (from cvs)

I think I found a bug in EdgeCommand. To reproduce start Fvwm with this
config:

DestroyFunc NorthFunc
AddToFunc NorthFunc
+ I Echo "North"

EdgeCommand North Function NorthFunc

While the mouse pointer rests over the top edge, the Echo command is
executed over and over, with a CPU load of 100%. This only occurs when the
command to EdgeCommand is a complex function, a normal command is executed
just once, as it should.

Best regards

Hello,

According to the man page of FvwmConsole, all resources set for xterm
are inherited. But it is not the case if xterm's resources are set
using class name, i.e. this works:

xterm*background: white

but this doesn't:

XTerm*background: white

though both are supposed to work, as xterm itself makes use both
of xterm* and XTerm*.

The reality is quite opposite to what you say, unless you invoke
FvwmConsole using some non-standard way that you don't tell us.

FvwmConsole does not do anything with resources, it just starts xterm
-name FvwmConsole -title FvwmConsole, that creates a window with class
"XTerm" and resource "FvwmConsole". Try FvwmIdent on this window.

So it matches all "XTerm*", but not "xterm*". And you may just configure:
FvwmConsole*background: #003030
FvwmConsole*foreground: white

Mikhael.

Once again it seems that it is a problem with Debian's package:
(by "once again" I refer to the recent topic called
"FVWM: Usage of FvwmEvent." in fvwm@fvwm.org mailing list).

Indeed, using freshly compiled fvwm (2.5.10) I get exactly the same
behaviour you have described, but using Debian's package not only
does the things work as I wrote previously, but setting resources
via FvwmConsole*background etc. doesn't work at all.

Go figure.

Forgotten to say - fvwm's version (in Debian package)
is 2.5.10-6 (the "-6" is Debian specific).

I think Debian replaces "xterm" in FvwmConsole with "x-terminal-emulator"
that may be any random application and may not even support resources.

You may create debian packages from clean sources by "make deb-dist".

Hello,

I'm a member of I18n/zh_CN team, while we had done a lot of work on GNU
soft/KDE/GNOME. We're now want to get fvwm localized to zh_CN. If it is
possible, it would be better that issue a cvs account for me.

We'll maintain our works through a web interface, which is located at
i18n.ricetons.com.

Thanx.

You may send patches.  I don't know if someone will commit them.

Why is the web interface you mention, http://i18n.ricetons.com,

Hi Mikhael,

A question for you:

Some apps (for example GVim) appear to have their own icons built in &
I'm wondering if there's a way to access them somehow? (through the
perllib interface of course)

Using the WindowList tracker, M_MINI_ICON events have the value
"ewmh_mini_icon" for the name/mini_icon_name field. Not useful to
FvwmTabs as I can't load the image.

I'm trying to associate mini icons with each tab in FvwmTabs. See:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/tmp/fvwmtabs.icons.png

Any ideas?

SCoTT. :)

There is no much to translate currently in fvwm, but you may add your
language to the existing po/ directory. Maybe in the future we will
compose a better set of standard strings for modules/core, that we will
ask translators to translate.

If you want, you may translate fvwm-themes.

You may submit your finished work by email in the way of patches or
complete files. If you do this often, we may think about the cvs access.

Mikhael.

I suppose you mean field named icon_id in M_MINI_ICON in perllib.

Are you sure you can't just embed the mini icon window by its id?
You will need to do this anyway, since I think Tk does not support png.

If you are at it, feel free to update FvwmWindowMenu to use WindowList
tracker and to support ewmh mini icons (I guess, you need to patch fvwm
menus a bit to support mini-icons by window id, in addition to by name).
:-)

Mikhael.

Ah, I can do a XGetImage($icon_id).

Don't think so. There appears to be only one copy of each mini icon
(pixmap) in the X server - the same icon_id can be used by multiple
windows.

Tk supports PNG images just fine - I am currently using them in
FvwmTabs.

Sure. I'm currently implementing a whole bunch of new features for
FvwmTabs - I'll look at FvwmWindowMenu after I release the next version.

Ok.

I'm in the process of moving the CVS server around, so things may be
iffy for a bit.  It shouldn't take long to get everything going again.

Last week I submitted a patch to create a new style, CenterPlacement.  I
didn't see any comments about it and I don't see the changes in the CVS
sources, so I'm wondering if there was something wrong with the way that
I submitted my patch?

Just curious.

I guess it always takes some time until a FVWM worker looks at your
code. They're busy people, I suppose ;)
Wait some time, I think you will get an answer.

Patches should be complete.

Missing from this patch are updates to:

 fvwm/fvwm.1.in
 AUTHORS
 NEWS
 ChangeLog

For extra credit, update:

 sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc-sample-1 Line 56 to use CenterPlacement
 tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc to add centerplacement test(s)


I'd like to see centerplacement added, if none of the other
developers object, I might apply the patch.  Preferably a complete
patch...

Per Dan's request that I submit a complete patch, I've updated my recent
CenterPlacement patch to be as complete as I can make it.  The attached
file contains changes to these files:

	AUTHORS
	ChangeLog
	NEWS
	fvwm/fvwm.1.in
	fvwm/fvwm.h
	fvwm/placement.c
	fvwm/style.c
	sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc-sample-1

I was unable to figure out how to write a test for the CenterPlacement
style, so I didn't change tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc.

I hope the FVWM developers find this functionality useful.

I'll take a close look at the patch, probably this weekend.
For the purify.fvm2rc, all that is needed is an invocation of
the command.  We run that file under a debugger that checks
for memory leaks and uninitialized variables.  No need to resubmit
for that, I'll take care of it.

I've been wondering if CenterPlacement isn't a special case of something
else, like "TopCenterPlacement" or "UpperRightCornerPlacement" but so far,
no useful insight has come to me so I think this is OK.

Hi all,

FvwmCommand currently misbehaves if it receives a sigPIPE. Of
particular annoyance, it leaves a FIFO hanging around which means that
subsequent invocations of FvwmCommand fail.

This patch makes FvwmCommand behave much more nicely.

SCoTT. :)

Hi,

I posted a bug report a week ago (incoming/1284). Since then I
investigated the problem a bit more, and found it to be MIT-SHM related
(and independent of any configuration file; does the same with a zero
conffile, ie. fvwm -f /dev/null).

I managed to hunt down the bug (at least I hope so:-), here's a patch. (I
can't say that I fully understand the intent of that "if" statement in
line 127. So there may be an other - cleaner - solution.)

bye,

norbi

Without the "if" statement, if you compile without shm support you get
a warnning. Note that there are no ifdef in the code, however the
compilation is "conditional".

I've applied the patch, Thanks!

Subject: Pixmaps for borderstyles in 2.5

Full_Name: Evgeny Stambulchik
Version: 2.5.8
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.6.5-gentoo-r1 x86_64
X_Server: X.Org version: 6.7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (132.77.4.129)


In 2.5.*, when a pixmap is used for window borders, the right border is
rendered separately (with shifted origin) using the pixmap, whereas in
2.4.* the same pixmap was used, so for gradiented pixmaps it looks now
(2.5) ugly. Please see
http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/~fnevgeny/tmp/2.4.18.png and
http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/~fnevgeny/tmp/2.5.8.png.

Regards,

Evgeny

Any reason why the FvwmTheme module should not be completely
removed?

Compatibility only. Many configs probably still use the original colorset
syntax, i.e. "*FvwmTheme: Colorset". And 2.4.x is forward compatible too,
it supports the new Colorset syntax (by: SendToModule FvwmTheme).

Maintaining FvwmTheme is a no work. We may remove it in 2.7.x.

Mikhael.

This is a feature. Now the window resizing and moving over other windows
do not flicker at all (smooth and fast decorations).

I don't think it is possible to have both the old look and not the
constant border redrawing on interactive Resize. Yes, it is sad, but
flickering is more annoying, I don't even want to recall how ugly it was.

So although I would definitelly like to have the way to define border
images nicely in the future, I think this may be done after 2.6.x.

Mikhael.

In EWMH_SetWMDesktop, you're setting _NET_WM_DESKTOP to 0xFFFFFFFE if the
window is supposed to be 'sticky across all desktops'. However
http://freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec/index.html#id2768578 says this
value should be set to 0xFFFFFFFF, so applications which follows this spec
will break. We've plugged the bug on our side (xmms) but should be fixed in
FVWM aswell.

This is a small patch that allows multiple window names to be specified
in conditions.  I've tried to write it with the same style used in the
rest of the code, although some variable names may be a bit terse by your
standards.  The patch keeps the window names in a linked list.  It
includes updates to the man page and ChangeLog.  The patch is against the
current CVS code.  What exactly it does is best described by the modified
portion of the man page:

--------

       In addition, the conditions may include one or  more  window  names  to
       match to.  The window names may include the wildcards '*' and '?'.  The
       window name,  icon  name,  class,  and  resource  are  considered  when
       attempting to find a match.  If more than one window name is given, the
       implicit operator is a boolean OR -- that is,  the  condition  will  be
       satisfied  if  the window has any of those names.  Each window name can
       begin with '!' which prevents command if any of the window  name,  icon
       name, class or resource match.  Mixtures of window names beginning with
       '!' and window names without '!'  are allowed.  The general rule is  as
       follows:  if  any  of the window names with '!' match, the condition is
       not satisfied; otherwise if any of the names without '!' match,  or  if
       there are no names without '!', then the condition is satisfied.

       Examples:

                 Next (Netscape konqueror Mozilla*) WarpToWindow 99 90

       This  goes to the next web browser window, no matter which of the three
       named web browsers is being used.

                 Next (XTerm !xterm3) WarpToWindow 99 90

       This goes to the next xterm window, except that the one named  "xterm3"
       (with the -name option to xterm) is excluded.

                 Next (!XTerm !rxvt !emacs !Netscape !konqueror !Mozilla* \
                      !xdvi !xpdf) WarpToWindow 99 90

       This goes to the next window which doesn't have one of the above names.

>     Next (Netscape konqueror Mozilla*) WarpToWindow 99 90

This is a nice implementation of an "OR" rule, is there any way of specifying
and "AND" rule? For example, a rule to match a window with Class "Netscape" 
and Title "local*". Now that multiple window names can be read, why not
include one.

For example, i would want these to this expression
All (Netscape) ThisWindow (local*) ...
to be reduced to 
All (Netscape local*)

But this is exactly the syntax used by this patch, hence it means "OR".
By default, all other conditions must be true, so i propose an alternate
syntax for window name/class/resource "OR" conditions:
All (Netscape |konqueror |Mozilla*) ...

Perhaps it's not worth the effort?
I just thought it was a little counter-intuitive.

This also works well with "not" commands:
All (Netscape |konqueror |Mozilla* !Opera) ...
will match all browsers except opera if "!Opera" is read as an "AND NOT"
(which is subtly different to the patch syntax's implied "OR NOT")

I guess one could implement an "OR NOT" rule, but i strongly doubt the 
usefulness of it.

I'd imagine a _full_ implementation of this would require a linked list
of linked lists so one can specify multiple OR conditions eg.:
All (Netscape |konqueror  http* |file* !http://www.google*)
would match all netscape and konqueror windows with titles that start with 
either http or file but not showing google. Note the "not google" rule needn't
be applied to a specific list as its evaluation to true anywhere negates the
rule.

But of course a simpler (perhaps better too) method would just implement:
All (Netscape |konqueror |http |file !opera)

Of course, these are all just suggestions :)

Great patch though,

- Craig
