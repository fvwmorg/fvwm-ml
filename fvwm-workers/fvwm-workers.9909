Sorry, I don't understand what you want to tell me. Are you
saying that the contents of the buttons has shifted compared
to earlier versions? But I can't imagine you see all or some
of your buttons at x=0/1 y=0/1 (isn't that what x modulo 2
and y modulo 2 mean?).

The contents is ok, it is only the wrong button activated, when I
press buttons with x and y positions 2 and 3 (starting from 0).
So if I press (1,0) I get (1,0), but if I press (3,2) I get (1,0) too.

The configuration for the buttons is in
  http://wm-icons.dhs.org/data/wm-icons-current/etc/fvwm2rc-compact-buttons

Also maybe `locate Mikhael-desk-1152x864.gif` helps.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually you should get three that strech all the way across, and one of
the other two winds up on desk 0 page 1 1, and desk 1 page 0 1. and only
the three that stech are defined as sticky.  The idea is the one on page
1 1 is just for gimp windows which are defined as StartsOnPage 0 1 1.
The other does the same thing only for my gui builder.  So in a word yes
that is how it is supposed to look.

I just tested your commit and it seems to have taken care of it.  I'll
use it through today and let you know.  As for your odd BadMatch message,
could it be something todo with that XMoveResizeWindow listed above.

Brad.

P.S. on a FvwmButtons note, another thread had mentioned some odd
behavior with buttons, I think a problem I'm having is related.  I just
have one button that performs an action (Close) defined.  And when I
click it nothing seems to happen, this may be related to the others
threads comment about some modulous stuff gone ary.

It's fixed now. Can you please verify if the fix works with
buttons in containers in containers too (both levels of containers
must not start in button 0/0 of the parent).

If I have rxvt windows iconified, exit fvwm and start fvwm 2.3.7
it doesn't seem to know which windows were iconfied, at exit, and
it opens my rxvt windows.  This doesn't happen with 2.2.2.

Jason,

would you please put the tarball in the usual place (version-2)?
I have updated the web pages too, and as far as I know all
outstanding web update issues have been cleaned up. So please
install the web pages too (pllus the necessary scripts to update
them automatically).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I don't know. I've just checked in a patch that prints the contents of
each ConfigureNotify event in IconMan. Could you download it and see
if it shows something strange (especially if it crashes)?

Yes, it works with two container levels non starting from (0,0) too.
Good work.

I know that the 2.3.x versions are beta versions (development), but how
stable is it nowadays?  Are there any more things to be added, or is it
in "feature freeze" yet and only bug fixes are now going to be put in?

I'd really like to check how it builds on Tru64 Unix (I'm running the
new 5.0 release), and if it still works with tkgoodstuff.  I figured
that I'd do this sort of testing when new features stopped being added
and its development was in bug-fix-only mode.

Submission from: (NULL) (168.143.0.8)


Bug #446, which reported that bug #422 had returned, is listed as
fixed by Dominik.  On my system, the bug doesn't seem to be
fixed.  Could this be looked at again?  Dominik's original
#422 fix did work for me, but the latest fix-to-the-correction-to-the-
fix-of-422 does not.

Thanks!

Yes, Restart doesn't do what it used to and what I liked it to do.
You can either simmply 'Restart', but then fvwm remembers everything,
including the size and positions of the modules I want to restart,
and when you 'Restart --dont-preserve-state' it forgets about icons
and shaded windows. I don't like either version :-(

  I thought that looked interesting, so, not having seen it before, I read
up on it in the man page. I can understand pretty-well what's going on,
but to get it working an example would be handy. Like the
fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh that's not in /utils ...

  I thought that looked interesting, so, not having seen it before, I read
up on it in the man page. I can understand pretty-well what's going on,
but to get it working an example would be handy. Like the
fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh that's not in /utils ...

It is not clear from your message whether you exit using Quit or Restart 
and whether you use session manager. Anyway, AFAIK, 2.2.2 does not have
session support and the only thing it remembers about windows is their
desk and only if you don't exit X, of course.

fvwm never remembers any window state if you exit using Quit and start
it again, even if you use SM (you must shutdown session instead of exiting
fvwm). If you exit using Restart, it must remember window states for
versions starting from 2.3.0.

If your 2.3.7 doesn't remember iconification state on Restart can you
please give more details (say, whether it remembers other window states;
and for others than rxvt windows)?

Regards,
Mikhael.

It _is_ in utils/. Ok, it was absent for several days. :)
You can look at fvwm-menu-directory as an example. There will be added in
several days another script fvwm-menu-headlines (freshmeat, slashdot,
linuxtoday and other online headlines in your menus), which can be used
with DynamicPopupAction too.

Mikhael.

I exit using Quit.  I'm not intentionally using the session manager.
I just looked for an .fvwm_restart file, found one, removed it, tried
everything again, with the same result.

When I exit my window manager, I use "xprompt" to prompt me for the
next thing to run.  (X continues to run.)  I'm getting the problem
when I type in "fvwm2 -v 2.3.7".  (There's an fvwm2 shell in the
picture.)  When I type in "fvwm2 -v 2.2.2", my windows come back the
way they were when I exited.

I don't think thats correct.  2.2.2 and before always restored all my
windows to the correct iconification and desk state.

XEmacs, xlogout and contool are coming back iconfied.  The only windows
that change state are rxvt windows.  (Just added an xterm window.  It
also doesn't remember its state.)

The new stuff still to be done is:

 - complete colour set support (a few modules and fvwm itself)
 - finish new FvwmButtons panels and remove the old code
 - finish the transients raising/lowering rework
 - possibly change the way how menus are posted with a click

As long as these things are not resolved I'll still apply
patches and do a few minor minor enhancements on request
(there are zillions of enhancement requests left to implement).
The most new stuff must still be tested thoroughly and the
many potential problems be fixed.

I hope to get out of the 'code-and-fix' mode within the next
two weeks and enter 'debug-and-fix' mode (followed by
'code-ans-fix' - you see, there's a lot of fixing to be
done :-) )

Bye

I agree. If only the two windows moved it would only confuse the user.

Of course. I was just unable to turn that new feature off again.

Okay.

That is exactly what Raise/LowerTransientStrict are doing now (without
any patches). I wrote this a while ago. I tend to remove this feature
again because it happens too often by accident. E.g. if you have a
Move-and-Raise function bound to the window title the window toggles
above or below its transients each time it's used. Very ugly.

Take your time, we're not in a hurry.

Nothing :) if it doesn't slow things down dramatically I have
no objections.

BTW, since you wrote the last patch I made a small but important
patch to stack.c. Please fetch a current development snapshot
and merge it with your patch.

Bye

The name .fvwm_restart is not used anymore, it was renamed, but one is
not supposed to remove the restart file anyway, it is autodeleted on
restarts and not used otherwise (when you do Quit, for example).

Oh, I am not correct here, iconification is restored for 2.2.

Hmm, I can't reproduce this. For me nothing is restored for the current
version when I do Quit and start fvwm from xterm again.
Maybe someone who familar with Recapture code can help here. Matthias?

Dominik,


Enclosed, three patches in a tarball - applied with:

 $ cd <your fvwm-2.3.6 source tree top>
 $ cat <untar'd patches directory>/00* | patch -p1


Patch files:

001-fix.fvwm-2.3.6-LowerTransient

 Fixes a logic bugette in must_move_transients()

002-patch.fvwm-2.3.6-StackTransientParent

 Implements (Dont)StackTransientParent as suggested in your mail:
 Raise/Lower on a transient moves the parent window too.

 Only one level of transientfor is handled. I think we should
 consider extending it to handle whole trees of transient windows.
 I conviced myself earlier this year that the penalty of extra scans
 along stack_next->... is not large. What do you think?

003-patch.fvwm-2.3.6-RaiseTransientStrict

 Implements RaiseTransientStrict as proposed in my earlier mail:
 turns RaiseTransient ON, but does not allow the main window above
 its transients.

 There is a conflict here in that DontRaiseTransient followed by
 RaiseTransientStrict will turn RaiseTransient ON. Is it best to
 simply point that out in the manual page, or to apply some trap in
 the style parsing ?

Well, go ahead.

Just don't toggle RaiseTransient flag. I see no real reason in
doing this.  Furthermore I'd prefer that 'strict' is the default
because of the reasons I wrote in my last mail.  And don't forget
that 'strict' affects raising as well as lowering. Perhaps it
should better be named '(Dont)RaiseLowerTransientLenient'?
The name is a bit too long for my liking, perhaps a different one
is better?

--------- after testing the patches ----------

Excellent work, Mark :-) Everything works smooth now. I will commit
the three patches you sent me today.  There are only minor things
to be done:

 1) Write a patch for the man page.
 2) Write a patch for the NEWS, AUTHORS and ChangeLog files.
 3) Find an acceptable default behaviour and put the necessary
    lines in ConfigFvwmDefaults.
 4) The LowerTransient style has no equivalent LowerTransientStrict
    style. How about '(Dont)StackTransientLenient'? This would
    augment RaiseTransient/LowerTransient and have no effect if
    neither of the two is used.

BTW, a single patch is enough for all the changes.

When this is finished we are very close to the point where we
will stop writing new features for 2.4 and begin testing and
debugging :-)

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I think this should be on the 2.4 "must do" list.

It would also be nice if we stopped all the extra window reparenting
that happens during startup.

Dominik,
     since you are currently working on FvwmButtons, I had a couple of
questions/requests relating to that module.

 1. If one defines an FvwmButton with a panel, could you have fvwm
    automatically add a small arrow-like indicator inside that button to
    indicate the existence and direction of the panel (the arrow I'm talking
    about would be similar to Netscape's small black arrow-indicator inside
    its "Back" or "Forward" buttons)

 2. Is there a way to toggle an FvwmButton (pressed-in/out look) to indicate
    different states ?  In other words, if I wanted to have a button that
    would tell me whether "Paging" is enable or not; or if I wanted a button
    that would indicate if I have auto-locking enabled or not.

    AddToMenu MiniScrollMenu
    +       "ON"                    EdgeScroll 100 100 (PRESSED-LOOK)
    +       "OFF"                   EdgeScroll 0 0     (NON-PRESSED-LOOK)

    *FvwmButtons Paging clamp.xpm Popup MiniScrollMenu

    -OR-

    *FvwmButtons Paging clamp.xpm (Pressed EdgeScroll 100 100, EdgeScroll 0 0)

    -OR-

I want to implement a new special fvwm function EnterFunction and would
like to hear your comments first if any.

This function (if defined) will be executed on startup and restart just
before the appropriate *InitFunction or *RestartFunction and is supposed
to be used for module startup and some other static initializations.
This will allow to define modules once; now users add most of the used
modules to InitFunction, RestartFunction and (in case a user uses SM)
to SessionInitFunction and SessionRestartFunction.

So a typical user would define EnterFunction (to start modules) and
InitFunction (to start initial applications) and probably leave
RestartFunction, SessionInitFunction and SessionRestartFunction empty
or undefined. But the flexibility to define absolutely independent
starting functions still remains.

The name of the proposed function is chosen as an opposite to the existing
ExitFunction, which is unconditionally executed on exit. A better name?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, with ColorSet support all done in FvwmButtons, couldn't
FvwmButtons be setup to look like the Wharf fairly easily?  I'll play around
with it later, and if I can reproduce it, I could make a sample config, and
FvwmWharf could probably be removed...

The man page is very ambigous about this:

           AddToDecor flatness
            + ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \
              Inactive (-- flat)
            + TitleStyle -- flat
            + BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
            + HilightColor white navy
            + Style "flatness" UseDecor flatness, \
              Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4

           Style "xterm" UseStyle flatness

     An existing window's decor may be  reassigned  with
     ChangeDecor,  or  a  Style  command  followed  by a
     Recapture.  The decorations of all windows or of  a
     specific  decor  can  be  updated  with UpdateDecor
     (useful after decorations  are  modified;  changing
     Style  options  requires  a  Recapture instead).  A
     decor can be destroyed with DestroyDecor.

Technically this is all correct, but the 'UseStyle' style is not really
a style but instructs fvwm to built the final style from the styles
given with UseStyle. I.e. a style is updated when the decor changes,
but the style is not the one the windows are using. In the above
example the 'flatness' style is changed, but xterms use the 'xterm'
style, not the 'flatness' style. To make your xterms really use flatness,
the line 'Style "xterm" UseStyle flatness' must be issued again or
be added to the decor:

           AddToDecor flatness
            + ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \ 
              Inactive (-- flat)
            + TitleStyle -- flat 
            + BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset 
            + HilightColor white navy
            + Style "flatness" UseDecor flatness, \
              Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4
            + Style "xterm" UseStyle flatness

I'll clarify this in the man page.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

     a big problem.
     [fixed]
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow

You can simply use an icon in the panel button (at least with the new
panel implementation, but I guess it's the same with the old one).

No.

Phew, how would FvwmButtons know what you want? Especially to watch
fvwm configuration options is nigh impossible without re-implementing
fvwm in FvwmButtons. I'm sure there must exist an applications that
can indicate generic state changes with pixmaps. Such an application
could simply be swallowed (e.g. to indicate new mail).

I think it is a useful option. Probably I would not use it for normal
menus (although I remember one guy does), but I would rather use it for
special autogenerated menus (directory tree as an example), where you can
easily get 40 open menus on the screen. It is nice to be able to leave
only the last one, especially if you can always return to the parent
menu (like in: fvwm-menu-directory --special-dirs).

The problem is that currently PopupAsRootMenu does not work for these
dynamic menus. Because all menus are poped down while there is a line
  + DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu "/dir"
and MissingSubmenuFunction is not reexecuted on PopupAsRootMenu,
so fvwm complains: "[FVWM][menu_func]: <<ERROR>> No such menu /dir".
Is it possible not to pop down and then pop up again the last menu if
it is already up?

>  11) Add FvwmKb module?

I have just tried to compile it and got a compilation error. My g++ is
near to the latest. I think that it would be better not to have any C++
source code, if possible, just to reduce compiler problems.

The idea of FvwmKb is very good, may help anyone using multi-lingua.
Although, since the author optionally wants to add support for other WMs
and there is own configure, maybe it is better not include it?
Personally, I would prefer to rewrite it to C (ufff) and include. :)

>  36) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)

I am unintentionally testing this while working on fvwm-menu scripts.

I think, you should include:
  * Test the new session manager code (appeared only in 2.3.0)

There are many problems with it. Although, I run fvwm in gnome-session
without big problems for several months already. xsm is more problematic.
The most annoying bug is a broken window stack on startups/restarts
(fvwm thinks the window is in the bottom, but it is shown on the top).

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Erm...yes, but I haven't had time to make much progress lately, what
with other commitments. I'll try to apply a fix to CVS soon for testing,
though I'm not really satisfied with it.

	The problem is that ill-behaved windows like KFM's override_redirect
abominations are really incompatible with FVWM's new layer architecture.
It's conceptually the same problem as the RaiseOverNativeWindows hack
for Exceed users: to preserve the stacking order, all the windows from
the target of a Raise upward have to be raised over the unmanaged
windows (in this case the override_redirects, not the native Windows
ones).

	This is what I did (in a quick 'n dirty hard-coded hack - I need to add
the GlobalOpts logic and apply it against a more recent CVS). It works,
though I'm not really wild about the result, with all that extra
window-raising, but I don't see any other reasonable way around it.

	I did fantasize a bit about adding a GlobalOpts
Override_RedirectIsEvil, which would be used to consign all
override_redirect windows to a permanent StaysOnBottom status, or maybe
to destroy them as soon as an app tried to create them (I always
resented KFM's forcing little icons on my desktop that I didn't want
there).

	I'll try to put in a fix this weekend.


Cheers,
- Bob

  Possibly StartFunction (matches Restart... - but doesn't match Exit...
:-/ )

  I agree that it's getting a little crowded now with all these auto-run
functions - do we really want to add *another* bnuilt-in one when, e.g.
(what I have, below), works? It's not like it's complicated.


AddToFunc _BootFunction  \
   "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+  "I" FvwmEvent
+  "I" PipeRead ModuleList
+  "I" FvwmPager 0 0
+  "I" FvwmAnimate


AddToFunc InitFunction   \
   "I" FvwmBanner
+  "I" Function _BootFunction


AddToFunc RestartFunction   \
   "I" Function _BootFunction
+  "I" Next [Xticker] Raise


  I think I'd suggest that a hint to do this within the manual page might
be easier!

This really hurts my brain.  I didn't know you could add a style command
to a decor.  I'm not really sure I see the point anyway. I thought the
decors were supposed to be called from styles, not the other way around
e.g.

Style "xterm" UseDecor flatness

and then you can change the flatness decor and do an UpdateDecor to get
a new look without a recapture.

Dominik, you understand this stuff, could you rewrite the man page
examples to not use the same name for styles and decors? It's very
confusing even if it is very clever.

Cheers,
Tim.

Neither did I. I discovered it by trial and error.

The decors are working properly, but the 'UseStyle' style does not.
When you use

  style foo Usestyle bar

style foo gets updated immediately with all settings made in the
style bar already. Future modifications of bar have no effect on
foo. BTW, all this UseStyle stuff is a *huge* memory leak and I bet
there are abundant possibilities of getting a coredump. UseStyle
simply uses memcpy to overwrite already set styles!

Uh, how did you get this idea? I just investigated #315, and what
I wrote in the man page is the workaround for the problem.

Okay, I'll do it.

FvwmWinList is done, the missing ones are IconBox, Script, TaskBar,
Wharf and possibly FvwmBacker. I don't think TaskBar, Wharf and Backer
are in the must category. What they do can be replicated with other
modules. If we release 2.4 with them incomplete it may inspire someone
to add colorset support to them. I won't be doing any of them in the
forseeable future, I don't use them so I can't test them properly.

>  77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
>  78) Implement colour sets in window styles.

Maybe these should be moved to the optional category. MenuStyle already
does everything a colorset would do (apart from shaping).  Adding it to
styles could be very tricky and it might make more sense to do that as
part of a serious rewrite of the style/decor stuff.

> To do (optional)

>  79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole.

This should be in the unlikely category of the enhancement requests. I
just had a quick hack and the xterm from /usr/openwin/bin/xterm on
Solaris draws in a child of the top level window. It sets $WINDOWID but
that window isn't visible.  Using xlswins I found the window to draw in
by guesswork and even though you can set the background as soon as you
type xterm draws characters in a rectangle of it's background color. It
looks a real mess.

I don't know if other term emulators would work better and it might be
possible to patch one to allow FvwmConsoleC to apply colorsets to it
succesfully, but what do we do then? Do we support an FvwmTerm? Do we
support a patch to another term?

Cheers,
Tim.

  So far, I think I've traced this to: if I'm using OLDecor, then /yes/
fvwm (decorations.c) processes these correctly, and removes the window
header for an OL-hinted window.

  But my window has no MWM hints, and the code seems to default to MWM_ALL
- this then doesn't get changed, and it seems to see this later on and
assert all of MWM's hints (max/min/etc.) which induces a window header.

  Am I right? Can someone see a fix?

  I think now that the problem is this: decorations.c's SelectDecor() sets
t->functions according to OLDecor prefs., but not 'decor'. It's 'decor'
that determines whether one gets a header, and this hasn't had the MWM
flags (that are equivalent to the OL ones) reset accordingly, so that
effectively OL hints are ignored in the decor.

  I'm going to /try/ to figure out a change, but I wouldn't hold your
breath - if anyone else understands this code more than I ...

I don't understand this but this section in decorations.c looks like it
is missing out on clearing the MWM_TITLE flag:

  /* Now I have the un-altered decor and functions, but with the
   * ALL attribute cleared and interpreted. I need to modify the
   * decorations that are affected by the functions */
  if(!(t->functions & MWM_FUNC_RESIZE))
    decor &= ~MWM_DECOR_RESIZEH;
  /* MWM_FUNC_MOVE has no impact on decorations. */
  if(!(t->functions & MWM_FUNC_MINIMIZE))
    decor &= ~MWM_DECOR_MINIMIZE;
  if(!(t->functions & MWM_FUNC_MAXIMIZE))
    decor &= ~MWM_DECOR_MAXIMIZE;
  /* MWM_FUNC_CLOSE has no impact on decorations. */

  /* This rule is implicit, but its easier to deal with if
   * I take care of it now */
  if(decor & (MWM_DECOR_MENU| MWM_DECOR_MINIMIZE | MWM_DECOR_MAXIMIZE))
    decor |= MWM_DECOR_TITLE;


Maybe all it takes is to add:

  if(!(t->functions & MWM_DECOR_TITLE))
    decor &= ~MWM_DECOR_TITLE;

between the two blocks.

Cheers,
Tim.

  OK, here's a patch to fvwm/decorations.c that seems to stop it ignoring
OLDecor hints when there aren't a full set of MWM hints.

  Don't ask me why it works, I don't understand what I've done (i.e.,
what's the diff. between the flags i nt->functions & decor?). But it works
for me.

  Anyone want to comment?

  I dunno. I can try it, but from looking at it, I think it's probably
more complicated than that. It really depends upon what functions/decor
relate to.

I just tried this with FvwmWinList and it does get things in the right
order. Unfortunately it also causes fvwm to lock up on a Recapture. I
don't know what's happening here but the changes I made were to send an
unlock immediately on every packet recieved by FvwmWinList except for
M_ICONIFY (the unlock goes out after the animate message in M_ICONIFY). 
I guess that since fvwm grabs the server during a recpature it means
that FvwmWinList locks trying to update it's window and can't receive
any more messages.

I'm just wondering if it would be easier to add a command to fvwm to
fill in the icon location of a particular NoIcon window.  FvwmWinList
could send this command for every button it had:

sprintf(icon_rectangle, "NoIconLocation %d %d %d %d", x, y, w, h);
SendText(fd, icon_rectangle, window_id);

There would be no need to change FvwmAnimate as it would think a normal
iconification had happened when it gets the numbers. There would be no
need to make FvwmWinList a LOCKONSEND module as it would send the
coordinates as soon as it created a button.  There would be no need to
hardcode a message to FvwmAnimate into FvwmWinList.  It would also
resolve the problem of what happens if two modules want to do NoIcon
animation, only one of them would win.

The only problem I can see with this is what happens if the module that
sets the NoIconLocation dies. Maybe a DefaultNoIconLocation command is
needed as well.

Cheers,
Tim.

If I run configure --enable-kanji, then FvwmWinList.c fails to
compile.  What's happening is that it #defines XDrawString to
XmbDrawString, and later #includes (indirectly) Xlib.h, resulting
in this garbage:

I got it to compile if I moved the #ifdef I18N_MB paragraph to after
all the #includes, though something more fine-grained might be
appropriate.

BTW, shouldn't --enable-kanji be something less specific, like, say,
--enable-multibyte?

fvwm/fvwm.h uses __attribute__((__noreturn__)) which is a gcc
specific extension, and is not available on at least Sun's
compiler (and probably others).  Here's a patch to remove it;
I haven't investigated other ways of removing the warning it
prevents.

(A question, not entirely related.  There are still loads of
prototype mismatch errors, mostly signed / unsigned ints, though
some others that look more serious.  Is it feasible to get
rid of all of these by 2.4, or is it too much work / impossible?)

Subject: build breaks with Solaris make

Full_Name: Danek Duvall
Version: snapshot 19990831
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.8
X_Server: Openwindows 3.6.2
Submission from: (NULL) (209.233.33.110)


There are three Makefiles where the use of the automatic variable
$< breaks using Solaris make.  The man page says that $< is only
reliable in implicit rules, and the explicit rules are exactly
where it breaks.  GNU make does not have this limitation (in
addition to having lots of more useful constructs, but that's
beside the point).

The three (auto-)Makefiles are:

modules/FvwmConsole/Makefile.am (line 17)
modules/FvwmForm/Makefile.am (line 55)
utils/Makefile.am (line 33)

One of those good news, bad news kind of things.

I'm also not sure what could be happening during recapture.

During  my last foray into  the  module interface  I noticed some code
related to lock on send, fvwm grabs and M_ICONIFY. I think it disabled
lockonsend during grabs.  (I don't think it was  my code.)  I wondered
at the time why the code was ignoring M_DEICONIFY.  Before we give up
on lockonsend, I think it would be worth changing this.

The key concept here is FvwmWinList knows where its going to put
the icon, before the window is iconified?

I don't think that helps FvwmIconMan, or windows being created iconic.

Yes, it will send the NoIconLocation command as soon as it gets the
M_ADD_WINDOW or the M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW message that tells it that the
window is a NoIcon style.  It would only send it if it creates a button
for the window.

This isn't specific to FvwmWinList any of the winlist type modules could
do it.

> or windows being created iconic.

I'm not sure how a StartIconinc windows looks from the point of view of
a module. It might just work or it might give a spurious iconify at
start up.

Cheers,
Tim.

Isn't FvwmIconMan empty until a window is iconified?
FvwmTaskBar presents the same problem.

I think FvwmIconBox is different, but I remember complaints about it
having icons for things that aren't iconfied yet.

Agreed, something created iconic, doesn't need animation.


I'm still thinking lockonsend can do the job.

I recently noticed ^K not working right in  FvwmForm input fields, and
some pixel dropping  in input fields.   I finally traced this  down to
some    logic  in FvwmForm/ReadXServer.c    that  was  changed to  use
XDrawString instead of XDrawImageString.  (I think.)

(I couldn't find a corresponding ChangeLog entry.)

I suppose this has something to do with background pixmaps?

Whats the right way to restore the background in a text area, or
should this get changed back to XDrawImageString?

Probably it is not very good that it matches RestartFunction (which
already does not matche its companion InitFunction). So on restarts fvwm
runs StartFunction and then RestartFunction? I don't know. Anybody else?

The fact that any user can define his own function to emulate the proposed
EnterFunction does not help. Still in automatic setups (say FormFvwmSetup.
or fvwm-theme configurator, like the one suggested by Jason Kibblewhite)
modules must be added in one way or another to four functions instead of
one, because this user function is not standardized.

Historically we have two start functions in fvwm, however for a typical
user RestartFunction is just a shorter version of InitFunction.
IMO, defining the function unconditionally executed on start is a right
thing to do in order to eliminate duplications in configuration files.

Maybe, instead, we can add a hint to advanced users that they still can
do this in the old way, but the prefered way is to start modules in
EnterFunction?

Ouch.  __attribute__ is supposed to be tested for and turned into an
empty macro if unavailable.  This is done already in libs/fvwmlib.h, but
it either needs to also be added to fvwm/fvwm.h, or fvwm/fvwm.h needs to
#include libs/fvwmlib.h.

I never liked having a RestartFunction or an InitFunction.

I start apps where they should be started, in my .xinitrc.
(Thats just an opinion expressed like a law.)

I only started using InitFunction, and RestartFunction after I started
getting hangs, from  just  having "Module FvwmAnimate" anywhere  in my
.fvwm2rc.

If you are not starting modules, you can still get something similar
to "EnterFunction" by just putting the commands in the .fvwm2rc.

That brings   me to  my point.    When is EnterFunction  going  to run
relative to the other 2 functions?

You can  create  "EnterFunction" by  modifying ConfigFvwmDefaults like
this:

AddToFunc EnterFunction I Nop
AddToFunc InitFunction I EnterFunction
AddToFunc RestartFunction I EnterFunction

(That puts EnterFunction before InitFunction and RestartFunction.)

Done like this, theres little argument against adding unnecessary code.

I  think  the  idea itself    is   reasonable.  Its   a little    more
user-friendly than  leading the average  user down  the path of coding
both functions.

I hope, this is not a law. :) I would probably put xhost, xmodmap
or other programs belonging to X in .xinitrc, but not my applications.
I want to be able to get a clean X. All my applications belong to one
specific .fvwm2rc and, say, .fvwm2rc-2 contains different applications.
Also I can't use a SM if I put applications in .xinitrc.

I think fvwm's starting functions are good enough for flexibility.

Maybe it is a bit more convinient to have an official place for them?
Also you can add commands to this function from Read files as well.

Before them. This is usually enough, if not - users can always use
the old way of doing things and not to use automatical tools or modular
configurations, which put modules to EnterFunction (StartFunction?).

It would be a solution, but...
Unfortunately, there are good arguments against this trick.
  1) The "uneccesary code" will take only about 30 bytes of binary
  2) Being defined this way, is EnterFunction now official enough that
we can change module man pages to refer to it?
  3) Users usually have (I have) this code in their .fvwm2rc:

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction

which makes your suggestion not to work for them.

Maybe we just implement this function and see, if there is something wrong
with it if at all.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Uhh, never mind, the new background logic brought out some latent bugs.

Sounds like you've already coded it, in that case, ignore the above

I would have thought so.

	[sigh!] Can someone familiar with GNOME tell us whether the Panel is
another of those [expletive deleted] override_redirect thingies that
seem to have become fashionable of late?

  I had a thought about this over the W/E; maybe I'm missing something
obvious, but I have a suggestion - which relies on something I *think* is
infvwm. Hang on, I'll check ...

  OK, yes it's there, but I've not used it so I may misdescribe it.


  Would it not be possible (well, maybe 'acceptable' would be better) to
have logic in fvwm such that, instead of blindly ignoring (and keeping on
top/page/etc.) override_redirect windows, if a Style exists (i.e., created
by the users that want it) by the name of "OverrideRedirect" then these
windows have that style [and only that style/ Prob. not].

  Then, if the user *really* wants override_redirect to be that, they do
nothing. Those of us who're dischuffed with the concept may choose to:

  Style "OverrideRedirect" \
    Sticky, NoTitle, NoBorder, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip, Level 0

  That last should be "put on top layer".


  I personally would then just have no title/border.


  Might it not even be an idea to define that style by default and always
process override_redirect (that's possibly overstepping the mark!).

  Just a thought, but it would seem to solve most of the OR problems
that've cropped up. Ideally, in the fullness of time, 'OverrideRedirect'
would become a conditional/windowlistable tag, akin to Raised or Iconic.

I guess you can expect at least some OR programs to break when their
top-level windows are suddenly reparented away under them.

The panel sets layer hints that are honoured by a GNOME compliant
window manager like fvwm.  It can tell the WM that it wants to stay
on a layer above or below all normal windows.  I reaaly don't know
why KDE/GNOME do it this way with several of their desktop accessories,
but it's regularly driving the users nuts.  Fortunately you can tell
fvwm to override this setting:

  Style panel StaysPut

This command places the window on the default layer where all other
normal windows reside.  Thus it can be raised/lowered as usual.

The strange effect with windows going in the opposite direction of
where they are supposed to is probably caused by the panel flipping
its layer.

Fvwm does not blindly ignore OR windows.  It never sees them.  The
override_redirect flag is used by the server when a window is created
and what it does it to override the redirection of map request to the
window manager.

What normally happens with fvwm is that a client creates a window and
maps it with XMapWindow(). This causes a map request to be sent from the
client to the server.  Because fvwm has set the substructure_redirect
bit on the root window the server does not map the window, instead it
passes the request on to fvwm to deal with. Fvwm then sees this request
and can reparent the window and put borders and things on it.

With override_redirect windows the server ignores the
substructure_redirect tha fvwm has and just maps the window.  Fvwm does
not know anything has happened and cannot do anything about it.

In summary: you can't have an OverrideRedirect style.  If a client uses
override_redirect you are stuck with the way it chooses to behave.  My
opinion is that OR shouldn't be used for anything but pop-up menus,
anyhting else is bad manners.

Cheers,
Tim.

  Oh well. It was a nice thought while it lasted :-/

It's not only bad manners, it's against the law - er, I mean against
the ICCCM. Applications creating windows like the KFM icons are breaking
the ICCCM which explicitly states the the WM may do anything it likes
when it detects such a window.

  Nope, it'll fail for the same reason as my patch is still failing: this
segment of code only /removes/ things according to OL decor hints. I've
just come across a case where an OL app. of mine pops up a transient but
gets no header. It specifically requests a header (within the OL_DECOR_ADD
atom), but all fvwm will do is /not/ display a header if OL_DECOR_DEL asks
for such.

  I really don't want to extend this if-sequence any more (to add stuff
that OLDecor wants) wince I don't really understand what I did in the
first place!

  Is there anyone still out there who knows what this bit of code's about?

  But, to preserve my sanity, this is what I'm using here now. It *seems*
to work with what I've got, but again, I can't vouch for it since I'm
still uncertain as to the distinction between the t->functions flags & the
decor flags.

  [patches on top of original decorations.c, not my patched one]

Neil, that patch doesn't apply to the CVS code. I guess you did not
take into account that I already applied your last patch.

I have written a new command 'BugOpts' that is responsible
for the various hacks and bug workarounds int the code (the
stuff that configure options did before).  The
RAISEOVERNATIVEWINDOWS hack is now duplicated in GlobalOpts.
Can we remove this global option without annoying lots of
users?
------

Bob (Woodside), since you are working on that new hack for
KFM, will you fit the new options you need into the BugOpts
command?

  Ooeer. I wouldn't have done that :-)  (I filter CVS emails to Trash, so
I missed it going in) Leastways, not without having a quick butchers at
it, anyway! Like I said, I don't *really* know what I'm doing in that
code.

  However, if you reckon it looks OK, and it doesn't cause anyone else any
problems, I'll attach the second-half of the patch here.

Hello,
I try this (in the place of DefaultLayers 6 8 10).
This work until I shade/unshade the gnome panel, after
this operation it seems that the panel forget the StaysPut Style.
Note also that it seems that the Layers of the shade/unshade 
button of the panel when the panel is shaded is stronger than 
the Layer of the panel when it is unshaded. 
I use gnome-core-1.0.8.

Hm, I guess fvwm still allows the application to switch the layer,
even with StaysPut. I'll check this.

IconBox is already done, and I'm not sure how Backer would benefit from 
colorsets

We could possibly grab the old code from FvwmTalk, that created its own
window instead of using and xterm, then we would know exactlly how the
window is defined.  Thoughts?

  Why doesn't style.c's ProcessNewStyle free() the tokens returned by
GetNextToken(), as I beleive it's supposed to? The initial free() calls

I get the impression that fvwm is not the right place to fix this.
Users are always annoyed by this 'clever' applications that think
they know better where the user wants them.  Fvwm is merely doing
what the panel tells it.  Of course we could write a style option
to disable the GNOME hints.  But the usability problem is the fault
of all these applications doing fancy tricks with layers.  I suggest
someone writes a bug report to the GNOME (and possibly KDE) folks
about this.

Actually, IconBox, IconMan and WinList all display items regardless of
window state.

I missed FvwmIconBox being done. It looks like FvwmTaskBar and
FvwmScript are the only ones left.  I'm not serious about FvwmBacker but
it could be used to put a colorset into the root window (wouldn't work
with mixed visuals and would take a lot of memory).

The reason I use FvwmConsole rather than FvwmTalk is the history line
editing features you get with readline.  I think this means you need a
real terminal emulator with a pseudo terminal interface to the command.

Cheers,
Tim.

FvwmTalk history editing is a day or 2 from completion.

The change I made to FvwmWinList to have it handle animation of NoIcon
windows uses the style proposed by Dan i.e. FvwmWinList sends an animate
command to FvwmAnimate. I think this is a better way than my suggestion
of having fvwm maintain a NoIcon location: it doesn't go wrong if
FvwmWinList exits, it uses less memory and it doesn't require any
changes to fvwm.  The downside is that FvwmWinList has to become a
lock-on-send module which means more communication between it and fvwm. 
There may also be lurking bugs which cause a deadlock.

Cheers,
Tim.

Would It really take up any more memory than doing

I use the history stuff all the time my self, I wasn't suggesting
loosing that.  But I can take a look at the readline stuff and see if it
really needs a terminal or if any window will do.

You had me worried there for a minute.  The XDrawImageStrings were
replaced when I added colorset support, the problem is DrawImageString
uses the background color of the graphics context to do its work, which
would overite the image, that is why I switched to XDrawString instead.

I haven't yet looked at the feasibility, but I thought  if we got this
far,   (seems we  have), perhaps  fvwm  could  be told  that only  the
messages M_ICONIFY and M_DEICONIFY require a lockonsend response.

If I remember correctly we tried to clean up these memory leaks
for 2.2, but it was too complicated without causing a coredump.

  Hmm. It looked suspicuously like someone'd left some debug #if's in the
code. I've had a wade through the function, and as far as I can see
(assuming one /can/ always free() the token output of GetNextToken())
they're perfectly OK. I'm trying it with them in in the version I'm
fiddling with.

  Maybe they were part of a more thorough 'insert loads of free()s'
session, /all/ of which got #if'd out, but in the case of style.c it all
looks OK.

  I'll let you know when mine builds!

  For the record, I'm trying to put in a "Style 'SomeStyle*' -" syntax to
remove style definitions. It seemed to fit in with other 'unbinding'
syntaxes (e.g., Mouse), but now I come to write this, maybe DestroyStyle
would be more in keeping that a "-". But then thre's no corresponding
AddToStyle ...

Tim, 
did something you did hear effect animations when WinList isn't running.
Right now if I iconify one of my icons it gets animated twice then
mapped.

Yes it could, but if the modules were to be changed to only ack these
message and then for some reason we made another type of message require
ack's we would have to go through all the modules and make sure they
didn't deadlock.

Here's a thought:
*) Remove M_LOCKONSEND
*) Add a sibling to SetMessageMask(): SetSyncMessageMask() that tells
fvwm what messages are to be treated as though M_LOCKONSEND  is set.
*) WinList can then use SetSyncMessageMask(M_ICONIFY | M_DEICONIFY) and
only need to send an unlock on these messages.
*) Animate would use SetSyncMessageMask(M_ICONIFY | M_DEICONIFY |
M_STRING)

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't think this is FvwmWinList. If it isn't running it can't send the
animate command. Do you have two FvwmAnimate's running? What is your
animate style?

I'm not so sure. The problem is very recent. I have been using CVS fvwm
for quite some time with no problems. Only when I updated to 2.3.8 did
this start.

Can you provide a patch then? (BTW, please include ChangeLog entries in
your patches).

I vote for DestroyStyle instead of introducing a new cryptic syntax

:-p

Of course I couldn't reproduce the problem here, but the panel I have
isn't up to date and doesn't have the options you mention.

Hello,

I like very much (at a user level) the new Buttons panel 
implementation. However, I have a bug report and a suggestion.

First of all the buglette:
When I "unshade" a panel the geometry of the panel
do not seem to be the one expected: 
With my "down" panel the panel seems to far from the
Buttons (3 or 4 pixels): with a NoBorder Style I can see
the background between the buttons and the panel.
With my "up" panel (BorderWidth 5 for this Buttons) the
panel is on the Buttons (not on the Buttons Border, 2 or 3
pixel on the Buttons).
I can send the two Buttons and do more test if the bug is 
not easily reproducible.

A suggestion:
With the old panel implementation we can unshade a panel 
"up", "down", "left" or "right" but also with "geometry"
(then the panel follows the geometry of the panel config in a
relative way). It seems that this feature disappear with the 
new panels (this is right ?). It will be find to get it for the
new panels. My dream is two new relative geometry options,
with one the border come in the computation, with the second one 
the border is forgetted.

Hello,

I have a deadlock with FvwmWinList (and animation) in the following
situation:
- The only opened windows belongs to the WindowsSkipList.
since my FvwmWinList use it, WinList is not in my screen.
At this point every thing is ok.
- Then if I start a standard application, the application 
does not appear in the screen and I need to kill X to
get control on my machine (I presume that I've got a deadlock).

However, if I start WinList and some applications not in the 
SkipList  already run the animation work very well (and I like 
it very much !!).

  So do I, now (I changed my mind)! I'm about to test it. I'll post the
patch to the list when I'm done (instead of email it straight to you,
Dominik) 'cos I'd like it if some others ran with it for a bit, just to
confirm that my style.c memory free()s don't cause funny crashes!

  In top-level dir:

  patch -p0 -b < DestroyPatch.patch

  I recommend trying it out for a couple of hours, just in case, but I've
not had any problems with it, so I'm pretty certain that my Style memory
free()s are OK.

  If 'DestroyStyle *' doesn't stuff things up, I doubt anything will :-)

  OK, this problem that I've mentioned before is exacerbated under the
latest snapshot.

  With:

Style "dtcm"            Sticky, NoIcon

  and:

toolwait dtcm -geometry 754x666+187+50 -icon

  ... whenever I start up dtcm, it's open window appears in Fvwmpager, but
I never see the window itself (I wouldn't expect to, starting it iconic).
Why does FvwmPager get a map request? If it's supposed to, why not the
unmap? Iconising dtcm normally makes it go away from FvwmPager correctly.

  Quitting and restarting dtcm makes this happen everytime now.


  Any ideas what I can do to trace the problem?

Ah, I guess fvwm forgets to tell the modules that the window is
iconified immediately. I'll have a look at the code.

Fvwm sends the 'M_ICONIFY' package before the 'M_MAP' package. I guess
this is what confuses the pager.

I think what happens here is that FvwmWinList does an XMapWindow which
blocks waiting for fvwm to map the window border. fvwm broadcasts an
M_ADD_WINDOW packet for the FvwmWinList window but this blocks because
FvwmWinList is a lockonsend module.

I don't know what the fix for this is.  Making FvwmWinList drop the
LOCKONSEND flag when unmapping won't work because it is prone to a race
hazard (messages are asynchronous with X events).  Just ignoring
LOCKONSEND with M_ADD_WINDOW messages may work but it prevents animation
of window mapping which might be nice to do one day in FvwmAnimate.

Cheers,
Tim.

I get back I won't be crsuhed.

To animate M_ADD_WINDOW we'd need another packet that wasn't associated
with a grab.


We have a choices:

a quick fix which eliminates M_LOCKONSEND for everything but m_iconify
and m_deiconify.  I think M_LOCKONSEND is still under control, we
can change it now, and then change it again later.

The change we discussed which sets a lockonsend mask.
I think I might be able to find time to do this, but I don't
want to start if you're going to do it.

Mark, I think there is some bug in inner_RaiseOrLowerWindow().
When an application changes its layer, the new_layer function
calls RaiseWindow/LowerWindow while the stack ring is not
sorted properly (the window is still stuck in the old layer).
I think you are doing something with the unsorted stack ring
that causes raising/lowering to behave funny. Any ideas?

An excellent idea. Now I can even use gradients as a background. This
is indeed a useful option and a perfect replacement for xsetroot.
Whatever mixed visuals are (I'm completely ignorant :-) ), I see no
reason why this should work any worse than when I use xsetroot to
set the background.

Oops, i meant FvwmTaskBar.

Wharf, Backer and IconBox are completed.

I agree with Wharf and Backer, but TaskBar is used by many people
who wouldn't like to be forced to use IconMan instead. Writing a new
config can be quite a pain.

I don't know. I'll think about menu styles, but I'm no expert with
styles.

Not easily. But there is a solution for your problem. If you use
MissingSubmenuFunction only to create an empty menu and instead
place the code to build it in the DynamicPopupAction you can use
"DestroyMenu recreate ..." to create a fresh menu right after
deleting it. When you pop down the menu, the DynamicPopdownAction
is executed. After it has deleted the menu it must rebuild the
DynamicPopupAction. Now when the menu is finally posted it runs
the popup action again and is properly rebuilt. I guess it's as
complicated as it sounds, and it will leave you with an empty menu
for each popup you ever use. What do you think about this?
(If you do make the effort to get this working, could you please
add something in the FAQ?)

Mikhael, can you talk with the Author of the module about his future
plans? I don't like the idea of adding a C++ module now that we finally
got rid of the last one we had.

Since people are using all of these options and do find them useful

That's always the right way to submit patches.  If you send them
personally to me I will immediately forward them to the list most
of the time anyway.  I may know a lot about fvwm after the year
years I've spent with it, but often I simply don't understand what
patches are doing and rely on others to look at the patches before
applying them.

I think I finally pinned it down. The gnome code in fvwm
is responsible for keeping certain GNOME hints (like the
desk the window is on). So it's important that the proper
GNOME_Set... function is called every time one of the
settings that GNOME is interested in changes. I guess this
is not alwasy done. In fact I already discovered one situation
where this is the case. Perhaps you could try the latest CVS
and see of the original problem is gone (the chance isn't
very high, but still).

Neil, please replace the beginning of the process_message function
in FvwmPager.c with this code and record the output when your problem
occurs.

void process_message( FvwmPacket* packet )
{
  unsigned long type = packet->type;
  unsigned long length = packet->size;
  unsigned long* body = packet->body;

  switch (type)
    {
    case M_ADD_WINDOW:
fprintf(stderr,"add window: 0x%x\n", packet->body[0]);
      list_configure(body);
      break;
    case M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW:
fprintf(stderr,"configure window: 0x%x\n", packet->body[0]);
      list_configure(body);
      break;
    case M_DESTROY_WINDOW:
fprintf(stderr,"destroy window: 0x%x\n", packet->body[0]);
      list_destroy(body);
      break;
    case M_FOCUS_CHANGE:

My fault. I accidentally removed the one useful line in the ClientMessage
event handler when deleting the old panel stuff.

I can confirm that the layer handling code in fvwm wasn't bullet proof
when applications changed their own layer.  Technically the reason is
this:  Fvwm keeps a ring list of the window stacking order internally.
The stack ring is kept sorted by layer.  When a window changed its own
layer, this change didn't update the stack ring correctly (probably
caused by a bug in the latest transient handlich patch).  I have made
a temporary fix for the problem, but since I didn't see it myself I
need to know if the problem still occurs with the current CVS code.

The gap you see is a feeble (hard coded) attempt to compensate
the border width of the swallowed fvwm windows.  I have no idea
how I can find out the geometry of the fvwm window.  FvwmButtons
swallows the application window itself, not the window created
by fvwm that is used to draw titles and borders.  It's especially
annoying with the 'down' panel style if the window still has its
title.

I'm aware of the problem and thinking about various enhancements
in this area but I'm still not sure how to do it.

Scrap this idea, it won't work.  If some messages are not synchronous
they will end up in the queue. When a synchronous message is sent fvwm
will add the sync message to the end and wait until the unlock message
comes back. This won't happen until all the message have been processed
by the module and some of them might deadlock.

Tim.

IconMan looks fine now, I haven't had any more troubles with it.  So you

The map doesn't block but waiting for an expose deadlocks because the
expose won't happen until fvwm maps the parent window and that won't
happen until WinList handles lots of messages (M_CONFIGURE, M_NAME,
M_MAP) and that won't happen because WinList is waiting for an expose.

I don't think this makes deadlocks impossible, it may just make them
only happen with busy systems (messages buffered) which would make it
very hard to track down.

> The change we discussed which sets a lockonsend mask.

This is just another way of having some messages synchronous and others
async.  I don't think it eliminates the chances of deadlock.  Messge
from fvwm must be processed in serial order and so there is no guarantee
that a sync message won't be appended to a queue that has other messages
in it that will cause a deadlock.

I think the fix is to leave M_LOCKONSEND as it is and to fix any modules
that cause deadlock.  Having all message be synchronous when
M_LOCKONSEND is set means that the message queue for that module will
always be empty which I think means that debugging deadlocks should be
simple (kill -QUIT the module and look at the last message).  Making a
module deadlock safe means making sure it only ever blocks in the
select() call that handles fvwm messages.  It means XSync() is not
allowed or things like WaitForExpose() or XNextEvent().

Is it possible to put a timeout in the fvwm sync message sending?

Cheers,
Tim.

It's the -visual option for fvwm. It means that colorset pixmaps won't
work with the root window.  You get a BadMatch error I think.

FvwmButtons could look for the M_CONFIGURE packet for the panel (not
sure how it would know the windowId to look for). That packet has the
title height and borderwidth in it.

I'm just thinking outloud here.  But how about this.  We modify
FvwmAnimate,by putting all of the animation stuff into fvwm/libs.  Then
have each module that cares (IconMan, WinList, TaskBar, Wharf) call the
function to animate then in a similar style to FvwmTheme, Animate can
simplly be a controlling module that dictates look and feel, and passes
a message to fvwm, which would pass it to all modules.  Now I realize
there may be problems with this method as well, but the chances of us
finding all possible deadlock cases is going to be pretty slim.

Any thoughts?

Brad

I don't know hen this happened but cgradients don't look right in
colorsets or menus

	MenuStyle * MenuFace CGradient 200 black white

doesn't get to white at the corners and

	SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset 0 CGradient 200 black white

gives colorsets with black corners.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think  we should  try  as  hard as we   can to  keep  something like
FvwmAnimate out  of the core.     Its pretty frivilous.   Putting  the
animation logic in fvwm/libs would be a last resort.

Thats seems to be what the fvwmSelect function gives us.
Seems like a good idea.

If I just have a '*FvwmButtonsColorset 0' as the only color setting for
FvwmButtons it does the right thing and puts colorset 0 as the entire
background but for swallowed apps the $fg and $bg are set to some
default.  ( -fg black -bg rgb:90/80/90).

If it's a respawn swallow and the applet is respawned $fg and $bg are
blank.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well its not anymore fribilous than the Gradient drawing algorithms.
This would basically only be code that get called if I ask for
animation.  The binary for Animate is only 41K so I don't really see
code bloat as an argument against.  But if you want to keep fighting
deadlock bugs, I'm all for it and will do my best to help you squash
them.

Sorry, it didn't help. It still behaves exactly the same as before I

I have spent several hours trying to find out the border width.
But fvwm does something that defeats all my efforts: when a window
is unmapped it reparents it to the root window again and destroys
its FvwmWindow structure. I need to get the size of the FvwmWindow
before the window is mapped, but at that moment I can't know which 
border width and title height the window would get. Even if the code
were in fvwm itself I couldn't do much.  I'm really stuck. Any ideas
how to solve this problem?

I was playing with FvwmButtons and FvwmTheme, and I've nearly reproduced a
Wharf, but, the gradient that DGradient is giving me seems to be at the
wrong angle.  Instead of a 45 degree slope (which I was expecting), it's
more of a 20 degree slope.  Is this the way DGradient is supposed to
behave, or am I or fvwm doing something wrong?

Yes, this fixed funny problems with Mark's (?) patch.

Regarding the problem Eric reported. Yes, it was.
But now the following works:

  DefaultLayers 6 8 10

Of course, this only works for new windows, you must close existing ones,
since they keep the layer or change their layers using 'Layer 0 8'.

Alternatively, you can place the panel in the normal layer with:

  Style panel StaysPut

Since there is no option to quit panel only in the latest GNOME, you must
'killall panel' for this to be activated.

You can raise windows over the panel now. But any operation with the panel
seems to return it to layer 8, so for now only the first solution works.
And currently sometimes you must Raise/Lower panel first (the known
problem with all windows on startup/restart in session).

So, the problem is that fvwm allows the panel to set its layer other then
the one defined in Style.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,
Here two very humble suggestions:

If someone do the TaskBar can he take the occasion to add a
*FvwmTaskBarIconBack  Option (there is an IconFore option) ?

Also I will be very happy if IconMan had the options: 
*FvwmIconMan*[id*]icon style [forecolor backcolor ]
*FvwmIconMan*[id*]iconcolorset colorset
Seems to be natural for an Icons manager ?

Hello,
I try again the procedure. No more problem :o). Perhaps this need
more tests, I will e-mail if I see some problems.
Note that I try also with the SaveQuitSession fvwm function
but it seems that this function save nothing or there is something
that I do not understand (do I need to say some thing to fvwm at
new session start for my saved session applied ?).
An other note: Gnome use a function with two options 
save-session [--kill --query] 
the --help option say
save-session options
  --kill                      Terminer la session (finish the session)
  --query                     Ask the user
"save-session --kill" do "SaveQuitSession"
I imagine that you know that, but these may be usefull for a fvwm-gnome-faq.

This won't stop deadlocks. Modules that want to do animation at iconify
time will still have to be LOCKONSEND modules.  The last deadlock with
FvwmWinList was caused when a window was created and the in the set of
messages that fvwm sends on window creation was a message that caused
FvwWinList to wedge. This blocked the handshaking of the last few
messages and so fvwm blocked. It had nothing to do with iconify
animation.

If we could put a timeout on sending messges to LOCKONSEND modules it
would be useful if a timeout caused the module to be killed with a core
dump and a report from fvwm about what message type it was sending.

Cheers,
Tim.

Would it be possible to map it to an offscreen area and wait for the
M_CONFIGURE packet? If that's not possible how about making an initial
assumption and saving the numbers from every M_CONFIGURE packet that
matched the panel window-id?  It's not likely that the border width will
change often.

That's the way it is supposed to be. FvwmTheme creates a square pixmap
with the DGradient at 45 degrees and FvwmButtons stretches it to fit
it's window.  If it really really bugs you and others it could be
changed by setting the keep_aspect attribute in FvwmTheme but it would
require more server memory and computation (a lot more for a task bar
like window).

>  87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.

This is done but needs reviewing

>  79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?

A quick way to do this might be to add -fg and -bg options to the
command line used to start the xterm. It wouldn't be dynamic but then
you can always start a new one.

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't know how to reproduce the bug, so this bug might be untrackable.
I start xscreensaver, leave the workstation for the night, and by morning
it is back to xdm login.  Here is (I believe) the relevant portion from 
.xsession-errors:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 54, Error 4, EventType: 18
/usr/local/bin/xscreensaver-command: activating.
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

>From this log, and from the fact that this never happens during the day
while I'm using the machine, I think the problem is interaction between
xscreensaver and fvwm.

One other note that might be of interest is that I'm running dual-headed,
and never saw this problem before adding the second monitor.  I tried
upgrading to the 19990906 snapshot to see if that would solve the problem,
but it first wouldn't even start dual-headed.  I gave it the "-s" option,
but then modules wouldn't work, so I gave up.

X_Server: XFree86-3.3.3.1
Submission from: (NULL) (143.239.211.101)


FvwmIconMan (1.3) seems to have a small inconsistency in the way that it
handles the navigation of icons.

At the leftmost  icon, 'gotobutton Left'  does nothing.
At the rightmost icon, 'gotobutton Right' moves to the leftmost icon.

The relevant portion of my .fvwm2rc file is:

   *FvwmIconMan*managergeometry 5x1+0-0
   *FvwmIconMan*action Key Left  N gotobutton Left,  select
   *FvwmIconMan*action Key Right N gotobutton Right, select

Repeatedly pressing the left-arrow key will move back to the leftmost icon
and then stop, whereas repeatedly pressing the right-arrow key will keep
on
cycling through the icons, wrapping around from rightmost to leftmost
icons.

Cheers, Joseph

All,

I am running Fvwm Version 2.3.8 compiled on Sep  9 1999 at 14:24:56
(fvwm-snap-19990906).

First let me start off by saying that I like to have different files for all the
different Modules I use.  So I created the following files for FvwmButtons and
the associated Panels: $HOME/.fvwm/Buttons (main buttons file),
$HOME/.fvwm/Fvwm, $HOME/.fvwm/Logins, $HOME/.fvwm/Applications and
$HOME/.fvwm/ArtTools.

Here is what I have in my $HOME/.fvwm2rc for the Buttons:

###################### FvwmButtons Files #######################
# FvwmButtons and sub-panel Configuration file
*FvwmButtonsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/Buttons
*FvwmButtonsFvwmFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/Fvwm

*FvwmButtonsApplicationsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/Applications
*FvwmButtonsArtToolsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/ArtTools

Here is the contents of my "$HOME/.fvwm/Buttons" file:

######################################################

The other "Panel" file are similar to this one, if needed I can post them.

Now when I start up my session I get the following error messages:

-transient: Couldn't open config file FvwmButtonsFvwm
-transient: No buttons defined. Quitting
-transient: Couldn't open config file FvwmButtonsLogins
-transient: No buttons defined. Quitting
-transient: Couldn't open config file FvwmButtonsArtTools
-transient: No buttons defined. Quitting
-transient: Couldn't open config file FvwmButtonsApplications
-transient: No buttons defined. Quitting

Without the "-transient" all the Panels start in the opened state.  If I close
the "Fvwm" Panel then click on the button that should open the panel the image
in that buttons goes away and the Panel never starts.

What am I doing wrong here?  I had no problems setting up the old Panels (except
for buttons sizes) but I sure am have tons of problems with this version.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

BTW, thank you for the FvwmButtonsButtonGeometry option.  I can now use my Wharf
Pixmap without having to play the "What Size should I make this button" game
(now if I could only get these panels working).

# That's the way it is supposed to be. FvwmTheme creates a square pixmap

Well, that's the problem-- my window is square, it should be 45 degrees :)
Perhaps the gradient is being calculated before FvwmButtons sets its
geometry?

I prefer a very uncluttered look to my window manager. I'm switching
from ctwm to fvwm2 because fvwm is more keyboardable, but it's harder
to turn off the 3D look in fvwm. This patch makes "BorderStyle --
Flat" do the expected thing.

An alternative (and somewhat more thorough/flexible) would be to allow
the user to specify the relief and shadow colours.

BTW, I'm not subscribed to the list.

Tony.

I have found out when it *does* save. After you save session using a gnome
facility (menu or save-session), SaveQuitSession and SaveSession start to
work (save current session). Otherwise, they don't work (a session is
saved, but gnome restores the previous session on the next start-up).

I will try to fix this, but currently I can only guess why this happens.
Maybe someone else, who knows XSMP, can help out here?

> "save-session --kill" do "SaveQuitSession"

Yes, and save-session without arguments is what SaveSession must do.

BTW, a comment in save-session.c says that "there is no way to request
a shutdown without a save". I don't remember that XSMP says that this
is impossible, but if this is true, QuitSession (without saving) is
impossible. Ok, currently it does not save anyway, only exits. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

This patch implements opaque resizing using the same condition as
opaque moving (i.e. the window must be less that OpaqueMoveSize
percent of the screen area).

Um, could you give me a hints what exactly you are talking about?
I've been out of touch for several days so I'm not sure about the
status of the various problems. I think Eric(?) already replied
that my patch didn't help with his GNOME panel problem.

Yup, that fixed the problem with windows jumping around, but I got
a crash with your config. The fprintf's are supposed to debug the
crash. But I guess you didn't ever see that crash, right?

Some things to check:

 - Do you set the background for the whole window or the buttons?
 - Do you resize the main window after it is created?
 - If you can't solve it, can you provide a screenshot and the relevant
   portions of your config (theme and buttons setup).

Could you try if it works if you have all the config lines in your main

Hi Tony,

the development sources are already too far away from this patch
to apply cleanly. Could you please create a patch for the current
sources? You'll find instructions on how to fetch the latest
sources on our web page (downloads) at http://fvwm.org . If you
don't have CVS, fetch a snapshot.

Yes, unfortunately I tried this after I sent me message.  It behaved no

figure this out.

Hmm ... it doesn't happen for me in any version (using Alt+F3=>Lower to
avoid possible influence of a mouse click), nor can I see the code which
does it: as far as I can tell there would need to be some more logic in
fvwm/stack.c(must_move_transients). However, it makes sense to mirror
the "top of layer" behaviour.

Now you really *are* trying to wind me up aren't you :-? I got involved
because my site relies on Raise/LowerTransient Motif behaviour. I vote
we keep them.


So ... is this where we stand ?

(1) RaiseTransient - as now.
(2) LowerTransient - as now with addition of toggling main above+below
its transients to be described in the man page, and made to work for me
too.
(3) New style (Dont)StackTransientLenient which augments
Raise/LowerTransient by (not)allowing the toggling, and has no effect if
neither of the two is used (from your suggestion Thu, 2 Sep 1999
02:55:56 +0200).

In relation to both this and the various GNOME hints discussions ...


The handling of transients with respect to changes of layer seems to be
a bit mixed up. There is a half-hearted bit of code in
fvwm/stack.c(new_layer) in which RaiseTransient makes a main (which is
being moved to a higher layer) bring along its transients from the
layers being traversed - but it ignores any transients which were lower
than the old layer. Also, there is no attempt to handle LowerTransient.

Meanwhile, RaiseWindow() and LowerWindow() completely ignore
any transients which are not in the same layer as main - leading to
possibly undesirable behaviour such as LowerTransient leaving a
transient on-top - in a higher layer.


I'm not sure what to expect of transient windows when their Main
changes Layer; given that Layers are kinda new this is probably
untrodden ground. Let me have a guess at what the behaviour should be,
someone correct me ...

1) With neither RaiseTransient nor LowerTransient, a Main window
changing
layer does not change the layer of any Transients.

2) With RaiseTransient, a Main moving to a higher layer collects
Transients as it  goes - so that all its Transients which were in any
of the layers from the bottom through to the new (higher) layer are
moved to be above Main at the bottom of the new layer. Transients which
are already in layers higher than the new one are unaffected.

3) With Raise Transient, moving Main to a lower layer does not move
any Transients.

4) With LowerTransient, moving Main to a lower layer collects
Transients as it goes - so that all its Transients which were in any of
the layers from the top through to the new (lower) layer are moved to
be above Main at the top of the new (lower) layer. Transients which are
already in layers lower than the new one are unaffected.

5) With LowerTransient, moving Main to a higher layer does not move any
Transients.


.. or is it something else?

Silly me, I just noticed Dominick's message to me to try to reproduce a
problem he may have fixed (he sent it August 3... yikes!).

Anyway, fvwm.h, as distributed in version 2.3.7 has a serious deficiency:

Line 450:

extern void Done(int, char *) __attribute__((__noreturn__));

The __attribute__((__noreturn__)) part is a GNU gcc-ism, and won't compile on
non-GNU compilers.  Can that part of the statement be #ifdef'd to allow
compilation by people who use other compilers?

PS --> I've removed the offending code and I'll try to check on the bug that I
reported in 2.2.  Is there a list of things to look out for when upgrading
from 2.2.x to 2.3.x... like changed or modified functionality?

This has already been fixed in the development sources.  You should be
able to try it with the latest nightly snapshot.

Your first suggestion on the GNOME panel problem was 'Style panel StaysPut'.
This still works only until you do some operations with the panel.
After that it places itself to the layer 8 regardless of its style.
On the other thought, this is not a fvwm problem - StaysPut or Layer
style only refers to an initial placement.

One of the suggestions was to try 'DefaultLayers 6 8 10'. Eric reported
that this didn't help too. I tried to reproduce this and it really didn't
work well (supposedly the panel tried to always raise itself over another
window even though they both were on the same layer 8, but I am not sure).
This was a week ago. After the commit (that I am replying to) I have tried
again and now 'DefaultLayers 6 8 10' works well, the panel can be freely
lowered/raised over new windows.

So, unless a new option (ignoring layer hints) added, I think, you can
close this problem.

Regards,
Mikhael.

If I grab any window in the title bar and move it, leaving the mouse
in the title bar, the title bar does not "de-de-press".
	Also, if there are other windows on the screen, parts of the
title bar (one pixel lines) turn bright green (not anywhere in my config).

If I move the mouse fast enough so that it is not in the moved window,
this
does not happen.

If I move the mouse off and back on the window, it looks normal again.

Somesort of refresh problem.   I'm not sure how to best describe it.

I'm using a Voodoo3 as well so that might be causing problems...

Because you can never complain about FvwmAuto enough... ;)

It seems as though something isn't right with FvwmAuto, in that it doesn't
always raise a window.  With two overlapped xterms on-screen, click the
title bar on window #2.  It should be focuses and on top.  Then slide the 
mouse (medium speed) from window #2 to window #1.  Window #1 gets the 
focus, but doesn't raise.  Slide the mouse back to window #2, and then
back to window #1, and this time window #1 gets the focus and raises.

In playing with it, it seems as though a window won't raise until the
second time the mouse enters it.

Here's a small config file:

Subject: Maximize 0 100 bug

Full_Name: Lee Skinol
Version: Latest CVS
CVS_Date: Sept 12
OS: Linux 2.2.12
X_Server: XFree 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (168.143.0.8)


Something with the Maximize function seems to be broken.  Here's
the line in the config file:

Mouse 1         T       A       Maximize 0 100

Start an xterm with xterm -geometry 80x25 and click its title bar.
The window stretches to something like 90% of the screen height,
with a gap at the bottom of the screen.  Interestingly enough, 
repeating the same test with Netscape brings it to a full 100%.

I'm using Xfree on Linux at 800x600.

Thanks,
Lee

	This is because apps like xterm and its cousins constrain their window
sizes to increments of the character cell size, not pixels.

	To see this in action, try slowly drag-resizing a corner of your xterm
window. You'll see the rubber band resist moving, then suddenly junp
several pixels (the height or width of a character). Then try the same
thing with a Netscape window, and observe the rubber band moving
smoothly.

	The degree of imprecision in fitting your screen size depends on the
dimensions of the font you use, but it's simply a characteristic of the
application.

Okay, I'll update again and try this. Am I also supposed to use the StaysPut
style?

The first my reaction was to write a similar answer, but I tested this and
yes, it always causes a window like Netscape to have a gap of two pixels
and in some cases it causes a window like xterm to have one line or column
less than maximally possible, so the gap seems to be large.
I have fixed this.

Lee, please test again. Supposing your font is 7x14, it is ok to have a
gap for xterm on X less than 7 and on Y less than 14 pixels.
For your resolution 800x600 it is larger than 99% for X and 97.7% for Y.

Regards,
Mikhael.

No, you only need one of them. StaysPut is useless since the panel always
jumps to layer 8, so you must have all windows in this layer.

Ah, um, I think you got a version where -transient was not implemented.
I wrote the man page bofre the patch. Furthermore I made a cut-and-paste
error that would have caused it to fail if used together with the -g option.
It's all fixed now.

Ah, no. Raise/LowerTransient should work like your suggested ...Strict
styles and ...Lenient activates the 'toggling' behaviour.

Weird. Can you try this with a newer fvwm version? The current betas
are at 2.3.7 ( ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.3.7.tar.gz ).
(The betas are *not* recommended for production use at the moment!!!).

Hmm, the Voodoo3 seems to be fully supported since XFree 3.3.4. What
graphics adapter do you use?

Hello,

It seems that there is a problem with the auto resizing
of WinList. I saw some problems when a numbers windows
appear / disappear at the same time: WinList does not resize
as expected.
Try the following (*without* FvwmWinListNoAnachor and with say
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0-0). Open a number of xterm (say 3) and a 
FvwmConsole and send to fvwm via the console: All (xterm) Close.
Then, on my machine the geometry of WinList become something 
like +0-15. 

Olivier

PS: I use the latest cvs, I do not know exactly when this
problem happen to me for the first time.

Subject: configure doesn't check for correct XPM version

Full_Name: Christian Wiedholz

OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (192.35.17.13)


Hi!

I downloaded fvwm-snap-19990906 and tried to compile it. I had this error:

 Picture.c:188: `XpmReturnAllocPixels' undeclared (first use this
function)

I used XPM version 3.4f which was fine for the configure script. 
But `XpmReturnAllocPixels' is not available in this version. The current
XPM
version (3.4.11) has this function.

So I guess the configure script should be updated.

Regards,

Christian

No, I meant the card vendor and the name of the card. As far as I know,
'Voodoo3' is the name of the 3d chip on the card, not the name of the
card itself.

I've been barely here over the past several days owing to a rather severe
workload and now I'm taking a few days off to leave civilization for a
bit.  I'll return sometime Sunday but probably won't be able to answer mail
or do any admin tasks until sometime Monday.

Oh, I see... It's a 3dfx card (from 3dfx.com).  It's what ships with
Dell's computers... dmesg says:  3Dfx model 0005 graphics accelerator.

Looks like it's working, except for one problem. I have to hide and show

I thought you should know anyway.

After the third rewrite from scratch, I think I have this just about
right. I'm just about ready to commit it, but it's raised a couple of
issues we may want to discuss.

	The main one is that the current RaiseLower handling doesn't work
properly with the new BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged. Does anyone remember
what the reason was for the overlap check? If you have a window that's
below the KFM icons, but doesn't happen to overlap any FVWM-managed
windows, it is assumed to be at the top of its layer and gets lowered
instead of raised. To get RaiseLower to work properly in this situation,
I had to change the RaiseLower on-top test to a very simple check for
whether the next higher window is in the same layer as the target. Can
someone explain to me why it shouldn't be this way?

	The second one is that I occasionally observe quirks with the
RaiseOverNativeWindows handling. These may be due to buggy apps, I don't
know, but with RaiseOverNativeWindows enabled, a couple of apps (moxfm
and nedit are the ones I can consistently trigger it with) will pop up
transients with no window in them, just a little bit of FVWM frame.
(That's just a visual description, I haven't tried to analyze them to
see just what's happening.) However, with the new RaiseOverUnmanaged
code running, this doesn't happen. Now, RaiseOverUnmanaged happens
before the raise hack, so there are no longer any unmanaged windows
above the target FVWM window: the raise hack only raises FVWM windows.

	This leads me to question whether we should be trying to raise
override_redirect windows, or whether they should be left to their own
devices. I understand that not trying to raise them loses some of the
benefits (for popups and the Pager's ballons) that led Matthias to the
GSOR (Great StackingOrder Rewrite) in the first place. However, one
could argue that all these special case hacks are apt to be imperfect
attempts to deal as best we can with ill-behaved apps, so trade-offs
have to be accepted. The question is which trade we want to make.


Cheers,
Bob

And it is ugly... Maybe we just replace it? There is a candidate in:
  http://www.princeton.edu/~alanho/fvwm/

It uses 255 colors vus 6 in fvwm2_big.xpm, but much nicer.
What do you think? At least we must remove '2' from the current logo.

This is too many colors for the default logo. FvwmBanner might be run
before the ColorLimit command and using up the whole colormap may cause
other programs to fail to start.

This is my fault. I added this bit to try to stop fvwm and the modules
leaking colors. I don't know what version of XPM would support this. If
it will cause major hassle to require everyone to upgrade their XPM I
can take it out and we can live with color leaks.

This looks like a race hazard. If two windows are added quickly
FvwmWinList will get the M_ADD message for the first, calculate it's new
geometry and does an XMoveResize.  The wandering happens if FvwmWinList
gets the next M_ADD message before fvwm does the Move, it then uses the
wrong coordinates for the next XMoveResize.

I'll have a play and see if I can fix it. If I can't would you be happy
with a config option that would make FvwmWinList warp to it's original
position all the time? At present if you move it it stays where you put
it.

Cheers,
Tim.

I've committed a fix for wandering when several window get added or
deleted in quick succession.  Ther may still be some race problems
around Recaptures but I don't think I can fix them.

Okay, what have you done in your fvwm configuration? Diy you
use the staysput style or the defaultlayers command? And
how is your panel set up?

I'm not sure thats right, the Colorlimit command goes on by default
with 8 bit color.  Also FvwmBanner exits, freeing its colors so
only programs starting while the banner is up could have a problem.

I think FvwmBanner  using 256 colors may fail  to display.  Even using
"close" colors, if you try for too many colors, I've seen xv and other
programs just fail to be able to display at all.

I think I favor having the built-in stay low in color, and I prefer
the image to the logos at the above site.

We don't seem to have a link to the above site.

I'm not sure if we should link to it, or just grab the images and
add them to fvwm-web.  I don't want to create the worlds greatest
icon repository, but it might make sense to collect the fvwm
specific images.

Hmm, a while back I fixed color leakage in rxvt without setting
that mask bit.  Instead after XFreePixmap I added:

 XFreeColors(Xdisplay, Xcmap,
           xpmAttr.pixels,
           xpmAttr.npixels, 0); /* free the colors in the old pixmap */

I don't have my Xpm docs handy so I don't know if I just missed
XpmReturnAllocPixels, but I believe this is another way to
free the colors.

Imagine you have a window that is fully visible and obscures several
other windows you want to see. I would expect thast RaiseLower lowers
the window in this situation. Otherwise you would have to click twice
before something happens.

If someone complains about fvwm because of these buggy apps, I want
to be able to say: "Well, it's really the fault of your application,
but if you can't live with it, there's an option in fvwm that can
help you, although it is not perfect..."

Of course we could easily say that the problem is 100% the fault of
KFM, but in the end that would mean that nobody would use fvwm with
the current KDE version.

Is the "daily snapshot" not being update daily anymore?

The latest one there is from the 6th.

Just wondering.

Wasn't there supposed to be a competition/contest (contest.gimp.org) to
create a new logo for fvwm (wasn't that in the works) ?  I could have sworn a
few people had even volunteered to host the contest (or at least to track it).

Back to searching the archives :-)

Dominik,

Enclosed please find patches (from CVS this time :-) completing my
previous submissions - hopefully agreeing with all we've discussed.

- Raise/LowerTransient: main always below transients
- StackTransientParent: documented
- FlipTransient(previously StackTransientLenient): new style,
re-instates flipping transients above/below main on raise (no longer
normal behaviour for RaiseTransient); does similar job for
LowerTransient.

This time I've included updates for NEWS, ChangeLog etc :-) but NOT
fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults on the grounds that False is a good initial
value for the relevant flags.


Outstanding:

(1) Extend the behaviour to handle more than one level of
main+transient. Since no one seems to have noticed this but me, I guess
its not worth holding up a release for, but I will start on it.

(2) Does anyone have views on the suggestions I made in relation to
transients and layers? (Mon, 13 Sep 1999 18:31:06 +0100)

Yes, there was. I have talked with Patrick Rogan today about taking over the
contest on the fvwm site. Since he is overloaded with work he'll have no
chance to launch the contest anytime soon. So I think we'll lauch the contest
from fvwm.org in the next few weeks. Ideally there will be a new logo with 2.4.

Ok, I have reduced a number of colors from 255 to 3 (haha) and it is
still much nicer than the current one, so I will make it a default
(until we have results of fvwm-logo contest if any).

I think that a link would be enough. You can include them to fvwm-web
later when the site disappears, for example. Because this or a similar
site can be updated. There are fvwm images in the old context page too:

Mark, I doubt we should put much work into handling transients
on other layers than the parent. All this stuff is far too
complicated to find a solution that works well. This is a topic
on the wm-spec-list and may be subject to a lot of changes in the
near future. I would ignore all this until the wm-spec-list has
come to a decision.

Okay, this looks good, but I still se a few small problems:

Configuration: RaiseTransient + LowerTransient + DontFlipTransient:

 1) The RaiseLower command never lowers a window that is overlapped
    by one of its transients. I guess this is because there is still
    a window obscuring it and thus the function assumes it has to
    raise the window. The same behaviour is correct if you use the
    FlipTransient style.

Configuration: RaiseTransient + LowerTransient + FlipTransient:

 2) I use 'GlobalOpt MouseFocusClickRaises' and
    'Style * SloppyFocus'. When I click on a window with a transient
    it raises above its transients as expected, but if I click it
    again it doesn't lower back below the transient. It does lower
    itself if I raise it by clicking on the title bar.

---------- a while later ------------

Problem 1 is fixed now.

---------- a while later ------------

Problem 2 is fixed too.

There is only one thing left that may confuse users (well, it *does*
confuses me and that should probably be fixed:

Configuration: RaiseTransient + LowerTransient + FlipTransient:

 3) Put some window A on page 0 0; put a window B with a transient
    C on page 1 0. Put a window D on page 1 0. Raise window B and C
    so that they are above D and C atop of B. Raise the window A on
    the other page by moving it in the pager with button 2. Now when
    I raise window B I expect it to flip atop C because of FlipTransient.
    But instead nothing seems to happen. In fact, B and C are raises
    over A because although its on a different page. A RaiseLower would
    have lowered both windows below D, not raised them above A.

    The problem is that the code in must_move_transients() doesn't
    consider if windows are actually overlapped by other windows but
    only looks at the stacking order. The right thing to do would be
    to check any of its transients (possibly recursive) each window
    overlapping each of the individual transients. Well, since this
    would require O(n^2) tests for overlapping windows (where n is
    the total number of windows) I guess its not worth the effort.

Okay, finally I found the bug. When an applications was started
iconified and provided its own icon, fvwm would send an iconify
packet, delete the internal flag indication the window is iconified,
broadcast the new configuration with the now deleted flag and then
set the flag again. This is exactly what you see in the last three
lines of the debug output above. Neil, please try the lastest
CVS code. You mentioned something about pager getting mapped
lowered, if this problem persists, please start a new discussion
thread about it.

	Hmmm...I would expect to use the Lower function instead of RaiseLower
in this situation, if I wanted a single-click operation. To me this
seems to be adding too much cleverness to a function whose real purpose
is simply toggling between top and bottom. I really much prefer the
simpler interpretation of RaiseLower, but I'd like to hear others'
opinions.

	In any case, it's definitely broken when you're trying to raise above
override_redirects. I don't fancy having to tell a user "Drag that
window till it overlaps some other, non-override_redirect window, and
RaiseLower will raise it over KFM...um, maybe." Now, I can put special
handling in RaiseLower for the RaiseOverUnmanaged case, but I'm not
overly fond of the idea. Any other opinions?

	[Gack!] That won't do.

	We're certainly in agreement on principle here. I'm just not sure
whether to take this answer as a yea or a nay. But, then, I probably
didn't make my original statement into a clear yea or nay question. I'm
suggesting that we consider removing the raising of override_redirect
windows (or, more generally, all unmanaged windows, whether o_r or not)
from the RaiseOverNativeWindows hack. Does anyone have strong feelings
on this one...particularly feelings based on experience with Exceed and
its ilk (which I don't have).

	I'm beginning to suspect (though I won't have much chance to look into
it for a couple of days) that there are more things than simply
override_redirects to consider, based on the problem I see with moxfm
and nedit transients. I'm wondering if there are race conditions such
that there are embryonic windows, if you will, as yet unrealized
non-override_redirect windows whose existence the X server reports to
us, but which are not yet managed by us (not yet in the chain); if so,
the RaiseOverNativeWindows code blithely attempts to raise them, which
may not be a Good Thing.

	In any case, the conjunction of my RaiseOverUnmanaged code with the
RaiseOverNativeWindows code shows the problem not occurring when the
only windows we explicitly raise are those for which we have an
FvwmWindow in the chain. Opinions...?


Cheers,
Bob

At the moment, the panel has the "Keep panel below windows" unchecked, and
the relevant fvwm configuration lines are:

DefaultLayers 6 8 10
Style gmc	CirculateSkip, StaysPut
Style panel	CirculateSkip, StaysPut
Style login	StaysPut

It looked to me like fvwm was behaving one way sometimes, and differently
at other times. So, with the above configuration, I started X, tested
whether windows stayed above or below the panel or if they behaved properly,
and then logout. I did this over and over again. About half the time,
things behaved, the other half, the windows were stuck below the panel until
I hid/showed it.

I then tried the same thing without the StaysPut lines, and got the same
result. Since fvwm behaved differently with no changes in configuration,
I still think this is a bug, not a configuration issue.

I am still trying to get this working. Not easily. Maybe I will add an
option to fvwm-menu-directory, but I am not sure.

This solution (even it works somehow) applying to fvwm-menu-directory
can potencially produce memory leaks (menu (empty) is stored in memory,
but will never be accessed, because the directory is deleted). This is
usually the case for /proc process subdirectories. So if user visits
/proc or other similar subdirectories often, it collects memory leaks.

The only benefit is that 'MenuStyle * PopupAsRootMenu' will work, AFAIU.
This affects all menus, not what one may want. It is still impossible to
define a menu style for dynamic menus (say for menu names starting with
some prefix).

I was planned to write auto_menu.html with some initial examples and
explanations about static and dynamic menu generation. I hope you will
add your notes to it too. :)

I am forwarding the Author's response.
Maybe the initial solution is to add this module, but make it optional?
Anyway we wait until FvwmKb-0.3 is out.

Okay, here's a bare bones config that works well with GNOME. Well, almost;
there is the little matter with the panel layer.

Yes, I plan to release v0.3 soon.

My main idea was/is to make FvwmKb as window manager-independent as
possible so if some wm supports external modules which are able to
send it decoration changing messages, it should be fairly easy to
adapt FvwmKb to this wm.

On the other hand I think it would be a good idea to distribute FvwmKb 
within fvwm as well as a stand alone application. So if fvwm
development team included the module into the fvwm source tree I
would take full responsibility of maintaining it and synchronizing
with stand alone version.

My todo list for v0.3 is

1. make it compile with egcs-1.1.2 (see below)
2. couple of minor bugfixes
3. instruction on how to use FvwmKb with scwm (it involves several
   simple enhancements to scwm's fvwm compatibility module

For v0.4 I plan to add support for accepting commands from fvwm to
change keyboard layouts so it would be possible to add, say, a menu
with items "Russian", "English", etc and change layouts with mouse clicks.
Another possible improvement in v0.4 would be to rewrite all communication
with wm using c++ streams

No, I don't plan/want to rewrite FvwmKb in C. There are several
reasons, main of which are

1. I use hashtable to store window-id/current-xkb-layout pairs. The
   hash table implementation I deploy is from STL (standard template
   library). I hate reinventing wheels and I don't like the idea of
   spending my time (re)implementing efficient hash table myself.

2. I believe that programming with exceptions makes programmer's life
   much easier and, more important, makes programs less error-prone
   and _much_ easier to debug. 

Look at it from another side: I tried to carefully rewrite/enhance all
functions I use from fvwm library, libc and Xlib to generate
exceptions at the lowest levels instead of returning error codes. So
why don't consider my exceptions-enabled code as a foundation to, say, 
libfvwm++ - library for writing modules in c++. I'm sure this would
encourage many new would-be modules writers to join the team :) All
exceptions related things are separated in FvwmKb source so it would
be very easy to move them to some other place in fvwm source.

And there still is a reason

3. I still hope to add support for other window managers so the
   abstract wm layer is essential in my opinion

I developed FvwmKb using egcs-1.0.3 and glibc-2.0 from RedHat 5.2. New
RedHat 6.0 delivers egcs-1.1.2 and glibc-2.1. New glibc defines
sa_handler as a macro making it impossible to have such a variable. Do
the following changes to the FvwmKb source:

It should compile without errors now.

  Have done; sorry, but it still happens :-(  Oddly, the representation of
dtcm inside FvwmPager now appears on or near the bottom of the window
stack instead of the top!?  With the debug added to the latest CVS:

Start dtcm:
configure window: 0x5400039
add window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 0
configure window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 0
iconify: 0x5400039
configure window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 1
iconify: 0x5400039
configure window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 0

[not window, FP shows it open]

Deiconify:
deiconify: 0x5400039

[FP now brings it's map of the window to the front]

Iconify:
configure window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 0
iconify: 0x5400039
configure window: 0x5400039
IS_ICONIFIED = 1
configure window: 0x2c00003
IS_ICONIFIED = 1

You should only use one, either StaysPut or the DefaultLayers command.
If you use both this will again prevent the apps from ending up on the
same layer as normal windows.

The differences in behaviour are probably caused by panel. What you see
depends on the layer of the panel when fvwm starts up. I guess what you
see is a race condition between panel and fvwm competing to set the
layer hint. The randomness in behaviour should go away if you don't use
StaysPut (since fvwm will not try to modify the layer then).

Are you 100% sure that you got the right code and recompiled and
installed fvwm properly? I can't believe it. The bug was *so*
obvious when you know where to look. The fix was not in FvwmPager
but in fvwm itself (events.c). Can you double check that you are
really using the correct code?

  Oops :-(

  Sorry, I'd assumed that the fix was in FvwmPager.c (I noticed it had
been updated today)!


  OK, assume for now it's OK - I'll actually test it out in a new snapshot
when they're working again.

I'm  confused  as to  why  you've created fvwm-logo-old.xpm and stored
fvwm-logo-colorful in the FvwmBanner directory.

If someone gets around to making FvwmBanner accept a command line arg,
for the pixmap to use, we would only need one pixmap to be built in.

I think any other banners should be in fvwm-web.

In events.c, line 713, replace the lines from

          if(IS_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win))

to

              BroadcastConfig(M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW, Tmp_win);

with

          if(IS_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win))
            {
              SET_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win, 0);
              SET_ICON_UNMAPPED(Tmp_win, 0);
              CreateIconWindow(Tmp_win,
                               Tmp_win->icon_x_loc,Tmp_win->icon_y_loc);
              BroadcastPacket(M_ICONIFY, 7,
                              Tmp_win->w, Tmp_win->frame,
                              (unsigned long)Tmp_win,
                              Tmp_win->icon_x_loc, Tmp_win->icon_y_loc,
                              Tmp_win->icon_w_width, Tmp_win->icon_w_height);
              /* domivogt (15-Sep-1999): BroadcastConfig informs modules of the
               * configuration change including the iconified flag. So this
               * flag must be set here. I'm not sure if the two calls of the
               * SET_ICONIFIED macro after BroadcastConfig are necessary, but
               * since it's only minimal overhead I prefer to be on the safe
               * side. */
              SET_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win, 1);
              BroadcastConfig(M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW, Tmp_win);
              SET_ICONIFIED(Tmp_win, 0);

(the new parts are the two SET_ICONIFIED macros at the end of this block.).

I thought that the pixmap to be used as built-in default can be configured
from the three supplied (there will only be a change in #include).
If you think that this is a bad idea, feel free to correct it.

If you look at them as external banners - probably yes, if you look at
them as alternative default variants - they belong to FvwmBanner.

Mikhael.

Look like I've corrupted something. I had something like this when I
added
the ability to set the foreground color to "contrast" but I can't get it
to fail now. Could you hack out the two bits of code concerned with
"contrast" and see if it still fails?

Cheers,
Tim.

I'd rather not see pixmaps the size of the banners as part of the
fvwm tarball. It's bad enough that there must be one such file,
but I'd definitely against adding a set of them. We just need an
icon distribution.

I think you are aware of this, but the way you  worded that has me not
sure.

We do have an icon distribution.  Check out xxx.fvwm.org.

Based on this  mornings discussions and  the comments  about the sites
possibly going away,  I will be adding the   banners and side  pixmaps
from the 2 sites mentioned to the fvwm-web icons directory.

I'm  including     the  "extra" icons    that   are   now  sitting  in
modules/FvwmBanner.

I  don't see  the value  of having more   than one built in  pixmap in
FvwmBanner.

As for size, a few days ago, right after I removed the  icons, I did a
make distcheck.  I don't know why, but the size  of the tar.gz file is
1,349,807.  I haven't figured out yet why its so large.

The ChangeLogs are getting out of hand.

Okay, I see this address for the first time now. Is that some private
URL where you and Jason test the new pages, Dan?

Let me rephrase what I mean: We need a way to distribute icons *and*
config files that use them in a way that is compatible with the
autoconf stuff of fvwm.

There are several reasons:

 - The tared gziped icons from fvwm95
 - Tons of copyright statements is all files.
 - menus.c has grown to around 170k source code
 - FvwmTheme generates a lot new code in most modules.
 - The ChangeLogs are growing *fast*. The main and module
   changelogs have about 350k.

> The ChangeLogs are getting out of hand.

Indeed. I gues we should probably remove them from the distribution
and provide them in some other fashion.

Jason set it   up.  Anything   committed  to fvwm-web    automatically
propagates to this URL.  I've requested  that Jason switch fvwm.org to
fvwm-web but as  he's  indicated more  than once his   workload hasn't
allowed him to get this done.  I'm sure he will get to it.

I'm not sure what you are driving at.  You can configure a pixmap path
right now.  Last  week you and I agreed  to remove the icons  from the
distribution.  (My offline mail to you  asking about the tgz files you
added to the icon directory.)

They were already removed when I did the make distcheck.

If thats the case, lets get them out.  I don't see why it can't say,
see the copyright notice in xxx.

All good code I'm sure.

Tim,  I commented out the stuff around line 540 dealing with contrast 
that was the only stricking thing I noticed dealing with contrast.  
Did I miss something else. The theme I'm loading is 
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 gray80 #515178 CGradient 128 #515178 #000000
and I'm running on a 24bit display could this have something to do 
with the readwrite color stuff?

After all the work to put them in? :-) Hm, let's see...
251 .c and .h files plus perhaps 50 other files with a copyright
statement. One statement uses 717 bytes.

  300 * 717 = 210k

Wow.

Thanks for the kind lie ;-) It's much code and there is much

I mean, who uses the ChangeLogs anyway. Only the developers. Anybody
else will be hard pressed to extract any useful information from them.
SuSE for example takes all ChangeLogs out of the packages and provides
a ChangeLog package (that probably nobody installs).

What was happening was I was commenting out StaysPut like this:
Style panel CirculateSkip#, StaysPut. Of course this didn't work, it thought
CirclauteSkip# was an unknown option and when ahead and applied StaysPut.
Everything works now, thanks. Sorry for all the trouble.

Right, as long as they still stay in the CVS tree :)
Still, I think the ChangeLogs should be rotated out of the reposatory, say,
monthly.  That would theoretically keep the size down near 32k (judging by
the fact that that most of the changelogs are 10-11 months old.)

On the FvwmBanner stuff, I agree that all but the internal pixmap (which I
personally think there should be only one of, but that's just my opinion)
should be externalized, and FvwmBanner should be able to accept a pixmap as
a command line parameter.  Additionally, I suggest a command line option or
.fvwm2rc option that can make FvwmBanner wait until it's done displaying its
banner to send the startup notification (this way colormap problems could be
avoided).  I'd be happy to do either or both of those, but I'd need some
feedback as to where to set the option, or if there's a reason it shouldn't
exist.

Okay, scratch the first part of that, unless you want a command line option,
too.  The second part still applies :)

Hello,

In the last "Planet Linux", a french (paper) journal, there is
an article about windows managers. The wm considered are Qvwm,
Blackbox, Amiwm, Icewm, wm2, wmx and fvwm.
There is 60 lines about fvwm and these lines are really good for fvwm !
The sub title is "Fvwm2 l'anctre se porte bien", it is not easy
for me to do the translation but it means that "the old-father is
really alive" (can one do a better translation ?). The paper is
well documented and on version 2.2.2 (there is one word on the devel
version: compatibility with gnome). The conclusion is :
Good point: "il sait tout faire" ~ it can do every things
Bad point: "l'absence de theme" ~ No themes
Here theme means click somewhere to change the "decorations".

Olivier

	How about "the great-grand-daddy [of window managers] is still going
strong" (or "...is still standin' tall and lookin' good")?

	I'd certainly like to see the entire article, or at least the FVWM
section. I don't suppose "Planet Linux" has an online version, does it?
If so, a link would be nice.


Cheers,
Bob

As always. When it comes down to changing hundreds of files I'm
the idiot who does the work :-) Perhaps a shell script can do the

Of course. They are invaluable to me, but they are trash in the tarball.

No! I need the old entries too. I could imagine to rotate the old
entries into a new file that is too in the repository for each new
release (i.e. remove the entries that came in for the release before
the current one). This way CVS access time can be reduced.

Do we need an option? We could simply delay that notification until after
FvwmBanner is done displaying the pixmap, just before it exits (is there a
possible race condition with shutting down the pipe?).

I like the idea of a command line argument much better than the current
fvwm resource. It's more flexible.

This perl snippet edits the "*.c" files in place (try before you buy !)

   perl -i -ne 'if (/This program is free software/../MA  02111-1307 
USA/)
        {print "/*\nGPL pointer\n" unless $f++;} else {print;}'  *.c

I don't think it's anything in the recent changes. I've just added a
free() of
something that was malloced and it crashes on the first config line. The
free() is just after InitGetConfig().

Hopefully this will now crash with everybody and someone with purify
will find the bug.

Cheers,

I didn't think the extras lines of code in modules to make them colorset
aware was that big. Or do you mean the size of the executables?  What
are the chances of getting fvwmlib built as a shared library? Does make
distcheck strip the binaries?

Does anyone know the difference between xpmAttr.pixels and
xpmAttr.alloc_pixels?
Are there any cases when .pixels contains more pixels than .alloc_pixels
and would freeing the extra ones do any harm?

If not then I'll chnage it to the above.

  If I understand it correctly, libXpm will try to grab whatever colours
it needs according to the pixel values in the XPM. If it can't get
any/all, it'll either fail, or use the closest ones available (depending
upon what settings you have).

  So, assuming you have closeness allowed, .pixels will contain /all/ the
pixels being used by the XPM, and .alloc_pixels will conatin those
specifically allocated for the XPM, which will be a subset of .pixels,
ranging from none at all to all of them.

  At least, that's how I see it.

I mean lines of code. At least IconMan, Buttons and Pager need
a lot of LOC to handle colour sets. And don't forget all the changes
related to gradients in Graphics.c. And it's not critical anyway
since it's useful code.

That won't help for the size of the tarball. I think Steve had
already looked into this a while ago.

make distcheck doesn't generate binaries at all. To strip the binaries
you would call 'make strip'. Anyway, since I was not talking about the
size of binaries...

I don't know where the confusion is coming from.  This is in the man
page:

You  can also give  it an  optional  file parameter, like  'FvwmBanner
doomface.xpm' or specify an alternate default pixmap via configuration
options (see "*FvwmBannerPixmap" below).


(It already accepts a command line parameter.)

Its actually under the Subject Re: CVS hippo: FvwmTheme can 
use read/write colors


But here is the quick run down.
The theme I'm loading is
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 gray80 #515178 CGradient 128 #515178 #000000

and I'm running on a 24bit display.  I simply dump core when I start
FvwmTheme.  Tim, origionally thought it had something to do with the
contrast stuff, that got committed along with the ReadWrite stuff.

The core comes from a call to free in an XCreateImage.  So right now
Tim, is thinking we need to purify this stuff.  Unfortunatelly my prufiy
won't run under 2.7 so that means I need to rebuild some stuff for
Solaris 2.6 to check that out, but I don't have 2.6 box running 24 bit,
so I'm worried I may not get the same problem there.

Hello,
Probably every body know that but we can answer this to the user:

<An answer to a faq>
1. Create a director ~/.kfmbug
2. Move the contenent of ~/Desktop to this directoy
3. Edite the [path] section of ~/.kde/share/config/kfmrc
so that it become some thing like this:

[Paths]
Trash=$HOME/.kfmbug/Trash
cdrom=$HOME/.kfmbug/Autostart
Templates=$HOME/.kfmbug/Templates
Autostart=$HOME/.kfmbug/Autostart


Then, You do not have any more the kfm icons on your desk.
If you can't live without these icons  use your imagination
and FvwmButtons, fvwm menu ...etc to simulate these icons !
</An answer to a faq>

Dominik -
	I compiled 2.3.7 and am still experiencing the problem.  I've
tried to pay more attention and I find that it also happens when I right
click on the desktop and open the root menu sometimes.  It seems to be
random, but it's always the same 1 pixel green lines in the window.  Would
a screen shot help (although I'm not sure I could get you once since
moving the mouse to another window makes the lines go away...)

FYI - while making 2.3.7 there were a couple of problems:

sed -e 's,xPERLx,/usr/bin/perl,'  > FvwmConsoleC.pl-t

Just sits there since there's no input file. I hit CTRL-D to go on...

It also happened on these sed lines:

sed -e 's,xFVWM_CONFIGDIRx,/tmp/fvwm/etc/fvwm,'  > FormFvwmSetup.-t

BUILDER=${USER-${LOGNAME-`whoami`}} &&  sed -e 's,xCCx,gcc,'  -e
's,xCFLAGSx,-g -O2,'  -e 's,xprefixx,/tmp/fvwm,' -e
's,xsysconfdirx,/tmp/fvwm/etc,'  -e 's,xlibexecdirx,/tmp/fvwm/libexec,' -e
"s,xBUILDERx,$BUILDER,"   > fvwmbug


and on "make install":

BUILDER=${USER-${LOGNAME-`whoami`}} &&  sed -e 's,xCCx,gcc,'  -e
's,xCFLAGSx,-g -O2,'  -e 's,xprefixx,/tmp/fvwm,' -e
's,xsysconfdirx,/tmp/fvwm/etc,'  -e 's,xlibexecdirx,/tmp/fvwm/libexec,' -e
"s,xBUILDERx,$BUILDER,"   > fvwmbug


It ran fine (except for the green lines) however...

Because the function snprintf doesn't exist  in Solaris 2.5.1, I can't
compile FvwmWindowList at home.

Apparently Sun realized  the  errors of its   ways,  and it is on   my
Solaris 2.6 work machine.

Or we could make a new style FlipTransientStrict ... only joking :-) The
same holds for lowering - when not overlapping other windows and not at
the bottom of the stack. I think it is reasonable for this to be
documented behaviour - I'm sure that users of FlipTransient will develop
a feel for it.

As for the RaiseLower case, perhaps the man page should indicate that
the action depends on being overlapped rather than on the position in
the stack.

In case you like these notions, I've attached a man page patch.

I had the same problem. My LD_LIBRARY_PATH didn't include
/usr/local/lib, where libstdc++ was installed. Fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
all was well. I found this out by "ldd conftest", which showed the
missing link.

BTW, I think it's better for the configure script to assume bad user
setup than to assume cross-compiling. It's much more likely.

snprintf() is not portable.  It's not ANSI C _or_ POSIX.

If we must have it we need to provide our own implementation to include
when compiling for systems which don't have one.

I agree, and I've reported this as a bug to autoconf a while ago.  My
comment was that if the C compiler is detected as normal, but the C++
compiler is detected as a cross-compiler, that should be a sure-fire
error and configure should kick you out.

I submitted another report saying that configure shouldn't try these
kinds of tests for cross-compilation: the vast majority of packages
don't support it anyway and configure should simply report an error,
rather than assuming a cross-compiler, if the compiler links but doesn't
run.  I suggested a flag, either in configure.in or on the configure
command line, to allow cross-compiling.

Hopefully the next version of autoconf will fix these issues.

Note that in FVWM 2.4 we won't need a C++ compiler any more, so this is
a non-issue for FVWM after 2.2.

I second the motion to have fvwmlib as a shared library-  I've been tossing
around the idea of making a GTK based configurator for fvwm, and having a
shared fvwmlib I can link to would make it really easy to provide a preview,
even if somebody else writes it before I do.

Though I hardly use FvwmScroll - maybe once in a month just to play with
- it seems to have a small problem when I click on the root window. I
just start FvwmScroll using a menu, the cursor changes to select a
window and click on the desktop which causes a random (??) window to
receive scroll bars.

BTW, being able to cancel FvwmScroll or FvwmIdent actions with <Esc>
would be very nice.

This is already fixed in the current (pre-2.3.8) version.
Unfortunately dayly snapshots are not generated. But the last existing
snapshot fvwm-snap-19990906.tar.gz contains the fix. :)

I find that configure --without-cpp currently does the work.

This would be good.  Paul, if you submit bug reports to autoconf, can you
please submit a bug report about their autogenerated config.status, which
does not allow parallel generation of AC_OUTPUT files. There is a fix for
this at the and of our configure.in, but they must fix this themselves.

This will not be the case when FvwmKb will be added.
I think that --without-cpp may be a default. This will fix most of the
problems. Am I correct?

What do you mean?  As far as I can tell there's no --without-cpp option
in either 2.2.x or 2.3.x configure--what does it do?

You can do it yourself; they have an online bug system via GNATSWEB at
Cygnus now:

http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=autoconf&user=guest&password=guest&cmd=login

That's where I (re-)reported my bugs.

I (a) don't know what --without-cpp does, (b) didn't know that FvwmKb
will require C++, (c) don't see how having a default of no C++ will
help, since that means no FvwmKb by default, right?  and (c) would
prefer it didn't require C++ in general.

At any rate, my preference is that we not add any more C++ modules
until/unless we also work out the autoconf issues.  It's _really_ easy
to get an installation of C++ that links but won't run unless you use,
for example, a -R option--autoconf won't/can't set that up for you.  And
personally I'm bored answering these configuration questions :).

I mean --without-cxx. It is in both 2.2.x and 2.3.x, but currently it is
commented in configure.in.

(c) you are right, by default FvwmKb will not be compiled/installed
if it is optional. But it can be included in all binary distributions
(rpm/deb).

I've been reviewing my list of little annoyances today, in the hope
that we could clear up a few before 2.4. Here's the first one.

	I use ClickToFocusDoesntRaise, which I consider only a partial success.
The problem is that HandleButtonPress (events.c) has code to try to
force a raise if one clicks on the window decorations instead of the
client area to focus the window. Now, apart from the fact that I can see
no useful purpose served by this, it cause a couple of problems.

	First, since I have functions that include a Raise command bound to
certain window components (e.g., the titlebar), this results in
redundant Raises. RaiseWindow gets called twice each time I Button-1
click on the titlebar of a window that doesn't already have focus.

	Second, it causes RaiseLower to behave in a silly way when it's bound
to a mouse click on a window decoration (I have Button-3 on the titlebar
so bound). Let's say I have a window that is somewhere in the middle of
the stack. First, the window gets raised as it gets focus; then the
RaiseLower command gets its shot, and decides that since the window is
on top, it should be lowered.

	I tried the following little patch. I see no ill effects so far, and I
find the behavior much friendlier. Can anyone tell me a good reason why
this code should be left as it is?


Cheers,
Bob

Hm, why does RaiseLower have something to do with with the override
redirect hack? Can't we simply ignore such windows when it comes to
raising/lowering fvwm managed windows?

Then I don't understand your question. If you're asking if we should
remove the exceed hack I think, yes, there are people who won't like
this. Or do you want to move the code somewhere else? In this case I
don't understand why you ask instead of simply doing it. Or do you
have something else in mind?

Uh, I guess a user of KFM actually *wants* those icons or he
wouldn't use KFM.

	Because RaiseLower is currently biased toward lowering a window rather
than raising it, thanks to the overlap check. If a regular window is
below an override_redirect, but is not overlapped by another regular
window, RaiseLower will never raise it above the override_redirects,
because it will never raise it, period: it will always choose to *lower*
it, and the raise hack never gets a chance.

> Can't we simply ignore such windows when it comes to raising/lowering
> fvwm managed windows?

	Ignoring them is our normal handling; that's why the hack is needed in
the first place, so we can detect when one is above our target window
and raise above it.

	This is just one of several problems I'm finding with RaiseLower (I
mentioned another yesterday ("ClickToFocusDoesn'tRaise...Does"). Now,
somebody went to a good deal of trouble to add the overlap logic, so I
have to believe it was because he found it useful; and probably many
others do too. But I find it just the opposite. I'm beginning to think
we need two different styles (please don't hit me...no...put down that
awk!)...something like SimpleRaiseLower (it's either on top or it isn't)
and CleverRaiseLower (with overlap checking). Well, ok, Simple would
need to take the new transient styles into account.

	I was asking because I don't have any experience with using FVWM under
Exceed, and I was looking for feedback from the original author
(Matthias?) or anyone else who uses Exceed. From the underwhelming
response, I gather that most of the developers are fortunate enough not
to have to use it. I'll just make the change and see who squawks, then.

	The change I was suggesting is neither moving nor removing the code.
The code now attempts to raise everything, override_redirects and all;
what I proposed was that the Exceed hack only raise FVWM-managed
windows, and leave the others on their own. In effect this is the result
you would get now if you used both RaiseOverNativeWindows and
RaiseOverUnmanaged, since by the time we hit the Exceed hack all our
windows will have already been raised above the overide_redirects.


Cheers,
Bob

A screenshot might help.  You can get one with this command line:

  # sleep 5; xwd -root > screenshot.xwd

After you hit return you then have five second to reproduce the
problem before the screenshot is made.  Plear gzip the screenshot
and cut out the parts of it that are not interesting since
screenshots tend to be huge.

The additional checks for the frame were the former CLICKY_MODE patch.
It has been in the earliest fvwm version 2 release I have access to
(2.0.38):

  #ifdef CLICKY_MODE_1                                                            
            if((Event.xany.window != Tmp_win->w)&&                                
               (Event.xbutton.subwindow != Tmp_win->w)&&                          
               (Event.xany.window != Tmp_win->Parent)&&                           
               (Event.xbutton.subwindow != Tmp_win->Parent))                      
  #endif                         
              {                                                                   
                RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);                                             
              }                                                                   
                                                 

In 2.0.46 I find a comment in the TO-DO file:

  - Add ClickToFocusDontRaise style (so clicks in window don't
    automatically raise the window when giving it focus).  Note - this
    behavior currently exists if you compile with CLICKY_MODE_1
    defined, I believe.

So it seems that it was intended that clicking on the title always
raises a window.  Perhaps the reson is that by default only clicks
on the title/border were intended to raise a CTF window, but not
clicks in the client window? Then the correct condition would be:

  if (Scr.go.ClickToFocusRaises)
  {
    RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);                                             
  }
  else if((Event.xany.window != Tmp_win->w)&&
          (Event.xbutton.subwindow != Tmp_win->w)&&
          (Event.xany.window != Tmp_win->Parent)&&
          (Event.xbutton.subwindow != Tmp_win->Parent))
  {
    RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);                                             
  }

Bye

Did you discover some way to make this happen since you reported
this bug?  I would look into this if I had the slightest hint where
to begin.  Can you provide the output of xwininfo -all of the pager
window when it has the screwed up geometry and after you recovered
it via recapture?

  xwininfo -name FvwmPager -all

or 
  
  xwininfo -id ... -all

(You can find out ther window id with 'xwininfo -root -tree').

It was a bug in the handling of the 'gotobutton right' function. When
the selected button was in the rightmost column is jumped back to the
button in the top left corner. I have fixed this in the development
code.

I believe he's refering to the interval while you have the crosshairs for
window selection. (FvwmIdent has to be invoked from a root menu or
keystroke.)

Let us know why the one at xxx.fvwm.org doesn't qualify.

I can think of one reason, I don't believe that the man page
and config file references match up with what we actually have.

Still, I'd like to know what you're thinking.

I didn't take a look at the distribution yet.

Yes, this is the kind of things we have to do before 2.4.
It has to integrate smoothly into the fvwm distribution and
all references that we use must be up to date. If you can
come up with a more detailed list of what is left to do here
I will put that in the next update and remove #90.

	I'll have to think about this one. On first thought, I'd vote for
changing the meaning of ClickToFocusDoesntRaise, and eliminate the extra
checks. The alternative would be yet another option, like
ClickToFocusReallyDoesntRaise.

	I wonder how many ClickToFocus users have mouse clicks on the
frame/titlebar bound to functions like Move-or-Raise or
Resize-or-Raise...and have had for years? My guess is, a lot, and
they're getting double raises every time they click the titlebar (and
have been for years). The automatic raise is not only superfluous, but
undesirable in this case, and has other undesirable side effects like
confusing RaiseLower when it's bound to a mouse click.

	I think it's much more useful - certainly more flexible - to allow the
ClickToFocus user to control when the window is raised by the functions
bound to particular mouse button clicks on specific window components.

	Hmmm...come to think of it, the decision to focus or not could be
controlled this way as well; who needs FVWM to make the decision, when
the user can control which clicks focus via his bindings
(ClickToFocusMeansDoItYourself?) Better not go there, this close to 2.4.
Nevertheles, it's an intriguing idea.

Back in May we had a long discussion about the proper window to
transfer focus to when a transient closes. A number of people felt that
the only proper thing to do was to transfer focus to the parent (always
be suspicious of a principle stated that way!) I expressed reservations.
As I recall the decision was "let's try it this way for a while and see
if it really bothers anyone; if so we can make a new option."

	It really bothers me. Let's make a new option.

	Here's the scenario I have. I use ClickToFocus, GrabFocus, and
GrabFocusTransient. My preferred editor is nedit (no religious
discussion about the One True Editor, please!) When I'm editing a file,
and wish to open a new one (which will open a new top level window), I
select File->Open, which pops up a transient file selection dialogue.
When I select the file I want, a new edit window appears and the
transient closes, but who gets the focus? The old window, which was the
parent of the now defunct transient. This is definitely not what any
normal user would want; it's not even what I would want.

	Now, the problem is that nedit creates the new window before destroying
the transient. You see the new window briefly flash its focused colors
before the transient disappears and the focus reverts to its parent. It
won't do to argue that this is a program bug. It's simply the way nedit
operates, and we should be able to handle it gracefully. I'm sure there
are other programs that do similar things.

	I am now sure that I want an option to have the focus revert to the
last-focused window instead of the parent, since, as I mentioned back in
May, there are other scenarios where reverting to the parent is
absolutely the wrong thing.

	Would anyone else like to cast a vote before I dig into this one?

Bob

Here is what I think about this. fvwm_icons.tgz is good for providing
backward compatibility. I think, it can be called fvwm-icons.tar.gz
and include the top-level directory in it (fvwm-icons/), but this is not
too important to me. Must it include a version postfix (fvwm-icons-2.2)
or is it not supposed to be changed? Probably not.

Let's see. generated/icon_shots/icons.gif - there are dozens of
non-standardized different sizes and different styles, making it hard to
use them. Some of the icons here are included into wm-icons icon sets
48x48-general, 56x46-3dpixmaps and 21x17-3dpixmaps.

Now, mini-icons in generated/icon_shots/mini[12].gif are represented much
better, although there are also dozens of different close sizes.
Many of them are included into wm-icons icon sets {16x16,14x14}-general.
BTW, Dan, nice idea with xbmbrowser, I will use it too. :-)

I don't speak here about other icons categories like banners, side pics
and others. It is really hard (if not impossible) to standardize them,
so it is a good idea to have them and update in fvwm-web. As for desktop
icons, I think, wm-icons is the real solution.

I didn't update wm-icons for several months, but now I am coming back to
it. I am still with fvwm, but wm-icons is a high priority for me
for now. I will release a minor version soon and then will ask to help me
with improvements (autoconf, rpm, CVS, better name list and much more).

I guess it's a relic of fvwm 1.x that nobody thought of
changing.  I vote to remove it completely and look if
someone complains.

This change would be a bit too disruptive to existing config
files.

A while ago I started to create a small, simple icon set
for window managing functions.  Then I had a look at the
template icon set and was overwhelmed by the sheer amount
of icons I was supposed to draw.  I suggest to split the
icon packages in application icons and window management
icon packages.  I see no close connection between the two
anyway since virtually everybody uses window management
icons somewhere, but application icons are a different
story.

Perhaps, when the dreaded wm-spec v2 is finally ready, application
writers will honour it and use the the defined mechanisms to transfer

I still can't believe anybody prefers ClickToFocus :-) Okay, no
religious discussion about focus policy either.

That's the advantage of maintaining a window manager, you can
make it do anything you like :-) BTW, shouldn't we finally clean
up the GlobalOpts and do what has been announced for a long time:
make the focus GlobalOpts new styles?

I had a similar problem with a project that I was working on (AIX 3.2.5
doesn't have snprintf() either).  I searched for a PD implementation, and
found one in the Apache distribution, which I'm MIME-attaching to this
message.

Actually, looking at the comments at the top, this may not be useful for fvwm.
I refer people to the page:

http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

For a GPL version of snprintf() (incomplete support for all formats), and
pointers to other implementations of snprintf().

Well, its  already  been removed from  FvwmWinList.   I  did  notice a
"g_snprintf"  in FvwmGtk.   I'd guess  thats the  GNU version this URL
points to.

I left  out the directory, because I   wanted the user   to be able to
easily  drop    this  anywhere  they  had    it before,  for   example
"/usr/local/icons" or "$HOME/ICONS".

When I can figure out a way to word it, I intend to make it clear that
there  are  much better    icon distributions  available,   especially
wm-icons.  My intent here is to  get the icons  out of the source tree
and provide the   base icon set to  match  up  with  our examples  and
builtins.

The duplication and different naming for the same things bothers me,
but I don't see how I can do anything about it without creating a
wm-icons competitor, and thats not my intent.

Glad you liked  xbmbrowser.  It seemed like  the best way to go  other
than writing something myself.  I'm  thinking of putting the four gifs
onto one page,  and wrapping them  in  a table.   I think the  display
speed would still be reasonable.

One  at  a time   has the  great  advantage  that  you could  download
individual icons, but its too slow for my taste.

I agree.

Well, snprintf() is very useful for avoiding buffer overflows (using sprintf()
could overflow its buffer).  Just like fgets() is preferred over gets(), and
strncpy() is preferred over strcpy().  It's simply a matter of safe
programming.

One would hope that fvwm2.x will remain off BUGTRAQ and other mailing lists
for buffer overflow problems.  Of course, fvwm2.x doesn't normally run as
root, but that's not the point; the point is that if the code is written
safely, there are less opportunities for bugs to be found in the future.

Too bad that C89 turned down snprintf() for standardization.  Having
g_snprintf() in the GNOME libraries doesn't help, really, since fvwm can (and
should) build without GNOME.

If the removal of snprintf() in FvwmWinList simply replaced it with a
sprintf(), then we have a bug waiting to happen, especially if the format
string(s) or arguments are obtained externally (eg, via .fvwm2rc or things
like absurdly-long window titles, etc.). I cannot see any easy way to avoid
such a bug without using snprintf() or vsnprintf().

Yes, you do a good work. I didn't intend to lower it. I also respect your
contribution to wm-icons (good ideas are the most important contribution).

Regarding Icon_Screenshots.ksh, xbmbrowser -xrm 'res:value' works for me
without problems, so you may want to fix it.

I am having hard times to create an automatical script to convert icons
from wm-icons to a gif (jpg) for every icon set. I already patched
xbmbrowser to produce constant sized centered label without extention
and still have alphabetical order and did many other tricks. It is not
easy yet to evaluate the right geometry for xbmbrowser according to icon
size and number of icons to fit them all. Then the window must be shot
after it is mapped, then stripped a top (with menus) header, converted
to .gif... Not easily, ehh? Maybe there is existing tool to do this?

What I need is to automatically create a shot like on
  http://xxx.fvwm.org/generated/icon_shots/icons.gif
for given NNN icons of the size XXXxYYY putting them in CCC columns,
when they are of fixed size, sorted alphabetically and labels are
centered. Seems imposible to find...

It is ok with me, although all icons are included three times in fvwm-web
(.gif, .tgz, .xpm).

This is reasonable. But it requires having two separate icon lists
and two different sets of icon aliases, which makes configuring harder.
I would really like to have one icon set with both application icons
and wm icons. I too see no close connection between both, but noone
can say there is no connection at all. I can use both types in the
same menu/buttons and thus I want to have the same icon style for them.

I am open about these issues and would like to hear what others think.

Currently you can implement your suggestion by providing only one type
of icons in a set. You don't need to draw all icons, in fact you only
need to provide empty.xpm or/and todo.xpm. All others can stay symlinks.

Mikhael.

The flip side of that is you'd like your program to not contain a lot of
hard limits--one of the primary advantages of the GNU versions of system
programs over many vendor versions is the GNU ones are fully dynamic and
don't contain random restrictions on sizes and lengths.

It's not hard, at the expense of some CPU time and/or heap (and
depending on the thing to be formatted) to have save code even without
snprintf().

It's pretty straightforward to get a rough (too conservative) count of
the amount of buffer space you'll need for any given format string.  Add
the sizeof the format string itself, a max size for integers, the strlen
of any strings, and away you go.

snprintf() makes the coding simpler in some ways (depending on how you
want to handle the error condition: if you really want to write the
entire string regardless of length it's actually simpler to calculate it
first as above, IMO).

Or I am missing something or there are these problems with ResizeOpaque:

* after 'Style * ResizeOpaque' opaque resizing works for xv or rxvt, but
  not for xterm or netscape

* only when opaque resizing works, ESC or other mouse button click does
  not work (cancel resizing)

* only when opaque resizing works, there is always a gap of one point on
  the right and bottom

* this can be related to the previous, when you try to resize xv operation
  window (name 'xv controls') from the left or/and top border, the effect
  is moving to the left or/and top by one pixel

* misspelling (redundant space and repeating) about ResizeOpaque/
  ResizeOutline in fvwm2.1 (sorry I have no time to fix)

* not a bug: ResizeOpaque is nice to have, thanks

Easy. Just allocate a target array that is large enough at all times :-)
Module commands cannot be longer than 1000 bytes at the moment, so limiting
a string to say 900 bytes plus the space for the dynamic arguments should be
good enough. Unless int's are 64 bit, but in this case fvwm won't even
compile.

Dominik -

I've put a sreenshot and my fvwm2rc file up at:

http://www.adhesivemedia.com/~philip/screenshot.gif
http://www.adhesivemedia.com/~philip/fvwm2rc.txt

The colors in the screenshot aren't the colors I have spec'ed, but the
bright green is the same...

To get that image, I put the two windows side by side (not overlapping),
then dragged the left window on top of the right one leaving the mouse in
the title bar.  At that point the screen shot was taken.

Let me know what else I can do to help you out...

Thanks -philip

Well, I guess the point about that is that you'll find more people
willing to do only one half of the work than doing both.  For me
drawing all the application windows is a waste of time.  I don't
even know all these applications I would be supposed to provide
an icon for.

A gap between the bottom of what and what else? The window was one pixel
less wide and high during the move. This is fixed.

No, but there is always a possibility of a user fault. :)

I mean I get outline resizing instead of opaque. This is my fault.
'Style * ResizeOpaque' starts to work for new windows only. You can guess,
which windows were new in my example.

Nice. Although, I think, there must be a call to draw window borders
and title text after pressing ESC (this is not needed for ResizeOutline).

Between the bottom of the window and the screen edge. You fixed it.

As always you have to do a recapture because of the way in
which styles are implemented.

Uh, doesn't it do that? It definitely does on my setup.

Yes, I see it too. There is a bug in how your Move-or-Resize
function works. There is a workaround for your problem.
Replace your Move-or-Raise function with this one:

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise
+       "C" Raise
+       "M" Raise
+       "M" Move
+       "D" Lower

Don't ask me why that makes a difference. I'm working on the problem.

Bye

I think that shots will describe it better than I can.
Even window buttons can be blank too, if I narrow window.

Hello,

Attached to this message a patch against the current cvs tree.
If you apply it and try fvwm2 -version then fvwm2 supplies
information on the compile-time options (readline, rplay, 
stroke, xpm, imlib, gnome). This is useful to build and install
portable .fvwm2rc file.

Modified file: 
	: ChangeLog
fvwm    : fvwm.c, fvwm2.1

That doesn't work. I don't have IMLIB and thus the IMLIB macro is undefined.
You have to wrap the output with '#ifdef IMLIB'. I guess it's the same with
the other compile time options.

Hi,

Would it be possible to fix the automake in the
CVS tree so that if you do not use gcc but cc
instead, it uses the -MDupdate flag instead of -MD
to create dependencies ?

I dunno if it is standard to SGI Irix cc, but I
have either -M or -Mupdate, but -MD generates a
macro definition error.

Thanks!

Cheers
Stephane

Aaahrg ... Shame on me !!!
I try it by putting XPM to 0 in config.h (every thing is defined
on my machine) but I see now that this really stupid (I didn't wanted
to see 6 #ifdef FOO neither introduce a new string variable).
Anyway, do you think that it is a good idea ? If yes I can try to do
something that work and which is elegant (I imagine that everybody 
here can do it in one second !).

Tim took care of FvwmWinList.   That leaves FvwmTaskBar,  FvwmIconMan,
FvwmIconBox.  I  think the item should   stay open until  they are all
done.

I added a note to #281 indicating the current status.

Ok I will send a patch Friday (I am now far from my devel machine).
But perhaps a better idea is that "make install" install config.h as
say fvwmconfig.h in goodprefix/include ?

Dan, I had lost track, I though Tim was still tracking down some
deadlocks.  If he is done I will get started on FvwmIconMan.

Tim's the  expert, but  I  believe  the latest   status is  that   the
deadlocks are solved.

Full_Name: Greg Ward
Version: 2.2.2

OS: Solaris 2.6
X_Server: Sun
Submission from: (NULL) (209.206.24.143)


Trying to build with gcc/g++ 2.8.1 under Solaris 2.6.  `configure' script
crashes in the AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED macro (line 159 of configure.in).
Session transcript:

$ CXX=g++ ./configure 
creating cache ./config.cache
checking for a BSD compatible install... ./install-sh -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking whether make sets ${MAKE}... yes
checking for working aclocal... found
[...]
checking for sigaction... yes
checking for siginterrupt... yes
checking for sig_atomic_t... yes
checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can
not run test program while cross compiling

However, if I disable C++ compilation, it works:

$ ./configure --without-cxx
loading cache ./config.cache
checking for a BSD compatible install... ./install-sh -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking whether make sets ${MAKE}... yes
checking for working aclocal... found
[...]
Configuration:

  FVWM Version:             2.2.2

  Build extra modules?      no
  Have ReadLine support?    no
  Have RPlay support?       no
  Have XPM support?         no: Xpm library or header not found!

Not sure if this is a fvwm-configure-script bug or an Autoconf bug.
I tried stripping down configure.in to isolate the bug but was
unsuccessful -- will try harder if assistance is needed!

The WinBase.C failed to compile (located in extras/FvwmConfig).

I was able to get it to compile by adding #include <sys/select.h> to
the file.

Subject: Auto-Hide ?

Full_Name: Nadim Saeed
Version: 2.2.2

OS:

Submission from: (NULL) (207.137.158.177)


Is it possible to add a style (or a command) that would "auto-hide" things
(similar to what FvwmTaskBar's AutoHide does) and have it act on misc
windows.

What I'm getting at is, it would be _great_ to have the ability to select
auto-hide (in a menu/mouse-binding or invoke it as a style within
.fvwm2rc - similar to how 'sticky' is treated today) and then click on
a window (xterm/FvwmButtons/FvwmWinList/etc) and just see a 1-2 pixel
ribbon.  The ribbon would revert back to its normal state upon a
mouse-enter event and would be as wide as the edge of the autohidden
window.

Possible syntax examples,

  Style "*"             AutoHide
  Style "FvwmButtons"   AutoHide

  AddToMenu WindowOps-Popup
  +     "WindowOps"     Title      
  +     "Auto-Hide"     AutoHide


There are a couple of ways of doing this,

 1. Auto-Hide would only work on windows that have at least one side
    abutted to the edge of the screen (similar to Windblows' task-bar).
    If there is more than one edge abutted to the screen, use the
    longer-sized edge.  If all edges are the same size, use the edge that
    doesn't impede on a previous autohidden window.  If there already are
    autohidden windows on all the edges, create a 1-2 pixel ribbon 1-pixel
    above whatever is already there.  In other words, one would have the
    ability to Auto-Hide multiple windows on the same edge and have a
    ribbon (or line) for each hidden window.

 2. Auto-Hide would kinda act like 'WindowShade' in the sense that the 1-2
    pixel ribbons don't have to be anchored to any screen edge at all.
    They can float and reside anywhere one chooses to auto-hide a window.

BTW: this option (or style) could be incorporated into FvwmAuto (since it
     seems as though it falls in-line with what FvwmAuto does - "raising
     of things")

Thoughts/comments/likes/dislikes ?

Submission from: (NULL) (143.239.211.101)


Please consider adding a 'Warp' option to the 'MoveToDesk' command,
so that:

   MoveToDesk arg1 arg2 Warp

is equivalent to:

   MoveToDesk arg1 arg2
   Desk arg1 arg2

OK, so the effect of this suggested enhancement can be achieved
by defining a new function consisting of the latter sequence of
two commands -- but I would like to avoid the extra clutter of
introducing this new function, and I think that the suggestion
would also achieve a desirable consistency with the 'Warp' option
currently available on the 'Move' command.

Cheers, Joseph

forget it, it's a GNU automake crappy default, I
fixed it on my side in /usr/local/share/automake/depend2.am

(Good to know anyway for all those anti-gcc guys ;-))

I downloaded fvwm-2.3.7 to try it.  It fails compilation on Tru64 5.0

 1) No, because automake isn't in the CVS tree, it's on your local
    system.

 2) Building the CVS sources without GCC is not a supported
    configuration; from the docs/DEVELOPERS file:

      | You will need to install several GNU tools to be able to use the cvs
      | sources.  If you do not have these tools available, build from the tar
      | file distribution instead, available from ftp.fvwm.org.
      |
      | To build from the CVS sources, you will need:
      |   * GNU gcc
      |   * GNU make
      |   * autoconf (version >= 2.13)
      |   * automake (version >= 1.4)

    Note that it's automake that imposes these requirements, not FVWM.

 3) There is lots of discussion about these requirements on the automake
    list and I believe the next version (of automake) will relax them.
    But that's an issue for automake, not us.

OK, I decided to start a bit of user-debug on fvwm-2.3.x - without any
modifications to my .fvwm2rc file (just to see what sort of gotchas there
will be).  I got the following errors (I'll number them to ease discussion).

1. [FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file '/usr/local/etc/fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults' not found in /usr19/people/nadim or /usr/local/etc/fvwm
2. [FVWM][pixmapPath_function]: <<ERROR>> PixmapPath is deprecated since 2.3.0; use ImagePath instead.
3. [FVWM][iconPath_function]: <<ERROR>> IconPath is deprecated since 2.3.0; use ImagePath instead.

NOTE: I haven't installed fvwm-2.3.8 (I usually don't), I create a directory
      in the modules sub-dir and link all the executable there (that becomes
      my "ModulePath").
ie.
  ModulePath      /usr13/new/fvwm-2.3.8/modules/ALLmodules

Questions/Comments:
error-1: I don't know what this error is about (no mention in the fvwm2.1
         man file).  I see ChangeLog notes; come to think of it I remember it
         had something to do with FvwmForm and having the "." proceed or
         follow the entries or something (good'ole archive reading is
         paying off :-)  But where can I read about it - in other words, what
         do I have to do to please it ?
error-2: OK, I'll fix my .fvwm2rc file.
error-3: OK, I'll fix my .fvwm2rc file.

 When 2.4.0 is ready for release, it might be a good idea to add a file
 in the distribution indicating the new features/deprecated-ones/etc
 between stable releases (2.2.2 vs 2.4.0).  I like the "NEWS" file, but
 there needs to be another ("RELEASE" ?) in the same spirit as the TODO
 file (the NEWS file is a bit too much info for someone that doesn't want
 to see all the gory details -- "just tell me what I need to change to get
 my current setup to run").  Just a suggestion...

Compiled on: SunOS cosmo 5.5.1 Generic_103640-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
Running via: Exceed-6.1.0.0

I've also noticed a couple of really strange quirks with the new fvwm
(concerning the Pager (extra white border around the internal windows - wrong
sticky color) and WinList (when I iconify something the color of the button
and the text changes for some reason -- it shouldn't) - more in a separate
email).

make install. The requested file will be put where it's expected when
you make install.

As has been pointed out, "make install" has become more important.
Not using make install will cause other things not to work.
The error message isn't the only symptom.

If you have some process set up that makes this undesirable, do make
install to a work area, (using --prefix) and duplicate what it does.

Its not in the man page, because its not user configurable.
The installation instructions say to do "make install".

I think we had a discussion about describing the "sed" needed to fix this.

We  will  be creating  a "docs/ANNOUNCE"  file as we  get  closer to a
non-beta release, but there does seem to be too much NEWS for the next
release.   (Our last   ANNOUNCE  file pointed  to  the  NEWS  file for
details.)

Right, but gcc (even 2.8.2) produces dead slow binaries under Irix,
because it is not really optimizing. I never had any problems in
compiling with MIPSPro cc/CC, and Fvwm2 just screams ;-))

Funny thing: The remarks in depend2.am says : we do NOT use -MD
for several good reasons, and then it is used in the code...

I might subscribe to the automake likst some days :-)

By the way, Irix cc is a bit more careful on the code quality,
and I get several warnings like "int * not compatible with
unsigned int * and so on. If I get a positive reply from you
guys, I can fix them on the latest tree and submit a global
diff patch to the list (I don't have commit access). I think
that compiling without warnings on all the supported platforms
is a must, isn't it ?

Cheers

I think I agree with you, deleting transients along with their parent

wanted it for is due for retirement. I'll move it to enh-reject.

I believe the deadlocks are fixed with FvwmWinList. The golden rules
are:

*) Reply to every message with an Unlock
*) Only block in the select() call. This means no XSync(), XNextEvent()
calls.

Cheers,

It only crashes when the first *FvwmThemeColorset line uses "contrast"
and "average" as foreground and background colors. The following crashes
if it is the first config line:

*FvwmThemeColorSet 7 contrast average ygradient 200 4 blue 1 navy 1 blue
1 navy 1 blue

but if "contrast" is replaced by "white" it works. Once one colorset has
been processed it doesn't crash on "contrast".

Cheers,
Tim.

But how does that explain my crash on 
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 gray80 #515178 CGradient 128 #515178 #000000
??

It doesn't. I was hoping that someone with purify could see the crash
and find out where the memory corruption is happening.

Pixmaps in Menues should be scaled (maybe only as an option)
Sometimes with big icons the menu looks very .... awful
Pixmaps should have all about the same size (height).

This has been fixed in the sources for a while (since about the day

Dominik or anyone else who can answer my question,

I am now running Fvwm-2.3.9 and I have the Panels working now (thank you for
fixing transient).

Let me setup my question with how I have my panels defined.  Here is a sample:

(NoSize, Icon Monitor.xpm, Panel(right, delay 0, steps 2) LoginsPanel, \
        "Module FvwmButtons -transient LoginsPanel")

Now when I click on a button in this sub-panel it goes away as expected, but it
then restarts and disappears again.  Is this the expected result?  Am I doing
something else wrong?

I have each panel in its own file (for easy editing) and I have the following in
my $HOME/.fvwm2rc file:

###################### Button button-bar Files #######################
# FvwmButtons Configuration file
*FvwmButtonsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/Buttons
*MainPanelFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/MainPanel
*LoginsPanelFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/LoginsPanel
*AppsPanelFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/AppsPanel
*ArtToolsPanelFile /home/misha21/.fvwm/ArtToolsPanel

Before I put everything in its own file I did have this all in my .fvwm2rc file
and I had the same results.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Ugh, yes, it's the expected result. Obviously I should have tried it
myself. The reason is that 'Panel' works just like 'Swallow' with the
'respawn' option set. That means that the application is lurking in
the background as soon as FvwmButtons has been started (you can see
the panel flashing once when FvwmButtons starts up). When you click
in a transient FvwmButtons it exits. The parent module notices that
the panel has died and and restarts it so that the next press on the
panel button can map it - hence the new flash.

You can prevent the flashing by giving the panel a geometry in the
'void' (e.g. FvwmButtons -g -32767-32767 mypanel). I'd like to do
this automatically, but since FvwmButtons doesn't control where
the spawned application will be mapped I don't know what to do
about it. I have to think more about this. 

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Dan et al, I can't argue that "make install" is important, but in alot of
circumstances (and for a variety of reasons) - there will be individuals
that will not be able to do a proper "make install".

I, for one, would love to know how I can get-by without a complete install.

Could I create ~/.fvwm and copy all the "FvwmForm*." there and set
"FVWM_USERHOME" to "~/.fvwm" -- would that do the trick ?  

I think adding the reason and intent behind "ConfigFvwmDefaults" is worthy
enough to be added to the man pages (even if its not user configurable).
It might also be a good idea to point-out what "Not using 'make install' will
cause other things not to work" really means (what are those other things).

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be combative or anything (far from
it - I think you guys are doing a great job).  I just think the option
(or a detailed explanation) needs to be discussed.

Don't tell me I'll have to decipher "make install -n" :-)

Hmm, didn't like my "make install" to a work area suggestion...


If you are just building links, you  will miss the new executables and
links  too.  Watch out for the  link  from FvwmAudio to FvwmEvent, and
FvwmTalk orginating  from the  FvwmForm build  area.  Also   watch for
Fvwmcascade and FvwmTile.

As for  the  config files, during  "config" you  end  up defaulting or
setting the  location of the  config  files.  This could  be somewhere
like  /usr/local/etc.  As of 2.3.9,   these  are the installed  config
files:

  -rw-r--r--   1 dje      other        167 Sep 20 23:12 ConfigFvwmBacker
  -rw-r--r--   1 dje      other        899 Sep 20 23:13 ConfigFvwmButtons

  -rw-r--r--   1 dje      other        856 Sep 20 23:17 FormFvwmTalk.
  -rw-r--r--   1 dje      other       1097 Sep 20 23:17 FormFvwmTalkHelp.

You should be able to find these files scattered thru the build area.

As you might appreciate from this, trying to work without make install
is way too complicated.  I don't think I'd like to add this to the man
page or the installation instructions at all.

Once and a while, if I'm working on something for a while, I'll start
out doing a make install, then replace the installed file with a link,
and do make instead of make install.  But then I do lots of work on
a really slow machine, and I have an excuse.

Dominik,

I tried your suggestion and it seemed to cause more problems.  Here is what I
did:

(NoSize, Icon Monitor.xpm, Panel(right, delay 0, steps 2) LoginsPanel, \
        "Module FvwmButtons -g -32767-32767 -transient LoginsPanel")

This made the sup-panel squeeze in from the sides and top and bottom.  It also
made it flash/pop up in the middle of my screen.  Oh well...

I would like to say that besides the flashing, I really like this new
implementation of the panels.  It is a lot easier to setup.  This and the
ability to set the button size has made my button bar look and behave almost
like FvwmWharf.

Thank you for the effort you and all the other developers have put into this
window manager.  It is greatly appreciated.

OK, OK --
     I've run "./configure --prefix /my_disk/fvwm-test" and "make install"

I'm still getting,

 [FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file '/usr/local/etc/fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults' not
               found in /usr19/people/nadim or /usr/local/etc/fvwm

Can I now set some environmental var. to point to the altered $prefix
installation (/my_disk/fvwm-test instead of /usr/local) ???

One quick note, you might want to consider installing into
$prefix/etc/fvwm/VERSION/Config*
                 ^^^^^^^
so that someone running fvwm-2.6.x doesn't clobber over fvwm-2.4.x
(in case those files do ever change in the future)

Point well made.  A couple of minor things (if I'm out of line - in other
words, the discussion has been had and that's that - let me know)

Concerning obsoleted modules:
a. Instead of having links from FvwmAudio to FvwmEvent wouldn't it be cleaner
   if fvwm internally reverted to FvwmEvent whenever FvwmAudio is called (this
   support would disappear after the next release of course -- you don't want
   these things to build-up -- you want the users to make the changes ASAP,
   but yet be nice enough to accept their configs for _now_)
b. As for FvwmTile (and FvwmTalk etc.) you don't necessarily have to create
   those scripts as part of the 'make install'.  Those scripts could reside as
   is in the distribution.  In other words, in the 'modules' sub-dir have a
   directory named 'FvwmTile' with FvwmTile (the script) as its only content
   (that way you are NOT dependent on "make install")
c. Cry foul (ie. print out an ERROR) and tell the user that FvwmAudio is
   obsolete and tell them to use FvwmEvent instead (applies to all obsoleted
   modules).
d. You'd mentioned something about a sed script for ImagePath (that script
   could apply here as well to make the necessary changes).  Something along
   the lines of 'convert_2.2_to_2.4' sed or perl script would do.

Concerning point-A above, I'd guess that fvwm does not get involved with
modules, it just passes the calls, but the translation would be pretty light
weight I'd think.  Point-B, I think, is clearer compared to what we have now
with no added expense.  Point-C is already happening and Point-D would be
pretty simple as well (whatever changes are needed to circumvent the obsolete
modules would happen automatically for the user - similar to the convert
fvwm1->2 script).

Am I completely whacked-out ?

During configure, add "--sysconfdir=/my_disk/fvwm-test/etc", or  where
ever you like.

During make install in the fvwm directory, you should have seen
an error if it was unable to copy into /usr/local/etc/fvwm.  Is there
anything there?  If not, did you get a message?

I might have comments on your other points later.

I just went through the whole process again (sans sysconfdif) - NO errors (I
could mail you the output if you so desire).  I think the process went
smoothly - no complaints there :-)

Having just done a './configure --help' its showing sysconfdir as,

  --sysconfdir=DIR        read-only single-machine data in DIR [PREFIX/etc]

which is correct --> $prefix/etc (no need for me to redefine it).

I would have guessed I could 'setenv ??FVWM_ROOTINSTALL?? /my_disk/fvwm-test'
and that'd be it (pretty reasonable thing to do, no ?)  It would default
to /usr/local.

Alas, here were my steps:

   $ setenv LDFLAGS "-R/usr13/new/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib"
   $ ./configure
       --with-xpm-library=/usr13/new/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib
       --with-xpm-includes=/usr13/new/xpm-3.4k-solaris/include
       --prefix=/tmp/fvwm
   $ make install

(I assume there  are some  backslashes  in the config  command, or you
just cut it up for email purposes.)

With "--prefix=/tmp/fvwm", the config   files should have been  put in
/tmp/fvwm/etc/fvwm.   If  you  then  execute  /tmp/fvwm/bin/fvwm2,  it
should find the config files in /tmp/fvwm/etc/fvwm.

You can't change  this at run time, the  location of the  config files
gets compiled  into  the binaries.   I don't see  the  value of having
run-time control over this.

If its still not doing what I say it should be  doing, send the output
to me directly.

Well, heres the one relevant line from my make install output:

 ../../version-2_3_9/install-sh -c -m 644 ../../version-2_3_9/fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults /opt/public/etc/fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults

You might be able to use this output to create a shell that will create
the links you want.  (I recommend getting with the program, and
just doing make install to the real location.)

Yup - it was a cut-n-paste job (for readability).

OK - I botched up the cut-n-paste above (the prefix should have been
/my_disk/fvwm-test) -- didn't mean to confuse things further.  I figured out
what my problem was.  I don't have a problem with the way things are done now
that fvwm found its confdir.  Here is my error:

I was deleting config.cache/config.sys/config.status and running configure -
it would generate new Makefiles and I thought that would be sufficient to
recompile everything (timestap of Makefile would be younger than the
executable and so it would recompile it, or so I thought).  That didn't
happen (I guess my understanding have been wrapped over the years concerning
dependencies).  And so I was compiling with the prefix, but no where did I
see the new PREFIX (not even with I 'strings fvwm2') which lead to to believe
that maybe its a runtime indicator.  Alas, got through it (teaches me not
to do 'make distclean').

I've been assimilated (make install it is);
my previous points/suggestions still stand though.

Thanks for your patience Dan - I feel rather foolish :-\

*Sigh*, no, that doesn't cause a crash for me. FvwmTheme didn't
crash on my machine for weeks. Can you send me a minimal
.fvwm2rc that causes a crash?

I suspect that this is related to the IconMan crash I got. In this
case it must be in the code that is shared between FvwmTheme and
the other modules, i.e. in libs/Graphics.c.

Tim, I have fixed a memory leak in FvwmTheme.c and a call where
potentially random colours could have been free'd. (the address
of the bg member of the colorset struct was used as an array of
three colours). But I don't believe that fixes any crashes.

it will be fixed there.

Paul (PDS) and whoever else feels competent to say something
about build and configure problems:

We have a number of such bug reports in the 'incoming' directory
of Jitterbug and I really don't have an idea what to do with
them. Could you please look at these reports and comment on
what to do with them?

Bye

I found one memory corruption, the fix is commited. It was in
FvwmTheme.c and was a malloc() that was too small for the following
sprintf().

Brad could you test it?

Cheers,
Tim.

Well the good news is it no longer crashes, good find.  The even better 
news is I managed to get purify up on my 2.7 box. The bad news is there 
is one memory leak left and I'm not sure what to do                     

The XPutPixel has an array bounds write problem. And I think your
problem and correct me if I'm wrong in Graphics.c you have the following
on line 690 
image->data = safemalloc(image->bytes_per_line * t_height);
shoudln't it be 
image->data = safemalloc(image->bytes_per_line * t_height * t_width);
or am I just terriblly confused?


    case C_GRADIENT:
      {
    register int w = t_width - 1;
    register int h = t_height - 1;
    register int t_scale = (double)(w * h) / sqrt(8);
    
    for (i = 0; i <= w; i++)
      for (j = 0; j <= h; j++) {
            register double x = (i - w / 2) * h / 2;
            register double y = (h / 2 - j) * w / 2;
            register double rad = sqrt(x * x + y * y);
        XPutPixel(image, i, j, pixels[(int)(rad * ncolors / t_scale)]);
      }
    break;  
      }

Please post the purify output so I can have a look at the problem.

Yes, I gues you *are* terribly confused :-) The size is calculated
with bytes per >line<, not bytes per >pixel<.

Perhaps a rounding error in "rad * ncolors / t_scale"?

I'm now  getting this on  both  my home  system and at  work.  Nothing
seems to have changed in scanner.l.  At home I'm using  lex, and I get
a different message suggesting I increase  a limit.  I tried that, and
it exceeds  some other limit.  I increased  that, and exceeded another
limit.

Anyway, I'm stuck.

I removed the files that lex/flex and yacc/bison generate while I'm
hacking FvwmScript. I'll put them back when I'm finished so this should
go away then.

You're right of course I just looked at the log (which should be
attached) and it was array bounds read I was concentrating on array
write problems.  So it probabbly is a rounding error but we can just
check that value < ncolors-1 instead.

We have a report that our current test for XPM 3.4f isn't sufficient;
apparently some of the new code uses a function (XpmReturnAllocPixels)
which isn't available in that version.

It's available in 3.4k (the latest).

Do we know when it was added?  Or should we just start requiring 3.4k?

To answer my own first question: XpmReturnAllocPixels was added in 3.4g,
according to the xpm CHANGES file.

So, the second question: is 3.4g "good enough" as a minimum version, or
should we require the latest 3.4k.

What else new do we use?  Do we use "alloc_close_colors" in
XpmAttributes?  How about "bitmap_format"?  The color stuff, like
XpmAllocColorFunc, etc.?

Hmm, maybe we should just go to the latest.  3.4k was released on 18 Mar
1998, so it's about 18 mos. old now...

There was some discussion about freeing the colors using a different
technique.  I think the freeing works just as well using the technique
I described, at least I haven't detected any leakage.

This is a bug in the readline 4.0 headers.  Change this line:

rlstdc.h:38: #  if !defined (__GNUC__)

to this:

  #  if !defined (__GNUC__) && !defined (inline)
  #    define inline
  #  endif

As for your other questions: the PATH in the library option can be:

     * boolean (no, yes or blank): whether to use library or not
     * file: assumed to be the name of the library
     * directory: assumed to *contain* the library

For the includes option, it should be the directory containing the
readline directory itself... our code uses #include <readline/readline.h>
so the -I shouldn't contain the readline directory.

OK...

What does that mean?  :)

Should we update the minimum requirement for XPM or not?  :)

I think the other party in this is Tim.  He has the choice of removing
the XpmReturnAllocPixels and in that case we would not update
the minimum requirement.

If he wants to leave it in, then we would have to make the change
you suggest.

Hmm, lets check.  Yep, I'm on Xpm 3.4j.  No wonder I couldn't find
a better way to free up the colors.

I've just tried compiling the following snapshots, and all fail
compilation on FvwmScript.  I've included in the following snippet a

Sorry, I forgot to include the snapshots.  They are

The last two snaps I have compiled have been missing modules/FvwmScript/script.h

I think that is a problem.

Okay, work is already in progress on this problem. Please ignore it
for the moment and just see if your original problem goes away.
You won't need FvwmScript to verify this.

 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
     [fixed]
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
     [fixed]
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
     [fixed]
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.

I guess this is just some unfortunate timing. The function
GetTopAncestorWindow and this is in the renamed file
libs/WinMagic.c. You will need a complete update of the source
tree.

Okay, results:

* fvwm-19990923 freezes trying to start up on both heads.  There are
  no clues in the .xsession-errors, but doing a ps from another
  terminal shows that two fvwm2 processes are running.  To get it
  started, I did

    fvwm2 -s
    fvwm2 -s -display :0.1

* FvwmPager doesn't start, and doesn't give any clues in
  .xsession-errors why not.

* I'll know tomorrow morning if it dies during the night!  I haven't
  had it die since I stopped using xscreensaver, but I'm still
  mystified why that would be killing it.  I also haven't tried using
  xscrensaver with a different wm to find out if that fixes the
  problem, so I have some testing to do.

Thanks,
Aron

Ok, here is a manual patch on the above patch (you get the idea):

-      char *configinfo = strdup("");
+      char configinfo[50] = "";

I'll have a look at the XPM source. I'm not worried about leaking
colors, we always used to do that. What I don't want to do is free up
too much.

Does it leave a core file somewhere? If yes can you check where it
crashes?

Oliver et al,

I have an idea which relates to your patch for printing fvwm's compiled
options.

I would like to print fvwm's version into the error log: at our site we
keep more than one fvwm version available - allowing users time to
migrate their configs. We used the -version cmdline option, until it was
changed to also terminate the WM !


My thinking is to introduce a percent (%) trip character to the Echo
command which would recognize a keyword so that, for example

	Echo rock %version hard place

would print the fvwm version string between a rock and a hard place.
Other keywords could be introduced as the need arises, e.g.,
%configoptions for your extra line. The string could be either kept in a
static variable, or for some future keyword, returned by a function
call, thereby allowing a user defined function to print dynamic
information.

The -version cmdline option would be unaffected.


This may be overkill - since I can also get what I want by a locally
removing the call to exit(). Any thoughts ?

This is already possible. Fvwm replaces certain '$x' strings by
some predefined strings, e.g. '$r' is replaced by the window's
resource name. A '$v' could easily be added (function expand() in
file fvwm/functions.c). This works everywhere, not only in Echo
commands.

Subject: AIX compilation problem

Full_Name: Oleg Cherkasov
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: AIX 4.2.1.0
X_Server: X11R5
Submission from: (NULL) (193.214.111.226)


I have found a problem to compile fvwm2 on AIX 4.2.1.  AIX 4.2.1 does not
have Xmu library.  So some header files are missed on AIX.

I found '#include <X11/Xmu/WinUtil.h>' line in:

./modules/FvwmCpp/FvwmCpp.c
./modules/FvwmM4/FvwmM4.c
./modules/FvwmScroll/FvwmScroll.c

It should be replaced by:

#ifndef _AIX
#  include <X11/Xmu/WinUtil.h>
#endif


In this way FvwmCpp, FvwmM4 and FvwmScroll will be built without any
'missing header' error messages. _AIX is a compiler depended macro.
The compiler is IBM C/C++ 3.1.4.X

By the way the same problem was in fvwm 2.0.46.

I wonder why these include files are necessary. On my Linux FvwmCpp
compiles even without any Xmu includes. I guess FvwmM4 compiles as
well without testing it. FvwmScroll doesn't have any Xum includes
in the current development sources.

I did not try go deeper to the sources but it could be a mess 'include'
statement.  Somebody simply forget delete it or it was copied with the rest of
stuff in the beginning. Sometimes it happens :-(

That'll do nicely, thankyou.

I started adding "$v" to fvwm/functions.c(expand), but then received
your "CVS domivogt: * Applied version info patch." email ... however,
"cvs diff" only shows my edits. How come your patch doesn't show up ?

In case it is any use, the stuff I did is attached.

The changes from this patch are in fvwm.c, not in functions.c.

I don't know whether the Xmu stuff is needed, but I recently ran
into a similar problem on one of our AIX 4.3 machines where it was
missing the Athena widget sets.  Turned out our support staff
failed to install one of the optional packages.

Now that I look at the machine, (after the package was installed),
the file in question IS on is the machine.

Sorry, there is no core file, and my ulimit is set properly.

It appears that no modules will start properly.  My limited testing
has revealed that FvwmTalk freezes the wm (must be killed from a
remote terminal), FvwmAnimate doesn't start, FvwmAuto doesn't start...
But since FvwmTalk freezes, it does appear to be finding the modules
properly.

I do intend to research this further to provide you with more
information, but at the moment I've been swamped in work, which is why
these reports have been coming sporadically.  Sorry.

It did die during the night.  I will try again this weekend using
another wm to verify that the problem is at least related to fvwm.

Yes, the symbols defined in the Xmu include files are never used.
I have removed them (but I'm still fighting to compile 2.2.2).

Okay, I understand now: I got all confused because I only saw the

If you are starting any modules in your .fvwm2rc, make sure
they are started from the InitFunction or the new StartFunction.

Modules that don't terminate, like FvwmAnimate can no longer be
started any other way.

(Note the latest GCC is 2.95.1... not that I'm saying that's any better;
I don't have an Irix system--but these versions are under active
development again now that the EGCS team has taken over as the steering
committee for GCC).

I quite believe you about the GCC code on Irix, my point is only that we
don't support the environment you are trying to work in... so we can't
accept bug reports, etc. for it.

If you want to build late(st) FVWM's and you don't want to use the
environment described in the DEVELOPERS file, you should be building the
daily snapshots instead of the CVS source.  That's why we make the daily
snapshots, after all :)

HTH.

OK.  When we add it back, if autoconf hasn't released a new version that
fixes the bugs in this area, we should add some code to configure.in to
do it ourselves (check for cross-compiling and throw an error).

At least we can provide a semi-useful error message.

Somehow I was able to commit lots of old files from the 2.2
release over the latest version of the 2.2.x branch (see my
latest commit message). Now I need to undo this complete commit!
How do I do this?

Bye

There was some subsequent discussion to this that I lost, but for the
record I oppose removing the ChangeLogs.

Remember that the primary goal of the NEWS file is to introduce new
user-visible features and changes.  That leaves the goal of providing
detailed information on bugs fixed, etc. to the ChangeLog.  I really
don't want to see them left out of the tarball; I look at ChangeLog's
for programs all the time, myself.

If they're getting too big we can split them and only ship the changes
for the last release for now.  If/when fvwm development starts slowing
down we can ship more background.

Personally I don't think a large tarball is that big a deal for a
release these days.  _Many_ people will be pulling a .rpm or .deb
anyway, not the source tarball.

Anyway, that's my $0.02.

Another possibility is to 'make distcheck' with gcc first and then
compile the distibution tarball with your compiler of choice. It's
very slow, but the code you get should be okay.

Thanks!

The only thing left I can see is #182 in 'in progress'.

Yup, I think that was the most recent suggestion. Anyway, I guess
nothing will happen with the ChangeLogs anyway if makes the effort
(I won't). Personally I want to have the Changelogs in one piece when
developing. We could cut off a ChangeLog for shipping that has only
the entries since the last release.

I would have assumed most people simply wait until the package
appears in their favourite Linux distribution.

As an aside note: SuSE 6.2 that's out for a month now finally
has a 2.2.2 package. It's as big as 9.4 MB! I guess they forgot
to strip the executables (the old 2.0.46 package was about 1.5 MB).

> Anyway, that's my $0.02.

If I got these 2 cents for every mail I'd be filthy rich :-)

well, so how can you support other platforms then ? I'm actually
not having time to _develop_ new stuff, but I thought that fixing
incompatibilities with other compilers would be interesting...

Oh, maybe you mean that fvwm2 is supported ONLY with gcc, even for
users ? Ok then, I just wanted to know :-)

doesn't matter for me, the cvs tree compiles fine now that I have
fixed automake :-)

No, you misunderstand.  Building the CVS sources requires gcc.
(And automake, autoconf, etc.)
When we do a makedist, to create a tarball, ANY compiler can
be used to build the tarball.  (We hope.)

(Its the price you pay to work with the CVS sources.)

Very, very carefully! :)

You have two choices:

 1) You can use the cvs admin -o option to remove specific revisions
    from the archive.  Then it will be as if you never committed at
    all.  Of course, you must be extra-super-careful or you'll remove
    _useful_ revisions too.

 2) The safer way is to reconstruct the correct versions in your
    workspace (you can use cvs co -r or whatever), then do another
    commit that "re-does" the changes your previous commit undid.

Ah, I only looked in incoming.

OK, I committed a change to fix the last bit of this.

I guess, actually, there may be one bit left: currently we don't do
anything if perl isn't found or is too old, except print an error.

What *should* we do?  Can FvwmConsole be used without a reasonable perl?
Maybe we should not build the module if we can't find one?

Hi,

I've found that I'm getting lots of messages from Fvwm (version 2.3.8) similar
to the following when I run the development version of one of our products:

------------------------

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> Step Manager window 0x34005d3 has broken
(6) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
49 541 166 -1 -1 2147417500 0 0/0 69089100/0 69681124 0 69089076

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> ABAQUS window 0x340155a has broken (6)
size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
49 -1 -1 -1 -1 271439240 2147419216 2147419488/273469408 76441304/2147419216
271439704 273469412 0

-------------------------

After looking at the Fvwm code, I can see that it doesn't like it when the
window's max height/width (-1 in this case) is less than the window's min
height/width.  Furthermore, it probably doesn't like that last case above, where
the window's min height and width are less that 0.

Since the hints do look somewhat strange, and since I do not see any of these
messages from any other X applications, I assume that the problem is with our
product, but I wanted to write you (as the warning message implores) to make
sure.  If the hints being sent above are erroneous, I would appreciate it if you
could point me to any information regarding the correct behavior of X
applications.

Furthermore, I've found that when I try to run our product "iconic" Fvwm puts up
the windows anyway (but without any warnings).  Again, I would assume that this
is a problem with our product (since something like 'xterm -iconic' behaves as
expected) and any pointers to information about this would be appreciated.

I am not the person who does the X Windows programming (nor do I know much about
it) but I would be happy to pass along any information you could give to the
appropriate programmers.

If it makes any difference, I'm running on Irix 6.5 and the X server is 11.0 (?
-- this is  X_PROTOCOL and X_PROTOCOL_REVISION in X11/X.h)

Thank you,

-Matt Rees

Euhm, not really, I just want to cancel the select-a-window mode (the
cursor changed to a crosshair) with <Esc>. When I do "RaiseLower" when
no window has focus, the cursor becomes a crosshair and I need to select
a window. Well, at this point I can cancel the operation hitting the
Escape button. But this doesn't work with FvwmScroll. Nor with
FvwmIdent, though I THOUGHT it did. ( ugh, can't we use Dutch or German
instead of English? ;-)

Dan, a few things concerning 2.3.8 and FormFvwmSetup.  I'm unable to get it
to work for me since I used --prefix on my install.

Here are my steps:
- I copied off my .fvwm2rc to save.fvwm2rc (don't want my orig file clobbered)
- pressed F1
- pressed FvwmButtons, pressed FvwmPager
    now I have 3 things selected "create a starting .fvwm2rc file"
                                 "FvwmButtons"
  			         "FvwmPager"
- pressed F2 (for Copy Config Files)
- pressed F3 (for Restart fvwm)

 after the restart I don't see any change at all (I can see from the Form
 that a number of copies should have taken place, but they don't since they
 are all hard-coded to be from /usr/local/*).  I list my root directory and
 notice that the only new file that was created is ".FvConSocket".  I, again,
 think we need to define something along the lines of "FVWM_MODULEDIR" to point
 to the Form files (or have it be munged during install).  What's so wrong
 with having FVWM_CONFIGDIR, anyway ? ((I could even supply a patch :-))

So instead of,
 *FormFvwmSetup.Command   $(IDN?!/bin/cp /usr/local/etc/fvwm/ConfigFvwmIdent   ${FVWM_USERHOME})
you'd have
 *FormFvwmSetup.Command   $(IDN?!/bin/cp ${FVWM_CONFIGDIR}/etc/fvwm/ConfigFvwmIdent   ${FVWM_USERHOME})

On a related topic, a couple of suggestions:

1. Add the following entries to "ConfigFvwmDefaults"

   Mouse 1 T A Move		# I should be able to move things
   Mouse 1 F A Resize		# I should be able to resize things
   EdgeScroll 0 0		# scrolling is way too confusing to a newuser

2. Add an option to restart something other than fvwm (you can leave it upto
   the user).  Something along the lines of "F4 Restart command-line" and then
   prompt the user for a command to run (ideally it would be another
   window manager in case they get in a bind)

3. As noted in an earlier email, include the version number on the installed
   forms in case the format changes in the future and you have multiple fvwms
   installed.  Something along the lines of, $prefix/etc/fvwm/VERSION/*files*
                                                              ^^^^^^^
4. In FvwmForm's man file the architecture-independent data directory is noted
   as "PREFIX/share" - is that to happen in the future is or is it going to
   stay PREFIX/etc/fvwm ?  I personally like PREFIX/share.

I sincerely hope we won't need a c++ compiler in the future.
I have not been able to build 2.2 with all extras for about
half a year now, so this would mean that I can't build releases
anymore.

I figured as much. I have no experience in doing such things
with CVS and I'm anxious I will do something wrong. If you look
at the commit message that was generated in that swrewed up
CVS commit, can you tell me the correct 'cvs checkout' options
so that I get the code before this commit? And perhaps the options
for the following 'cvs commit' too.
 
I'm in no particular hurry to fix this, so I'd prefer to understand
exactly what I am doing.

Yes, that's what Dan wanted to tell me.  The misunderstanding was on
my side.

German will do nicely if you mail to me privately :-)

The first thing you should know is that fvwm itself has no problem
when it prints these warnings.  These are merely fvwm's observations
about broken application hints that may or may not cause trouble with
other window managers.

There is the so called Inter Client Communications Conventions Manual (ICCCM)
written by the X Consortium.  This document defines the proper way for
interaction between window manager and application (Chapter 4).  You can
find an online version at http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/ .  Unfortunately
the ICCCM is very sloppy and leaves much room for (mis)interpretation.  For
example, negative sizes are nowhere explicitly forbidden.  The checks in
fvwm's sizing code follow no strict rules but try to use common sense
instead.  Window managers have to deal with lots of broken applications,
so we put this code in the sizing function so that we can detect and
eliminate these third party bugs.  A popular bug for example is when the
application sets the bit that is provides e.g. a maximum size but then
forgets to fill out the actual values.

You need to set the 'StateHint' hint in the WM_HINTS struct to 
'IconicState'. (ICCCM section 4.1.2.4).

No, it doesn't.

Yes, it is.

I think FvwmConsole doesn't need perl at all.  If you don't have
a supported version of perl then you simply cannot run or configure
the FvwmConsole.pl frontend.  FvwmConsole itself should still work
as usual.

Subject: Removing GlobalOpts for StartsOnPage
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


	In some other thread, Dominik recently suggested cleaning up some of
the GlobalOpts and changing them to Style options.

	I have no burning desire to see all GlobalOpts done away with. I see no
reason why certain things shouldn't be global. However, StartsOnPage
seems to be responsible for more GlobalOpts than any other single
feature, and it's about to need yet another option (to apply
StartsOnPage to transients, which definitely should *not* be global), so
I'm looking at converting the other options.

	StartsOnPage uses the following GlobalOpts:

CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage/ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage


	Does anyone see a good reason why any of these *ought* to remain
global? (I don't.)

	Does anyone feel strongly about leaving the GlobalOpts for backward
compatibility for, say, one release, in addition to having them as Style
options? (I vote against it.)


Cheers,
Bob

But can I simply commit older versions to the head of the branch?

Neither do I. I would keep the GlobalOpts command itself, but start
moving the window specific stuff into the styles now.

I suggest the corresponding global options are removed internally, but
if someone still uses them they are translated to 'Style * <option>'
and a warning that these will be removed soon is issued. We should at
least give people a chance to do notice that they will go away before
we really do it.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
     [fixed]
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
     [fixed]
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
     [fixed]
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.

     less disruptive way.
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
     [Dominik]

I don't see why not.

First checkout 2.2 by date, you would be doing this in an area that
is "stuck" on 2.2.
Then do do an update, it should see all the changed files as modification=
s.
Then commit.

(I haven't tried any of this, but it seems like it should work.)

I am waiting for a new version (0.3) from the author before adding.
Here are my thoughts. Considering that

* we all (at least Dominik, Paul and me) want to have 2.4 C++ free,
  since there are a lot of problems to solve for configure then
* FvwmKb-0.4 will have a very useful option to change keymaps using a
  window button, which will be absent in 0.3,

I suggest that we rethink again. Do we want to add FvwmKb now, or is it
better to wait and have 2.4 C-only?
FvwmKb should be included in 2.5 anyway.

Regards,
Mikhael.

To be honest, if the author doesn't want his module to be 'fvwm only'
I don't think it's a good idea to put it in our distribution at all.
Prominent links, hints in the man pages, etc. are okay and I wouldn't
oppose to put the sources in our CVS, but I definitely don't want to
catch all the trouble with C++, a separate autoconf, etc.

Bye

The 'rounding error' theory was nonsens, of course. A rounding error
would cause one value *less* to be read, not one *more*. You would
have to add up x.000001 (or so) quite often before you got a result
that is one higher than expected. It is much worse. The calculation
of x and y is screwed up:

  register double x = (i - w / 2) * h / 2;

Because 'w' is an integer, 'w / 2' is rounded down if w is odd.
I have changed this to 

  register double x = (double)((2 * i - w) * h) / 4.0;

which should solve the problem. Can you verify this, Brad?
BTW, R and Y gradients had the same problem, but it didn't
cause an array overflow.

Yes, I commited from the modules directory, and the ChangeLog was in
the list of changed files. The second commit followed immediately
after the first commit with no intervening commands and it DID pick up
the ChangeLog. My CVS client version is 1.10.6.

Cheers,
Chris.

No, this should not work. It would not show all the previously changed
files as modifications if you don't modify anything. When you checkout
by date all your files will have sticky date. cvs commit will do nothing.
(Of course all this needs to be tested to be sure.)

The solution which works for sure is to checkout into a separate directory:
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout \
    -r branch-2_2 -d ../fvwm-old -D '2 weeks ago' fvwm
then copy back all needed old files to overwrite changes and commit.
(Personally I would run 'cvs admin -o rev file' to delete last revision.)

The best way not to do such errors is to always run 'cvs update' before
'cvs commit' and carefully check out which files are going to be commited.
But then again, this does not solve Chris's problem with ChangeLog...

Regards,
Mikhael.

In case you want to delete revisions you must (optionally) execute:
  cvs status file(s)

And then (one line for every file):
  cvs admin -o latest_file_revision_or_branch file

It is not dangerous at all if you specify the full file revision.
You can simply specify the branch instead of the revision and the latest
revision will be deleted. Specifying the branch is easier since it is the
constant for all files, but less safer.

Example (not tested):
  cvs admin -o 1.31.2.4 configure.in
Or (instead):
  cvs admin -o 1.31.2 configure.in

No need in special following commands. The only possible problems when you
delete revisions can be for one who locally changed deleted-revision file,
he must 'rm file' & 'cvs update -A [file]' to resolve the conflict.

You can see rcs(1) for 'cvs admin' options.
I suggest that everyone using 'cvs admin' reports about this, since there
are no email notification.

Hi folks,

The following patches are needed to compile fvwm2 on AIX 4.1.5 using
IBM's C compiler. I have verified these patches on SunOS 5.5.1 and
HP-UX B.10.20.


Have fun

Subject: refresh of borderless transparent rxvt

Full_Name: David Plaut
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: RedHat Linux 5.1 (kernel 2.2.12)
X_Server: AcceleratedX LX (laptop) 4.1.2
Submission from: (NULL) (128.2.188.47)


When I generate a transparent rxvt (version 2.6.1) with -inheritPixmap and
with no border (BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0) under fvwm (version 2.2.2),
it works fine initially but then does not refresh if exposed by lowering 
a partially occluding window.  The newly exposed region is drawn grey.  
If I refresh with Control-L, the entire window is grey.  If I move the 
window, it again correctly displays the underlying root window pixmap.

Strangely, everything works fine if I used borders of width 2 (but not 1).

>From my .fvwm2rc:
Style "rxvt" Icon xterm.xpm, NoTitle, Sticky, HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0

To reproduce the problem, run "rxvt -inheritPixmap", then cover and
uncover
the window (doesn't seem to matter if you lower and raise the window
itself
or manipulate another window).

Why so complicated?  Shouldn't

    register double x = (i - w / 2.0) * h / 2.0;

do the trick, what with automatic promotion and everything?  It's also a
lot easier to read ...

Mmh, well, ok, so I have a statement and a question before
stopping this thread :-)

1) Statement : I _can_ build fvwm from the whole tree without
gcc. I did it and it perfectly works. I understand though, that
any new code I could create wouldn't be accepted as is, unless
compiled and tested under gcc.

2) Question : Is somebody interested in patches that would allow
for clean compiling under other environments ? (Note that this
is also benefit for gcc, since my compiler is much more restrictive
and gives better compatibility warnings).

Cheers

There were several such problems in the past (i.e. with older versions
of fvwm/rxvt). Today (i.e. with the fvwm beta 2.3.8 and with the
2.6PRE4 version of rxvt) you should encounter no such problem.

I never trust automatic conversions :-) It doesn't really matter
since nobody will understand what this code (plus context) does
in less than half an hour anyway.  I wrote it myself.  I don't
understand it. ;-)

Hello,
I have noted some problems with FvwmM4 (and FvwmCpp).

Assume that you start fvwm in your .xinitrc with fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc".
Do : cd somewherebutHOME, startx
Then this does not work, since FvwmM4 try to "m4" the file  
somewherebutHOME/.fvwm2rc
You can imagine other problems, the point is that FvwmM4 does not honor
the "user_home_dir" (=$FVWM_USERHOME if set, or $HOME).

Attached to this message a patch that solved these kind of problems. I
do a very simple thing: I change the workingdir to user_home_dir
before popening m4/cpp.
Also I add the "macro" FVWM_USERHOME and SESSION_MANAGER, these macros
are set to the value of their corresponding environment variable if 
there are not NULL.

Patch description:

Modified files:
        modules         : ChangeLog 
        modules/FvwmM4  : FvwmM4.c, FvwmM4.1
        modules/FvwmCpp : FvwmCpp.c, FvwmCpp.1


NOTE 0: 
I would like to add other definitions for compile-time options
(e.g., HAVE_RPLAY,  ...). There is a macro for that called OPTION
with a list of options (at the present time XPM SHAPE I18N_MB M4/CPP
may be in this "list"). However, it does not seem easy to
use OPTION. I suggest to add other definitions for the main compile
time options: we can reproduce  config.h (e.g., define HAVE_RPLAY
to 1 if it is defined to 1 in config.h, does not define it if it is
not defined in config.h). If you think it is a good idea I can do
a patch.

NOTE 1:
There is a problem with SESSION_MANAGER and in fact with the session
code:
Assume that fvwm run under session on display :0. Then, run fvwm (not
under session and under the same user) on display :1. The problem
is that the second fvwm process think that it runs under session (e.g.,
it executes SessionInitFunc and my patch define SESSION_MANAGER !).

NOTE 2:
It seems that there are small problems if you start fvwm2 as
fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc":

A. No more watch during startup :o( ok this is not a problem: user
which use FvwmM4/Cpp can do that with "hands".

B. Assume you run fvwm under session on display :0. If you try to run
fvwm under session on display :1 with the usual command line (just fvwm2), 
then fvwm exit. Find (note that gnome does not exit and 
gnome cannot run two sessions for the same user in a good way ... :o) ). 
However, if you run the second fvwm process under session with the command 
line fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc", then in this case fvwm2  does not exit.

C. With gnome, we can see the apps of the "save session" during
startup.

To try to solve B & C I have moved the following lines (of fvwm/fvwm.c)

#ifdef SESSION
  SessionInit(client_id);
#endif

#ifdef GNOME
  GNOME_Init();
#endif

just after the lines:

DBUG("main","Setting up rc file defaults...");
SetRCDefaults();

It seems that this solved B but not C. 
However, I do not really understand all the consequence of the above change ...


Yours, Olivier

Thats only true if you have read line.  If you don't have readline it
compiles in support for perl to handle things in the console.

(latest cvs versions)

I have a problem letting the Netscape windows start on the right page.
They pick out the right desk, but it just takes the page coordinates of
the desk I'm working in.

Suppose I am at desk 1 and page (1,0) the mail window shows up at desk
3, but page (1,0) instead of page (0,0) like I specified in the Style.

I verified I don't have this problem with other applications.

---
Style "Netscape Navigator*" StartsOnPage 2 0 0, SkipMapping
Style "Netscape Mail*"      StartsOnPage 3 0 0, SkipMapping
Style "Compose*"            StartsAnyWhere
Style "Netscape: Open Page" StartsAnyWhere
---

Is this Netscape behaving bad again?

Regards,

Tung

  It's OK for me (although I'm a couple of weeks out-of-date from CVS).

  However, I use:

Style "Navigator"       ... StartsOnPage 1 0, ...
Style "MailThread"      IconBox 54x54+925+0


  My NS windows have titles "Netscape Mail & Newsgroups:*" and
"Netscape:*" (browser) - these won't match your strings (which is why I
match on the NS window classes rather than names). (BTW, all NS popups
match "*_popup").

All right since I'm not sure exactlly what is going on here here are my
numbers could you take a look, I'm still getting the aroun bound read in
the same place.

Using 
FvwmCommand \
"*FvwmThemeColorset 0 gray80 #515178 CGradient 128 #515178 #000000"

I get the following 4 around bound read. Maybe you can spot what went
wrong, it sounds like you are a little more farmilliar with the code
here.

i = 0 j = 0 w = 254 h = 254 x = -16129.000000 y = 16129.000000 rad = 22809.850548 index = 128.004773 128
i = 0 j = 254 w = 254 h = 254 x = -16129.000000 y = -16129.000000 rad = 22809.850548 index = 128.004773 128
i = 254 j = 0 w = 254 h = 254 x = 16129.000000 y = 16129.000000 rad = 22809.850548 index = 128.004773 128

Probably. What name/resource/class do these windows have

Looks right this far. It is important that the x//y values with i//j = 0 are the same
as with i//j = w//h (except for the sign). This is the case in abouve output:
-(16129) = -16129. What are the values of t_scale, ncolors and myncolors?
Theoretically rad = 22809.850548 should be equal to t_scale*0.5.

well t_scale = (double)(w * h) / sqrt(8); or in my case 22809.850547516
and ncolors = 128, myncolors isn't defined for CGradient.

It seems we just have a simple off by one here.  And one of us is not
seeing it, looking at Graphics.c:679 we have 
	XPutPixel(image, i, j, pixels[(int)(rad * ncolors / t_scale)]); 

now we are indexing into an array of size 0 to ncolors -1 in order for
that to work rad / t_scale must be < 1.  In the cases above it is not
Now if we made t_scale a double we would get rad/t_scale == 1 but 1 *
ncolors > ncolors -1.

Now some where we need to subtract one to get our array index correct.
I'm just not sure where we need to make the change.

I think you still misunderstand.

Definitely we (want to) support all ANSI C compilers.  We don't require
any GCC-isms which we feel are non-portable (the only potential GCC-ism
we use is alloca, but most systems have that for all compilers these
days and we ship an alloca.c for those that don't).

All we're saying is that the development environment as checked out from
CVS needs GCC.  The "developers" makefiles that automake generates use
GCC-specific flags and features to, for example, create dependency
information.  If you don't have GCC, these things don't work.

When we build a distribution tarball, _that_ codebase is generic and
doesn't require any particular compiler.  When we build the tarball
automake build Makefile.in files that don't require GCC, and those are
used by configure to build Makefile files that don't require GCC.

We will accept any new code you create, whether you've ever compiled it
under GCC or not... or anyway, we won't reject it because you haven't.

All we're saying is that we don't support building our tree as checked
out from CVS with any compiler other than GCC--if you get it to work
that's great, but we can't help you get it to work and we aren't really
interested in patches that might make it work better--any such changes
really ought to be directed to the automake folks.  We use their
environment verbatim and it's not our place (or interest) to maintain
it.  It's purely a development environment issue, not a user environment
issue.

We're always interested in cleaner code, thanks.

Nope, if use use the gradient I sent you get array bounds problem.
Try some code like if ( [(int)((rad * ncolors - 0.5) / t_scale) > ncolors)
then print(some useful values to debug.

I normally don't care about encoded attachments as long as they're a
reasonable size, but I really hesitate to approve a 9000 line message (the
likes of which the list software has just bounced to me) given the number
of developers here that sit behind modems.  The introductory document does
ask you not to post binaries, after all.

Can anyone argue for changing this policy?

They are NOT hardcoded to be from /usr/local.

Take a look in  the source at modules/FvwmForm/FormFvwmSetup.in around
line 56:

*FormFvwmSetup.Command   $(BASIC?!/bin/cp xFVWM_CONFIGDIRx/ConfigFvwmSetup ${FVWM_USERHOME}/.fvwm2rc)

There is a "sed" in the Makefile that will change this to whatever you
set the fvwm    configuration  directory during the    "make  install"
process.  I think you might need to do a "make clean".

I don't know what this file is, but it wasn't created by the setup form.

We just went  thru this didn't we?  You   did install into  /usr/local
didn't you?  Or do you need to do a "make clean"?

I like these 2.  I was on a mission to put a lot more things into
ConfigFvwmDefaults, but I sensed that some users weren't too happy
with the alt-tab binding.

Anyone else think they should not be added?

Given the way the pointer reacts to the screen edge before it switches,
it always seemed intuitive to me.  I don't know.

Picking option 3, you should be able to restart anything else assuming
you know how.  If you create a starting .fvwm2rc and restart, you can
then escape into the other window managers that we've allowed for.

I think  you can do this by  using configure --sysconfdir.   I believe
you are  requesting that this become automatic.   When  I put 2.4 into
production here,  I will definitely  be using  a  version number.  Not
being the configure guru, I'll leave decisions on changing defaults to
someone else.

"share" vs. "etc"?  Again something for the configure gurus.  I've
made a mental note to fix the man page.

Aron, I've been busy getting my new home machine working, and I've
lost track of this.

The problem was "fvwm hanging during startup", and you mentioned:

  It appears that no modules will start properly.  My limited testing
  has revealed that FvwmTalk freezes the wm (must be killed from a
  remote terminal), FvwmAnimate doesn't start, FvwmAuto doesn't start...
  But since FvwmTalk freezes, it does appear to be finding the modules
  properly.

I don't see FvwmTalk or FvwmAuto in the above.
If they are there and you just cut them out, perhaps it would be
useful to attach dbx to one of the fvwm processes and see what its
doing.

OK - I see what's happening.  The "make clean" or even the "make distclean"
won't help -- I'll still get the same results and that's due to the fact that
"FormFvwmSetup." is not removed during a clean/distclean as it _should_ be.
I guess I was stuck with "/usr/local" after my very first 'make' :-/

In other words, a "make clean" now simply does,

  Making clean in FvwmForm
  test -z "FvwmForm" || rm -f FvwmForm
  rm -f *.o core *.core

where-as it should also 'rm -f FormFvwmSetup.'

Someone should modify the Makefile generation...

Yup - I was talking about this automatically happening upon 'install' to mimic
libexec's directory structure.

Yup - it was inconsistent that's all -- "share" makes more sense to me :-)

General comments about 2.3.8 (bugs/pics to follow below).

Comments:
 a. WinList has a tendency to quit (or crash without any error messages or
    indicators) after numerous iconify/deiconify events (will try to narrow
    it down).
 b. If one goes ballistic on switching pages (do it as fast as you can as
    long as the pager follows-along for about 30seconds) you'll notice that
    every once in awhile the window mapping gets royally messed-up and
    then corrects itself.  I've seen it happen once on normal speed switching.
 c. I've seen instances when the pager seems to refocus (or refresh) itself
    (happens more often with maximized windows).  The pager flickers.
 d. In Netscape, if I Meta-o and then take the focus away from the transient
    (I use mousefocus - ie. enter the transient and then leave) the transient
    refreshes itself (flashing affects that looks kinda ugly).
 e. Don't like the default fvwm banner (the older one had character :-)
    This is more cosmetic than anything else - and yes I know I can change it.
    This will be settled with the contest, I'd guess.

Bugs:
 I'm MIME-attaching a tar file that includes xwd files (use xwud -in * to
 view) of before and after snapshots of the pager and winlist to show the
 differences.  Note, there are no changes to my .fvwm2rc file (ie. results
 ought to be identical) - the .fvwm2rc is included as well.

 1. On the pager, note the window border color.  Its white under 2.3.8 instead
    black (in 2.2.2).  Also note the fvwm sticky windows are not green-colored
    (as in 2.2.2), instead they're blue.

 2. On the WinList, note the iconfied buttons - different button/text colors.
    NOTE: The 2.2.2 pic is narrower in width due to the fact that I always
          comment out line 860 concerning the "Magic Number" in FvwmWinList.c
          There were emails (and a bug report in Jitterbug) about the topic.

 Compiled on: SunOS cosmo 5.5.1 Generic_103640-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
 Running  on: exceed-6.1.0.0

Let me know how I can help.

You're right, but this is one of the requests we will never
find the time to do unles someone provides a patch :-(

 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]

     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
     [fixed]
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow

 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
     [fixed]

 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.

To be honest I'm very reluctant to add such options that make
existing commands even more unwieldy for no other reason than
saving two or three lines in the configuration file.  I mean,
the functionality is already there and it's not hard to figure
out how to do it, so I'd rather spare us the effort and the
additional code.

If things run smoothly I will get a dual-headed setup running
on my home machine this week (believe me or not: only to debug
fvwm). I will look deeper into the problems you reported when
I have it up and running.

Recently (for a few months) I have problems building fvwm after
one of the Makefile.am files has changed (well, I at least I guess
that this is the problem).  If this happens, 'make' calls automake,
autoconf and reruns configure.  automake and autoconf run through,
but configure always fails with this message:

----------------- snip ----------------

configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler cannot creat
e executables.
make: *** [config.status] Error 1
---------------------------------------

(If I don't configure with -without-cxx, I get the same error, but
with 'C++' instead of 'C'.)

To recompile I have to run configure manually with
'./configure --enable-gnome'. Note that I don't need '-without-cxx' here.
But the next time a Makefile.am changes I will get the 'C++' error.

What can I do to prevent this?

Oops, seems I forgot to commit a '-epsilon' I had already planned:
Correct version should be:

  XPutPixel(image, i, j, pixels[(int)((rad * ncolors - 0.5) / t_scale)]);

No, with -1 we may run into trouble with very few colours.

Never mind, I'll commit the change in a few minutes.

Navigator window:

Name: Netscape Navigator 4.51
Resource: Navigator
Class: Netscape
Icon Name: Netscape

Mail window:

Name: Netscape Mail & Newsgroups: Re: Netscape doesn't listen to
StartsOnPage well
Resource: MailThread
Class: Netscape
Icon Name: Mail & Newsgroups

It would be fun to copy the text from the FvwmIdent window, now it
disappaers when I try selecting some text.

Ha ! Now _you_ misunderstand(tm) :-))

It actually *works* for me. I just had to patch an automake file,
because the -MD flag to gcc is replaced by -MDupdate in my cc. That's
it. I've built fvwm from the cvs tree without any more headache, and
I'm running the latest fvwm as I'm writing this. I don't need any
support of any kind on this point, thanks very much for your very
kind and patient answers by the way.

Good ! We both agree on everything now (we always agreed, without
knowing it, that's it :-))

Several patches that seem to be a bit dangerous in a single patch.

Well, this looks right.  I can only guess that netscape is too lazy
about setting up its title and possibly class/resource.  Probably
it is already mapped when its sets its name. In the file
add_window.c around line 233 you should find this code:

    else
      tmp_win->name = NoName;
  
    /* removing NoClass change for now... */

Could you add an fprintf before the comment:

    else
      tmp_win->name = NoName;

    fprintf(stderr,"name of new window: %s\n", (tmp_win->name == NoName) ? "(null)" : tmp_win->name);
    /* removing NoClass change for now... */

It wouldn't let you copy it anyway.

  I'm reposting this 'cos I think it's still relevant, and the way the

  It's OK for me (although I'm a couple of weeks out-of-date from CVS).

  However, I use:

Style "Navigator"       ... StartsOnPage 1 0, ...
Style "MailThread"      IconBox 54x54+925+0


  My NS windows have titles "Netscape Mail & Newsgroups:*" and
"Netscape:*" (browser) - these won't match your strings (which is why I
match on the NS window classes rather than names). (BTW, all NS popups
match "*_popup").

Alright that got it, FvwmTheme now runs fairlly clean through purify.
With the exception of the call to XOpenDisplay and error_handler.
XOpenDisplay doesn't bother me, since we can't fix it.  And purify
thinks that our error_handler is reading unitialized memory, but as near
as I can tell it is, so I would say its another X problem and ignore it.

So any other pressing modules you want purified while I'm at it?

Brad

P.S. thanks for all your work, my head just isn't in bug fixing mode this
week, I should have been able to fix this myself.

Well, I guess FvwmButtons, FvwmTaskBar/FvwmWinList and FvwmPager need
it urgently.  I can almost smell the memory leaks :-)

Applied.

You don't feel inclined to write a config file for FvwmPager in the
style of tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc, do you?

Great! Now only window styles and the decision about FvwmConsole
have to be done.

Ok,
Forget all my "NOTE*" in my first message :o), my patch
does not concern these notes.
I have attached 3 patches one for M4, one for Cpp and one
for the ChangeLog.
I think that these patches are not dangerous
(I use intensively FvwmM4 with this patch and it works well).
I have added two new values FVWM_USERHOME and SESSION_MANAGER,
and with these patches M4/Cpp will chdir to the "user_home_dir"
so that m4/cpp make this directory as their working directories.
Since the value "HOME" has been omitted in the man page I add it.
There are quite symmetric since Cpp / M4 are (it was the reason I do
it in one patch). Maybe you can just apply the M4 patch and probably
a bit mutation will produce automatically the corresponding change
to Cpp :o). Maybe these patches are not good ideas, but ...

The window borders were changes as part of putting colorsets in. The
color is no longer fixed at black but is the same as the text color. The
green blue does look like a bug though.

There are some new options: *FvwmWinListIconFore and
*FvwmWinListIconBack. If you don't specify them you get the default of
black and gray.

Well, FvwmWinList doesn't seem to have any purify problems.  Here are
some fixes for FvwmIconMan and the log for some unresolved memory leaks.
The leaks come from the structs allocated for functions and mouse
bindings, never getting freed, we can probablly safetlly ignore them but
I thought I would through them in for completness sake.

I've raised the minimum version requirement of xpm to 4.3g. It's 4 years
old so I hope this doesn't cause too much inconvenience.

I couldn't find a reliable way of freeing the colors with 3.4f. The
returned pixels could include colors that were just close and since they
are not alloc'd freeing them might lead to odd behaviour.

Cheers,
Tim.

Okay, I have applied the patches.  Now, if you could again explain
in a few simple words (so that idiots like me are able to understand)
what the other patch you sent was supposed to do?  Your original mail
was so long that I became utterly confused :-)

I'm thinking that the syntax for setting colorsets needs redoing, the
fixed position of arguments makes it difficult to add new features.
Would it be difficult to rewrite it like the MenuStyle command? If it's
going to happen it should happen before 2.4 or we'll be stuck with the
old way.

The reason I'm asking is that I'm considering putting in a Transparency
pixmap option as well as a Tint option and maybe getting the foreground
color to understand "blink" as well as "contrast" (only with read/write
pixels).

Cheers,
Tim.

I tried using the class names as you said, but the problem persists.

Style "Navigator"               StartsOnPage 2 0 0, SkipMapping
Style "MailThread"              StartsOnPage 3 0 0, SkipMapping

Why doesn't my string ("Netscape Mail*") doesn't match the "Netscape
Mail & Newsgroups:*" title? I don't see the problem. And why do the mail
and navigator windows shows up at the desk I have specified in the two
Style lines and not at the current page like a regular window?

This is what I get:
---
name of new window: Netscape Navigator 4.51
name of new window: Netscape Mail & Newsgroups
---

Looks ok to me.. though I know nothing from fvwm2 internals.

Can't you make the text selectable?

It seems the bug is gone, I can't reproduce it anymore.

I just discovered removing SkipMapping "solves" the problem. Other
Netscape popup windows also suffers from SkipMapping.

There is another thread "SkipMapping" going on about problems placing
Netscape windows too.

I use Netscape 4.51, in case it does matter.. Bob Woodside tells it
works ok for 4.6, but right now, I can't afford upgrading to 4.6.

Subject: Pager out of sync with stacking order

Full_Name: Allan Black
Version: 2.3.8
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 7 (sparc)
X_Server: Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (194.247.80.193)


Version 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 of fvwm introduced a bug where the pager can get
out of sync with the window stacking order.
I've found the code which introduced the bug, but I can't figure out what
the new code is supposed to do.

To reproduce, use a keyboard shortcut to change the stacking order of
windows, e.g. this way:

Key L5          A       A       RaiseLower
Key F5          A       M       RaiseLower

It's also best if you use ClickToFocus.

Then use L5 (on a Sun) or ALT-F5 to switch the currently focused window
between the top and bottom of the window stack. The pager normally updates
correctly the first time, but subsequently fails to update.

I believe the WM is failing to broadcast the event to the pager.

In fvwm/stack.c:inner_RaiseOrLowerWindow(), the following code:

  if (do_move_transients)
    /* send out M_RESTACK for all windows, to make sure we don't forget
     * anything. */
    BroadcastRestack (Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next, Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev);
  else
    /* send out (one or more) M_RESTACK packets for windows between r and s
*/
    BroadcastRestack (r, s);

has replaced the one-liner from V2.3.6, in
fvwm/stack.c:RaiseOrLowerWindow():
  /* send out (one or more) M_RESTACK packets for windows between r and s
*/
  BroadcastRestack (r, s);

I have changed stack.c and commented out the new code, so it looks like
this:

  /*if (do_move_transients)*/
    /* send out M_RESTACK for all windows, to make sure we don't forget
     * anything. */
    /*BroadcastRestack (Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next,
Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev);*/
  /*else*/
    /* send out (one or more) M_RESTACK packets for windows between r and s
*/
    BroadcastRestack (r, s);

Recompiled fvwm and the pager started working fine again. However I don't
know what the effect will be of commenting out the above code. I've
probably broken something I don't use :-)

Hmm.  Weird.  Changing a Makefile.am should _NOT_ cause autoconf or
configure to re-run, it should just automake that one Makefile.am.
autoconf/configure should only rebuild if you change configure.in, or
the acinclude.m4 or similar files.

Do you normally need to compile with special LDFLAGS?  Right now
autoconf/automake doesn't preserve special values that are set through
the environment, like this:

  $ LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib' ./configure ...

I have to do this; if you do this then when you re-run configure it
won't have the special values of LDFLAGS anymore and won't configure
correctly.  I always have to configure by hand.

The next version of automake fixes this, and caches _all_ the
interesting values.  I can't wait.

  dv> (If I don't configure with -without-cxx, I get the same error, but

This is in the 2.3.x branch?!?!  We don't (shouldn't) check for C++ at
all here.  --without-cxx should be essentially ignored, and configure
should never look for C++ of any kind.

Remove your config.cache and config.restart files.  In fact, I'd do a
distclean.  When I build fvwm I actually don't build it in the tree but
in a remote directory.  That way when I want to I can just rm -rf and
all that config.cache, etc. stuff just goes away.  You need GNU make for
this, though.

  dv> --enable-gnome'. Note that I don't need '-without-cxx' here.  But
  dv> the next time a Makefile.am changes I will get the 'C++' error.

Very, very strange.  Are you sure you're not somehow mixing 2.2.x and
2.3.x workspaces?  You shouldn't move back and forth between these
within the same view (checkout); it's dangerous.  When was the last time
you checked out a completely new version of the CVS code from scratch?

Look in your configure.in; you should see all the C++ stuff commented
out with "dnl".  Look in the generated configure; there should be no
reference at all to c++ or cxx (except one subst of CXXFLAGS).

Try "cvs status configure.in" and make sure you don't have any sticky
tags or dates set.  My version is 1.79 and I believe that's the latest.

That's strange... I didn't change these files.

When I did an update it gave me a conflict and said I had to move them
out of the way.  So, I did and re-did the update, and it updated them.

Now it's checking them back in again?  What's with that?

I have a swallowed xosview in my FvwmButtons.  When I restart
fvwm with the current cvs code, the background of the button
that will swallow xosview shows some random image (once I saw
part of the netscape logo, but most of the time its just
colourful bits). As soon as xosview is swallowed the problem
goes away.  I suspect this is an effect of the last commit
in the colour set code.

Tim had removed the files from CVS because they are auto-generated.
This didn't work in some setups, so he just added them back.

I found the problem. Tim, when you did your work in
Colorset.c today, in SetRectangleBackground you changed
these lines:

      if (!colorset->stretch_x && colorset->width != width)                     
      ...
      if (!colorset->stretch_y && colorset->height != height)                   
      ...

To

      if (stretch_x && colorset->width != width)
      ...
      if (stretch_y && colorset->height != height)
      ...

This reversed the condition and caused the gradient to be
stretched in the same direction twice instead of once
vertically and once horizontally.

[fixed].

Bye

Hm, I checked out when I arrived at home. At work I hagain had this
problem, so if it's persistent I should see it here again... 

Yes, same error. But this time './configure --enable-gnome' fixes it.
I don't have to remove config.cache. Strange.

----- some more experimenting -----

Gack! The command line I use to call 'make' makes the difference.
I have developed a habit to run make always as

  make CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -Werror"

This knocks out configure (if it has to run)...
Oh well, the '-Wall -Werror' is passed to the C compiler test in
configure which in turn produces this output in config.log:

-------------- snip --------------
configure:1004: checking for gcc
configure:1117: checking whether the C compiler (gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Werror ) works
configure:1133: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -Wall -Werror   conftest.c  1>&5
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
configure:1130: warning: return-type defaults to `int'
configure: failed program was:

#line 1128 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"

main(){return(0);}
-------------- snip --------------

:-) Perhaps the test program had better been 

  int main(){return(0);}
  ^^^

I see that all test programs except the tests for the C compiler,
alloca stack direction and setvbuf already have 'int' before
'main'.  Is that an autoconf bug or can we change that in our tree?

Do you have any other style lines that might affect netscape windows
that use 'Starts...' or 'SkipMapping' or some related style? Can
you send me your config file please?

I'm not sure that is the correct thing to do. Usually the border colour
derives from the background of the area, not from the text colour.
The contrast between text and background is usually high, but you don't
necessarily expect a high contrast between the background and the border.
Shouldn't the shadow colour be used instead?

The man page states something different:

       *FvwmWinListIconFore color
              Specifies the color to use for the button names for
              windows  that  are iconified. If omitted, the color
              from FvwmWinListFore is used. Cancels  *FvwmWinLis
              tIconColorset.

(same for IconBack)

This seems to be the right behaviour.

I have already a patch to solve the problem.

	It does. And "Netscape*" would match all the window titles of the
windows I commonly use; furthermore, the Class for all of them is simply
"Netscape", so there should be a backup match.

	Which means we are matching the style to the right window. I have no
idea what's inhibiting the StartsOnDesk/SkipMapping combination - as
I've said, I can't reproduce it on my Linux system with 4.6.

	I think we need to compare notes on our environments - I've lost track
of who has what. Would everyone having this problem please let us know:

	1) Which version(s) of Netscape misbehave(s) this way?
	2) What OS and version are you running?
	3) Do you have any special X resources set for Netscape? - particularly
	   any of the more arcane ones listed in the Netscape.ad file under the
	   comments to the effect of "Don't install this file, and you really
	   don't want to change any of this stuff, but...".
	4) Do you start it with command line args -  -geometry or the like?

No, not at all.  There are powerful service functions in libs/Parse.c
that do all of the work for you.

Yup, you're right.

How could that transparency option work? I still had no idea how
you can do this except by using shapes.

I have another enhancement suggestion, but I'm not sure if it
can be done easily.  I want to specify certain colour names that
are taken from colour sets.  So you could say

  *FvwmButtonsFore $foreground_cs3
  *FvwmButtonsBack $shadow_cs3
  Exec exec xterm -bg $background_cs0

and so on. Hm, doesn't sound too difficult.
  

BTW, I have a question about shapes that someone may be able to
answer:  When I add combine shape masks for a window and finally
want to turn off the shape of a window, how do I do this? I don't
have a description of the shape commands.  The only way I could
figure out was to 'or' a filled rectangle of the size of the window
into the shape mask with XShapeCombineMask, but this is too slow to
be acceptable.  Is there a way to simply turn shapes off?

Bye

Hello,
First of all, I am sorry for my english !
In my first message there are only the patch that you applied. I have 
made the error to add comments which was not directly concerned by the 
patch that I have send. This one contains no patch and it is in two
parts (+ a "bye").


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 1: Starting fvwm with FvwmM4/Cpp

Assume that you start fvwm in your .xsession/.xinitrc script with the
command line:
	fvwm -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"
Then:
	1. fvwm do its "init"
	2. fvwm executes the command line: executeModule FvwmM4
	3. fvwm go to its "main loop"
	4. So now fvwm run :o)

the point is that fvwm read the file preprocessed by FvwmM4
at step 4. This implies some *litle* problems
    a. No more watch cursor during startup.
    b. If you use gnome, the applications of the saved
       session flash or are clearly visible during "startup".
    c. SessionInit("client-id") may some time work in an unexpected way

Last night I have modified FvwmM4 so that if you start fvwm
with the command line

fvwm2 -cmd "ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 -noread -outfile .fvwm2rc
Main.fvwm" -cmd "Read .fvwm2rc"

(noread is a new option which 
	i. implies  m4-debug;
	ii. report the "I have finished my startup and now I am running" 
	    message of M4 to fvwm *after* that FvwmM4 has closed its 
	    pipe to m4;
	iii. Does not say to fvwm to read the preprocessed file.)

Then:   1. fvwm do its "init"
       	2. fvwm executes "ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 ...." and  * write
.fvwm2rc *
	3. fvwm executes "Read .fvwm2rc"
	4. fvwm has finish to run its options and then create the resize
	   window, SessionInit, ..., Go to its events loop, ...

That is: we can start fvwm in the same way that with the command line
	fvwm2 -cmd "Read .fvwm2rc"
This solved problem b. and c. but not a. because I think that FvwmM4
kill the watch cursor ( but we may add a -cursor option to M4 :o).
Moreover, I think that it is a more "generic" way to start fvwm with
a preprocessor and this can avoid future problems (but as usual
with fvwm the user can choose and use M4/Cpp as before ! ).

So the QUESTION is : Do you want such a patch ??
(I have tested it with --enable-debug-msgs)


Do not read this: Maybe a we can implement a new executeModule function:
executeModuleAndFunc: it will executeModule, then wait for a "message"
from  the  module (as executeModuleSync), then execute "command" at once
if
the module ask it in is "message", then fvwm will come back to the "main
loop".

#--------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 2: Add More value to FvwmM4/Cpp ?

I would like to add other values to FvwmM4/Cpp for compile-time options
(e.g., HAVE_RPLAY,  ...). There is a value for that called OPTION
with a list of options (at the present time XPM SHAPE I18N_MB M4/CPP
may be in this "list"). However, it does not seem easy to
use OPTION. I suggest to add other definitions for the main compile
time options: we can reproduce  main config.h values (e.g., define 
CTO_HAVE_RPLAY to 1 in Cpp/M4 if it is defined to 1 in config.h, does 
not define it in Cpp/M4 if it is not defined in config.h). 
If you think it is a good idea I can do a patch (or add this to
the previous one).

#--------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I am sorry, this message is very long. I hope it is clear but my
english does not allow me to be as clear as I would like. 
But, print it and go to take a coffee with it.
Moreover, I have to show you that I begin to understand the fvwm code, 
so that you can trust me :o). 

Yours, Olivier

You can have this already with *FvwmPagerWindow3dBorders.

Just like all those terminal emulators - you fake it.  What you need to
do it to shift the background pixmap so its origin is at the absoloute
coordinates (0,0).  I think you can do this by:

*) take the background pixmap supplied by FvwmTheme
*) use it as the tile in a GC (XSetTile(), XSetFillStyle())
*) XSetTSOrigin(GC, -(window absolute x), -(window absolute y))
*) XFillArea a new pixmap with the GC
*) Apply the new pixmap as the window background
*) free the new pixmap

Getting the absolute coordinates require a round trip to the server so
it could be quite slow. Using big pixmaps could also slow things down.

The other major problem is that it won't look transparent if fvwm puts a
border around the window which shifts the location. To fix this you have
to add StructureNotifyMask to the event mask and handle ConfigureNotify
events like FvwmWinList. You also have to recompute the background
pixmap every time the window moves. Actually, on thinking about this, it
looks like an awful lot of work.

I thought about doing this in the library function GetColor().  I think
all the modules use the library GetColor() and they all have the
colorset stuff linked in so it should be possible to just modify the
library.

Not sure about this one though as it wants the color value not the
pixel.

Tim.

Oops, I forgot to include it in the diff.

1999-09-29  Brad Giaccio  <bgiaccio@psrw.com>

	* FvwmIconMan/x.c (X_init_manager): set pixmaps to None on init since we
	check for it later
	(X_init_manager): cleaned up an UMR on a print

	* FvwmIconMan/globals.c: contextDefaults needed another entry since I
	increased the number of contexts when I did the colorset stuff

	* FvwmIconMan/fvwm.c (destroy_window): setting focus_win to null helps
	avoid possible free memory reads/writes

Well, I waited, and now with this mornings CVS, I'm still having
problems compiling scanner.l:

flex   ../../../version-2_3_9/modules/FvwmScript/scanner.l && mv lex.yy.c scanner.c
"../../../version-2_3_9/modules/FvwmScript/scanner.l", line 104: unrecognized rule

That was my first idea too.  But that won't help for applications
that use XAllocColor or XAllocNamedColor.  If the fvwm command
line parser replaces the pixels values with the corresponding
rgb values this can be passed to any application.  The only problem
would be to find out the rgb values.  THe benefit is that all
applications on the desktopn can share the same colour set (well,
at least as long as you do not change it).

Oh yeah.  Doh!  I didn't even notice that.

Yes, you don't want to do that; configure won't like -Werror in

produce output with -Wall that configure then interprets as a problem).

It's an autoconf issue.  We _could_ fix it, by overriding the default
autoconf macros for those tests with our own, but I don't want to go
there.

I think you should rather report it to the autoconf folks.

Oh dear.  I committed scanner.c later than scanner.l so I hoped that you
wouldn't have to build it.  Does anyone know of a way of getting CVS to
get the timestamps in order on scanner.l and scanner.c?

OK, I touched scanner.c and now I can build.

I'm not clear on why I'm getting these errors.  What did you do to get
scanner.l to create scanner.c?  If there is  a problem with scanner.l,
shouldn't it be solved?

My .fvwm2rc stuff is:

I don't have a problem. When I started hacking FvwmScript I modified
scanner.l and script.y and typed make.  The problem I had was that
scanner.c, script.c and script.h were generated files and in the CVS
repository. I couldn't `cvs update' because it would just replace the
new contents with the old ones.  I removed the generated files from CVS
and it solved my problems.  Then there were some reports of people being
unable to buil scanner.c.  I think this is due to different versions of
lex and yacc (I use flex and bison).  I then put the generated files
back hoping that anyone doing a `cvw update' would get the files
restored with newer dates and they wouldn't have to use lex or yacc, it
seems like this doesn't happen.

Maybe we should remove the lex and yacc'ing from the makefile. There is
nothing machine dependant in their outputs. The problem then is that
anyone editing the lex and yacc input files will have to run them by
hand to produce the output. I don't know how hard this would be to do,
it might all happen due to autoconf.

Cheers,
Tim.

Doesn't  seem to me  to be a good idea.   I'm running flex 2.3.8.  I'd
like to upgrade if that will help.  Which version are you running?

I sent a patch like this back in July, but it was never applied. Anyway,
all it does is change FvwmGtk's gtk_init to a gnome_init so that GNOME's
user preferences will apply to FvwmGtk.

Two autoconf macros are required for this to work; they are included in
the attached file gnome.m4.gz which should be uncompressed into the
toplevel directory.

Then I have to ask someone else to apply this.  I'm still completely
illiterate when it comes down to autoconf :-)  The patch sound
interesting however.

Can you exchange the lookup_style function in style.c with
this code and see if the failing style lines are matched
at all?

------------------------------------------------------------
void lookup_style(FvwmWindow *tmp_win, window_style *styles)
{
  window_style *nptr;

  /* clear callers return area */
  memset(styles, 0, sizeof(window_style));
  /* initialize to default layer */
  styles->layer = Scr.DefaultLayer;
#ifdef GNOME
  /* initialize with GNOME hints */
  GNOME_GetStyle (tmp_win, styles);
#endif
  /* look thru all styles in order defined. */
fprintf(stderr,"trying to match n='%s', r='%s', c='%s'\n", tmp_win->name, tmp_win->class.res_name, tmp_win->class.res_class);
  for (nptr = all_styles; nptr != NULL; nptr = nptr->next) {
    /* If name/res_class/res_name match, merge */
fprintf(stderr, "style='%s'\n", nptr->name);
    if (matchWildcards(nptr->name,tmp_win->class.res_class) == TRUE) {
fprintf(stderr,"matched class\n");
      merge_styles(styles, nptr);
    } else if (matchWildcards(nptr->name,tmp_win->class.res_name) == TRUE) {
fprintf(stderr,"matched resource\n");
      merge_styles(styles, nptr);
    } else if (matchWildcards(nptr->name,tmp_win->name) == TRUE) {
fprintf(stderr,"matched name\n");
      merge_styles(styles, nptr);
    }
  }
  return;
}
------------------------------------------------------------

And I have a question refering to the add_style_to_list function,
Dan. There is a comment from you that mentions that older versions
tried to merge multiple style commands and that it was removed -
partially because 'the last match should win'.  I wonder if this is
really the behaviour we want.  One reason against it is memory
consumption, another that is may have subtle effects with certain
config files.  I wonder it is worth the effort to implement
merged styles again and then replace the matching scheme so that
a 'best match' wins.

Alright, the new parsing is in place.  The 'Colorset' command for
FvwmTheme now takes a comma separated list of options:

  Colorset <n> option [, option] ...

The Shape, TiledShape, AspectShape, Pixmap, TiledPixmap, 
AspectPixmap and ?Gradient options work exactly as they did
before.  There are new options Foreground/Fore/fg and
Background/Back/bg that do the same as the former position
dependent fore and back colours.  The options Hilight/Hilite/hi
and Shadow/Shade/sh are completely new.  Since parsing is
completely position independent there is no need for any
'-' specifiers anymore.  All options can be used independently
at any time.

Tim, would you update the man page for the new syntax?
I am so very tired of writing man pages :-/

---
There are two more issues that I did not resolve, and I
would be grateful if I don't have to do it.  First, since
all options are optional, we need to supply some default
colours if the user doesn't specify one.  All that is left
to do is to put the appropriate pixel values in the
structure - the logic is already there.  I have marked the
placed where to put the code with three exclamation marks.

The second open issue are the hilight and shadow colours.
These used to be initialised with a colour based on the bg
colour (with 'average' background).  I don't understand why
we can't simply use GetShadow() and GetHilite() here.  I have
ifdef'ed two occurences of this logic.  If it's okay to use
Get...() these two paragraphs can be deleted.

---
There was a bug in the calculation of 'average' background
colours with transparent pixmaps.  The pixmap first filled
the transparent part with the yet undefined background
colour, then the bg code calculated the average colour on
the random pixels :-) I guess I have fixed this.  I didn't
test the 'contrast' bit.

---
I had to put back the mask bit in colour sets. I need
them to draw the transparent part of xpm backgrounds in the
background colour. Tim, please have a look at the current
colorset_struct. I had to put some FvwmTheme internal
members in there that are not communicated to the modules
but take up some space. Do you have a better idea how to
handle this?

Bye

    [I'm copying several people, 'cause I'm not sure who's on the list.]


Tung --

	Do you have anywhere in your fvwm2rc a style like this...?

Style  *  NoPPosition

If not, please add that style somewhere and see if you have any better
luck with Netscape.

	If you do have it, please double check that there is no UsePPosition
style command that might undo it.


Dan --

	Try entering "Style * UsePPosition" from FvwmConsole and then fire the
beastie up (without the -geom), and I'll bet you get the same symptoms
as have been reported, at least for 4.61. I'd be curious to hear what
3.0 does, since one of the reports said 3.x worked fine but 4.61 was
flaky.


Ferg, Nathan --

	Would you mind trying the same experiment, and letting us know what
happens?


Dominik --

	I'm wondering whether maybe we should make NoPPosition the default,
since the documentation has recommended using it for years.


Cheers,
Bob

Ok, ModuleSynchronous can do that ! So the patch is now with
a -start option which forces to send the message "ok I am runing"
after that FvwmM4 closed is pipe with m4.
However, I still do not understand why the watch cursor disapear ...

Hi folks,

I got the following error message of fvwm 2.3.8:

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> xpenguin window 0x2800001 has
broken (6) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

I am not sure whether this isn't a problem of my own xpenguin program.
If I can help you in any way to reproduce this problem, please let me 
know.


Regards

Harri

Yes, it is a problem of your program.  It requests a maximum allowed
height of zero which is obviously nonsense.  With a window manager
taking these hints seriously it wouldn't be able to display its
window at all.

Style "Netscape" NoPPosition

fixes the problem.  It doesn't matter whether I use -geom or not.
It also doesn't matter whether I run Netscape 3.0 or 4.61 or not.

I'll change to:

Style "*" NoPPosition

for  testing, but based on the  man page, I guess I'm  going to have a
problem   with  some applications.  I  guess   thats why  its  not the
default.

I'm guessing that since Bob identified NoPPosition as the culprit,
you don't need this anymore.

Gee, you had me confused there.  The comment reads like this:

  /* This used to contain logic that returned if the style didn't contain
   * anything.  I don't see why we should bother. dje.
   *
   * used to merge duplicate entries, but that is no longer
   * appropriate since conficting styles are possible, and the
   * last match should win! */

Notice  that  my  initials  follow  the  first paragraph.  The  second
comment was  present in fvwm1.24r.  You  could only merge entries that
matched on style that at  are at the end  of the list.  These could be
merged:

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "*" NoPPositon

These couldn't:

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "Netscape" UsePPosition
Style "*" NoPPosition

This would get trickier:

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "Netscape" Icon x.xpm
Style "*" NoPPosition

I'm using it for years and never had any problems with it.
Applications that require that the WM honours this hint are
broken.  I see the 'UsePPosition' style as another bug-fix
option.  Shouldn't we give it a try?  I guess we will have
less bug reports in the future about this, not more.

Well, if it makes "startsonpage, skipmapping" work, I think I agree,
its worth a try.  I also needed "ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage".
Shouldn't that be a default also?

Duh, I didn't notice this subtle difference.

Why? It's easy to find the correct entry in the list. The main problem
I see is that the function merging the styles together would have to
know the individual styles so that it could free allocated memory.
I believe the question is more if we would like the effect.

No. There is nothing much to be merged. Remember that the code to
merge *different* styles is already there. What we need is the code
to merge two instances of the same style without leaking memory.
For use by add_window different styles are already merged, but these
new styles couldn't be used because they would happily leak any allocated
memory that both parent styles are using.

I was looking through the code for FvwmPager and found a thing... in
FvwmPager.c around line 1550:

      if (flags & XValue)
      {
        window_x = g_x;
        usposition = 1;
      }
      if (flags & YValue)
      {
        window_y = g_y;
        usposition = 1;
      }
      if (flags & XNegative)
      {
        xneg = 1;
      }
      if (flags & YNegative)
      {
        window_y = g_y;
        yneg = 1;
      }

That flags & XNegative difference looks wrong.. is it? Shouldn't it also
have a window_x = g_x ?

2.5.4 but only because the Solaris 2.6 lex falls over on this file. I
don't think there is a problem with the file it's just that some lex's
aren't as tough as others.  I think this problem has been around since
FvwmScript was first created, it's just that the dates on the files are
different now and make it trying to recreate it.  What we need is a way
to make anyone using CVS to have a more recent scanner.c than their
scanner.l. We also need to make sure the timestamps in any tar files we
build are sensible.

Cheers,
Tim.

I couldn't think of anything better than copying the colors from
colorset 0. Colorset 0 is initially created by fvwm and contains the
DefaultColors colors which default to black/gray.

These colors are calculated when FvwmTheme is using read/write colors.
In this case the pixel values never changed (they are
XAllocColorCells()'d when the colorset is created).  You can't use
GetHilite() since it uses XAllocColor and returns a pixel.

Contrast is just calculated from the background color so this shouldn't

I've put an ifdef in the structure definition so that only FvwmTheme.c
can see the private parts. I don't know if this is the best way but it
compiles.

If you do an opaque resize the pager doesn't update until the resize is
finished and then it goes nuts drawing all the intermediate positions
until it gets to the final size. I'm not desperate for it to update in
real time so it might be easier to not send the messages until the
resize is over and then send just one.

Tim.

I added the style and Netscape seems te behave like I wanted.

Netscape 4.51, XFree-3.3.3.1, Linux-2.2.5, i386 (all installed from
RedHat 6.0)

No xresources set for Netscape, no startup parameters.

I looked at the fvwm2 manpage, but I can't figure out what the
"PPosition field" designates, could someone explain it a little?

Thanks,

Getting hold of 2.5.4 fixed my flex/lex problem.

Maybe I'm dense, but now I appreciate how this isn't a solution.

Here's a   guess,  if both   files are  committed  with changes,   the
timestamps will  always be set on  checkout  based on their alphabetic
order:

me> rm scanner*
me> cvs update
cvs server: Updating .
U scanner.c
U scanner.l
cvs server: Updating Scripts
cvs server: Updating Scripts/some_nice_icons
cvs server: Updating Widgets
me> ls  -altr scanner*
-rw-r-----  1 dane  bae   3658 Sep 30 14:08 scanner.l
-rw-r-----  1 dane  bae  72465 Sep 30 14:08 scanner.c

This is rather a stupid bug, but I want to mention in anyway.

When I put this line in my .fvwm2rc, fvwm segfaults:

ColorSet

No options, no backslash, just the word "ColorSet".


BTW, keep up the good work, fvwm2 is getting better and better each day.
And I already thought it was already damn nice...

Hi,

I was working with xforms V0.88 under fvwm2.3.7 compiled with libstrokes
when I got the attached message.

Sorry, but I am not sure I can reproduce this as I was messing about with
ideas at the time.

If I can help just let me know,

	Great! I think we've got enough success stories now to be confident
that we've naile this one.

	[sigh]  I'm having to dig into my very fuzzy recollection of FVWM
ancient history on this one (which is why I didn't think of the solution
sooner). If anyone can explain this a little better, please jump in.

	NoPPosition addresses a problem associated with apps that explicitly
set a position of 0,0 when they create a window (by setting the
PPosition hint), and use 0,0 to mean they don't really care where it's
placed. A number of applications do this, though, as I think Dominik
commented, it is technically broken. The canonically correct thing to do
would be not to specify a position.

	NoPPosition, in effect, tells FVWM to assume that the special case of a
program-specified position of 0,0 means "don't care", and not to try to
honor the position request as it does for other values.

	There is a lot of code that tries to deal with honoring the 0,0 case,
and as far as I can tell, it's always tended to produce intermittently
quirky results. Among other things, I think it was prone to off-by-one
errors when adjusting for the window decorations, and falling through
some special code that attempted to reposition the window so that it was
in the visible viewport. Also, a lot of the fancy placement code gets
bypassed, and that's where StartsOnPage does its dirty work.

	I recall that Rob Nation (the original author of FVWM) had recommended
never using UsePPosition unless you have an app that really requires it.
I can't lay my hands on the source of his suggestion at the moment,
however.

	Without digging a little deeper, I'm not sure whether the StartsOnPage
code copuld be easily made to work with UsePPosition - without breaking
something else. But I'm also not so sure that an app that really goes
bonkers if it doesn't get the exact 0,0 positioning it requested would
be very happy with things like StartsOnPage and SkipMapping.

	Does anyone else recall what apps actually required UsePPosition?


Cheers,
Bob

	I got a little confused following the various threads related to this.
I was thinking that you had said StartsOnPage *was* working properly for
you, so I assumed that you *did* have NoPPosition. That's why my
suggestion was sort of backwards.

	I've used it as far back as I can remember (back in Version 1 days),
and I can't remember having a problem with any applications.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see how you fare for a few days before making
a change to the default.

	I seem to recall seeing some comments from Rob - maybe in the code,
maybe in the old sample fvwmrc's...I'll have to see if I can find them -
that he knew of only a couple of apps that had a problem with
NoPPosition. I don't recall what they were. I'm betting that you don't
have a problem.

	On the other hand, maybe I just dreamed it. I can't find any such
refence in my archives. I also think my foggy brain was merging the man
page comments about Lenience with NoPPosition.

	The man page (Version1 or Version 2) doesn't strongly recommend
NoPPosition - it's more of a gentle hint - so, clearly, my comment that
the documentation has recommended it for years was way off base. Well,
I've recommended it for years...a couple of times, anyway.  :-)


Cheers,
Bob
