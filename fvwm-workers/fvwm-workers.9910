I think its   time to either  remove  this message,  or clear up   the
wording so the problem report is sent to  the application owner rather
than us.

Submission from: (NULL) (209.68.1.70)


In updating my config to the new panel setup, I've noticed that 
a feature of the old Panel code is no longer present. See the below
line:

(Icon '1-15.xpm', Panel(left, smooth) 1-15.pnl "Module FvwmButtons
-transient 1-15.pnl /usr/home/fpotetz/.fvwm/panels/1-15", Action(Mouse 2)
'Exec ~/.fvwm/scripts/servers.1-15.script &')

No matter which mouse button is pressed, the Action(mouse 2) function
is never called. All mouse buttons call up the panel.

Something went wrong with that last change.  I have:

Style "*" IconBox -80 240 -1 -1, IconGrid 80 67, \
          IconBox 1040x20+0-40,  IconGrid 80 80, IconFill r t

and its using only the second iconbox.

If you try to move a window using the titlebar, but have little
time after the button click and the point you are moving the
mouse pointer, the X pointer will be far away from the place
where you originally clicked before fvwm figures out what is
going on and begins moving the window.  This is pretty annoying
because then you can't snug the window up to the edge of the
screen, etc.  I discontinued use of fvwm a couple of years ago
because it did this, and even now it appears to do the same
thing.

Here's the function that I use to do move windows with the
titlebar:

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "I" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "D" Lower

I'm using fvwm 2.2.2

Thanks,

Chris Ruffin

You should be able to twiddle the ClickTime setting to lower the
threshold before the Move portion of the function runs. Hmph,
actually, you're probably beating ClickTime by a lot anyway, and it's
the movement that fvwm catches... Anyway, some obscure changes were
made to the ClickTime behavior WRT I/M/C conditions in functions.
Didn't catch the full significance of the changes at the time. Anyway,
try reducing your ClickTime. Its default is 150 ms, so try dropping it
to less.

    Tried the same with xterm 3.3.3 on i586, 64M RAM, 128M swap, continuously
increasing the number of 'a's (perl -e 'print "a" x 60000', 600000,
600000...).  But instead of xterm crash got Fvwm2 hangup after 6e6 "a"s.
I.e. everything else works -- I ould even press the "play" button in x11amp
with mouse, except Fvwm2.

    "strace -p <fvwm2pid>" shows that Fvwm2 waits infinitely on select().

    The only choice was to kill the window manager.

    All progs are from stock RedHat 6.0/i386 -- "Fvwm Version 2.2 compiled on
Apr  9 1999 at 16:15:38".

I checked the man page, and it doesn't look like it's possible for one
decor to include another. Would it be possible for someone to add this
feature?

Oops, yes. I expanded the variables in a private memory area
and the sent the unexpanded string (when respawning). Fixed.

                ^^^^^

That output means that the application window 'Form Design' has
requested to be resized in units of zero pixels, which is nonsense.
This might cause strange effects with other window managers.  This
bug should be reported to the developers of said application.
Which program created this window?

Sounds like the perfect solution.  Is this mentioned in the

Ah, I understand.  But shouldn't we have a modularized version
of Get...() that works on rgb values only?  I don't like the
code duplication in FvwmTheme.

No, I meant I didn't test if 'contrast' still works since I
don't know exactly what it is supposed to do (i.e. which
colour is chosen based on the bg colour).

Sounds okay to me.  One of the rare useful applications of
ifdef.

Ah, yes.  I misunderstood how icon boxes work and let the latest
icon box override existing ones.  I corrected this.  However,
I don't understand how you can reset your icon boxes.  It seems
that the only way to clear out already defined icon boxes is to
destroy the complete style and build it from scratch.  Is this
right?  If it is 'IconBox' is the only style that cannot be
changed after it has been set.

     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
     [fixed]
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow

 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
     [fixed]
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.

 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript

     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
     [fixed]
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
     [Dominik]
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
     [fixed]
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.

After a change I made the gradient styles didn't accept flags
anymore. If the flags are on a separate line the flat style
still works:

  +     TitleStyle -- flat

It is fixed in the development tree.

That's a known problem with fvwm 2.2.2 (although it happens only
on some setups - otherwise it couldn't have sneaked into 2.2.2).
It it already fixed in the development code (I hope), but
unfortunately the fix is so complex that we can't provide it for
the 2.2.x series.

I didn't understand completely where the problem
was, but I suspect it might be a problem of the X server.  I have
noticed that XFree for example sometimes confuses the order in
which button events arrive. Possibly the problem is that when
you click+move fast enough the movement events are reported by Xlib
before the button press.

Hey! That you didn't understand my code doesn't mean it is
'obscure' ;-) And that change was after 2.2.x anyway (2.3.5 to
be precise).

I overlooked this one.  Fixed in the development code.

Does it still show up in the process list? Is it perhaps iconified? If
it is a 'Next (FvwmWinList) Iconify off) should bring it back. Can you
check if this is related to your config lines? I have spent five minutes
iconifying/deiconifying windows and nothing went wrong with FvwmWinList.

I can't reproduce this with the current CVS code.  On the other hand there
was a pager/stacking order related bugfix after 2.3.8 was released.  Can
you verify this with a current snapshot?

I'm not sure what you mean.  If the pager window receives an Expose event
if must redraw itself.  Of course it may flicker when it redraws.  Or it
might redraw if some other window is mapped, unmapped, moved or resized.
Please provide more details.

Shrug.  If netscape wants to redraw the window I don't see what fvwm
has to do with it.  With my version of netscape (4.51), it draws/erases
a black border around the text input box when the window is focused/unfocused.
If this causes flickering I don't see how this might me related to fvwm.
Please describe exactly what happens with the window.

I'm not sure I understand.  If you issue a new

Style * Iconbox <newlocation>

then all new windows will go into the new iconbox.
If you issue "Recapture" then existing windows move to the new iconbox.

I think thats the same as how other styles work.

The only "odd" thing is that multiple iconboxes have to be defined in
one command, and they are all overridden by the next "style iconbox".

I think thats a necessary part of the "multiple iconboxes" feature.

Sorry, I must apologize for the screwed up patch I sent on the weekend.
I made a cut-and-past error when moving the patch from our development
sources to the stable version.  The correct (and tested) patch to
fvwm-2.2.2 is attached.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hello,

In the patches attached to this message (one for FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp
(things are perfectly symetric) and one for the ChangeLog since it 
will be out of date when the patch will be applied ... if it is applied).

These patches add two new options -noread and -lock to FvwmM4/Cpp.

-noread causes FvwmM4/Cpp to do not says to fvwm to Read the
preprocessed file. This is useful for using FvwmM4/Cpp for preprocess 
script for FvwmScript.

-lock have some effects only if you start FvwmM4/Cpp with 
ModuleSynchronous. This option causes fvwm to wait that the pre-process
finish and that FvwmM4 ask fvwm to Read the pre-processed file before 
continuing. This may be useful at startup if you use a
session manager as Gnome. Also, this is useful if you want to process
and run a Form in a fvwm function. For example a function like

AddToFunc M4AndRunForm \
I ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 -lock $0
+ I FvwmForm $1

will work as expected (i.e., "M4AndRunForm afile AForm" will pre-process
the file afile (with a macro configuration of AForm) and run the Form AForm
which have been just Read by fvwm) 
 
To obtain such a result I have use the SendFinishedStartupNotification
function: if the -lock option is used, this function is used only after
FvwmM4/Cpp ask fvwm to read the preprocessed file.

No it doesn't show up in the process list (its not iconified).  The only way
I've been able to consistently reproduce it is by having a xterm close to
the winlist and then iconifying/deiconifying the xterm (in excess of 30-40
iconify's)

The behavior is totally different when compared to fvwm-2.2.2 -- I'm not
talking about the white "typing" area - its more like the entire transient
window.  Follow these instructions,

 1. Have 'Style "*" MouseFocus' in your .fvwm2rc file
 2. start netscape
 3. Meta-o
 4. Move the mouse to the transient
 5. Move the mouse from the transient to the underlying netscape
 6. NOTE: as you do #5, note that the transient flashes (I also noticed that
          the Pager also flashes then)
 7. repeat 4-6 for further inspection

Try it out - 2.3.8 vs. 2.2.2

I think what is happening is that in 2.2.2 the transient would be lowered
under the parent where-as now the transient is kept above the parent (no
problem there - but it seems as though its being done brute force).

I'm not talking about whether the transient should be on-top or not, where its
at with 2.3.8 is fine, what I'm wondering about is how that is accomplished -
my uneducated guess is,

as one Meta-o's                             --> "Transient is above parent",
focus taken away from transient             --> "transient is lowered",
oops, but transient should be always on top --> "transient is raised"

and thus the flickering (note - I'm guessing here, but there is flickering).

But how do you turn all icon boxes off?  I can't see how this
can be done.  Dan, can you clarify the description in the man
page?  It doesn't explicitly state that a new IconBox style
overrides existing ones.  And I am not sure that this still
applies with the new merging code.  I believe that IconBoxes
are added until a style with a different name is used between
two IconBox definitions.

We could but it would only be used by FvwmTheme so I don't think it

It works on the red/green/blue components individually and sets each one
to be as far from the background value as possible.  This means it
chooses one of white, black, red, blue, green, cyan, magenta or yellow.

Now that I have taken a look at ColorUtils.c I see that the code
we need is already there.  To get the hilight colour you can
call

    color_mult(&c.red, &c.green, &c.blue, BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR);

(where c is a XColor struct) and 

    color_mult(&c.red, &c.green, &c.blue, BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR);

to get the shadow colour.  This is exactly what Get... do.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I just tried with branch-2_2. A cvs checkout gets the files in the order
they were added to the archive: 

>ll -rt scanner.*
-rw-rw-rw-   1 tim      quadrics    3511 Nov 10  1998 scanner.l
-rw-rw-rw-   1 tim      quadrics   73792 Nov 10  1998 scanner.c

I then removed these file and did a cvs update:

>cvs update
U scanner.c
U scanner.l
>ll -rt scanner.*
-rw-rw-rw-   1 tim      quadrics   73792 Oct  5 12:29 scanner.c
-rw-rw-rw-   1 tim      quadrics    3511 Oct  5 12:29 scanner.l

Very strange.
Cheers,
Tim.

I need a way to reproduce this to do anything about it.

I did and it doesn't lower/raise or flicker.  Are you by any chance using
something like this:

  Module FvwmAuto 100 raise lower

I guess you have something in your config file that causes the
transient to be lowered when you leave the window (FvwmAuto is
the only thing that comes to my mind).  I think it would be best
if you send me your config file so I can find the problem therein.

Subject: Configure fails on checking argument types of select

Full_Name: Michael Kirby
Version: 2.3.8
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.7
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (208.140.33.201)


I download the 2.3.8 tar file, and run configure, and it bombs on checking
argument types of select.
This is a brand new sun installation, so I can't imagine I have anything 
misconfigured (although its possible).

It does work from the same account in SunOS 5.6.


Does fvwm not work on SunOS 5.7?

Thanks,
Mike

Please post the error message configure generated and the tail
of config.log (where the failing test is logged).  We are
constantly trying to keep fvwm compatible to any OS version.

The requested files are attached.

I notice that I seem to have a compilation error with gcc.  I've seen 
this before, and I am wondering whether or not I am running the 
right version of gcc (I'm running 2.7.2), or whether or not it is 
installed properly (like do I need to specify include paths properly).

It is possible that the include files in question work fine for Solairs 
2.6, but 2.7 has issues.  Is there a recommended version of gcc for 
use with this?  Or how about pre-built binaries?

Thanks,

Mike

You're probably better off getting binaries for gcc, which you can find a=

sunfreeware.com. If your picky, use those to compile a local gcc.

Either way, the resulting compiler(s) should work a lot better than 2.7.2=

does, and not just for fvwm.

In general, as your header-files and libraries have changed with the =

OS-upgrade, upgrading (or rebuilding) gcc is a good idea. See:

This looks as if the file /usr/include/sys/siginfo.h is broken on your
machine.  Seems to happen quite often with commercial UNIXes.  Can you
see any blatant bugs in that file?  Please send us the relevant portion
of this file (to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org).

In general, it's not the version of GCC that matters.  GCC 2.7.2 will
work on Solaris 2.7, _BUT_ you must have compiled GCC on Solaris 2.7.

That is, you can't use a GCC built on Solaris 2.6 to compile programs on
Solaris 2.7.

This is because GCC makes copies of some of the standard header files in
order to fix them up.  Then, when you compile on a different version,
the headers GCC has don't match well with the other headers on the
system (Sun is notorious for making extensive changes to system header
files with every release).

You didn't specify how your GCC was built, but I bet it was built on
Solaris 2.6.

As further info, the latest versions of GCC don't do nearly as much, if
any, of this header copying.  If you get GCC 2.8.1 (I think) or above
(the latest is 2.95.1) you _should_ be able to use the same GCC on
multiple versions of Solaris.  But I haven't tried this myself.

You can get prebuilt GCC binaries from:

  http://www.sunfreeware.com/

You won't be able to configure and build FVWM until the compiler
situation is resolved.

HTH.

You have a compiler built for solaris 2.5 not for 2.7 you need to have a
compiler built on 2.7 in order to compile try.

http://smc.vnet.net/sol7/ and get the package for gcc, please read the
instructions carefully.  And make sure you don't hose the other gcc if
its nfsed.

The requested files are attached.

I notice that I seem to have a compilation error with gcc.  I've seen 
this before, and I am wondering whether or not I am running the 
right version of gcc (I'm running 2.7.2), or whether or not it is 
installed properly (like do I need to specify include paths properly).

It is possible that the include files in question work fine for Solairs 
2.6, but 2.7 has issues.  Is there a recommended version of gcc for 
use with this?  Or how about pre-built binaries?

Nice work one thing I noticed, and its possible I'm calling it wrong. Is
that using $[fg.cs<n>] (or any of these variables) in an AddToFunc
causes the variable to be expanded then not at function callign time.

So if I have a function AddToFunction xcpu "I" xcpustate -bg $[bg.cs0] \
-fg $[fg.cs1] -colors $[bg.cs0],.,.,.

It is fixed with the values put in during startup not the ones active
given the current colorset.  I'd be glad to take a look at this if you
would like but I didn't know where if you were still in the middle of
things or not.  

Let me know
Brad

I'm guessing something is write with name being rgb:cccc
The colorset in question had fg gray80, bg #c05b23
FvwmCommand 'Echo $[fg.cs0] $[bg.cs0]'
[FVWM][Echo]:  rgb:cccc/cccc/cccc rgb:c0c0/5b5b/2323

Any idea why its gettig cut off?

Hmm, turn iconboxes off?

I don't think you would ever want to do that.  I recently added logic,
to create a  default iconbox behind all   the others, that  covers the
screen.  If all the  others get filled, it uses  that one.  So you can
override them, make them so small, nothing will go  into them, but not
remove them.

Of course if you don't want your icons in an iconbox, you just use
"Style * NoIcon".  Otherwise, they have to go somewhere.


I remember   working thru  the    merging issues  when I   wrote   the
"iconboxes" enhancement.   This wording describes  style matching  for
all style related matching:

  windowname can be a window's name, class, or resource string.
  It can contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which are matched in the
  usual Unix filename manner.  They are searched in the reverse order
  stated, so that Style commands based on the name override or augment
  those based on the class, which override or augment those based on the
  resource string.


I think iconboxes are no different than any other style parameter as
far as the matching goes.

But, somehow, I think I'm missing your point.

Hello,

I add a new way to compute the size of the scrolled window:
it use percentage of the full screen, here a part of the new 
man page:

"FvwmScroll can be invoked by binding the action 'Module
FvwmScroll x y' to a menu or key-stroke in the .fvwmrc file.
The parameter x and y are either integers or integers immediately followed by
a p, which describe the horizontal and vertical size modification of the window. 
An integer describe a size reduction. An integer followed by a p describe
a size as a percentage of the height or the width of a full screen but
the size is never larger than the original window size (0p will do
nothing)."

Sorry if the english is bad.
The "percentage" works similarly that Maximize. The difference are:
1. The Border width and the TitleBar width are not take in account in the
computation (I saw what Dominik do for the panel in FvwmButtons to get these
sizes, but this is to complicate for me ... I think that fvwm is not very 
cool with its modules, since fvwm know these values but there is no way 
to get it easily from a module)
2. The position is computed as for size reduction.
3. The size is never larger than the original window size.

This new ways to resize seems natural for me: It allows to do a
"constant reduction".

Oops, sort of my mistake but we should probabbly handle this better
than dumping core.  I looked at the new examples in the man page for
FvwmThem.  And took the 2 lines

Style "*" ForeColor $[fg.cs0]
Style "*" BackColor $[bg.cs0]
and made them into
Style "*" $[fg.cs0]/$[bg.cs0]
which works fine when your colors are not in the form rgb:cccc/cccc/cccc

So this was my mistake but we probablly want to error on something like
this in the future.

One more question: is your fvwm installed with 'make install'?  What
I am aiming at: is your ConfigFvwmDefaults properly installed?  It
might make a difference if this is executed or not.

??? Do you mean 'HilightColor $[fg.cs0]/$[bg.cs0]'?  I can't believe
fvwm even tried to interpret the strings a colours on this 'Style'
line.

Hm, your X lib has crashed in XParseColor.  I'm not sure what we can do about
it except reporting it to the X server vendor.  My XFree doesn't coredump here.
Can you check if you get the crash if you simply use 'Style * rgb:cccc'?

This is because the $[fg.cs1] is expanded as soon as it is encountered.
To get this in your function you will have to wuote the $: '$$[fg.cs1]'.
Not very nice, I agree.  Since the $[xx.cs<n>] variables are not
associated with a window I don't know what we can do about it (except
adding a warning in the man page). The expand() function determines if
it has to expand the variable by checking if a window is associated or
not.  The '$v' variable has the same problem, but since it never changes
you won't notice it.  Any idea is welcome.

The point is that you can reset any style except 'IconBox' and
perhaps 'UseDecor' to its default setting.  Once you have defined
an icon box you can't remove it completely from the style without
destroying the style.  I guess it wouldn't be difficult to make
'IconBox' without arguments delete all style specific icon boxes.

what I actually ment to type was 
  Style "*" Color $[fg.cs0]/$[bg.cs0]
            ^^^^^
and from the man page 
    Color takes two arguments.  The first  is  the  window-
          label   text   color  and  the  second  is  the  window
          decoration's normal background color.  The  two  colors
          are  separated  with  a  slash.   If the use of a slash
          causes  problems  then  the  separate   ForeColor   and
          BackColor options can be used.

I guess the only thing we could do is check that we are passing
something that looks like a valid color name to XParseColor rgb:cccc is
not but rgb:<4chars>/<4chars>/<4chars> is valid.

It is installed using 'make install' - not to /usr/local/ though (I've
specified a "prefix"); I can access all the setup-forms without a problem
in case I were to start fvwm without my .fvwm2rc file (can't see how this
relates though, because I don't think ConfigFvwmDefaults is executed - but
you know better :-)

If fvwm has been installed with 'make install', ConfigFvwmDefaults should
be read in.  It contains some non-vital initializations that are nonetheless
necessary to get all the defaults mentioned in the man page.  And especially
in this case it does matter if the file is read because it sets transient
handling styles that do affect raising/lowering of windows.

Anyway, I didn't find the time to look into your problem (and .fvwm2rc)
yet, but I think I can do it over the weekend.

I think this thread belongs on fvwm-workers instead of "fvwm".  I
moved it.

Isn't this just another manifestation of the known problem, that is
still pending.  That is, on restart, windows are not restored to their
correct state?

I get another variation, on startup, fvwm completely misses some of my
windows.  Especially the ones that are supposed to be started iconic.
The sit there, opened and undecorated.  A restart clears it up.

I think I understand now, but first, how do you remove:

Style * Forecolor red

you replace it with another color.  You can't reset it to the default.

But thats neither here nor there.  (Das machts nicht. ?)

I think the only important issue is no one ever asked to be able
to do that.  (Except you.)  I don't think:

Style * Iconbox -, Icongrid -, Iconfill -

would do us much good.

But, if you feel the urge, go for it.

I guess you prefer the FvwmCascade approach where it constantly nags you
to change your config file.

If I remember right, I went with a shell that didn't nag.  Someone else came
up with the link.  My own opinion is that I see no problem with the shell/link
staying in place for as long as people still use fvwm.  Especially the link
since it takes almost no space at all.

In my own site, I have fvwm users that are unable to navigate vi, let alone
modify their .fvwm2rc.  Maybe that explains why I'd rather fvwm go overboard
with backward support.

How can extra code in fvwm be cleaner than a nice tidy link?

Yes, but "make install" is necessary, as you discovered.

The other advantage to the logic in the makefile is that when the
"nag interface" is finally removed, CVS won't have one of those deleted
files sitting around causing trouble in the attic.

Well,  there is some of that  now, and I'm  against it.  Not enough to
complain about it,  but  I just wouldn't   do it myself.  I   view the
computer as the slave, the user is  the master.  The slave should not
tell the master to change his ways.

Some of the other developers must feel differently, perhaps when they
see my response, you'll get your wish.

Yes I did.  I fully expect to write it before I install 2.4.  Did I imply
that this script would be generic?

Somehow I don't think so.  Take this example, my current settings:

PixmapPath	/u/dane/icons:\
/u/dane/public_html/textures:\
/opt/public/bin/rxvt-pixmap/textures/:$FVWMICONS:$SYSICONS
IconPath   /u/dane/icons:$SYSICONS:/usr/WI/include/X11/bitmaps

My new settings will probably be

ImagePath /u/dane/icons:/u/dane/public_html/textures:+

I'll build the rest of the icon directories into fvwm.

The hard part will be the other users.  Fortunately, the fvwm2 startup shell that
I use tracks userids.  I expect I'll look at every users .fvwm2rc and build a shell
to deal with all the variations.

See why I prefer that fvwm wouldn't complain about PixmapPath and IconPath?

Hey, sorry, looks like I disagreed with you on every point.

I got a monochrome server running myself, but it doesn't have this
problem.  The log you sent me shows that the stipple pixmap is used
for the background as expected, but still it showed up as black.
My guess is that the colours used for the stipple have changed so that
your server maps them both to black.  There has been indeed a change
between 2.2 and 2.0.43.  The older 2.0.43 used the menu colours for
the stipple and 2.2 uses the standard colours which are 'black' and
'grey'.  Probably grey is mapped to black by your server.  I have
changed the code so that the stipples are always created with the
pixel values BlackPixel() and WhitePixel().  This should fix your
problem (please tell me if it does).

Can't you use something like this?

  AddToDecor foo
  + style "*" UseDecor bar

I didn't try is myself, but it could work.

Are you *sure* you are running 2.3.9?  This problem should be
fixed for several months now and it doesn't happen on my machine.
Of this is not the problem I need more information (which panel version,
how is it configured, what styles are configured for the panel ...).

It's possible that it's Gnome's fault; I have a rather old version (the
1.0.9 packages for Debian 2.1). 1.0.50 is supposed to be out rather soon,
and I'll be compiling it myself. I'll report back then.

Panel is actually 1.0.5, not 1.0.9 (that was gnome-libs). The only style
in effect for panel is CirculateSkip. I'm using DefaultLayers 6 8 10, and
the panel lives quite happily in layer 8. I'm not sure if knowing what
kinds of Style * options I have, so here they are: NoIcon, NoPPosition,
StickyIcon, MouseFocus.

I has a feeling that the problem is in a bad syntax for icon box style.
This is the only style, which treats things differently when they are on
the same line or not. Example:

Style * IconBox 100x100+100+100, IconGrid 16, IconBox 200x200+200+200

is not equivalent to:

Style * IconBox 100x100+100+100, IconGrid 64 64
Style * IconBox 200x200+200+200

neither to:

Style * IconBox 100x100+100+100
Style * IconBox 200x200+200+200
Style * IconGrid 64 64

It is also not clear what needs to be done in all 3 cases; ambiguity.
I suggest a new syntax for a new Style IconBoxes instead of IconBox,
IconGrid and IconFill, which must solve all problems:

Style * IconBoxes ((Geometry +100+100, Grid 64 64), (Geometry +200+200))

and any icon box in parentheses inherits all non-specified attributes
from the previous icon box or a default.
Written this way it is clear that the next IconBoxes will overwrite
previously defined icon boxes. To delete previously defined icon boxes:

Style * IconBoxes ()

Comments?

Sigh! Another of these problems that doesn't occur on my machine.
I'm really *really* fed up with such problems!

Please reporrt back if you can find out anything to isolate
it.

I agree that a link is the best solution and I don't mind if it stays
in place forever.  But I see the nagging more as a friendly reminder
that one day in the future things might not work anymore.  It's only
fair to inform people that some aspects of their config file are not
supported in the future (i.e. it may still work, but if there is a
problem we may tell them to do it differently).

It can't :-) But there alread *is* extra code in FvwmEvent to support
the old FvwmAudio syntax.  Not much, but still.

I see a difference between these shell scripts and changes like
the FvwmButtons panel rewrite or the GlobalOpts command.  Shell
scripts don't cost you much.  They are small and easily written
and maintained.  Features such as the old panels can be extremely
complex and prevent further development.  In such cases I am
willing to break backwards compatibility and confront the user
with warnings.  I wouldn't want to deny us the chance of making
progress, but still take great pains to keep backwards compatibility
where it is possible.  Shell scripts should definitely not issue a
warning.

If someone's going to commit this, you need to use this patch instead. And
the gnome.m4 file is no longer needed, I put the macro in acinclude.m4 so
it's included in the patch. This patch also fixes a bug with Gnome's
session manager starting multiple copies of FvwmGtk.

The gnome panel used to die for me all the time with 1.0.5/1.0.9.  I
gave it up.  I think it's a gnome bug, not necessarily an fvwm bug.

GNOME 1.0.5x is out for potato right now and I'm using it for one of my
logins.  Seems be much more stable and the panel doesn't go away like it
did before.

Ok. I'm not on that list (I didn't even know it existed).

This didn't happen on 2.2.2.

I don't have any such windows (that are supposed to get opened
automatically), and that is probably why it doesn't happen for
me, so yes it's probably the same bug.
I find it strange that it just happens when I'm not looking at desktop
0 when I do the restart.

You are specifically talking about desktops here, and not pages, right?

If it were pages, I'd suspect the icons are being redrawn, just on page
0 instead of your current page.  That's why they "reappear" when you go
to page 0.

If you really mean desktops--never mind :).

They don't reappear when I move, but if I look at that desktop (or virtual
screen, or whatever) when I restart fvwm..

When looking in my configfile:

DesktopSize     1x1

Key 1 A M Desk 0 0
Key 2 A M Desk 0 1
Key 3 A M Desk 0 2
Key 4 A M Desk 0 3
Key 5 A M Desk 0 4  
Key 6 A M Desk 0 5  
Key 7 A M Desk 0 6  
Key 8 A M Desk 0 7  

I would guess they are called desktops, but that's only me... =)

I have applied the path (or better: will have in a few minutes).
One thing I noticed is that it calls a function (gnome_init())
from the fvwm core.  If this is necessary the gnome_init function
must be moved into the libs directory.

I been playing around with my colorsets, and I noticed that we have the
feedback window set to Colorset 0, with no way to modify it.  Dominik,
did you plan on adding a command for this?  If not do you want me to
take a look.  And what should the option be FeedbackWindowColorset?

Brad

Sounds like we agree completely.

If you feel that way, the warnings in FvwmTile and FvwmCascade should
go away.

Those 2 shells will only go away if we make them go away.  I don't see
any pressing reason why they should go away either.

Currently it is hardcoded to colour set 0 because the command to set
these colours is 'DefaultColors'.  The last thing I know is that the
default colours are not use anywhere else, but that was before colour
set support was added.  Tim? What are the implications if we change
this?

I made fvwm create colorset 0 to prevent the case where FvwmTheme is not
run and a module tries to access the colorsets.  I think what would
happen if DefaultColors did not create colorset 0 is that any modules
that used colorsets would display in black on black (pixel 0 on pixel
0). I don't think they would segv since I think they all do an
AllocColorset(0) at start up but they would be unusable.

It's not necessary to tie DefaultColors to colorset 0 and it might
simplify some code in fvwm and FvwmTheme (it could ignore colorset
config lines from fvwm).

I'm not sure what DefaultColors actually controls. What happens if you
start fvwm with no color specifications other than DefaultColors? What
color are the window borders and menus? If they are not set by
DefaultColors then we have some other undocumented defaults in there.

If DefaultColors only sets the feedback window then shouldn't we rename
it and make a colorset version of the command?

Cheers,
Tim.

As I learned DefaultColors only seems to touch the feedback window.

Style "*" ForeColor, BackColor, 
HilightColor <fore> <back>
handles window borders and titles.

I think, menus are all controlled by MenuStyle lines now.  I don't know
if any of the above has an effect.

So I would say that DefaultColors becomes FeedBackColors and
FeedBackColorset

Comments?

Borders and menus have their own defaults.  Furthermore the defaults
can not be changed.

Yes.

>From the man page:

  DefaultColors sets the default forground and background
  colors used in miscellaneous windows created by fvwm, for example
  in the geometry feedback windows during a move or resize operation.
  If you don't want to change one color or the other, use - as its
  color name.  To revert to the builtin default colors omit both
  color names.

  Note that the default colors are not used in menus, window titles
  or icon titles.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm not sure it's worth the trouble to rename the command.  Yes,
the name is confusing, but if nobody complains I wouldn't change
it.  Default colours could have an alternative syntax:

  DefaultColors <fore> <back>

or

  DefaultColors Colorset <n>

No big deal.  I'd recommend to use 'DefaultColors Colorset 0' as
the default that is set in fvwm.c.  'MiscColors' might have been
a better name.  BTW, the HilightColors command could use the same
enhancement.

To be consistent with the other style commands, this should do exactly
what it would do,  The second should override the first.

If I  had allowed for   this syntax, it should  set  the grid for  the
previously defined iconbox, the one at 200+200,  or any other iconbox.
Looking back, I'm not sure why I didn't go this way.  The only problem
would  be  that  during  style  definition a  "iconbox"   structure is
created.  The  same structure is carried into  the window that matches
as it is created.

Where were you when this patch was first written?  :)

I think you have an improved design that reproduces what the current
syntax accomplishes.

We'd have to keep the current syntax, and add a new one.  (I would not
generate a warning when the old one was used. :) )

Rather than fooling with the syntax, I have a list of things I wish I
had time to create for iconboxes:

1,  A GUI tool that would let you draw a box on the root to outline the 
iconbox area, and give you the command to define the box.
At the same time, I'd like to see and define the grid.  Doing this as
a module would be neat, you could draw it, and then the icons could
move right into it.

2,  Better positioning of the icon in the grid.  To my eyes, the icons
aren't centered in the grid very well.  (At least when you don't have
icons with uniform size.)

3. Scaling or clipping of the icon to fit the grid.

4. Fvwm generated active icons.  That is, the icon is a shrunk image of
the window.  (Someone offered to pay money for this feature a few years
back.)

I don't understand what you mean. gnome_init is a function provided by
Gnome. Maybe you're confusing it with the GNOME_Init function in
fvwm/gnome.c?

I did _not_ know that (especially that its not mentioned anywhere in any
of the man pages :-)  I was under the impression that all those files in
(PREFIX/etc or in the future PREFIX/share) would only be peered at if one
does NOT have a .fvwm2rc file.

In the 'ConfigFvwmDefaults' file it notes the following,

 #  - FvwmDefaults file.  Contains fvwm defaults, and enough to help out
 #  the new user with no configuration file.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and since I already have a configuration file - I thought it shouldn't apply
to me (I guess it really depends on how you read that comment :-)

If it were me, I'd #defined the default styles within fvwm itself (the less
files one has to muck with the better; plus it would make your lives easier
especially if some out there start modifying this "FvwmDefaults" file to suite
their environment and then start reporting bugs that are not evident in
their personal configuration files)

Just my $0.02 worth.

I do this with x3270 and XEmacs (live-icon.el).

The person that wanted to  pay us was interested in  "xv" windows as I
recall.  (I know they could get a similar result by just shrinking the
xv window.)

But if fvwm or an fvwm module did this...

Interesting.

I would prefer not to center the icon in the grid, just to be able to get
the first icon exactly in the specified geometry. But it is not very
important (I mean which default is, centered, right- or left-justified),
because icons must have an uniform size anyway. :-)

I would add:

5. An option saying that Move for icons respects icon box grid, so the
icon can only jump to the next grid cell. Probably MoveStep attribute in
IconBoxes, defaulting to 1, can do this.

Finally, to be honest, Dan, I don't like too much that the icon, which was
moved, is treated specially (has the fixed position). I think it is a
number 53 in fvwm-2.4 todo, moved to done by your suggestion.
Fortunately, 'All (CurrentPage Iconic) RecaptureWindow' fixes the problem.

I'm been playing about with FvwmButtons and I can't get the "Panel" to work
properly.

I tried a couple of approaches (from the man pages) and couldn't get either
to work as expected.

--------
Test #1:
--------
  # Make the menu/panel look like CDE
  Style "FvwmButtonsWinOps" Title, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
  Style "FvwmButtonsWinOps" NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Sticky
 
  *FvwmButtons(Title WinOps, Panel(indicator) FvwmButtonsWinOps \
   "Module FvwmButtons -transientpanel FvwmButtonsWinOps")

  ########## PANEL WinOps
  *FvwmButtonsWinOpsBack bisque2
  *FvwmButtonsWinOpsGeometry -3-3
  *FvwmButtonsWinOpsColumns 1
  *FvwmButtonsWinOps(Title Resize,Icon resize.xpm ,Action Resize)
  *FvwmButtonsWinOps(Title Move  ,Icon arrows2.xpm,Action Move  )
  *FvwmButtonsWinOps(Title Lower ,Icon Down       ,Action Lower )
  *FvwmButtonsWinOps(Title Raise ,Icon Up         ,Action Raise )

Instead of getting ONE button on the main FvwmButtons I get 8 (one per
each line of FvwmButtonsWinOps* and the orig WinOps).  The button titles
are, "WinOps", "WinOpsBack", "WinOpsGeomerty", WinOpsColumns", etc...
The very first "WinOps" button, however, does produce correct results
(ie. it produces a panel when pressed).

The "indicator" arrow (or triangle) was not visible.

I can mail a gif to anyone who is interested..

--------
Test #2
--------
  *FvwmButtons(Icon graphs.xpm, Panel(down, delay 0, steps 16) \
   SubPanel "Module FvwmButtons WinOps")

  ########## PANEL WinOps
  *WinOps(Icon arrows2.xpm, Action Move)
  *WinOps(Icon xcalc.xpm, Action Resize)

In this example I see both the main FvwmButton and the subpanel come-up at
once on a start (or restart) -- in other words, they are both visible at
once without me pressing on anything.

What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks

 1. The iconified window with the longest string title in FvwmWinList
    appears without the right parenthesis ")"

    Note: I get a heap of "new button has no picture" when using WinList
          (left-over debug statements in "ButtonArray.c" ?)

    BTW: Dominik, I'm not using mini icons and the buttons still seem larger
         than they ought to be (if there is anything you want me to mail ya
         in terms of debug, let me know)

 2. As noted in "bugs/comments - 2.3.8";  The window border color in FvwmPager
    is white instead of black (as it is correctly set in 2.2.2) - I'm _not_
    using any colorsets.

      don't necessarily expect a high contrast between the background and

 3. As noted in "bugs/comments - 2.3.8";  The fvwm sticky windows are not

the two attached to this message (the ChangeLog are not in the attached
file but just below).

1. First patch (WLPatch): New options "UseListSkip" & "OnlySkipList" 
to WindowList.

UseListSkip Causes WindowList to add the windows with WindowListSkip 
style to its list of windows (of course it is not a default option).
OnlyListSkip just causes WindowList to only consider the windows with
WindowListSkip style (so it does not work as the other "Only" option,
which is natural).
I think that the OnlyListSkip option is useful.

ChangeLog (fvwm/ChangeLog):

*fvwm/windowlist.c (do_windowList): 
*fvwm/fvwm2.1:
New options UseListSkip and OnlySkipList to WindowList


2. Second Patch (CuPatch): A busy cursor for every body at startup !

It is a 4 lines patch and it causes fvwm to display the watch
cursor at startup even if you use FvwmCpp/M4 (at startup).

ChangeLog (fvwm/ChangeLog):

*fvwm/read.c (ReadFile): Display the watch cursor at startup if 
ReadFile is run via a module (as FvwmM4/Cpp)

This  being fvwm, if  someone wrote "centering",  I'm sure it would be
accompanied by all the possible positioning directions.

For my  own use, I find that  even if I had all  my icons with uniform
size, I want some to have icon titles, and some  don't need them, so I
suppress them.  Program generated icons come in various sizes also.

So, I still don't get my icons positioned that well.

Snap to icon grid.  I can remember some discussion, but not the outcome.

I'm  sorry, I don't know  what you mean by  "fvwm-2.4  todo", but then
I've only been awake a half hour or so.

The way moved icons  hold their place  has been an fvwm "feature" from
before I was involved.  I don't have any use for the feature at all.

I agree; this stickiness I find annoying and useless.  Of course, I
don't move icons much, either.

Does _anyone_ like it?  When is it handy?

I think that the idea of icon boxes must be redesigned to provide answers
for this and the one below questions. Would I only have a time... Anyway,
I will read archives on this topic.

Some time later...

Just to clarify myself, here is what I mean by redesigning icon boxes.
First of all I suggest to rename existing icon boxes to icon areas, which
is less confusing (and avoids name collision with FvwmIconBox module).

Currently, icon boxes (areas) are only used for initial placement, and
nothing else, so one can not do these operation on per icon area basis:
  * swap icons
  * move an icon to an empty cell
  * rearrange icons
  * resort icons
  * move the entire icon area to another place
  * dynamically change grid and fill of icons (current IconGrid, IconFill)
  * change aligning of an icon inside an icon cell (grid)
  * use colorset background instead of root for shaped icons
  * show/hide icon area borders (using a menu item bound to icons)
  * more...

A new FvwmIconArea module can do such things. Unlike other NoIcon modules
it could draw on the root. On the other hand, if icon boxes (areas) will
be moved to a module, what will remain in the core fvwm? And then NoIcon
term is becoming confusing (not what it is not confusing now).

A material for thinking.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	I do, I do. If I go to the trouble to move an icon to a particular
place, it's because I wanted it there and not somewhere else. I don't
want the window manager deciding I'd really like it somewhere else: I
wouldn't.

	I arrange several pages of my desktops this way, with (non-uniform)
icons placed conveniently for the current layout of that page. On
others, I just let the icons fall into an icon box; and in these cases,
I really don't care how the icon box gets arranged or rearranged. That
is, I don't care as long as FVWM doesn't appear to be getting too fussy
about it. I like things to move smoothly when I drag them around, and I
wouldn't want icons jerking from one grid position to the next because I
happened to be within an icon box; but an option for this would be fine.

	This is why I wrote the old RecaptureRemembersIconPositions GlobalOpts
hack a few years ago (haven't yet gotten around to converting it to a
style, so it's still a hack for 2.0.46 on my aged Unofficial Patches
page).

Thanks Bob.  What you  say makes perfect sense.  I  don't have any use
for the feature, but I  imagine if I did  move an icon, it wouldn't be
to adjust its position in the box but to give it a new home.

Seems like a logical patch.


While we are throwing around design ideas instead of coding,
couldn't recapture be improved by making it more atomic?

I don't  know the  code,  but we  seem  to need recapture  in order to
change the appearance  of things, move  icons, change titles, buttons,
borders.

If I just wanted to change the color of a titlebar, I get this flashing
all over the screen.  I wonder if there couldn't be a bunch of types
of recapture like:

Recapture <style> Icons
Recapture <style> Frames 

This might make it easier to create a configuration module where
you could change frame appearance without the whole display going nuts.

The only time I move an icon is if it's obscuring another one.  Then,
after I move it, it's invariably a pain in the rear because it never
moves again and is _always_ covering something up and generally making a
nuisance of itself.  Typically I end up deleting the window out of
frustration :(.

I'd prefer a way to toggle this behavior.

	Hmmm. Interesting idea. Maybe we want to think about a new command,
something like Redecorate or Reconfigure - which, of course, could be
applied to a single window or all of them (or maybe even an ad hoc
grouping of windows...maybe rubber band selectable...ah, go get some
sleep, Bob). And maybe, like you suggest, it should be selectively
applicable to only certain Style features.

	I think the nasty flashing part comes from destroying all the windows
(and their decorations) to reparent them to root, then capturing them
and recreating all their decorations - oh, yes, and remapping all the
windows on desktops other than the current one and then unmapping them
again (wonder if we could eliminate that part of the operation?). I
think the actual redrawing part isn't that big a deal.

	I'm not sure how feasible this is...because what I'm thinking of is
just redrawing decorations rather than destroying and recreating the
window. Certainly some decorations could be treated this way - color
changes, etc. Other things could get pretty convoluted, involving window
resizing, etc.

	Smoother appearance changing would certainly be nice....


Cheers,
Bob

	Well, I was thinking that maybe a new style to control this would be in
order. Of course, then you'd need to do a Recapture to toggle it, and we
have all that flashing...unless we can come up with a smoother way of
realizing style changes than the current Recapture.

	It sounds like you'd generally prefer the behavior to be off, though.
Would controlling it via a style suit you? Or would this be better as a
global option (no Recapture needed in that case, by the way)?

I don't care about recaptures or flashing or anything; I'm never going
to toggle it myself.  What would be the purpose?  Basically I guess I
just don't want to arrange my desktop like that.  So maybe I'm not the
best "customer" to be asking :).

The handy window that pops up in the upper left corner to notify the
user of the current window position/size when moving/resizing a window
does not become active when first selecting a window. It shows up
once the cursor has been moved to indicate a change. However, I found
it useful to see the initial value immediately upon selecting a window
as is done in 2.2.

Starting with version 2.3.8 and present in 2.3.9 is the bug that
after the pop-up window from xbuffy disappears the window focus
is lost and I must click on the background to bring up a fvwm menu
before moving the cursor into an xterm gives me back the ability
to type in the window.

Executing the fvwm Restart command from a fvwm menu results in a coredump
of fvwm2 with gdb indicating a problem in t_splay() and xsession
logging "FVWM2 has been killed by a signal 10", or sometimes signal 11.

I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but when I have a running
version of fvwm2 under xsession and I pull down the "Window Managers"
menu in xsession and select fvwm2 to restart fvwm2, windows in the
bottom set of virtual windows move to the corresponding virtual
window in the upper section, i.e., windows in PSPM move to System but
keep their same relative locations:

*FvwmPagerRows 2
*FvwmPagerColumns 1
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 System
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 PSPM
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8

FvwmPager 0 1

I'd rather not start adding even more 'Recapture' commands because
the 'Style' command sucks.  The right way to fix it is to make all
styles take effect immediately.  In fact I have been pondering this
for quite a while.  It would probably not be too hard to change, but
there is one major question I don't know how to answer:

  Should a changed style apply to all currently matching windows
  or only to those that already matched that style when they were
  created?

I tend to favour the second method since I believe it would more
what the user expects, but on the other hand it's much more difficult
to code.

Bye

If style commands took affect immediately, rather than at add window
time, wouldn't there be a lot more window flashing taking place?

There have been some changes in the default focusing and transient
handling behaviour recently that are probably the cause of what
you are experiencing.  Can you send me your config file please so
I can take a look at what's going on?

This is because there has been a subtle change in how functions invoked
with the mouse work.  With pre 2.3.x versions of fvwm a function like

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
  + "C" Raise
  + "M" Move

Would start moving the window after a certain timeout.  Since there is no
real need to make this decision before the button is released air the
pointer is moved I changed this behaviour.  This is what you see now:
unless you that moving the 'Move' command will not be executed and thus
no geometry window is shown.  To make this work the way is used to you
can add another line to the MoveOrRaise function:

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
  + "C" Raise
  + "M" Move
  + "H" Move

The 'H' stands for 'Hold' and means the action is activated if the
button has been pressed without moving for the time defined by
ClickTime.

Not necessarily.  There should be some mechanism that records that
window styles have changed and that redraws only after fvwm has
finished the current top level command it is executing.  This way
you could even read in a complete file with 'Read' and experience
no flashing at all until after the file has been completely read.
And of course only the changed parts or the changed style(s) should
be applied.

If you could do that, you could make the recapture command obsolete.

I have some Fvwm Functions that call other Fvwm Functions to change
some styles.  The the last thing the functions do is Recapture.

Suppose those same commands were coming from a Module?

Hm.  Is this a real issue or hypothetical?  I can imagine two
situations where this might happen: with FvwmCommand if used
to configure complex styles from the command line and with
FvwmConsole with cut-and-paste.  Before worrying too much about
this I would just write the new style code and see if it really
is an issue or if the additional flashing is hardly noticeable.

If the code can be easily written in a way that allows to update
only the parts of a style that have actually changed this is
no issue at all (well, perhaps performance).

Its a hypothetical module that generates window styles.

The functions are real.

There was introduced MoveThreshold command since 2.2, so if you don't drag
a window fvwm can't decide whether it's Move or Click (if you have both).
Note, MoveThreshold 0 does not solve your problem, fvwm will ignore Click.

I dislike this too, but there is a solution for this problem and I am ok
with it. Put:
 + H Move

into your function and you will get a feedback window immediately
(after ClickTime seconds) as in 2.2.
Generally, you should duplicate all Move triggers (add Hold trigger):
 + M Action
 + H Action

in all your functions if you don't like fvwm waiting.

Mikhael.

This has nothing to do with the MoveThreshold command.  It only made the
previously hardcoded value configurable.

> I dislike this too,

Like it or not - it's not going to change unless you can explain
to me why this automatic timeout is easier to understand or more
usable.  People with clumsy fingers (like me) may really have a
problem with this timeout.  On the other hand you can still get
the behaviour you were used to.

I know this, but it is easier to explain by referring to this command.
BTW, I received your (better) answer immediately after mine.

I don't want it to be changed, I fully understand this defense against
move. I also often move an icon by a mistake (and then it becomes
sticky).

fvwm is wonderful, because it serves opposite tastes. The reason I don't
like the new behaviour is that in fvwm-2.2 the ClickTime was a time
before a click was decided, now it is not. I used to the old behaviour.
Just a matter of taste.

Mikhael.

Writting descriptions for icons is on the todo list. Are these names
really so un-understandable? (I want to fix this.)

I am not sure about "how many people willing to do only one half of the
work". It is very difficult even to compose an icon set from existing
icons, creating is yet more difficult, I think. It is not my purpose to
make creating easier, my purpose is to provide ready icon sets and make
usage easier.

So, if someone describes the design where such split makes the usage
easier, we will discus it. There are more than just 2 groups of icons
here - window manager, software, hardware, filesystem, dialog icons etc.
and they all can be put together (menu, buttons).
So I think the split is not appropriate here unless we restrict a user.

I think this was always an undocumented application of ClickTime. As
far as I can remember the man page stated that it was used for double
clicks, not single clicks (correct me if I'm wrong).

> I used to the old behaviour.  Just a matter of taste.

I hope that only a few people notice it at all.  In my eyes it's a
big improvement, but if somebody relied on the old behaviour it may
annoy him or her.  BTW, can you still remember the uprise when I
changed the menu selection cursor?  I bet nobody notices the new
cursor anymore :-)

I don't have a problem with the names, it's simply that I didn't
ever start about one half of the classes of applications.

I guess the biggest problem with the existing icons is that there are
virtually no complete sets of icons.

Whatever.  I'm sure you spent much more time thinking about this.  I'm
happy if I can ever finish the ten to twenty icons necessary for WM
operations.

Hmm. I remember fussing over this change, mostly because I had always
read the manpage as describing the existing behavior accurately. Hmm,
found this in fvwm2.1, CVS revision 1.1:

    .IP "ClickTime \fIdelay\fP"
    Specifies the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between a button press
    and a button release for the Function built-in to consider the action
    a mouse click.  The default delay is 150 milliseconds.

Anyway, it's no big deal, given that to my way of thinking "H" means
the same thing as "C" used to.

Hi,
    Here's a new potential module, FvwmDragWell.  It is a Xdnd drag well.
The user can send data and the data type
to the module via the SendToModule command, and then drag the data from the
well.  It is useful in conjunction with
FvwmWharf.  The attachment is a tar.gz file.

I've never attached a binary file before, and I'm sending this from a
windows machine, so please let me
know if it doesn't work.
                    Thanks, Doug

I correct you. In fvwm-2.2 a 'M'ove was considered after the ClickTime
seconds, never a 'C'lick.

I always defined all cursor shapes (and later cursor colors).
I use red-on-white left_ptr in most cases if someone worries.
Relying on defaults is a way to be involved in flame wars. :)
I agree with any default, accepted by at least one man (woman?).

At least previously it was not possible to base menustyles on other
menustyle. I wanted to do that instead of copying the whole menu
specification, so here's a patch. Someone should review it before
patching, especially frees. Applies to CVS source updated this morning
(EET).

Tested it like this:

MenuStyle * Foreground White, Background Blue
MenuStyle Foo Foreground Red, Background Black
MenuStyle Bar Foreground Red, Background Black
MenuStyle Bar UseMenuStyle *, Background Green

AddToMenu T1 "T1" Title
+		       "Icons"	      WindowList OnlyIcons, Alphabetic
+		       "All"	      WindowList Alphabetic

AddToMenu T2 "T2" Title
+		       "Icons"	      WindowList OnlyIcons, Alphabetic
+		       "All"	      WindowList Alphabetic

ChangeMenuStyle Foo T1
ChangeMenuStyle Bar T2

Mouse 2	R    	A      	Menu T1
Mouse 3 R	A	Menu T2


1999-10-11  Pekka Marjola  <pema@iki.fi>

       * fvwm/menus.c (NewMenuStyle):
       * fvwm/fvwm2.1:
       Added new option UseManuStyle to MenuStyle command.

Oh well, you can't call your panel (or any other instance of
FvwmButtons) 'FvwmButtonsSomething' because fvwm will notice
that the config lines begin with '*FvwmButtons' and send it
to the original FvwmButtons.  You need to use a different
prefix.

     ^^^^^^^^                     ^^^^^^

You're trying to swallow a window that does not exist.  The correct
line is:

  *FvwmButtons(Icon graphs.xpm, Panel(down, delay 0, steps 16) \
   WinOps "Module FvwmButtons WinOps")

            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uh, oh, you can't simply copy one menu style over the other.  If some
style with allocated memory changes in one of the two styles fvwm
will coredump as soon as the other style is used because it still
accesses the freed memory.  All allocated aread have to be duplicated
in a different memory area.

Hi,
    The attachment should(hopefully) contain some changes to the Wharf
module.  The
attachment should be a tar/gzipped file.  The changes were significant
enough for me
to send the directory itself rather than patches, and the file is named
fvwmWharf2.tar.gz.
The significant changes include:
    Use fvwmlib parsing functions.
    Redid structures to be linked lists instead of arrays.
    Commented/Rearranged code.
    Added Xdnd support.
    Added file browsing script that uses Xdnd.

Subject: FvwmWinList & iconified windows

Full_Name: Nadim Saeed
Version: 2.3.9
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
X_Server: exceed 6.1.0.0
Submission from: (NULL) (207.137.158.177)


The iconified window with the longest string title in FvwmWinList appears
without the right parenthesis ")"

Note: I get a heap of "new button has no picture" when using WinList
      (left-over debug statements in "ButtonArray.c" ?)

BTW: Dominik, I'm not using mini icons and the buttons still seem larger
     than they ought to be (if there is anything you want me to mail ya
     in terms of debug, let me know)  This related to bug IDs 86 & 266

The examples in FvwmButtons' manpage need to be modified then (what I have
noted above is straight out of "FvwmButtons.1")

The window border color in FvwmPager is white instead of black (as it is
correctly set in 2.2.2) - I'm _not_ using any colorsets.

 Tim Phipps <tim@quadrics.com> on Tue, 28 Sep 1999 14:54:37 wrote:
 "The window borders were changes as part of putting colorsets in. The
  color is no longer fixed at black but is the same as the text color."

 "I'm not sure that is the correct thing to do. Usually the border colour

  The contrast between text and background is usually high, but you
  don't necessarily expect a high contrast between the background and
  the border. Shouldn't the shadow colour be used instead ?"


The fvwm sticky windows are not green-colored (as in 2.2.2 - in my
config file), instead they're blue.

The "indicator" panel option is not very versatile.  For example, I'm
unable to
use a title, icon and indicator all at the same time.  From what I've
noticed, 
it seems as though the indicator is drawn in the middle of the button
which
precludes the ability to also include an icon (pixmap) and/or a title
since
those options will also be drawn right smack in the middle of the button.

I'd like to be able to:

*FvwmButtons(Title Size, \
             Icon size.xpm, \
             Panel(indicator 20, down, delay 0, steps 16) \
             Panel1 "Module FvwmButtons Panel1")
*Panel1(Icon resize.xpm, Action Resize)
*Panel1(Icon move.xpm, Action Move)


A couple of suggestions,

 1. Give the user the option to specify where the indicator should reside
    within the button.  "right/left/top/bottom"
    Something along the lines,

    Panel(indicator 30 bottom)
                    ^^
                    Size as it exists today

    Panel(indicator right)
     +-------+
     |       |
     |  pix  |  <-- icon (pixmap)
     |       |
     | title |  <-- title
     |       |
     |   v   |  <-- indicator (at bottom)
     +-------+

 2. The whole idea behind the "indicator" was to /indicate/ or show that a
    panel exists there-in.  The arrow is nice, but not absolutely
necessary.
    I was initially thinking about a pixmaped arrow (such as the one in
    Netscape's Back/Forward buttons) that would be _very_ small and could
be
    added at no further button-area expense (an overlay if you will).

    To possibly simplify life (and this is a mere suggestion :-), one
could
    come up with a much simpler indicator (such as a solid line or a group
    of lines - kinda like the sticky window style) that would indicate
that
    there is a panel.  That indicator would reside on the side of the
button
    (right/left/top/bottom) in the same direction that the panel would
appear.

     +-------+
     |       |
     |  pix  |  <-- icon (pixmap)
     |       |
     | title |  <-- title
     |       |
     |-------|  <-- indicator (at bottom)
     +-------+

Alas, the ability to use all three (title, icon & indicator) options
within
FvwmButtons should be possible.

86 is in "fixed" and 266 is in "enh. done".

You can easily search for a particular bug by entering it in the
"Message ID:" field and hitting RET.  Then the folder contents at right
will be recalculated for just the bugs that match that search (in this
case, just one).

It'd be nice if Jitterbug was enhanced to realize only one bug matched,
and just display the details about it instead if making you click on
it... oh well.

Hah, you thought you could fool me :-)  No, your windows are *not*
blue, they are as green as ever.  If you use xmag on the mini
windows in the pager and you will see it.  They only appear cyan
because the border is blue and the windows are small.  So I guess
you problem breaks down to that you want blue/white titles but
a black border in the pager (which currently seems not to be
possible).

I just downloaded and compiled 2.3.9, and I'm getting behavior that's
erratic at best.  In no instance was I able to get a usable configuration.

I tried versions back to 2.3.6, and all were getting hundreds of internal
errors, and either freezing or crashing.

I finally tried running with -s, and everything works just fine now, except
that I only have it running on one screen.

I haven't tried paring down my .fvwmrc yet, though I did eliminate the
possibility of external programs screwing things up.

This is also on Solaris 8, if that makes any difference.

Let me know if there's any way I can help debug this.

Thanks,
Danek

Unfortunately none of the developers has a mutiheaded setup.
You are not the first one who reported this.  Perhaps we will
see something if you post the first few errors you get.
Otherwise we'd greatly appreciate if you try to debug this (I
guess from your description that the error occurs very early
in fvwm startup, so you should start looking in fvwm.c).  Can
you find out the first version that shows the problem?

Usually a whole bunch of

    [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
    [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 20, Error 17, EventType: 0

The Request / Error numbers changed; here's the complete list:

    [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 0, Error 1, EventType: 0
    [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 119, Error 1, EventType: 0

I can put the whole files up on my website if you think they'd be of any
interest.

It didn't seem to be doing it in a consistent place.  Usually it would
finish parsing the rc file, but not always.  Sometimes it would start
parsing the file again (presumably the second instance of fvwm).

Somewhere between 2.2 and 2.3.6.  I didn't have the time to narrow it down
further.  I'll try 2.2.2 to make sure it didn't get introduced there.
There don't seem to be any versions, either released or snaps, between
those two, on ftp.fvwm.org.  I could use CVS to bundle up intermediate
snaps, but my multihead machine doesn't have gcc.  :-/

Oh, BTW -- IconMan, IconBox, and WinList all have fvwm_msg(DBG, ...) in
them, which will neither compile nor link.  I think one of your recent
putbacks took it out of WinList, but not the others.

Thanks,
Danek

Using the shadow color would be quite a lot of extra code, would just
using black like the old versions be OK?

I think it is.  It's much to complicated to code to be worthwhile.

I think we have a problem with our next releases at the moment.

 1) I can't build the 2.2.3 release because my C++ installation
    doesn't pass configure's tests (I posted a question a week
    ago but obvoiusly nobody knows what's going on).  If I can't
    get this running I need a volunteer to build 2.2.3
    (with --enable-extras).  Just in case nodoby noticed my mail,
    here is the error from config.log again:

      configure:1943: checking whether the C++ compiler (c++  ) works
      configure:1959: c++ -o conftest    conftest.C  1>&5
      /usr/i486-linux/bin/ld: cannot open crtbegin.o: No such file or directory
      configure: failed program was:

      #line 1954 "configure"
      #include "confdefs.h"

      int main(){return(0);}


 2) We can't guarantee that further releases work because of these
    autogenerated files in FvwmScript.  The problem is that on my
    machine these are built every time I compile, but then CVS
    complains about the new files and refuses to check out the old
    copies from CVS.  In the end, the releases I build do not
    match the tagged code in CVS.  I'm sure that will cause trouble
    soon.  Any ideas what can be done about this problem?  I think
    this is a showstopper for 2.4.

Well, I could if SuSE hadn't removed XNest from their distribution :-(
And since they removed the X sources too I hesitate to compile X
myself.

Sorry, can't help, my C++ is also broken.

If we remove the autogenerate files we force everyone to rebuild them. 
I think we are in for problems if this happens: there were a few reports
of lex failing. I would prefer to include the generated files and have a
method of not generating them.  They only need to be generated once by
the person that modifies the lex and yacc files (correct me if I'm
wrong) so a method of excluding the .y and .l files from
automake/autoconf might work.

Maybe just removing the .l and .y from FvwmScript_SOURCES, adding them
as EXTRA_DIST files and including a Makefile.lex would be a solution. It
would only be needed when changing the script language.

Cheers,
Tim.

I thought that --enable-extras was obsolete, right ?

I didn't update my tree since quite a long time, I'll do it
and see if my C++ environment works fine. It's not really gonna
help you anyway, since I'm using SGI Irix CC... :-)

At least we'll see if it's broken all over the place or just
with gcc.

Right.  But you may not have noticed that I'm talking about 2.2.3,
I.e. a new bug fixing release in the stable 2.2.x series.  And in
2.2.x the --enable-extras is still necessary to build a release.

I think we should leave this until after 2.4 and then split Style into
several
different commands and get rid of Recapture altogether.  It seem like
Style has grown to be an enormous command that has no clear definition.
The name is vague which doesn't help.

It feels like it wants to be split into two new window-name matching
commands and several standalone commands. What I'm thinking of is:

1) InitialState <pattern> options
where options controls the state of a window when created, things like
StartIconic, SkipMapping. These would just be a way of overriding the
default state of a window at startup or the behaviour of fvwm when a
window is mapped.

2) Appearance <pattern> options
This would affect the look of windows: things like BorderWidth,
Title/NoTitle

n) lots of new commands for setting state in run time: things like
WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip, Sticky (already exists). This could be
lots of new commands or one with lots of options (ChangeState
CirculateSkip). Applying to windows based on name/class could be done
with the All command.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Tim.

PS the thing that really hacks me off about Recapture is that it sets
the sticky flag according to the style and ignores its current setting.

Whatever the solution could be (I can be no help here), I wonder
why this worked before.  There must be some vital difference
between the files in CVS and the former versions.  I never had to
built the offending files before and I never had a conflict when
checking out.

I just noticed that .cvsignore listed the files that are causing
trouble.  Try an update and see if it has gone away.

Hi Dominik,

I think you have the same problem I got a few weeks ago. You may want to
edit the file /usr/lib/gcc-lib/...../specs. There you should add the full
path to crtbegin.o.

Can't we remove the C++ check from the 2.2.3 release as well?  I thought
the only module that needed it was removed from 2.2.x already?

Your C++ compiler is mis-installed; that file (crtbegin.o) is supposed
to be installed in the /usr/lib/gcc-lib/.... directory for your
compiler.  If "c++" can't find it but "gcc" can, that means they're
different versions or something.

Do this:

  $ touch conftest.C
  $ c++ -v -o conftest conftest.C

It'll probably give you an error message during the link, but the -v
option will show you the directories it's looking at for everything.

Sounds like you need to reinstall your C++ compiler.

It is strange that this used to work and doesn't anymore, but Tim's
solution is simple.

_Don't_ create a new makefile, though.

Just add a new rule into the existing Makefile.am that doesn't get
invoked "normally", like:

  .PHONY: buildparser
  buildparser:
            $(LEX) ...
            $(YACC) ...

or whatever.  Now those commands will be run only when you say "make
buildparser".

Sorry - it relates (actually its the same bug) to the following emails,

 http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9909/msg00663.html
 http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9909/msg00698.html

in which I attached screen-shots and my .fvwm2rc file

Let me know if you need any other pieces.

I feel like an idiot, for not being able to figure this out.

I got the binaries for gcc from the sunfreeware site. (very handy site 
by the way).  I also installed XPM (both of them are in the default 
locations in /usr/local).

The problem is it isn't finding XPM.  I've tried setting the --with-xpm-
* settings set, but none of them seem to change anything.

The configure error log indicates that it is finding the XPM.h file, but 
is not able to determine the correct version.  Unfortunately, it 
doesn't seem to print out any error message (like incompatable 
headers, or whatever).  It just says "no" at the bottom of the 
configure output.

Any ideas???

Mike

Not until you provide some details.  Exactly what flags are you trying
to give to configure?  Where exactly are the xpm.h and libxpm.a files
installed?  What version of FVWM are you trying to build?

Look in the config.log file and search for "xpm" and you should see
something there about what exactly went wrong.

OK, the latter is likely incorrect.  Typically you don't put the "/X11"
on the end.  X header files are always #included as <X11/foo.h> so you
don't want the X11 in the -I option.

Use:

  --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/lib/X11 --with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/include

  >> Where exactly are the xpm.h and libxpm.a files

  mk> /usr/local/include/X11/xpm.h
  mk> /usr/local/lib/libXpm.a
  mk> /usr/local/lib/X11/libXpm.a

Weird.  Why do you have two copies of xmp.h and libXpm.a?  That's just
asking for trouble, esp. if they're different versions :-/.

Did you copy them?  Maybe they're left over from some old version?

Anyway, you _don't_ want the ones in /usr/local/include and
/user/local/lib; you _do_ want the ones in /usr/local/include/X11 and
/usr/local/lib/X11 (actually, the /usr/local/lib vs. /usr/local/lib/X11
is up to you; whichever you prefer--but definitely you need the header
in /usr/local/include/X11).

It doesn't print anything else?  Interesting.

Well, I see the compile line has this:

  ... -I/usr/local/include/X11  -I/usr/openwin/include ...

Since it won't find X11/xpm.h in /usr/local/include/X11, it's probably
the case that you have an old, crusty version of X11/xpm.h in
/usr/openwin/include, and that's what the configure test is using.

Try the above configure flags and see if that works.

I deleted the ones in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib.

I did a find . -name "xpm.h" -print in the /usr/openwin directory, and 
got nothing.

I got exactly the same behavior.

I also tried copying and pasting the code that is in the configure 
log, and running it.  I got an error saying it couldn't load libXpm.so.

So I modified my LD_LIBRARY_PATH to contain the 
/usr/local/lib/X11 path.  

This seemed to fix it.

2 comments.

1) Do we need to set this?  I would hope that making this is 
independent of any user shell settings?  Or am I doing something 
elsse wrong, and this was just an akward fix.

2) I think there should be a better error message when it fails (it 
didn't display any message in the config.log file), but when I ran it 
standalone, it gave a clear message.  I'm not sure if this is 
configurable, or something difficult to change because its related to 
configure.


Thaks for your help.  I knew this would be a stupid user problem.

Mike

Okay...I'm not quite done being stupid.  I do a make, and 
everything compiles just fine.  I su to root, and do a make install, 
and I get an error with FvwmTalk that aborts the remainder of the 
install.

The error is :

Making install in FvwmForm
echo "#!/bin/sh" > FvwmTalk
sh: FvwmTalk: cannot create

It makes just fine on the construction.  I am root, and this is a local 
file system, so I would think that this isn't a permission problem.  If 
you look in the FvwmForm directory, ther eis a FvwmTalk that 
contains a 2 line bourne shell script.  

There is plenty of disk space.  The target seems to be 
/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.8/  There are other files there, but no 
FvwmTalk.

Ideas?

Maybe there is some environment variables that need to be set to 
do a make install??

Thanks,
Mike

Oh.  That old bugaboo.  You didn't say you had a shared lib version of
libXpm... I should have remembered to ask.  You're using Solaris?
Obviously.

Well, on Solaris there's a little fun fact that -L options to the linker
are _not_ automatically added to the runtime linker path (the thing that
looks for .so's when you run a program).

You have to explicitly add -R... for each -L... to get that.  Tres
annoying, and autoconf is not smart enough to handle this situation.

So, you have to do something like this (note: sh syntax!):

  $ LDFLAGS=-R/usr/local/lib/X11 ./configure ....

so that the makefile will put -R/usr/local/lib/X11 on the link line and
the runtime linker can find the shared library.

It's ultimately an autoconf bug: they should DTRT here.  However, I
don't see any signs that they're moving to fix it on the autoconf list.
I'm not sure, myself, what we (FVWM) can/should do about this; I believe
we document this in INSTALL.fvwm... yes, I see it there.  Let me know if
this could be made clearer.

This is basic to configure, unfortunately.  Unless we rewrite the macro
from scratch I don't think there's any way to discover this particular
problem.  The output is thrown out at a low level.

Its a little strange, but the rules to create the 2 line
script in the build directory run during both make and make install.

I can't imagine why you can't write over the file as root, if
you are root on the file system that FvwmTalk is being written to.

Note that its first written in the build area and then installed
in the installation area, so you have to have permissions in both
areas.

This comes from my Gnome patch to FvwmGtk, but it didn't happen to me.
I downloaded
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-19991008.tar.gz
but it doesn't even have the Gnome patch applied, so I suppose this isn't
what you're referring to. Where can I find these snapshots so I can take a
look at the problem?

When the snapshot won't build, it doesn't get placed on the FTP site so the
last one available is the last one that built correctly.  There's no way to
download a snapshot that doesn't build.

Thanks for the hint.  Seems that my c++ compiler is egcs while my
c compiler is gcc.  Hm, I bet if I install the egcs package too
this will work again.

Okay, I just updated from CVS, made a snapshot, and built it with and

Hello,

In module_interface.c (executeModuleSync) there is no
return after "KillModule(pipe_slot, 10);" this seems quite
strange (sorry if a misunderstand something).

Also it will be good, I think, if we can Escape from
this function as with the Wait function with Ctrl-Alt-Escape
(I have tried to implement this but not succed :o(). Ok, there
is the Timeout option but ...

Note that it does not seems that there is documentation for
Ctrl-Alt-Escape in the Wait doc. For that this key sequence
works better it will be good to add to the  default key bindings: 
Key Escape A MC Nop. (I can do that ....)

Yeah, that was it. Here's a patch that allows it to build even without

Since you are running in Xnest you won't mind if fvwm core dumps.  If
you change the error handler to dump core and run fvwm with -debug (so
it runs synchronously) you should be able to see where the X errors come
originate.

Since there's no relevant code behind the KillModule it
doesn't really matter.  And flushing the queues if the module
is already down won't hurt either.

Be very careful here.  You *must not* handle X events in this
functions with fvwm's standard evevent handler (My_XNextEvent()
and DispatchEvent() functions).

Is it possible to use XCheckMaskEvent or XCheckType Event to look for
key presses without losing other events? I suppose this might mean that
fvwm would eat all key presses when waiting for a synchronous module.

If you do implement this could the abort key be configurable (and the
one in the wait_func too). I can't use ctrl-Esc, WindowsNT grabs it and
it doesn't even get to the X server.

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes I know that and it is the problem for me, because if not I
will be able to "copy" the wait_func :o)

Yes, I tried to use XCheckMaskEvent (with "all" the Key Mask) but I
begin
with XEvent and that did not work ... will try again. 
Note that at the present time during executeModuleSync the key presses
are catched by the window with the focus ! Maybe we have to grab
something.
However, "Mouse" events are freezed.

If I succeed to solve this exercise I may try to solve this one to :o),
but I am quite pessimistic with the first ...

I did this and it works but it doesn't generate the rules to get the .c
from the .l or .y.  I managed to get it working by copying and old
Makeilfe but I guess this is not very portable since other lexs and
yaccs may behave differently. I currently have:

.PHONY: buildparser

buildparser:
        $(LEX) $(AM_LFLAGS) $(LFLAGS) scanner.l && mv lex.yy.c scanner.c
        $(YACC) $(AM_YFLAGS) $(YFLAGS) script.y && mv y.tab.c script.c
        if test -f y.tab.h; then \
        if cmp -s y.tab.h script.h; then rm -f y.tab.h; else mv y.tab.h
script.h; fi; \
        else :; fi

Is there a way to get automake/autoconf to generate the make rules?

Cheers,
Tim.

OK, I understand how executeModuleSync work now. If we want to
escape from a possible infinite block it needs to be written 
differently.
Sorry to e-mail before thinking at least 7 times (not the first
time I do that ...).

Oh, I don't need to force a coredump to figure this out.  I already
found the place with ddd:

I.e. It coredumps when handling the first line from the RC defaults
in fvwm.c.  But I can't figure out why.  Surely a 'XParseColor'
shouldn't show such weird behaviour.  There must be more to this.

In the mean time I could narrow down the time when this bug was
introduced to a single day:

With

  cvs -z3 checkout -P -D "2 Jul 1999 12:00" -d fvwm-02-jul-1999

everything is okay, but the CVS from the next day has the bug:

  cvs -z3 checkout -P -D "3 Jul 1999 12:00" -d fvwm-03-jul-1999

Now, if somebody can tell me the cvs command to list all commit
messages between these two points in time...

Bye

Please speak what you have in mind.  Where do you see a potentially
infinite loop?

cvs diff -D "2 Jul 1999 12:00" -D "3 Jul 1999 12:00"

This gives quite a big diff (mostly me I'm afraid). I think these
changes includes making fvwm use the fvwmlib GetColor and moving some
Scr.things to globals in libs/Picture.c (Pcmap, Pdepth etc. ). Maybe the
initialisation of the picture library is happening in the wrong place
(too early) and the second head fvwm is using the first head globals?

Cheers,
Tim.

In the current cvs I am uneable to produce an infinite loop ;)
However, If you have an non-supported module that you start with
ModuleSync without timout and which never respond you've got
an infinite loop I presume since select is run with a NULL timeout.
So, it is probably not needed to rewrite executeModuleSync and
my first Event exercice is finish !

But it is not that that I have in mind ... I work on a general "Busy
Cursor" patch which displays a busy cursor when fvwm goes into a freeze
procedure which can take some times (as Read, PipeRead, Wait (not really
a freeze place but one may want to see that he waits something),
ModuleSync,
Recapture (allready implemented but not configurable, may cause a bad
interconnection with menu via dynamicpopuaction)). EveryThing
configurable 
with a command like: BusyCursor Option bool, ...
It allready work on my machine and it is real pretty in the case of 
a dynamicpopuaction that read long menu config (as the /dev directory 
or the gnome menu). All this leads me to try to see where there is
potential long loop.

If you think it is a bad idea say me now so I will not write the doc
(and
revert the patch on my machine).

The error messages are gone.  fvwm starts on the first screen
of Xnest without a problem now.  On the second screen it seems
to be hanging with the watch cursor.  I get the same with
2.2 however.

That's it right there.  I am doing the make as "me."  "Me" has a 
home account NFS mounted on another machine.  Once I build it, I 
am su-ing to root, and running make install.  root has access to 
the installation directory, but not to write to the "Me" account on 
another machine.

I think that a make install (assuming that make has successfully 
run), should NEVER write to the file system of the source directory.

Thanks for all your help.  I seem to have it running just fine.  My 
next project will be to try to get gnome running too :-)

I agree, this is definitely a no-no.

Can you submit a bug report on it, so we won't forget to fix it before

The basic bug is that make install should not write to the file system.
This causes problems for those who compile as a normal user on an NFS
drive,
and then su to root on a local machine to install.  If make install
writes to the src directory structure, root may not have permissions
on the remote NFS file system.  

Currently it seems to write to the file system for the FvwmTalk sh script.

The final message in the thread is below..

Hello,

Is it possible to prevent the coordinates in the upper left hand corner
from showing up? It would be nice if there were an fvwm2 option for
doing this.

Also, I have an entry that looks like this in my .fvwm2rc file
but each time I log in with xdm and fvwm2 starts the xconsole is still
there.

AddToFunc InitFunction "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xset b off
# Why is this not working?
+                      "I" Exec /usr/bin/killall xconsole
# The following line is only good if you run Fvwm locally.
+                      "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xhost + > /dev/null
+                      "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xclock -geometry 50x50-0+0
-bw 0
+                      "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -geometry 28x3+123+0
-T "Date" -fg white -bg black -cr black -fn fixed +sb +ls -e /bin/sh -c
"(echo; /bin/date; /bin/sleep 6)"
+                      "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -geometry 80x24+123+51
-T `/bin/hostname` -fg white -bg black -cr gray84 -fn fixed -sb -sl 4096

Thanks,

Neil

The behaviour in question is not just in FvwmForm, its also in FvwmTile
and FvwmCascade, and in the utils directory in fvwmbug.sh.

This is when part of the change was introduced:

Wed Apr 28 20:45:51 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* FvwmRearrange/Makefile.am (FvwmCascade):
	* FvwmRearrange/Makefile.am (FvwmTile):
	* FvwmForm/Makefile.am (FvwmTalk): force generation each time.

If I understand why Steve added a dependency on "FORCE", wouldn't
making the dependency on "Makefile" work even better?

I think a patch that would show when fvwm was busy would be a good change.

Hello,

It would be *REALLY* nice if it were possible to pass arguments to

AddToFunc from within a .fvwm2rc script.

Thanks,

Neil

I have never used xdm, but after looking at xdm man page and xdm default
files it seems that xconsole is started from /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 .

xsession is probably started as root or (another explanation) probably
started in parallel with fvwm and in fact after fvwm's InitFunction.

Try to specify another Xsetup file for xdm or edit /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0,
so xconsole is not started.

Mikhael.

$ cat /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0
#!/bin/sh
# $XConsortium: Xsetup_0,v 1.3 93/09/28 14:30:31 gildea Exp $

/usr/X11R6/bin/xbanner

Thanks but unfortunately I am not root so I cannot change this file.

I could if I were root, but I'm not.

Are there any non-root alternative solutions?

I too think it would be nice to have.  But I am a bit concerned
that this may become a rich source of bugs.  I tried to code this
busy-cursor-on-startup stuff once and failed miserably because
there are so many things to carefully consider.  Don't let this
discourage you, though.

What if you use StartsOnDesk or StartIconic styles for xconsole or other
tricks to hide xconsole window?

I believe I already use StartIconic but since my pager is StaysOnBottom
I end up with the xconsole under the pager. Plus, I'm not interested in
running xconsole anyway and I just want to get rid of it.

What do you have in mind?  Something like this?

  AddToFunc $0
  + I ...

Nothing prevents you from writing a complex function that calls
AddToFunc:

  AddToFunc MyAddToFunc
  + I AddToFunc $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

Is this what you mean?

You should really write mor detailed bug reports than 'it does not work'.
When and how do you set the StaysOnBottom style for FvwmButtons (in
the config file or at run time?) What is the exact line you use?
Are there any other 'StaysOn...' or 'Layer' style lines in your
config file?  With which command do you restart fvwm?  If you send
me your config file I will look at it and see if I can find the
error.

Precisely.

Just to get me started with a simple example, how do I run a function that 
passes an IP address to ftp and runs it within an xterm?

Yes, this is what I want, but is the $0 $1 $2 ... $argv , etc...
functionality already built in AddToFunc?
If it were then Fvwm2 would be many orders of magnitude more powerful
than I thought it was!

Open ConfigFvwmSetup, search for FuncFvwmRloginXterm and similar.
There are many examples for such functions in the fvwm manpage too.

  AddTuFunc my_ftp_func
  + I xterm -e ftp $0

The call it with 

  my_ftp_func 192.168.1.2

It's not built into AddToFunc but into all complex functions in
fvwm.  These are defined with the 'AddToFunc' command.  Whenever
you call a function defined in this way you can pass up to ten
command line arguments.  Whereever a $0...$9 appears in the commands
of the function it is replaced with the corresponding argument.
You can find a few examples in the man page.

It's a bug of xmms.  It usually happens when shading or unshading the
xmms window.  I have reported this to the xmms developers months ago
but never got any feedback.  It means that the window requests
a maximum height of 0 pixels, which is obviously nonsense.

Would you report this to the xmms team again?

I think the bug has been fixed, and he just needs to upgrade. I'm using
xmms 0.9.5.1 with no problems.

Are these features new in Fvwm 2.3?

I remember asking whether it was possible to embed scripts in fvwm and
someone replied saying it was not possible. It is starting to seem to me 
that it is possible.

Thanks,

Neil

I'm not sure where these get installed, but you can find it in
the source tree:

  fvwm/ConfigFvwmSetup

No.

You were asking about *shell scripts* back then.  The reason why we don't
want to support this is that the functionality is already there.  For
example you can let fvwm parse the output of a shell command with the
'PipeRead' command:

  Piperead shell_command

Okay, I see the bug with your config file.  There was a problem in the
session management code (fixed now).

Some comments on your config file:

You don't need to explicitly kill modules when fvwm exits or restarts.
They can't survive a restart anyway.

> Module FvwmButtons PagerButton
...
> Module FvwmButtons

You shouldn't start modules from the .fvwm2rc file.  The right place to
start them is in your InitFunc and RestartFunc.

With the latest changes I made with style flags, the modules need to
be rebuilt.  You may get strange effects if you don't.  BTW, it
seems that the module dependencies do not include the file
window_flags.h.

I don't have a problem with this. The modules that include the file get
rebuilt when it is modified (these are FvwmGtk, FvwmIconBox,
FvwmIconMan, FvwmPager, FvwmRearrange, FvwmTaskBar & FvwmWinList). The
other modules don't use the file.

Some of the modules that don't use the file are suprising: FvwmDebug,
FvwmIdent, FvwmSave & FvwmSaveDesk (are these last two useful any more,
they seem to be only partially succesful and session management is
someone else's problem).

Cheers,
Tim.

It should be simple to check for this in the parser; I wonder if this is
worth generating a warning about?

What is the problem with having modules being started by reading in a
file?  The long pause at startup problem has been fixed for a while now
(fvwm now only waits for modules started by command line arguments to
finish before running InitFunction).

Cheers,
Tim.

Yikes, that is some _bad_ grammar there :)

It looks like the linker thinks there is a global symbol "point" in both
the libstroke library and in events.o

But I can't find one in events.c, or indeed anywhere else in the fvwm
exe directory.

There is a bug in FvwmForm.
When the length of an entry box is longer than its displayed width and
I type in it past the width of the box then the ASCII characters I
type turn into funny characters.

It would also be nice if FvwmForm were made compatible with gpm, the
cut and paste utility for Linux.

Thanks,

Neil

I don't know how to reproduce the bug, so this bug might be untrackable.
I start xscreensaver, leave the workstation for the night, and by morning
it is back to xdm login.  Here is (I believe) the relevant portion from 
.xsession-errors:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 54, Error 4, EventType: 18
/usr/local/bin/xscreensaver-command: activating.
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

>From this log, and from the fact that this never happens during the day
while I'm using the machine, I think the problem is interaction between
xscreensaver and fvwm.

One other note that might be of interest is that I'm running dual-headed,
and never saw this problem before adding the second monitor.  I tried
upgrading to the 19990906 snapshot to see if that would solve the problem,
but it first wouldn't even start dual-headed.  I gave it the "-s" option,
but then modules wouldn't work, so I gave up.

Hi,

I have been configuring my ~/.fvwm2rc file. I thought the bug had disappeared
until I lowered my window and restarted fvwm2. Upon restart the buttonboxes
were placed above my window. I had to click on them for them to get lowered.

Here is my .fvwm2rc file.

Best Regards,

Neil

Hi,

I was trying the newest CVS version tonight when I thought I'd
make a patch for the WindowList function so that it works the
way I would like it to do. I've added this as an option
'NoGeometryWithInfo', that does the same thing as 'NoGeometry',
but also shows information about which virtual screen each
window is positioned on, and if the window is iconified or not.

If you are intent on create a 2.2.3 release,  I'd suggest
removing all the web docs.

Has fvwm put-on a few pounds :-)  I'm seeing a slightly larger resident
memory footprint.

Is anyone tracking this ?

The problem is that the style the new window gets depends on
if all the applicable styles have been defined before the window
finally maps.  This has nothing to do with modules alone though.

Can you imagine my headaches when I *wrote* this stuff :-)  In general when
you see array bound problems in Parse.c it's almost guaranteed to come
from the memory that is parsed, not from Parse.c itself (because the stuff
in Parse.c has been tested a million times).

This one looks strange.  From where in fvwm is it called?

If you chase the function calls above you will see that SkipSpaces simply
spooled over the end of the allocated area (that comes from the call to
GetNextToken).  Since it read only one byte past the end this probably
means that no memory had been allocated for the final zero.  The error must
be in ReadDecorFace or ReadTitleButton (which sounds very likely since I
rewrote part of the code recently).

Another one where you can't see from where it's called :(

That's the price of progress :-) With all the new features I wouldn't
be surprised if it grew a bit.  Anyway, you can't rely on the output
of 'top' anyway.  It definitely doesn't display the real memory
consumption.

Its a UMR in XOpenDisplay called from line 348 in fvwm.c.

There's all kinds of UMRs in X, Motif, just about anything I've
run into.  There not worth worrying about.

One question: did you check that the allocated memory is still big
enough to hold the string?

Please write a patch for the man page for this option too.

Okay, I'm not sure if I already informed you that the dual-head bug is
fixed since yesterday.  You should be able to fetch a current snapshot now.
I can't remember what we tried when you first reported this, but did
you find a coredump somewhere?  The error message above doesn't cause
fvwm to exit.  If there is a coredump, please see where it's crashed
(run 'gdb fvwm2 core' and then type 'where' at the gdb prompt; you may
have to provide a path to the sources).

	This may sound a bit confusing. Maybe we should say something like "you
shouldn't start modules in open code - do it in a function" - the
InitFunc and RestartFunc are also part of the .fvwm2rc file
(conceptually, at least).

	I suppose it's not usually a problem, but suppose I use FvwmConsole to
enter the command "Read .fvwm2rc" to reload my entire config without
doing a Restart. In this case I don't want a bunch of extra modules
started up.

I'd rather not change this in a simple bug fixing release.
I noticed that the file version.html was present in the
2.2 tarball but is gone in the 2.2.2 tarball.  The Makefile.am
of 2.2.3 still includes this file while the one in 2.2.2 does
not.  Probably a remnant of the screwed up commit a while ago.

Brad, can you find single out an example (Add)TitleStyle or (Add)ButtonStyle
line in your config file that shows the problem?

Did you cut some things out of the common symbol list?
If ButtonWindow is only 4 bytes, did init_fdset get to be 28 bytes beyond
due to some kind of quadruple word alignment?

I tried to figure out what in events.c could be 12 bytes long.
Apparently it is not called "point", unless its thru some macro.
It might be worthwhile looking at the preprocessor output.

It does seem to be sitting right behind "init_fdset" but I'm asking
about you cutting things out of the list, because the compiler doesn't
seem to be laying things out in the order encountered.

OS: SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2

I think there is a geometry calculation bug within FvwmWinList.  I've
also,
after multiple hours of trial and error, have a sure-fire way of making
WinList fail.

Here are the relevant parts of my .fvwm2rc file:

###
# FvwmWinList
#
*FvwmWinListBack Gray59
*FvwmWinListFore Yellow
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise, Focus, WarpToWindow 50 50
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, move
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListFocusFore Aquamarine
*FvwmWinListDontDepressFocus


Here's how to make WinList fail:
 1. Make sure you are in Desk-0, Page-0
 2. start winlist
 3. start an xterm
 4. go to any other page within the same Desk
 5. press mourebutton-3 on the xterm button in winlist
 6. place the xterm anywhere on that page
 4. repeat step 4-6; at least four-eight times
 5. FvwmWinList will crash (fvwm does not note any error messages !!)

The reason I think there is a geometry problem can be clearly demonstrated
if one were to inject an "iconify the xterm" between step-3 and step-4
above.  After pressing mouse-button-3 note the feedback windows numbers
(something along the lines "-328 +608388")

After the crash, if I were to restart FvwmWinList I get even stranger
behavior (which leads me to believe that the crashed WinList kept some
state that the newly created WinList latched onto).  Alas make sure to
start a _new_ fvwm on each try (not restart).

I've also noticed instances in which if I were to de-iconify an xterm, it
would deiconify on the wrong page with a placement geometry of +0+0 _AND_
it would not show-up on the FvwmPager unless I change pages (I'll try to
recreate this failure later).

Subject: Icon position after Restart

Full_Name: Stuart Anderson
Version: 2.3.9
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.6
X_Server: Openwin
Submission from: (NULL) (131.215.115.246)


When I restart fvwm2, some of my icons move to the upper left hand corner
of the window, but immediately move to their former positions as soon as
the cursor is dragged over them. The two that I have found that do
this so far are both old Sun programs:
contool
cm (calendar manager)

It is also interesting that Identify does not work on either of these
icons (though it does work on the full un-iconified windows).

For that matter Identify doesn't seem to work on some other icons
either: xmcd, yrolo, but it does work on others like xsession.

Contool again! It must be doing something strange with its icons.
Does any of my fellow developers have access to one of these to debug
this problem?

Is one of these free software?

No. I just omitted the symols after 'point'

I've no idea.

I have grep'ed ofer the whole sources in fvwm and libs and there
is only only occurence of the name 'point' in a local constant
variable in Graphics.c.  Although this can hardly be related to
this message, I renamed it, but that didn't help.

I've attached the complete output of 'ld -M events.o'.  Note that
I get tons of unresolved symbols on stderr that are not included in
the file (guess that's okay).

Nadim, that' doesn't cause a crash on my system.  Everything works fine.
One thing I did notice though is that these comma separated function
lists don't work as they should (because fvwm has no chance to handle
generated events during that function sequence). It works a lot better
if you define fvwm functions and call them instead, e.g.

  *FvwmWinListAction Click1 function fwlb1
  addtofunc fwlb1
  + i iconify off
  + i raise
  + i focus
  + i warptowindow 50 50

I have made several fixes related with function execution from modules
so please try again and see if at least part of the strange behaviour
goes away.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

t_hot is strlen(name) + strlen(tname) + 48, and in this mode
the menulines never gets longer than name 4 + name + 6, so it
will suffice.
I've now changed it to append to the t_hot string directly,
which makes it safe in case 'name' is really long.

Actually, now I noticed that this line is a bit wierd:
        t_hot = safemalloc(strlen(name) + strlen(tname) + 48);

At that point tname isn't really of a length that has anything
to do with the current menuentry. The first time the loop iterates
it's strlen(tname) will be 0, and the following times it will
be the length of the previous menuentry.
This isn't how it's supposed to behave?

Sure.

I'm including both patches here.

I don't know. Wouldn't this be too disruptive to existing config files?
I find the definition of 'Style' clear enough: Everything that can
be different for each window is a style.

Today change to focus.c causes my focus changing to hang until I click
the mouse or hit Return. I bind the keypad keys thus:

Key KP_7        RWTSF   N       my_go NorthWest
Key KP_8        RWTSF   N       my_go North
Key KP_9        RWTSF   N       my_go NorthEast

Key KP_3        RWTSF   N       my_go SouthEast
Key KP_2        RWTSF   N       my_go South
Key KP_1        RWTSF   N       my_go SouthWest
Key KP_4        RWTSF   N       my_go West # does something useful c.f
the pop group

DestroyFunc my_go
AddToFunc my_go I Direction $0 (CurrentDesk !Iconic) my_flipfocus

DestroyFunc my_flipfocus
AddToFunc my_flipfocus  I FlipFocus
+                       I Raise
+                       I my_cursorwarp

DestroyFunc my_cursorwarp
AddToFunc my_cursorwarp I Current (TaskBar) WarpToWindow 55p 10p
+                       I Current (!TaskBar) WarpToWindow 35p 50p
+                       I Current (Eterm) WarpToWindow 97 90
+                       I Current (rxvt) WarpToWindow 98 90
+                       I Current (xterm) WarpToWindow 3 90
+                       I Current (qsw-pc*) WarptoWindow 50 50

This only hangs when I move focus to an window which matches more than
one of the conditions in my_cursorwarp. Most of my windows match the
(!TaskBar) line which puts the cursor on the left menubar button. The
various term emulators have the mouse warped to the scrollbar.

When the hang occurs the cursor has been warped to the (!TaskBar)
position and fvwm waits until I click or hit Return, it never does the
(xterm) warp.

The diff of the change that looks suspicious is:
+ SetPointerEventPosition(XEvent *eventp, int x, int y)
+ {
+   switch (eventp->type)
+   {
+   case ButtonPress:
+   case ButtonRelease:
+   case KeyPress:
+   case KeyRelease:
+   case MotionNotify:
+     eventp->type = ButtonPress;

Could this be fooling fvwm into thinking a button is pressed and it
waits for a button release (or Return).

Cheers,
Tim.

Contool is freely available, and I remember it causing the same symptom
in the past.  I just got up and the details escape me right now.
Theres probably something in the mail archive.

I'm on jury duty, and have to get going.  Sorry I can't supply more
information until later.

Hello,
Can you or someone can explain me the reason of the following line
in the beginning of do_execute_module ( in module_interface.c)

  if(eventp->type != KeyPress)
    UngrabEm();

It has something to do with the  busy-cursor-on-startup stuff ?
Is these lines really useful when fvwm executes the InitFunction ?

Thanks, Olivier

Could we back this patch out please? I think it could cause color
corruption on PseudoColor displays. With theis patch fvwm does not keep
track of wetehr it alloc'd a pixel or if it came from FvwmTheme. It
XFreeColors pixels regardless whihc could result in it freeing a pixel
that it shouldn't e.g.

fvwm does a "DefaultColors pink navy": fvwm allocs pink & navy
fvwm does a "menustyle * ..... yellow blue": fvwm allocs yellow & blue
FvwmTheme does a "colorset 0 yellow red": it allocs yellow & red
fvwm loads it copy of colorset 0 with yellow & red
fvwm does a "defaultcolors orange purple": fvwm frees yellow & red,
allocs orange & purple.
FvwmTheme does a "colorset 0 x y": frees yellow & red

What happens here is that the x server will free the red and yellow
pixels for re-use. When another program allocs colors the fvwm menu
colors will get trashed because it is using the pixel it thinks is
yellow.

fvwm should really keep the pixels it allocs seperate from the colorset
copies.

I think FvwmTheme suffers from this problem, I'll sort it out. But I
think we need to seperate the DefaultColors pixels from the colorset
pixels.

Didn't this patch come about because someone didn't like the feedback
window using colorset 0? Wouldn't it be easier to just say it is fixed
at 0 and just use colorsets other than 0 for everything else?

Cheers,
Tim.

Tim, unfortunetly I was the someone. The problem is the same problem
exists with or without my patch.  The code origionally looked like this:

 if (!StrEquals(fore, "-"))
    {
        FreeColors(&Colorset[0].fg, 1);
        Colorset[0].fg = GetColor(fore); 
    }
  if (!StrEquals(back, "-"))
    {
        FreeColors(&Colorset[0].bg, 1);
        FreeColors(&Colorset[0].hilite, 1);
        FreeColors(&Colorset[0].shadow, 1);
        Colorset[0].bg = GetColor(back);
        Colorset[0].hilite = GetHilite(Colorset[0].bg);
        Colorset[0].shadow = GetShadow(Colorset[0].bg);
    }

As you can see this presents the same problem as you described above.
So sure we can back out my patch, I was just trying to be consistent.
But regardless we need to do something different here.

Dom, I made the changes to the comma separated function list (which I don't
see how that might have an affect on this bug, but I changed 'em per your
suggestion anyway).  I can still get FvwmWinList to crash as described above.

Might there be some other setting my config file that affects the behavior ?

BTW: were you able to see the "strange" feedback geometry if you were to
     inject an "iconfiy" between steps #3 and step #4 above ?

Alas, the FvwmWinList crashes on me _consistently_ (and it also happens when
I don't use mouse-button-3 -- but that's much harder to narrow-down, simple
iconify/deiconify's)

Any suggestions ?  Has anyone else tried to reproduce the error ?

OK. These entries are gone from my config file.

But the FvwmButtons man page gives:

*FvwmButtons(Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

as an example. Am I supposed to do that in my InitFunc as well?

Thanks,

No.

After FvwmButtons starts, it is sent all the previously entered commands
that start with *FvwmButtons, so there is no need to put that command
in your InitFunction.  To be safe you would want to make sure the above
command is processed before FvwmButtons is started.

How do I ensure that the above command is processed before FvwmButtons is 
started. Will putting Module FvwmButtons in the InitFunc do?

I thought that the order in which the commands came in the .fvwm2rc file
did not matter.

Thanks,

Sorry, I misled you on that.

Whether   you are  using the  new   StartFunction, or InitFunction  or
RestartFunction, they  are all run  after the initial .fvwm2rc file is
read.

I thought the man page said that the order of commands MOSTLY doesn't
matter, but I couldn't find any reference at all.  (I'm probably just
missing it).

Anyway, there are plenty of cases where the order of commands matters,
style commands with wild cards are one example.

Hello,

If you do ModuleSynchronous FvwmWinList with the current cvs,
then you lock fvwm (in my machine, try with a Timeout !).
The reason is that FvwmWinList is Lock on send and that
WinList "SendFvwmPipe("Send_WindowList",0);" before it 
"SendFinishedStartupNotification(Fvwm_fd);". I do not go in the
details but a simple fix is to invert the two above lines.

May be it will be useful to be able to can cancel a ModuleSynchronous
command by a Ctrl-Alt-Escape (I will send a patch soon if you want).

Olivier

It is ok to comment 'if (Restarting)' optimization in matchWin().
But your fix in SaveWindowStates() is not good:

  if (XGetGeometry(dpy, ewin->w, &JunkRoot, &JunkX, &JunkY, &JunkWidth,
                   &JunkHeight, &JunkBW, &JunkDepth))
  {
      /* Don't save the state of windows that already died (i.e. modules)!
       */
      continue;
  }

I don't quite sure what this should do, but it just does not save the
state of ALL windows. Please redo this fix.

Also in the next commit you seem to move CloseICCCM2() in Done() too far,
so it is not called when restarting in session manager. I don't know
whether this is ok. (And MoveViewport & RestartInSession can't be swapped.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is the better name not HideFeadbackWindow or HideGeometryWindow?
Since it is used for Move too, not only for Resize.

This patch creates the styles CirculateSkipShaded and CirculateHitShaded,
which act like CirculateSkipIcon and CirculateHitIcon, but for shaded
windows.

Hello,
Attached to this message a patch that allows to escape to a
ModuleSynchronous [Timeout time] FvwmModule
command with Ctl-Alt-Escape.

With this patch the executeModuleSynch loop is as
follows:  
1. try to obtain a message from the module during 1 sec
2. Handle the module message if any (possibly return)
3. return if "loop time" >= "Timeout time" 
4. return if Ctl-Alt-Escape
5. Go to 1.

Don't now if this is really useful ... May be the better way to
handle this patch is to put it in the trash.

The ChangeLog is not in the patch, here it is:

*module_interface.c (executeModuleSync):  New logic in the 
executeModuleSynch loop. Ctl-Alt-Escape allows to exit from a 
ModuleSynchronous command.

Olivier

PS1: There are no doc, I will write it if you apply the patch
(I will handle Wait too).

PS2: Tim, I will try to do the "escape sequence" configurable,
but later.

A better solution is attached to this message: Send that we
are lock on send after SendFinishedStartupNotification.

The change log is here (modules/ChangeLog)

*FvwmWinList.c (main): Fix a problem if we start WinList with
ModuleSynchronous.

Yuck, a function that doesn't return. I'll add it as soon as I
have the code on my disk working again.

Oops, sorry.  That 'eventp->type = ButtonPress;' is a remnant of
my previous attempts to fix some bug.  The five case values
above are meant to insure that the event has 'x_root' and 'y_root'
members.  Mangling the event type was my first try to ensure this.
The line can simply be removed.

Probably not.  But I'll try with your config file when I have
the time.

No.

Did you already check for a core file?  If there is one, what does
the stack trace say?  ('gdb FvwmWinList core' then 'where' on the
gdb prompt).

Subject: FvwmFormGrabServer: StaysOnTop

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.3.9
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.0.38
X_Server: 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.88.47)


Hello,

Whenever the *FvwmFormGrabServer option is used with FvwmForm, the form
must
be made StaysOnTop by default. Otherwise, suppose that I pop up a form and
some other window pops up in front of it. Then my system will be virtually
frozen because I will be unable to click on any of the FvwmForm's covered
buttons.

Thanks,

Neil

Um, if this option really does what its name suggests it is impossible
that other windows are mapped while the form is up.

Congratulations, I can now switch my entire colo scheme with out so
much as a recapture.  Very nice.  Now I can have a function that simply
changes all my colorsets to the new color scheme and then update my
HilightColor and TitleStyle, very slick.  Nice work.

I'm in the midst of patching.  It will mean a new command:
DefaultColorset, using DefaultColors overrides DefaultColorset in the
same way that the modules work. fvwm will not interfere with any
colorsets.

Cheers,
Tim.

It doesn't produce a core - FvwmWinList just quietly disappears (as noted, no

Not true because some applications take very long to start.
As an example is it is possible for me to launch netscape, then
have FvwmFrom come up. Then after the from is up netscape comes up
on top of the form (netscape takes about 15 seconds to appear on my box).

Best Regards,

Neil

	Execute the Recapture command while running the Gnome pager.

8-)

That's what we worked hard for.  I guess we have colour set support
completed for 2.4 when the HilightColorset command is done.

Well, does it appear on some icon management module like FvwmIconMan?
Do you have an icon defined for the panel?  What happens when you issue
a command like

  Style * some_icon_pixmap.xpm

And then do a recapture?  Does the icon show up?

No.  The swallowed applications are not handled by fvwm anymore.

Well the manual page says that *FvwmFormGrabServer grabs the mouse
pointer, nothing more. It certainly does not prevent new windows from
being mapped, nor does it prevent keyboard input: I can switch desks
while a grab is in effect for my "logout confirmation" dialogue! Because
of this, I have to ensure it is configured to be both in the top layer
AND sticky.

On a related note, my users sometimes find they cannot even click on the
Form's buttons: the grab appears to be in effect but FvwmForm does not
respond to mouse clicks. Killing the FvwmForm process always releases
the grab. On one occasion there were two processes! Unfortunately I have
been unable to reproduce this on demand. Any ideas ?

The warnings are bogus but that doesn't help much.  If a "make syntax"
cures this please commit scanner.c, script.c and script.h and we'll see
if your lex/yacc produces more portable output than mine.

No, mine produces the same warning.  Can't we simply disable lex/yacc
and distribute source files we modify by hand?  The sources could
still remain in CVS in case the files have to be rebuilt.

I remember this or similar bug was already fixed (twice) 4 months ago,
but it is again here (for about two months already).

How to reproduce:
  Eterm --trans  (after Esetroot)
  unfocus, go to another page, return to the Eterm's page

Eterm's menubar is not redrawn (wrong colors) until it gets a focus.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hm, I don't see why it should be a fvwm bug if eterm doesn't
redraw it's menubar.  Or do you mean something differrent?
Can you provide screenshots?

This one needs to be announced like the other stable releases we had.
And the web site must be updated too.  Jason, can you do that, please?

Hi,

I made the changes you told me but upon restart I sometimes still get the
pager staysontop. BTW, do I have to make swallowed applications 
StaysOnBottom as well if the swallowing application is StaysOnBottom?

Here is my configuration file (appended).

Thanks,

Neil

Ok, it is most probably Eterm bug, I can reproduce it with every fvwm
version. Here is that makes me think that this can be fvwm problem.

There was the same visual effect of wrong menubar update for *non*
transparent Eterm 4 months ago. And that event problem was fixed
then (see june archives for the discussion), but *non* transparent Eterm
worked with the previous fvwm versions unlike this one.

I still can send screenshots, although this can be easily reproduced
with Esetroot and Eterm 0.8.9. You get Eterm menubar with focused
background (wrong) and unfocussed shade/hilite colors (right).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thank you.

It would be a great contribution if someome whose native language is
english would spell check the fvwm man page(s).

Try ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/

But it seems that there are problems with building snapshots again.
The latest is fvwm-snap-19991017.tar.gz .

OK, as you all know, I've been terminally busy for far too long and it
doesn't show much sign of abating.  I really shouldn't put off switching to
the new machine the department has donated any longer, though, and so I'm
going to try to find the time to put some work into it.

The one remaining issue is the bug tracker.  Jitterbug is somewhat of a
pain to set up and from what I've seen isn't really all that useful.  Sure,
it tracks bugs, but we only seem to use it as an online filing cabinet.

I've been over the alternatives and at this point I really think that
Bugzilla is going to come the closest to meeting our needs.  It allows users to
attach things like screen shots and config files to bug reports (which
would have been useful recently).

What it seems to lack is an email interface, but I think that if we decide
one is necessary, I could probably hack something up.  (I'll probably begin
to have time for this kind of thing in a month or so.)  I have plenty of
experience doing this kind of thing.

So hopefully in the next couple of days I can get Bugzilla online at
xxx.fvwm.org and I can try moving some bug reports over.

Sigh! I wouldn't be asking for screenshots if I could reproduce it.

No, I don't.

We check for the proper number of slashes in GetSimpleColor() and
in ProcessNewStyle() now.  Thus the colour set spec in the style
line should work now plus it shouldn't coredump even if you say

  Style * forecolor rgb:ff/

Can you try this, Brad?

I don't have a remote machine at home :-)  Anyway, with SuSE 6.2
Xnest is distributed again (it was missing in 6.1).  Now all I
have to do is upgrade my home machine (yuck).

You can determine where is your panel by: WindowList OnlyListSkip
Most probably it has wrong geometry together with sticky flag.

For me the panel is visible, but in the wrong location.
Also most of the windows do not preserve their geometry (appear on the
page 0,0) and sometimes lose flags (shading, iconifying).

It only happens on the first Recapture, next ones do preserve everything
except for shading. I will try to find what happens.

Mikhael.

We have different Eterm configurations then.
Here are screenshots, all for 'Eterm --trans --menu Eterm.menu'.
Note, if I add ' --borderless true', the bug disappears.

Hello,
Is the bad position is some thing like +/-BorderWidth+/-BorderWidth
from the theoretical good one ?
I have noted some position problems of this kind with WinList if you use
CurrentDesk, goes to a desk with x apps in WinList, go to a desk with 0
app in WinList (so WinList unmap itself) and then go to a desk with y apps
(x not equal to y). I also noted such positions problems with Buttons Panel, 
but it seems that it has been fixed recently (by dominik ?).

Olivier

PS: I have a patch ready for WinList (which also fix some animation position
bugs), but I need to be at home to send the patch, so I will send it
Friday.

Hi,
Just built the latest CVS and restarted ... and suddenly all my xterm
windows have done a big switcharoo! (All except one, anyway). What
happens is that I do a "Restart", and all the window-frames disappear
etc. Everything seems to be in its original position. However, when
the frames come back, all my x-terms are displaying the wrong
contents! The frames themselves are the right sizes and in the right
positions.

Did I see a patch about a "stacking order" just go by?

BTW, the "coordinates" box that appears in the top left-hand corner
appears to have a different background colour every time I restart
too.

Cheers,
Chris.

	Ah, but it gets worse! I get multiple xterms not only switching places,
but switching geometries as well. This only seems to affect multiple
instances of the same window, whether within the same application
instance (say, multiple GIMP image windows), or multiple instances of
the app (like the xterm example).

	I've also occasionally observed some downright whimsical re-placement
of windows when they're reparented to root (when the window-frames
disappear) - they get put in places that seem to have no relation to any
place they (or any other windows, for that matter) have ever been. Then
when the Restart finishes, they may be restored to their original
locations...or they may not.

	So far I can see no rhyme nor reason to this behavior. Sometimes
instead of switching places, one window will seem to have disappeared
completely: in this case, I usually find that it's been stacked below
another window of the same type.

> Did I see a patch about a "stacking order" just go by?

	I don't think it's related. I started seeing this yesterday, which was
the first update I'd done in several days.

Hmm, we need to find out how it was done with 2.2 and replicate it then.

By default lex and yacc are not run.  I'll fix scanner.c by hand and add
a note to the README file.

Sorry it took so long to reply, but I did what was suggested. Even though
the iconification sound is being played (this is the only event that plays
this sound), no icons appear. Here's what WindowList had to say about the
geometry of the panels:

panel 0(8):52x553+3814-2147 S
panel 0(8):1024x52-1870+2147 S

My display is only 1024x768, so these windows are way out there.

The panels come back if I restart.

There are a couple of places in fvwm/*.c where the [ % nColorsets]
construct is still used.  Dominik could you change these?  I think using
AllocColorset to make sure the colorset array is big enough will be
faster than doing a `% nColorsets' on every reference.

Tim.

	The new immediate Style updating seems to be lacking a couple of
things. What's the current state of the project? Is it considered
complete, or is it still work in progress?

	The new handling doesn't seem to catch the case where styles are set
indirectly, via UseStyle and UseDecor.

	All my color scheme related Style elements are defined in decors, which
are then assigned to named styles, e.g.

AddToDecor BGStyle1 ...
... [buttonstyles, titlestyles, hilightcolor, etc.]
Style BGStyle1 UseDecor BGStyle1, color red/burlywood


	Then, to set or switch the color scheme, I use a command like

Style * UseStyle BGStyle1

A Recapture is still required for this to take effect.

Bob

I think the bug tracking is working Ok.  What I would like is for fvwm-web
to be connected to www.fvwm.org instead of xxx.fvwm.org.

That is the goal, but the bug tracking issue must be resolved first.
My point was that Jitterbug is a pain to set up (on the new machine) so if
a change is to be made, now is the time to make it.

When restarting fvwm (current cvs), windows are misplaced, switched
place and other funny stuff.. Anyone have any ideas?

During the restart, windows which normally are side by side might get
stacked on top of eachother too...

The switched windows are caused by excluding the 'if (Restarting)' code.
Dominik convinced me that this is a bug, not an optimization :).
I have reimplemented the removed code differently.

This would fix windows with the same resource class and name and
command-line and everything switching places. But only on restarts
and not on start-up inside a session manager, weird.

I don't know anything about why this happens.

Hmm, really strange.
Is this still reproducible?

It is only related to the raise order. Yes, the original order may not
be preserved temporarily. Can you live with it until I have a time to fix
it, so it does't harm a session manager user?

Mikhael.

	Super! It looks like that fixed it - I tried several Restarts with a
combination of windows that would almost always get scrambled before,
and they all stayed in place. Thanks, Mikhael.

Hello,

I see that it is now possible to paste into FvwmForm.
This is great, but it would be even better if in addition to that
one could CUT from FvwmForm and then paste into an xterm or something
else.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

Hi gang,

I haven't been on the list for quite some time, due to lack of time.

But I just dropped by the web site to see what is going on, and I see that
the configuration stuff is still giving people problems.  Sigh.

In particular, there was a message about why "make install" builds stuff
even after "make" succeeds.  I'll answer Dan's question (attached).

The reason the shell scripts are FORCEd, is to allow people to do

	./configure
	make
	make install prefix=/something/else

If the shell scripts are NOT rebuilt at "make install" time, they COULD
have incorrect paths coded into them.  Thus, the answer to Dan's question
is clearly "no".

Of course, rebuilding the shell scripts and FvmwForm scripts would be
unnecessary if they could compute the correct path at run time ...

Cheers all,

Keep up the good work!

The behaviour in question is not just in FvwmForm, its also in FvwmTile
and FvwmCascade, and in the utils directory in fvwmbug.sh.

This is when part of the change was introduced:

Wed Apr 28 20:45:51 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

        * FvwmRearrange/Makefile.am (FvwmCascade):
        * FvwmRearrange/Makefile.am (FvwmTile):
        * FvwmForm/Makefile.am (FvwmTalk): force generation each time.

If I understand why Steve added a dependency on "FORCE", wouldn't
making the dependency on "Makefile" work even better?

Hi Steve, I'm going to copy you since I'm not sure from your comment
as to whether you are on the list now.

Isn't it:

  ./configure --prefix=/something/else

I just tried make install with a prefix and it didn't have any effect.

Perhaps you mean:

  make FVWM_CONFIGDIR=/something/else
  make install FVWM_CONFIGDIR=/something/else

although I haven't tried that and I don't know if that works either.


BTW, Bob said that writing in the build directory during make install
is definitely a no-no, and when Bob speaks on this subject... well
you get the idea.

Thanks.  I'm no longer on the list.

Yes.  To allow this, anything with FVWM_CONFIGDIR has to be rebuilt *every
time* "make" is run.

I agree that one would like to avoid this.  

Maybe one could achieve the desired results without writing into the build
directory (writing into /tmp, instead, for example). Or perhaps allowing
one to set build variables like "prefix" or "FVWM_CONFIGDIR" after
configuring is just not worth the bother.

It's not legal or supported to give different values of prefix (or
FVWM_CONFIGDIR) at "make install" time than you did at "make" time.
This is a basic rule of autoconf/automake/etc. (indeed, IMO, any sane
build system :).

The _ONLY_ time you would do this (set prefix differently on install
than during the build) is if you wanted to stage the installation
somewhere to later move it to the right place; I often do this to see
what gets installed where, since I support a single filesystem that
provides an identical view for many different UNIX variants and I have
to put stuff in various places (it all looks right in the end due to the
magic of symlinke!).

In that case, of course, you don't WANT the different prefix value to
show up in the scripts; that would be wrong.

Of course the preferred way to do this (staging) is to use DESTDIR but
some older packages don't support that yet (automake didn't used to
support it in earlier versions), so both ways should work.

Yes, but not "make install".  IOW, these tools should be rebuilt as part
of the "make" process, but not as part of "make install".

Actually, I think I was the one who said that... so I guess it's still
open to debate :).

It's The Wrong Thing to change the path in these scripts based in the
prefix, etc. values during "make install".  That's all there is to it.

I'm sorry, I know the difference between Bob and Paul, I guess I'm
just loosing my mind.

Anyway I value both of your opinions.

That sounds awfully like a bug related to the aterm problem
reported recently.  It seems that all terminal emulators
stem from rxvt and share more or less the same bugs :-)

This is really a bug in eterm.  Fvwm cannot prevent that
eterm gets the Expose event; thus it must be the fault of
eterm.

Yes, forgive me.  I was not thinking clearly.

It's been a long while, but I think I was originally considering the
"make" and not "make install" case.

I can agree with this.

About 25% complete.  It's still causing me headaches.  Only the
common flags of the style/window structure are handled properly
right now (I hope).

I haven't looked into this yet.

Hm, now that you mention it, yes.  The styles overwritten by
the 'UseStyle' style are not marked as changed and thus don't
get updated.  I'll probably not be able to get back to this
until next wednesday or so.

Yes, unfortunately that is true.  Working with your bugs is very
tedious with Jitterbug.  There is no easy way to add comments and
send them to the list and the reporter at the same time (e.g. I have
to type my signature manually).

Given the percentage of useful mails sent directly to Jitterbug
without the report form (which is about 0%) it is even an advantage
not to have a public email interface.  I wouldn't complain about
one for the developers though - from time to time I enter all the
old reports that have queued up in my mailbox into Jitterbug, so
some email form would be nice (although not really necessary).

Any other bug tracking system can hardly be worse thatn Jitterbug ;-)
I'm all for at least trying it out.

	Wow. I have to say it's quite impressive at 25% - I can't wait to see
it when it's done.

	Judging from my feeble attempts to understand the style code a little
bit, I don't wonder!  :-)

	That's OK, I think I may be the patron saint of misattributors...it's
that darned middle-aged cerebral-digital disconnect.

Hello,

It would be nice if in addition to the StaysOnTop style option there were
also an IconStaysOnTop style option. For example for all the icons to stay
on top one would write:

Style "*" IconStaysOnTop

The default would be IconsStaysOnBottom.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,
This mail has two part and an attached patch. 
Part A: Description of 4 bugs of FvwmWinList
Part B: Description of a patch which fixes the first 3.

-----------------
Part A: Description of 4 bugs of FvwmWinList

1. This one depends on the fact that you use the option 
*FvwmWinListCurrentDesk
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0-0 #(not really needed)
(do not use *FvwmWinListAnchor)
and that WinList has a non zero border width.
Then do so that there are x applications in WinList in Desk0,
no applications in WinList in Desk1 and y applications in WinList
in Desk3 with x not equal to y. Switch between these 3 desks
(Desk0-->Desk1-->Desk2-->Desk1-->Desk0). In may machine the position
of WinList is bad, the bad position come from the BorderWidth
of WinList.

2. Now with the above configuration enable animation for WinList 
and do so that the *FvwmWinListFollowWindowList is *not* activated 
(this the default). Then, Iconify/DeIconify the windows, the geometry
of the WinList buttons in the animation are sometimes false (you may 
need to play a little bit to see that, open other windows and 
Iconify/DeIconify).

3. I have some problems with WinList at startup. If animation
is enable for winlist and an application is started iconified
(i.e., + I Module FvwmConsole in StartFunc and Style FvwmConsole
starticonic), then I've got:

FvwmWinList: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 3
   Major opcode of failed request:  40 (TranslateCoords)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0
   Resource id of failed request:  0x0
 Leaving a core dump now

4. At start up if there are some applications (started in .xinitrc
or in a Fvwm Start Functions, but not started iconified), then WinList 
some time crash with a core file:

Core was generated by `/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.10/FvwmWinList 24 4 none 0 8'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Erreur de segmentation. (segmentation fault)
#0  0x40061b20 in ?? ()
(gdb) where
#0  0x40061b20 in ?? ()
#1  0x4005ed20 in ?? ()

#3  0x804a5e3 in ?? ()
#4  0x804b212 in ?? ()

#6  0x804ab1c in ?? ()
#7  0x804aad9 in ?? ()
#8  0x804aa00 in ?? ()
(gdb) quit

Arg !!!

I have tried to solve this by reverting the patch which lock
on send only after SendFinishedStartupNotification, but the
same thing happen.

-----------------
Part B: Description of a patch which fixes the first 3.

Now the patch. It solves Bug 1, 2 and 3 but *not* 4.

1. Reason of the bug (IMHO): When winlist map it self we've got
a ConfigureNotify event and the positions given "forget" the border 
width and title width. I've take these width at first winlist map 
and do the appropriate correction in winlist position.   

2. The bug is visible in the code, the "button position" is
badly computed. I have modified FindItemDesk (never used in the code)
and use it in ProcessMessage to compute the good item in the current
Desk.

3. I forbid any animation before WinList has mapped itself for the
first time.

I have tried to test this patch with a lot of different configuration
option and situations. It seems to work good and I hope that I have not
introduced other bugs ...

modules/ChangeLog

FvwmWinList/FvwmWinList.c (ProcessMessage, LoopOnEvents, AdjustWindow): 
FvwmWinList/List.c (FindItemDesk):
Fix a positions bug. Fix some animation bugs.

Nice work, I've applied the patch. I took the liberty of renaming the
variable WindowIsUp to WindowState as it confuse me into thinking it was
a booloean. And I changed the `if' statements to adjust the window
geomtery into a couple of switches.

Indeed.  core files without debug are useless. Is it possible for you to
compile with debug on? I think a "make clean; make CFLAGS=-g" will do
it.

Tim or Dominik, I thought you might be able to track this down faster.
all of the leaks are coming from the same place, and its obvious pixel
is not being freed but I'm not sure that if it makes sense to free it or
where it should happen.

Brad

P.S. I now have purify for my deesktop machine so just ask and it can be
purified.

ahh, I feel much better,
      Memory leaked: 0 bytes (0%); potentially leaked: 0 bytes (0%)

Thanks, it would have taken me a bit longer to find that.

I assume you know more about  the library than I  do.  My research led
me to the Solaris "Standards(7)" man page:

     The only X Consortium standards are the ones  listed  above.
     No  other  documents,  include  files,  or software in X11R6
     carry special status within the X Consortium.  For  example,
     none of the following are standards:  internal interfaces of
     the sample server; the MIT-SHM extension; the Athena  Widget
     Set; the Xmu library; the Xau library; the RGB database; the
              ^^^
     fonts distributed with X11R6; the  applications  distributed
     with    X11R6;    the    include    files   <X11/XWDFile.h>,
     <X11/Xfuncproto.h>,     <X11/Xfuncs.h>,     <X11/Xosdefs.h>,
     <X11/Xos.h>,  and  <X11/Xthreads.h>;  the  bitmap  files  in
     <X11/bitmaps>.

So I guess if you wanted to use it, the prudent thing would be to
surround it with a feature test in the configure script.

Hi,
When I start my X session the following script is executed (.xsession)

xrdb -load .Xdefaults
xearth  -fork ....
xterm -C ... &
xterm ... -e rlogin ... &
exec fvwm2

When I close the session ( Quit from fvwm2 ) in RedHat 4.2
all the programs like xearth, xterm, sh,  rlogin, etc are close
automatically
in RedHad 5.1 all programs are close except xearth
(I do not care because xearth die when fails to update the screen)
en RedHat 6.0 none of these programs die, even after kill the X server
!!
Somebody has any idea about this feature ??
Some solution for this unfriendly feature of RH 6.0
(not killing the programs by hand)

IN RH 4.2 fvwm2 version 2.0.46 X version 3.3.1   kernel 2.0.34

Ok, I take that back.  The O-Reilly books say "it should be available
on virtually all machines".

Plus  old versions of fvwm made  references to the headers even though
they didn't seem to actually use any functions in the libraries.
This was up thru 2.2.2.

I searched  thru all the  programs I have source  code to and although
most  use  seemed  to  be confined  to   graphics  programs, "pixmap",
"Xaw3d", it seems to be used quite a bit.

I then checked to see if I already had libXmu loaded on my machine,
and I found Netscape had it loaded.

Netscape's use looked like this:

fork> /usr/proc/bin/pmap 772 | grep Xmu 
EF560000     80K read/exec         /usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.so.4
EF582000      8K read/write/exec   /usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.so.4
EF584000      8K read/write/exec     [ anon ]

I'm not  sure about the  "anon"  number, but I  think usage  might add
about 16K to fvwm's memory use.  (I don't  know what it would save, or
what functionality you might add with it.)


Bear in mind,  I have little idea what  I'm talking  about.  Since you
asked, I'm guessing that you want some input.

Uuuh, that look *really* screwed up.  According to the file docs/error_codes
which describes X errors (I don't have a X manual handy right now):

  Error code:
    BadImplementation 17    /* server is defective */

And an event type of 0 is suspicious too.

No, don't waste your time on 2.2.2.  The 2.2.x series is in a separate
branch.

The older files are in the testing directory:

  ftp://hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/testing/

??? Everything comiles fine here.  What are the error messages you get?
Do you use some unusal compiler of configure options?

When, I ask my question there are no Xmu in fvwm. Now I see that there
are in FvwmDragWell ! However, it is in a module code ...
I am still with my "Busy Cursor Patch" (do not know if I never
send it) and I would like to use  XmuCursorNameToIndex for that the user 
can use cursor name (and not only number) in the CursorStyle command. 
However, we can probably do that with hands and as you explain save 
some memory ... ?

You know surely more than me about that. I have just see the above
command in my X book and think that it can save my times.

DragWell uses XmuClientWindow() once to get the first non-window manager
client window.  There is a way to do this using a while(){} loop that I saw
once,
but have been unable to locate the code again.  If somebody knows how to do
this,
please email me and the library may be removed...

I hope  I didn't cause   a crusade to eliminate  the  use of  the  Xmu
library.   Any workstation  running Netscape   already has the  shared
library loaded.   Since I don't   have root access,  I wasn't  able to
determine if the X server itself has the library loaded.

The  8K  shown by "pmap"   for additional memory  use seems  to be the
smallest number it will show anyway.

In short, I don't see any problem with using this library.

Are TitleStyles planned to support ColorSets?  I don't see any reason not
to, as MenuStyles already support them, and that way I could get a nice
looking title bar without a pixmap.

This is too much of a change for me to commit.  Could you provide a diff
that just fixes the Xdnd in the existing FvwmWharf?

Subject: cursor falls off title bar when moving windows

Full_Name: Ben Ross
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.0.36/2.2.12
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.5/3.3.1
Submission from: (NULL) (203.102.212.6)


This bug wasn't evident in fvwm-2.0.45.
When a window is moved, the cursor moves off the title bar (or wherever
it was originally when the window was moved) before the window starts
moving i.e. the cursor ends up somewhere other than where it
was first clicked. For some reason this is most noticable when moving the
window vertically.
I tracked the problem down to the function InteractiveMove() in move.c
A fix involves replacing the following code:

  if (eventp->type == ButtonPress)
    {
      DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
      DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;
    }
  else
    XQueryPointer(dpy, Scr.Root, &JunkRoot, &JunkChild, &DragX, &DragY,
                  &JunkX, &JunkY, &JunkMask);


with:
  
  DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
  DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;

However, I'm not sure how valid the check for the ButtonPress event is
and whether this fix breaks something else.

If you set:
Style "*" NoPPosition
Java2/Swing applications have weird rendering problems. A good example is 
standard dialogs (from JOptionPane) will draw with the OK/Cancel buttons
partially obscured or not rendered. I've tried a few other window 
managers (vtwm, dtwm) and have only been able to exhibit the bug with
fvwm2 with this option set.

Hello,

It would be nice if there were an option that
left menus posted after the mouse button release
which also worked for menus posted by clicking
on a window's titlebar button.

Thanks,

Neil

Hmmm, I'll look around, but I doubt providing a diff for just Xdnd would be
easy.  I converted
the button infomation storage structure from an array to a linked list, and
that was a pretty
fundamental change.  The original code was(and still is) a mess.  Several of
the drawing functions had code like:
[x+y-y+3].  The parsing code was a real mess with the drag definition
needing to be declared
before the button definition, etc.  I downloaded the AfterStep wharf/zharf,
and it too had been converted
to linked lists.  The current code is pretty stable.  All of the
windomaker/aftertep applets seem to be swallowed
fine.
   I was sort of hoping that a parallel module FvwmWharf2 could be created.
That way
people could examine Wharf2, and if it made the grade, be converted to Wharf
in the future.
I know that this isn't the way that open source is supposed to work and am
sorry for the abuptness of the
change.  I'll see if I have a really old version lying around somewhere.

So speaking of wharf,  I got my sound card to work under linux, and I was
thinking of updating the wharf
sound code.  The current version seems to assume that there is some kind of
sound "daemon" called
ASSound.  Any suggestions about what to do?  Is there a way to send events
to FvwmEvent?  Does anyone
use Wharf and sounds?  Thanks for any input.

Doug

Well I finally got around to implementing this, it seems to work fine
with my config and the default config.  I couldn't get a deadlock so
everything should be okay.

Yes, but definitely not in 2.4.  The problem is not the
syntax but the way the border drawing code draws the
decorations.  This is completely incompatible with the
way colour sets work.

Well, it actually is available, although searches thru the mail
archives reveal that sometimes system administrators fail to install
it.  I found one instance on HPUX9 from a few years back, and this
more recent one on AIX:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9909/msg00591.html

Since we had the headers being included, but we didn't need them, you
removed the includes, but I don't see any instance of the headers not
being available, just missing.

Worse than that it would get the wrong coordinates if you moved the
manger.  I was foolishlly assuming win->manager->geometry.x, and
win->manager->geometry.y were actually being updated somewhere.  Silly
me.

I am running FVWM 2.2 on RedHat 6.0. Because of RedHat's changes to the fvwmrc 
scripts, my user file is actually called .fvwm2rc.init and also most of the man 
stuff on fvwm doesn't apply.
I have to say:
exec command
for each thing I want to do in .fvwm2rc.init. Maybe it helps, if you try this, 
or try putting &s after each command like:
command1 &
command2 &
command3
Hopefully, one of them might do the trick...

Something I've seen elsewhere -- BeOS and twm (or some varient of
twm, vtwm, tvtwm, ...) have short titlebars, or titlebar tabs which
take up a bit less screen realestate than the long title tabs like
FVWM and most other window managers have. It'd be really neat to
have a configuration option where we could change those bars to
short bars. Looking at the TODO list, I see it's down there
(SqeezeTitle) but with a question mark, making it a possible
feature, so count this as a vote for it, if you would.

I've also seen the tabs be slideable along the window (BeOS), which
I think is a wonderful feature as it allows you to make a tab-view
out of your windows and then easialy stack more windows. If it
did get implemented, something of this nature would make it /so/
much more useful than just the short titles without them being
movable along the top of the window.

Thanks for your time and the great WM. :)

This is a known bug in 2.2.x.  The fix is too complicated to make it
into the 2.2.x series however.  The problem is already fixed in the 2.3.x
betas.  And to comment on your fix:  yes, it *will* break something else,
i.e. if the move was triggered by an event that has no x_root/y_root
member in the event struct (yes, this does really happen sometime).

This is something you should report to the developers of the
application you mention.  An application must not require the
window manager to honour the position hint it requests (that's
why it's called a hint).  An application that fails to draw
itself properly is broken.

There is.  Simply use the 'Menu' command to open the menu
instead of 'Popup'.

	Sounds like the "application" is the JDK itself. Bummer.

	Kris -- Dominik is absolutely right. But before rushing to report a bug
to Sun - have you searched through Sun's outstanding patch list to see
if there might be anything applicable here (I don't have the URL handy)?
I've not used Solaris-7 yet, but my suggestion is based on experience
with past out-of-the-box Solaris releases.

	Brad -- I seem to recall that you've done a lot of Java work...(am I
remembering correctly, or is there another Brad Giaccio running around
the Net trying to confuse people?) Ever run into this sort of problem?
If not, do you use NoPPosition?

	Dan -- We were discussing a while back the wisdom (or lack thereof) of
switching the default from UsePPosition to NoPPosition. Maybe we were
wise to wait a bit. You were going to switch your setup to specify Style
* NoPPosition and see if anything went haywire. What results did you
have?

Bob

yes, undoubtedly.

My machine is all patched up (as of last week some time), and the JDK is
the latest stable.

I thought before I had nailed it down to NoPPosition, but it is actually
intermittant. I turned off NoPPosition and the bug went away, but I just
turned it back on and it was fine. I also have experienced the bug with
NoPPosition off. I suspect it's some sort of inconsistancy with what sun
expects from dtwm in certain fringe cases. I may try and take a poke at 
it myself if I can nail down the cause more firmly.

So far, I haven't detected any PPosition problems.

I don't run any Java applications.

During startup I'm seeing wireframes for offdesk windows making me
click the mouse, but thats just 2.3.10 with any PPosition setting.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.202.174.20)


This is my ExitFunction:

AddToFunc ExitFunction  I KillModule *
+                       I FvwmBanner
+                       I Wait FvwmBanner

I have to have it this way otherwise the swallow(noclose) apps in
FvwmButtons are put into a parallel universe. The function works nicely
with the Restart command but if I kill fvwm with a -USR1 signal it gets
into
a 100% cpu loop. All the modules are dead but fvwm is alive and able to
manage windows. I can get out of the loop by starting an
'xclock -name FvwmBanner'.  Is it possible to disable the Wait command
after
fvwm has received a -USR1 signal?

Here's a stack trace when looping:

I'll echo that.  The source of Java's windowing stuff is absolutely
littered with crap to work around bugs in dtwm.  They assume that you're
running dtwm or olwm as your window manager and if you're not, well, that's
not supported.  They've closed several bugs of mine with exactly that
explanation.  So I wouldn't rely on the right fix ever being made.

I've been having this problem myself recently, but in my case it's not at
all related to {Use,No}PPosition.  Instead, it only occurs on naked
transients.  If I turn DecorateTransients on for the windows it has
problems with, the problem disappears.  Switch back to NakedTransients, and
it's there.  Every time.

Re-reading the original bug report, it may not be clear what exactly is
going on here (though of course, I may be suffering from something slightly
different).  What's happening to me is that the (naked) window is being
drawn the correct size.  However, the bottom of the window has a portion
where the contents of the window aren't drawn.  The height of this piece is
about the height of a title bar.

Sometimes the window contents are displayed in the correct location w.r.t
the top left corner, and the bottom of the contents are clipped, and
sometimes the window contents are clipped off the top, and the blank space
at the bottom doesn't cover everything.  In the latter case, there seems to
be some left-right displacement as well.

I can make snapshots if anyone thinks it would help, and I have a code
snippet so you can reproduce it.

This only happens on descendants of JOptionPane, as near as I can tell.

HTH,
Danek

Yes, this is the cruft of the problem.
However, /sometimes/ naked transients work for me, and /sometimes/ they
don't.  If it's not working, it actually degrades each time you call 
setVisible() on the window (less and less of it draw, until eventually you
just get a gray blob). If decorate transients works, I'll use that for a
workaround.

<soapbox humor=bile>
	Seems to me that it's downright fraudulent for them to claim to support
a Java implementation for the X Window system in that case.

	I don't know about anyone else, but I'd personally like to see
screenshots and a code snippet.

OK then but a diff of whatever changes you want is much better than just
a new set of files. Someone has to do it and it's better if it is
someone who understands the new code.

I'd rather have just one. More people will test it and if it doesn't
work we can reverse the changes or fix them.

"SendToModule FvwmEvent <anything>" will cause the "string" event to
happen but it
ignores the data sent to it. I suppose you could kludge it by setting
the "string"
event to play a certain audio file and FvwmWharf could make that file be
a symlink to whatever sound it wanted before triggering the event. It's
prone to race hazards.

A reliable way woudl be to patch FvwmEvent so that the *FvwmEventPassID
config option would cause the contents of the string to be appended to
the command that FvwmEvent constructs. You could then just send the name
of the audio file.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well Bob the good news is your memory isn't failing (At least in this
instance anyway).  I'm as far as I know the only bgiaccio running
around at there.  But anyway you are all quite correct sun does make
assumptions about your window manager and your xlibs as well, as a
matter of fact if you install jdk1.2.x they tell you you need to path
your xserver but if you look close they are patching /usr/openwin/lib
not just the x server.  So my advice is to try this in your java code
where you can consitenttly reproduce the problem, add one line of code.

<window>.validate(); 

This will force all of its children which are marked invalid to get
validated.  And when you first create a window everything is invalid.
The problem is Sun changed the code for show so it nolonger does this on
its own, the programmer needs to do it.  Well let me know if this fixes
it or not otherwise pass me the sample code and I'll take a look.

http://www.cow.org/~wehner/decorate-transient.gif
http://www.cow.org/~wehner/naked-transient.gif

I have noticed that while the decorate/naked transient will consistantly
trigger the bug, if you make your window borders "thin enough", it will
sometimes crop up as well.

The code for this is:
private void handle_file_open_click()
{
  if(!handle_file_close_click())
    return;
  
  if(open_file_dialog == null)
    {
      open_file_dialog = new JFileChooser();
      open_file_dialog.setCurrentDirectory(new File("."));
    }

(which is outside of the JOptionPane, as well).

People at Sun seem to have forgotten about X, and know only about two
beasts: OpenWindows and CDE.  No matter that they're both just layers on
top of X.  It's really quite sad.

I've attached Test.java, which you can compile and run.  It requires either
Swing or Java 1.2.

I've put pictures up on

    http://www.emufarm.org/~duvall/fvwm/

There are the good and bad results from the test code, plus the good and
two bad results I tried to describe yesterday.

I've also noticed that when the code is run under Linux, using blackdown's
1.2 jre, it works just fine.  I may have to compare source bases.

HTH,
Danek

I've put up a second test program that lets you do that, rather than using
the canned JOptionPane.showXXXDialog().  I've tried validate() on all three
components in that program, and nothing doing.  I also tried a pack() on
the dialog, but again ...

Now, if I put the JOptionPane directly inside of a JFrame, and call pack()
on the frame before I show() it, then there are no problems.

I think the following might be of interest to the fvwm group.
It concerns a difference between various wm that caused a bug in the xcircuit 
package.

Dear Ray,
   After bringing up WindowMaker and playing around with your
suggestions and one of my own, I finally came up with a "proper"
solution to the problem.  The correct solution is to have a
separate routine respond to EnterNotify events and change focus
there---I noticed the other day under fvwm (by the way, none of this
focus problem happens under the admittedly simpler twm window manager,
which is what I normally use), while I was using xcalc to figure out
scale values for an architectural drawing, that xcalc was doing
something like that:  whenever I entered the window, it immediately
had keyboard focus.  I didn't get the same effect in xcircuit until
I clicked in the window.  To do that, you need to add, around
xcircuit.c line 1694,

   XtAddEventHandler(top, EnterWindowMask, False,
        	(XtEventHandler)focusinput, NULL);

with a separate subroutine as follows:

/*----------------------------------------------------------------*/

void focusinput(w, clientdata, event)
  Widget w;
  caddr_t clientdata;
  XCrossingEvent *event;
{
   XSetInputFocus(dpy, XtWindow(w), RevertToPointerRoot, CurrentTime);
}

/*----------------------------------------------------------------*/

I ran this version under WindowMaker and the keyboard focus appears
to work right.  I also updated the minor version number and posted
the corrected code to the xcircuit web page.  Thanks for your help
in tracking down the problem.

						Regards,
						Tim

Unfortunatelly you are right with the canned dialogs it is next to
impossible to get them to paint correctlly.  I've noticed it happens
less frequentlly with jdk1.2.2 however maybe you could give that a shot.
But I'm afraid the short answer is there is nothing fvwm could do about
it.  I suppose you could set up fvwmEvent to resize the window 1pixel
wider on an add window (since a resize force the validation) to get it
right.

Hmmmm...  maybe functions should have a "nesting limit" like file reading.

Hello,
Attached to this message a "busy cursor" patch. This patch is big
(and one may found it is dangerous). It will be probably preferable 
to send 3 patches but since every things is linked  I send
only one. However, if you like only some parts of this patch, say me
and I will send an other one.
I found the results quite pretty espesially with dynamic menus used
with the various "browse menus" scriptes.

1. Busy Cursor Stuff

The man page between the two --- lines:

-----------------------
.B "BusyCursor" "[\fIOption\fP \fIbool\fP\fP], ..."
This command controls the cursor during the execution of certain
command. \fIOption\fP can be "DynamicMenu", "ModuleSynchronous", "Read", 
"Recapture", "Wait". An option must be followed by a boolean argument 
\fIbool\fP. You can use commas to separate individual options. If you 
set an option to True, then when the corresponding  command is run, fvwm 
display the cursor of the WAIT context of the \fICursorStyle\fP command. 
False forces to not display the cursor. The Default is: DynamicMenu False, 
ModuleSynchronous False, Read False, Recapture True, Wait False.

The Read option also concerns the \fIPipeRead\fP command.
 
DynamicMenu concerns the \fIDynamicPopupAction\fP and 
\fIMissingSubmenuFunc\fP commands. If this option is set to False, then
the busy cursor is not displayed during a dynamic menu command even if this
command is a \fI(Pipe)Read\fP command and the Read option is set to true. 

Wait concerns only the root cursor. During the wait pause the root cursor
is replaced by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully functional (you can 
escape from the pause, see the \fIEscapeFunc\fP command). If you want to 
use this option and if you do not use the default root cursor, you must 
set your root cursor with the \fICursorStyle\fP command.
---------------------------

Comments:
If the corresponding action to an option set to True is execuded, then
the cursor is grabed using the GrabEm function (things are different for
Wait, see below) and ungrabed when the execution is finished with the 
UngrabeEm function. The main technical problems is "multi grabing", for
avoiding problems I have add a new external int variable GrabPointerState 
and modify GrabEm and UngrabEm which now have a new parameters
"(un)grab_context". This new external variable is controled by GrabEm, 
UngrabEm and menus.c (and also by StartupStuff of fvwm.c for the "busy 
cursor at startup" stuff). Grabing the cursor when it is allready Grabed
is not a problem, however, we need to 
i. never forget to ungrab the cursor;
ii. not ungrab the cursor if it is not necessary (to avoid the disparition
of the busy cursor if a command that grab the cursor is executed during
a BusyCursor command).
iii. Do not forget to regrab the cursor after that a command which grab/ungrab
the cursor occure when the cursor is grabed: case of menus.c with dynamic
menus.
If one forget i and iii then we can freeze fvwm. Note that we can freeze
the *current* cvs by using principe iii: use a dynamicpopuaction that build
a menu but also execute a command that grab the cursor as Recapture or Move,
then popup this menu and click on the root window: "freeze". The patch solves
this :o). An other good news: the "busy cursor at startup" is alive for a
more long time.
The reason for this (is may be a bad news) is that I have commented some
not usefull IMHO UngrabEm in do_execute_module and SendStrToModule.
An other good news: the Wait stuff does not use grabbing, its only
redefine the root cursor (since fvwm is still functional during a
wait pause), here the bad news is that the user can't any more use xsetroot
to set the root cursor (if (s)he sets the Wait option to True and use
the Wait command). But, (s)he can use CursorStyle.

Ok, the above comments are quite not clear ... if you are interested
just read the patch :o)

2. Some cursor utilities

I have add the ROOT context to the CursorStyle command. Moreover, one
can now use X11 cursor name in this command (and not only number). 
I do *not* used the Xmu library.
I do that because of the Wait option of the BusyCursor command. So that
it is more easy to users to change the xsetroot command to a CursorStyle
one for setting the root cursor.  


3. EscapeFunc

I have documented the Ctl-Alt-Escape key sequence for the Wait and
ModuleSynchronous command. Moreover, since it seems that this key
sequence can be captured by some X server I have added the EscapeFunc 
function. Here the man page:

.B "EscapeFunc"
By default the key sequence Ctl-Alt-Escape allows to escape from
a \fIWait\fP pause and from a locked \fIModuleSynchronous\fP command.
The \fIEscapeFunc\fP command used with the \fIKey\fP command allows
to configure this key sequence. An example:
.EX
Key Escape A MC -
Key Escape A S EscapeFunc
.EE
replace Ctl-Alt-Escape by Shift-Escape for aboring \fIWait\fP pause
and \fIModuleSynchronous\fP command. \fIEscapeFunc\fP used without the 
\fIKey\fP command does nothing.

I think that here we do not need more comments.

May be I miss something but the read limit come from the C language.
My opinion is that we have to forbid to a function to AddToFunc to
itself (but it seems that this does not suffice to fix the problem).
Any way, the problem is not a real one since I do not think that a normal
user do a thing like cir (I found cir by testing my BusyCursor patch :o).

Nice work, Olivier!
Some notes after several minutes of playing with this new stuff.

You forgot to enclose the second parameter to CheckBinding() in
#ifdef HAVE_STROKE. No need to repost a patch.

Now with this patch all xsetroot or similar calls in initialization
functions are ignored. I don't know whether this is ok.

It is not a problem to replace:
	Exec xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr -fg red -bg white
with:
	CursorStyle Root left_ptr red white

But probably some users can be confused. The note about the initial
xsetroot should be in the man page or/and NEWS.

I think that the default Root cursor must be changed from ugly X_cursor to
left_ptr or similar. Does anyone love this X_cursor?

I see no problems with incorporating this patch into the current CVS.
But I didn't take a look at it in depth yet and I prefer to test it first.

Also I think Olivier can get write access to apply his patches himself.

What others think?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'd definately prefer a 'Root' cursorstyle instead of running xsetroot
in the InitFunction.  One note is that CursorStyle requires the cursor
number, and can't accept names--  support for names would be nicer, and
wouldn't it be preferable to have name support anyway, since the numbers
could *theoretically* change?

I hate the default X cursor.  Most window managers set the default to
left_ptr...

Thanks Mikhael ! It was not easy for me to implement this busy cursor
stuff and I'm happy that you like the result.

Yep, with the first versions of my patch this happen only if you use
BusyCursor Wait True. I think I can do so that this is the case with
the version I send (and so the doc is ok).

I don't, I use hand1 yellow black :o). For the default I think that the
better one is right_ptr (it is more different that the cursor which appear 
with TitleBar, menu, modules, ...).

Maybe I am a little young with programming and with fvwm code (even if
I learned quite fast this last two months). On the other hand my job
is *theoretical* computer science and if I have write access I will
be very careful (at present time I know that Dominik, Tim, Mikhael or an
other "guru"  will take a look to my patch) I do not want that
a fvwm core dump be my fault !
Any way, the fact that I have not write access is a minor problem for
building patch and may be I have to learn more to have this access.

But with this patch it is already possible to use names instead of
numbers, so my example is valid. :)

	We've all made mistakes and committed things that were broken. We just
expect someone to demonstrate reasonable competence and to be reasonably
conscientious. I think you've done both. If you have a particularly
complex piece of work, you can *still* ask for opinions or make a patch
for others to review before committing it. Even the "old-timers" do that
occasionally. Remember that one advantage of being able to commit things
yourself is that, if something goes in that is broken, you can fix it
much more quickly.

	Olivier has my vote whenever he feels ready to request access from
Jason.

	I hope so. I don't like the idea of adding too many "you can't do this
during init functions" restrictions.

	The default X *is* really ugly. There isn't another choice that quite
satisfies me, though. The standard collection of X cursors could stand
some sprucing up. I wouldn't recommend the righr_ptr because of the
Motif habit of switching to that cursor when it expects you to do
something. This could be confusing or annoying to some users. The
disadvantage of the left pointer (otherwise probably the best choice) is
that I really like to see the cursor change when you enter a window or a
menu, and left_ptr is commonly used in this case. Most of the others are
either commonly used for specific purposes (like the watch) or are are a
bit quirky (i.e., very much subject to individual taste).

	Does anyone else have a favorite they'd like to recommend as the new
default?

	Oh, pain! It doesn't get them wrong, it doesn't get them at all!

	It looks like this one was never touched in the GSFR. I thought all the
modules with flag dependencies were getting compile errors left and
right, so I fixed all the ones that failed to build. I don't understand
why FvwmIdent continued to build...guess I'll have to look into it.  I
wonder if there are any others like that [shudder]....

	Oh, no...! FvwmIdent had all those old flag value defines coded inline

I'd recommend left_ptr, although you do have a valid point.  Perhaps the
best bet is to use a custom xpm as the default cursor (although this may
cause even more disagreement than the default X cursors ;)

Subject: BusyCursor addition, shaded titlebar bug report

First, the patch: 
The patch attached to this mail is just a small addition to the BusyCursor
code which allows the use of '*' to affect all of the options.  It's pretty
straightforward.

Second, the bug report:
When using pixmaps in the titlebar, the bottom border is drawn too high, and
is then overwritten by the pixmap.  The attached .gif is an example of this. 
Relevent statements from the configuration file:

TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 18 -- flat
AddTitleStyle TiledPixmap title-act.xpm
AddTitleStyle Inactive TiledPixmap title-inact.xpm -- flat

AddToFunc Move-or-Shade
+ "M" Move
+ "D" WindowShade

Mouse   1       T       N       Move-or-Shade


I poked around borders.c a while, but I'm really unfamiliar with that code,
so I had no luck finding the problem...
