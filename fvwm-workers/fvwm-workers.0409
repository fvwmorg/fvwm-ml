   Hi.  The definition of smr_SWITCH (in both acinclude.m4
and aclocal.m4) uses "m4_substr" and "m4_len", neither of
which exist in any m4 I know about.  (The three on my
Solaris 8 machine are /usr/ccs/bin/m4, /usr/xpg4/bin/m4,
and GNU m4 1.4.)

   Does this exist in some newer or more odd M4?  Shouldn't
we just use "substr" and "len"?

   The sign that this has failed is in the --help output of
the generated configure.  It contains the macro calls,
rather than the intended strings resulting from the
macro.

   Anyone know where these came from?  (And why there's
ones in both aclocal.m4, and acinclude.m4?)

                             - Chris

You need a more recent autoconf. This part is tricky, I know how to make
autoconf <= 2.13 happy and autoconf > 2.13 happy, but not both together.

If someone knows, feel free to fix this, but I don't think it worth
the effort. It only affects the --help output, and if the recent autoconf
is used to create releases, then the release will be ok.

Regards,
Mikhael.

   Well, at the very least, you could check which version of
autoconf is running, right?  And if it's <= 2.13, you can
redefine m4_substr and m4_len to substr and len, yes?

   I'll take a look into autoconf and see if I see how to
do this anywhere from inside of m4...

aclocal.m4 is generated from acinclude.m4 by aclocal that's from automake
(before this generated file is used by autoconf to generate ./configure).

   Excellent.  Thank you for that information.

   Okay, I've applied a fairly ugly patch to acinclude.m4.
It tears apart the AC_ACVERSION macro into the major and
minor number [string]s, and then if the minor number is
13, defines m4_substr and m4_len.  It works for me, and
I've tested that the macro leaves m4_* unset when I
hand-feed it a 2.51 instead of AC_ACVERSION.

   Unfortunately, m4 only knows about strings.  So, do
do a <= 2.13, I'd have to use syscmd() and sysval().
I could do that, but I wasn't sure it was worth the
effort.  But, I don't know what versions of autoconf
are likely to be in use.

   Let me know if anything like this would be acceptable.

   Thanks...

                        - Chris

Hello,

When working on metisse (http://insitu.lri.fr/~chapuis/metisse) and
related projects I added a few new features to FVWM. Maybe some can go
into the official 2.5.x tree as it does not seem that the tree is
really feature freezed. Just vote!

Here a full list of the difference between 2.5.x and the fvwm included
in metisse 0.3.4 (not yet released).

* New command SaveWindowPointerPosition: this command save the pointer
position relatively to the "current" window. You can restore this
position with a new option to the WarpToWindow cmd: "UseSavedPosition".
WarpToWindow UseSavedPosition 50 50 will either restore the pointer
position if saved or put the pointer in the middle of the window. 
My vote: I do not care.

* New command ShowCursor: draw a flashing circle around the cursor
during a fraction of time. I use this with some new options to
WarpToWindow: ShowCursor and ShowCursorOnSavedPosition.
My vote: I do not care. 

Example of use of these two cmd and these options to WarpToWindow: 

	DestroyFunc FuncFvwmSaveWindowPointerPosition
	AddToFunc   FuncFvwmSaveWindowPointerPosition
	+ I Silent All (HasPointer Focused) SaveWindowPointerPosition On
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break 1
	+ I Silent All (HasPointer) SaveWindowPointerPosition On
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break 1
	+ I Silent Current SaveWindowPointerPosition On

	DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
	AddToFunc   WindowListFunc
	+ I Iconify false
	+ I FlipFocus
	+ I Raise
	+ I WarpToWindow UseSavedPosition ShowCursorOnSavedPosition 10p 10p

	DestroyFunc MyAltTabFunc
	AddToFunc   MyAltTabFunc
	+ I FuncFvwmSaveWindowPointerPosition
	+ I WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease Meta_L

	Key Tab 	A	M	 MyAltTabFunc


* Support for _NET_SHOW_DESKTOP via a new command ShowDesktop bool: this
command, if bool is on, iconify all window not in the window skip list.
If bool is off the command uniconify all window iconified by a
"ShowDesktop On". This can be simulated by a fvwm function (by using
State) modulo stacking order problems. FVWM GNOME/KDE users will be
happy with the support of _NET_SHOW_DESKTOP. My vote: yes.

* A library "FTips" for implementing tips in modules. I used this
library to add tips to IconMan with a lot of options (I've even write
down the man page I can poste it). I used this library in the Pager
and I plan to use it to implement (multiline) tips in FvwmButtons.
My vote: yes (a step toward removing the FvwmTaskBar).

* New option MaxButtonWidth to FvwmIconman. My vote: yes
(an other step toward removing the FvwmTaskBar).

* New option -transient-window to the FvwmPager which causes FvwmPager
to be transient and to execute "Silent Current MoveToPage x y" or
"Silent Current MoveToDesk d" or "Silent Current MoveToDeskAndPage d x
y" in the place of the GotoPage, GotoDesk and GotoDeskAndPage usual
cmd. Optionally the usual GotoPage, GotoDesk and GotoDeskAndPage are
also executed. My vote: yes.

* The "execute totally immediate complex function even if we
cannot grab the pointer" patch. Should not be disputed here :o)

* There are others stuffs which are not stable enough.  Some new complex
stacking/focus policy related to text selection and dnd (these use
XRecord). TaskBar Launch buttons used all the rows. My vote: no.

* Some metisse specific stuff. New module msg MX_STARTSTOP_OPERATION,
MX_MODULE_INTERACTIVE_MOVE and MX_CLICK_MOTION mainly for non standard
operation and interactive move in FvwmAmetista. New msg for syncing
desk switching are incoming.  A new BugOpts option "MetisseWorkaround"
for small things. My vote: obviously no.

There have been quite a few people asking about this feature -- and while the
solution has been thus far to use xmessage, I can see this being quite a
popular one.

Of course, this is easily scripted by a FvwmFunction, I can see nothing wrong
in making it in-line Fvwm. An (odd) side-effect of this can also be achieved
using the command 'vdesk', as well.

I had no idea we were thinking of removing FvwmTaskBar -- indeed, I don't
think it should be removed, it is used by quite a lot of people.

I do not see how to make a ShowDesktop complex function which respects
the stacking order. The All (condition) command loop over the windows
following the "normal" list and not the "stacking" list. Maybe a "stack"
option should be added to certain conditional commands.

FvwmtaskBar is not so easy to maintain and if one day we can exactly
simulate the FvwmTaskBar with FvwmButtons + FvwmIconMan we may _discuss_
the removal of the FvwmTaskBar.

_NET_SHOW_DESKTOP support: yes; implementation with icons: no.  I
am almost sure using icons for this purpose will make more trouble
than it saves.  Instead, all windows should just be unmapped like
when they are on a different desk.  The checks for the current
desk are strewn all over the place, so this is no simple patch.

I don't very care too, but these seem to be isolated and easy changes, so
if you think these are tested well, my vote is more "Yes" than "No".

It is probably better to use "short" for new window fields. There is one
more unapplied patch that should use "short" not "int" as well. It is
good to keep fvwm smaller even if it is just a matter of several KB (this
is also potentially passed to all modules, so it should better be short).

Yes, if FvwmAnimate is on, mass-iconify may be problematic. This is why
I added "pause", "push" and "pop" messages to FvwmAnimate some time ago.

I can't say yet whether iconifying without iconified windows is good.

I suggest to rename the option to -transient-move, or -transient -move,
where -move is only relevant with -transient.

FvwmPager -transient-move is supposed to be bound to a window operation
menu, it nicely shows all pages and moves the window to the chosen page.

I just commited a patch to parse all man pages through config.status.

This involved renaming most *.1 files to *.1.in. Several man pages
appear to be auto-generated by Perl scripts:

./bin/fvwm-menu-directory.1
./bin/fvwm-menu-headlines.1
./bin/fvwm-menu-xlock.1
./bin/fvwm-perllib.1
./modules/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.1
./modules/FvwmDebug/FvwmGtkDebug.1
./modules/FvwmPerl/FvwmPerl.1
./modules/FvwmWindowMenu/FvwmWindowMenu.1

So I've not changed these.

I'm not sure if I need to make any further changes to complete this
patch. For example, when making a release, will scripts automatically
pickup the new *.1.in files & ignore the *.1 files?

SCoTT. :)

Hi all,

The current version of FVWM in CVS seg faults on my Xinerama system:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x080b6804 in FScreenInit (dpy=0x2b8300) at FScreen.c:444
444                     memcpy(screens_xi + 1, info,
(gdb) p info
$1 = (XineramaScreenInfo *) 0x0

It works fine if I configure X for single screen setup.

SCoTT. :)

that message).

I do not see which kind of problem we can have, but Animate like 
problem. Moreover, you can build a fvwm function which almost
do the show desktop feature, so it seems to me that if we get
problems by using icons for "show desktop" we will have to
fix it any way.

Indeed, I used these in the code.

No opinion too and I have not the time to implement the "show desktop"
feature using an other method than simple iconification.

I have a suggestion for a faq based on a question I see quite regulary
on the irc channel, something like this:

Q: Why does fvwm change my X Cursor theme?
A: It doesnt, there is a standard set of cursors that should always be 
available to applications, such as crosshair, left_ptr, arrow, pencil, etc. 
your theme should provide each of these cursors, but some dont. when 
something (eg, an application or fvwm) requests a cursor that your theme 
doesnt provide, X falls back to the default. If you are seeing fvwm using
cursors that dont match your theme, you should use CursorStyle to 
change to a cursor that is available, or find a more complete theme.
Note that fvwm doesnt control what cursors your applications request.

Is there any particular reason that

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org/home/cvs/fvwm login
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm


Would just hang indefinitely? This happened to me the first time I tried
this (four months ago), and again today, which makes me think there's
something wrong with the way I'm doing it.

Thanks.

CVS is definitely working, I just tried it.

Try installing a different version of cvs.  There is at least
one version that doesn't work.  We weren't able to figure out why.

Your client is probably out of date.  Some older clients don't talk
well with newer servers.  The FVWM CVS server is running 1.11.17.

Let's see if I understand this thread properly. (Tell me if I say
something incorrect.)

At the moment, whenever FVWM sends an M_ADD_WINDOW or M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW
packet, the last field in the packet is (effectively) a memcpy() of the
window_flags data-member from the ConfigWinPacket struct. The bit-value
of the window_flags data-member varies from compiler to compiler because
of byte alignment/padding, endianess, etc.

So the solution is to define precisely what each bit in a flags
field (of a packet) pertains to. This means that FVWM will carefully
"build" each bit in the flags field (selectively choosing only 50 or
so interesting flags from the window_flags struct). FVWM modules
that receive these packets now have to treat the flags field as
a specially-defined set of bits (relating directly to flags) instead
of a bundle of bits that fill a window_flags C struct.

Presumably we have to ensure that the 50 (or so) flags we decide to
export satisfy all the C FVWM modules. (Currently, the modules have
access to all 384 bits (on my platform) of the window_flags struct
& could potentially be using any of them.)

Re: perllib "breakage is auto-detected"

I'm not sure how perllib would detect the addition or removal of flags.

SCoTT. :)

Hi,

fvwm has quite some problems with AMD64, specifically module communication is wrong; for example the window_flags in  ConfigWinPacket 
do not get passed to modules (empty?) so FvwmIconMan and Pager or Identify show wrong info (iconified windows are still visible in pager or similar).. I would hazard a guess that the error is somewhere in
make_new_vpacket (fvwm/module_interface.c), probably due to some  conversion assumptions which do not work in 64bit env.. alas, fvwm was(is) my editior of choice but I can't spare the time fixing it myself..

Best,

Borut

Thanks, Dan and Jason. I've found this problem documented elsewhere on the
web, but no solution. It's a bit of a pain, since I work on a group of a
dozen machines that have 1.11.1p1 installed (thanks, RH7.3), but I'll work
around it.

Stupid broken interfaces.

Hm, yes.. however the package transport is still broken; specifically I 
think the stuff in 'newpackage' composition/conversion is faulty..
suggestions..?

Best,

Replace the last "instead of" with "together with" and you get what I
meant.

No, C modules still have the access to all flags. This is an intermediate
solution that would be relatively easy and cheap to implement, until the
real solution of actual replacing of the currently compiler dependent
flags is implemented (if at all).

Now, when I say 50, it may mean 40 or 60, anything less than 64; some
flags are 2 or more bits. And there is no reason not to also send the
third integer in addition to these two, that includes 32 window states.

When I spoke about breakage in that thread, I didn't refer to flags (they
were not changed), but to arguments of events (Dominik changed the order
and type/number of arguments). This may be partially auto-detected in
some tests. Anyway, this is not a big problem; as long as everyone writes
meaningful cvs log messages, the changes to module interface may be
detected by a man (me, you) and applied to perllib promptly.

Mikhael.

[I move this discussion to fvwm-workers@ not to scare readers.]

This is a good suggestion, but it adds more than 300 events to modules
even if they are not interested in window flag bits.

I am not against going this way although it is harder than my my
intermediate solution and still is not fully the ideal solution (that
would be not to dump and pass C structures across network). But again,
this is an acceptable solution.

But then, to be optimal we need a new event type MX_WINDOW_FLAG with
three arguments: short int bit_start, short int bit_length, char *name.

o [I move this discussion to fvwm-workers@ not to scare readers.]

Missed which list we were on. Thanks.

o This is a good suggestion, but it adds more than 300 events to modules
o even if they are not interested in window flag bits.

That's true, although 300 events on startup isn't so bad. I'm not sure how
often people ask for config info after that, though, so it is possible
that it adds a lot of overhead to some modules.

o I am not against going this way although it is harder than my my
o intermediate solution and still is not fully the ideal solution (that
o would be not to dump and pass C structures across network). But again,
o this is an acceptable solution.

I go back and forth about this. On the one hand, dumping the C structure
is the most efficient way to take care of shipping this kind of data. On
the other hand, my platform-independant psyche says "yech." I like the
idea of adding a new message, but only if it is heading toward a permanent
solution. What're you thinking about as an alternative to shipping the C
structure? I mean, I can think of a few, but they seem so grossly
inefficient (either in terms of space or computational overhead). I'd like
to think about this in the context of where this code is going, rather
than just the intermediate solution.

o But then, to be optimal we need a new event type MX_WINDOW_FLAG with
o three arguments: short int bit_start, short int bit_length, char
o *name.

Again, your experience wins out. I hadn't used any multi-bit flags.  This
will complicate the code, below. Not much, though.

I think that is too many messages.
The module should request the messages.
That is the only time the messages should be sent.

[I move this discussion to fvwm-workers@ not to scare readers.]

This is a good suggestion, but it adds more than 300 events to modules
even if they are not interested in window flag bits.

I am not against going this way although it is harder than my my
intermediate solution and still is not fully the ideal solution (that
would be not to dump and pass C structures across network). But again,
this is an acceptable solution.

But then, to be optimal we need a new event type MX_WINDOW_FLAG with
three arguments: short int bit_start, short int bit_length, char *name.

Maybe Dominik has another solution, but my "best" solution is something
like this. Send all bits packed by hand (not C structure), and send the
scheme using the described MX_WINDOW_FLAG event.

Advantages as compared to your solution:

  * sent data is not compiler specific
  * more network-optimal, currently window_flags contains some internal
    window state useful to fvwm only, it would not be sent

Disadvantages:

  * less performance-optimal, requires a work to pack flags
  * probably more difficult to maintain, but this is not clear yet
  * replacing the sent window_flags is a risky change

Both solutions are similar in that they require the same MX_WINDOW_FLAG
to define the scheme. Also, the Perl code written for one should not be
changed when switching to another.

So, I think, we may start with adding a new event and not changing any
existing events. Then later we may raise the question again of whether
the compiler specific format is good or not.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yeah, we're on the same page, for what my novice opinion is worth. The
only thing I would think wasteful is if we actually broke each flag out
into, say, a char value so it got across the network okay. In terms of
re-packing, you're going down the same path I was thinking, so here's what
I hit: how do you account for endianness? I guess we assert that the
messages are in network-byte-order, but that means that we will have to be
very careful about making sure that every platform gets its endianness
right when the data leaves.

With this in mind, MX_WINDOW_FLAG seems even more attractive (as opposed
to a generated perl file, since it will solve the problem for every
module, no matter the language).

Do we send it automatically, is there a request, or is it part of
config_info (that last one doesn't seem right)?

o [I move this discussion to fvwm-workers@ not to scare readers.]

Missed which list we were on. Thanks.

o This is a good suggestion, but it adds more than 300 events to modules
o even if they are not interested in window flag bits.

That's true, although 300 events on startup isn't so bad. I'm not sure how
often people ask for config info after that, though, so it is possible
that it adds a lot of overhead to some modules.

o I am not against going this way although it is harder than my my
o intermediate solution and still is not fully the ideal solution (that
o would be not to dump and pass C structures across network). But again,
o this is an acceptable solution.

I go back and forth about this. On the one hand, dumping the C structure
is the most efficient way to take care of shipping this kind of data. On
the other hand, my platform-independant psyche says "yech." I like the
idea of adding a new message, but only if it is heading toward a permanent
solution. What're you thinking about as an alternative to shipping the C
structure? I mean, I can think of a few, but they seem so grossly
inefficient (either in terms of space or computational overhead). I'd like
to think about this in the context of where this code is going, rather
than just the intermediate solution.

o But then, to be optimal we need a new event type MX_WINDOW_FLAG with
o three arguments: short int bit_start, short int bit_length, char
o *name.

Again, your experience wins out. I hadn't used any multi-bit flags.  This
will complicate the code, below. Not much, though.

Please don't worry about endianness, at least not in this thread.
Endianness and bits-in-the-integer is something that should be worried
in the lowest layer regardless of the event.

A module should set MX_WINDOW_FLAG xmask. And we probably need
SendWindowFlags (SendWindowFlagScheme?) command from modules.

Yes, you may start, just please preserve the coding style. I don't have
the hardware anyway.

True, although endianness is no more or less a problem than structure
alignment, which is what started this discussion.

Is anyone coding this, or should I start?

Of course. The last code snippet I wrote was off of a test program that

Hello,

I want to propose a patch which adds the styles
- NoTransientPlacement (use the current behaviour)
- TransientParentPlacement (pop up the transient in the center of the parent window)
- TransientPointerPlacement (pop up the transient at the pointer)
to fvwm. This patch was build against the fvwm-2.5.10 sources.

Kind regards
Carsten

Hello,

I found two bugs in my patch
(wrong PLACE_TRANSIENT_MASK and if instead of else if). Hence here is the improved version.

Kind regards

Hello,

I want to propose a patch which adds the styles
- NoTransientPlacement (use the current behaviour, default)
- TransientParentPlacement (pop up the transient in the center of the parent window)
- TransientPointerPlacement (pop up the transient at the pointer)
to fvwm. This patch was build against the fvwm-2.5.10 sources.

Kind regards
Carsten

OS: Redhat Linux 8.0

Submission from: (NULL) (53.122.197.194)



When tearing off a menu from a motif (2.2.2) menu,
the fvwm gets a SIGSEGV in Flocale.c:2321

It seems that the reason is an uninitialized variable:

Subject: Firefox Full Screen Issue

Full_Name: Hugo Haas
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: XFree86 4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (128.30.5.104)


Firefox randomly disappears, both from the screen and from the windows
list, when swiching on or off full screen mode.

This is basically the same issue which was reported early January 2004 by
Kingsly John:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0401/msg00020.html

It still is the case with 2.5.10 and Firefox 1.0PR.

Regards,

hugo

Subject: fvwm crashes when QUIT'ing firefox

Full_Name: George 'Nephrite' Potapov
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: FreeBSD-5.3BETA5
X_Server: Xorg-6.7.0
Submission from: (NULL) (217.171.1.2)


I'm using firefox 0.9.3
When I select file/quit from firefox menu, fvwm crashes and dumps core.
When closing firefox windows using 'Close' fvwm function, everithing's OK.
Happens every time, just start firefox and try to quit using firefox menu.

I'd think it's firefox issue unless fvwm dumped core :-)

Can you please fetch a stack trace and post it to the fvwm-workers
list?

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

Also, you may try a recent CVS snapshot.

I've written a function flib_unsetenv() that uses unsetenv if the
system has it.  If not, it calls putenv("name").  If that throws
an error or does not remove the variable, it is zeroed with
putenv("name=3D").

  Setenv foo

is now equivalent to

  Setenv foo ""

which sets an empty string.

GetNextToken is not bad at parsing empty strings.  It's the
documented behaviour on which many callers rely.  GetNextToken
never returns an empty string.  Changing that would entail tons
of crashes.
