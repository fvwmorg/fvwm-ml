Hum, I do not know if there is a documentation somewhere. This variable
is used by some programs in the gnu world to get the charset associated
to your locale if your libc does not have nl_langinfo which can do the
job (it seems that you do not have nl_langinfo). It can also be used to
override the charset returned by nl_langinfo.
Now, it is not used in mb support but in the ewmh support for iconv
conversion from/to UTF-8 and your charset. If you have iconv
you can get the list of charsets by using "iconv --list".
There are multiple problems here:

1 - FInitCharset is run by fvwm even if you do not have iconv
support (easy to fix).
2 - nl_langinfo may return a different charset than the "X charset".
3 - iconv is not an X function.

So nl_langinfo and iconv should not be used :o) but it does not
seem that there are obvious (portable) replacement (XFree >=4.0.2
has some Xutf8 functions, we may try to use if available).
I will try to fix these problems progressively. I begin to understand
the X i18n stuff. Any way these problems are small and these concern
only applications with ewmh support (but these should be fixed).

	Please, please, please don't use Xutf8*() functions -- they are
absolutely unportable.  They were introduced due to the inadequacy (sp?)
of the current X locale model: only one locale at one moment, so Xutf8*()
are "current-locale"-independent.  But their unportability completely
outweighs their advantage.

Of course.  What I wanted to point out is that I get warnings if I
compile with optimization, and I don't get warnings if I turn off
optimization.  There should be no relationship between warnings
and optimizitaion.

Still you didn't described an example where this would be required. I can
invent artificial examples, but I want to see a real-life one where using
FVWM_DATADIR for system stuff and FVWM_USERDIR for user's is not enough.

we (that is Institute for Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway)
have sitewide fvwm setup for all new users. Installed on at least 2
different architectures as of now... using a highly modularised setup,
where users can customize parts of the setup by making their own files
in FVWM_USERDIR, these would otherwise be included from the global
setup directory (same for all architectures). Other stuff from the
fvwm distribution would be included from FVWM_DATADIR.

So you don't need more than one directory in IncludePath like I expected.

You want the situation #1:

  * The system stuff in /usr/share/fvwm-includes that is not FVWM_DATADIR
  * Have this command in user or system fvwmrc:
      IncludePath /usr/share/fvwm-includes

I suggest the situation #2:

  * The system stuff in FVWM_DATADIR, i.e. `fvwm-config --fvwm-datadir`
    (by default datadir is a shared directory)

For me (and probably for you) #2 is preferable, because it does not
require to add a hard coded path to configs.

My point is that if even fvwm-themes (pretty modular and fully
configurable setup) does not require IncludePath, maybe it is not needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is there a reason you don't want to put the global stuff in
FVWM_DATADIR?

up to seven differen flavours of unix, spred over 2-3 different
locations. i would think it would be nicer to keep our sitewide setup
seperate from files installed by fvwm.

I'd just like to point out that fvwm already has everything it needs to
create a set of configuration gui's due to Dan's enhancements of the
FvwmForm module to enable them to read & write to file. A couple of
years ago I actually attempted to utilise this method to create a
complete config tool but received very little or no interest.

Eventually I was persuaded to abandon the project in favour of the new
fvwm-themes project, but I'm hoping to now ressurect it to create some
gui config tools for fvwm-themes.

I attach a simple form to configure the FvwmWinList module as an
example. This form is still just an example and should be optimised at
some stage but it works. Invoke it normally as Module FvwmForm
FvwmForm-WinList then once you have saved your settings it should
automatically reload them upon each invocation a la FvwmForm-Form.

This method would enable building a config tool without the need for any
other software other than fvwm itself. Perhaps FvwmScript's capabilities
of swallowing other forms and scripts could be used to keep the suite of
gui's tidy?

I left a "dont understand" comment in mod_f2m_communication.html.
What "id" is it referring to?
Use short sentences.

Fvwm1 hasn't been changed in a very long time.
We don't provide any support for Fvwm1.
Upgrade to Fvwm2.

And it should be on by default.  The ConfigFvwmDefaults file has
this line:

  Style * GrabFocusTransient, LowerTransient, RaiseTransient, StackTransientParent

So probably ConfigFvwmDefaults is not installed properly on your
site.

Hi All,
	Here's a patch to make FvwmButtons understand this:

FvwmCommand "SendToModule FvwmButtons Title 5 You have Mail!"

Buttons are numbered from 0 and are in the order in your config file 
(containers don't count). It only works with buttons that have a title 
in the config file (could be " ") and I haven't tested it with anything 
other than a simple button (just a title, no icon or swallows).

I've stuffed the new code into FvwmButtons.c which is probably the wrong 
place.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS I think I can get rid of all my swallowed (non-fvwm) apps except 
xload with this.

I looked at the various codesets iconv supports to try to figure out
a default value.

It looks like if  CHARSET is not set,  is should default to ISO_8859-1
(on Linux).

On Solaris and AIX, the default should be ISO8859-1.

On HPUX, it looks like it should be either "amere", "iso81", or "engle".

I'd be happy if it just didn't print any warning.

I think you'll find that PipeRead is the best way to deal with
multiple UNIX flavors and common configuration files.

Do there are bad or only unprotable? If there are bad only because
there are not protable this may be fixed as xterm do: xterm has
a file with these functions in the case the "locale" Xlib does
not have it (xterm -u8 work fine with XFree-3.3.6 and old glibc).

What happen is that for ewmh support fvwm should deal with
utf8 strings for window names: a window can gives its names
with an UTF-8 string and fvwm should set on the window
the names that it really used in UTF-8 (this name may be
different form the original window name: xterm, xterm (1),
xterm (2) ...). Moreover, more and more utf-8 strings will
appear in the future.

So now what we should do for performing conversion?
In the average (lib)iconv seems to give good result but
it speaks an other language than X. Maybe the Xutf8*
function may help at some points? Any other ideas?
Also what to do for displaying directly utf8 strings
(with a libc which does not support utf8 locales)?
Is XRender/Xft can do that? Really any suggestion is
welcome. But, any way at the present time the most
important thing is to centralize all the fvwm text
rendering and locale stuff in 2 or 3 libs file so that
we can really works on all this locale stuff which is
a real (interesting) mess IMHO.

Yes, you're right of course. I was trying out the freshly compiled fvwm
from the source dir so ConfigFvwmDefaults wasn't found.

I seems to me however that the combination of MouseFocusClickRaises and
MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotion is a little undeterministic. If I select
text in one xterm, which is on top and then click on another xterm,
it raises but selection is kept. However, if I then click on the first
xterm again, it raises but selection is lost. Not really a problem, but
it would be neater to have an option which sets this, either the click
is passed to the window that is raised or it isn't.

I also would really like a configurable MouseFocusClickRaises, to choose
which button(s) raises...

That doesn't work as you think.  The buttons are counted from left
to right, top to bottom:

Regardless if I use

  *FvwmButtons(5x1+0+0, Action `Menu RootMenu`)
  *FvwmButtons(5x1+5+0, Action `Menu ModuleMenu`)

or

  *FvwmButtons(5x1+5+0, Action `Menu ModuleMenu`)
  *FvwmButtons(5x1+0+0, Action `Menu RootMenu`)

the RootMenu button always gets 0 and the ModuleMenu button gets
1.  I think the numbering is based on the position of the button.
My FvwmButtons looks like this:

  --------------------------------------------------
  |    |    |    | ||        ||         |          |
  ------------------|        |----------|          |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |        |          |          |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |        |          |          |
  ------------------|        |          |          |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |        |----------|          |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |        |          |          |
  --------------------------------------------------

It can be quite difficult to find ot the correct button numbers.

Do buttons inside containers count too?

I lika that patch :-)  Consider it applied.  The next logical
thing to do would be to change the pixmap of a button.

Please don't forget to include ChangeLog entries and the man page.

The first 3 man pages are autogenerated from perl scripts.

Actually, fvwmrc was used intentionally to specify any fvwm config file,
not just .fvwm2rc. Never mind.

Any reason not to use a symlink for this?

Example: at work we have a sitewide apache build installed (through magic)
in /opt/apache. But naturally an individual server has its own config and
logs.  The build-from-source was done with "--prefix=3D/opt/apache-1.3.23",
and so the daemon believes its configs are in /opt/apache-1.3.23/conf
and so forth.

But post install I moved the conf dir to conf-dist and make conf a
symlink to /var/apache/conf. On machines actau=7F=7Fually running apache
one then makes /var/apache and copies conf-dist into the conf subdir
and customises.

Similarly for your setup you would have the config stuff (architecture
independent) symlinked to a central spot. Would this not work?

It is the id of the top level window of the module. I've replaced
id with window id. I hope it is ok now.

How to set this default? Do we have "cpp variables" which allows to write
down somthing like:

#ifdef SYS_A
#define DEFAULT_CHARSET   "FOO"
#endif
#ifdef SYS_B
#define DEFAULT_CHARSET    "XYZ"
#endif

...etc in libs/defaults.h ?

Why are you against such warning? This may help to debug
the (experimental) iconv stuff. For example, with the error
message you send to me I can see that you do not have
nl_langinfo and  that no iconv conversion will be performed
at all. On the other hands, we can document our use
of the CHARSET variable. But as our UTF-8 support is not
finalized this should wait a bit. Any way, if you really want
I can suppress such warnings now or only in the future beta
version of 2.5.x.

Hello,

I've just installed fvwm2.4 at my site, and wanted to send you a
report on my experience.  The report has turned out to be rather
long -- you can read it or not, as you please.  By the end I
explain why I think I can't afford to replace v2.2 with v2.4.
(I'm installing v2.4 alongside 2.2.)

I'm glad that there are people working on fvwm.  I like using the
windowmanager.  But I had some frustrations with this latest
version, and wish that I hadn't had them.



Broadly speaking, my frustration falls in two categories:
sysadmin's frustration with the build system, and end-user's
frustration with trying to upgrade to fvwm2.4.



My sysadmin frustration is relatively minor.  Two points of the
build system were responsible for most of it.  One was the fvwmbug
shell script, and the other was the awkwardness of trying to install
the program with the --program-suffix option to configure.

The fvwmbug shell script hardcodes the username of the user who
compiled fvwm2 into the script.  This really should be
configurable.  I don't want personal bug reports any more than
you want personal bug reports, and I should have the ability to
configure which address "local" bug reports go to.  (I worked
around the issue by setting $USER to the target email address
during the build.  Ick.)

The --program-suffix option would have been useful, because I wanted
to install this fvwm as "fvwm2.4" to prevent users from running it
accidentally.  I couldn't use --program-suffix, though, because
it transforms the names of all of fvwm's modules in addition to
transforming the name of the fvwm2 binary.  A module named
"FvwmPager.4" doesn't work, when the config file is trying to
run "FvwmPager".  (I worked around this issue by hand-editing
fvwm/Makefile after running "configure" but before running
"make install".  The "transform" variable I added worked, but I
wish I could have specified at the configure stage.)

On the bright side, I definitely appreciated the INSTALL.fvwm file.
It gave useful information about where components would end up when
installed, and saved me a lot of time that might otherwise have been
spent crawling through the Makefiles trying to divine how they
worked.




My end-user style of frustration came when I tried testing the new
fvwm2, to see how it would work for our users (who have been using
version 2.2.2 before now).  I'm sad to say that most of them will
continue using 2.2.2 for the near future, because I don't have time
to handle the cost of upgrading them.  The most problematic issue is
the config file changes, but another nuisance is fvwm's readiness to
scream "ERROR!" at users.


One backwards-incompatible change in the config files that bit me
is the change in how titlebar buttons are defined.  My current
system.fvwm2rc file, used with fvwm 2.0 and 2.2, has lines of the form:

Key     F6      WTSFI1357924680 M       Move

I wanted M-F6 to always invoke Move, and the manpage explicitly
claimed that a context of "A" stood for "any context except for
title-bar buttons", so I included title-bar buttons in the Key
binding's context.  In version 2.4, this Key binding has the
side-effect of *creating* all ten title-bar buttons.  I can fix the
global system.fvwm2rc file by using a context of "A", but this won't
help users who have personal files based on modifications to the
system one.  They will suddenly be faced with titlebars with too
many buttons.



They will also be faced with another nuisance: screaming <<ERROR>>
messages.  Fvwm will yell ERROR at users who use xbm images.
("<<ERROR>> XpmReadFileToXpmImage failed"), at users who have Key
bindings for foreign-platform keys ("<<ERROR>> No such key: SunF37"),
or at users who use v2.2-style config files ("<<ERROR>> IconPath is
deprecated", and "<<ERROR>> Please replace 'GlobalOpts
MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise' with 'Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff'")

There's nothing wrong with config file changes, as long as
backwards-compatibility is maintained for a reasonable number of
release versions.  Given that GlobalOpts hasn't spent any time in the
deprecated state, I'm irked to see it marked as obsolete.  And is it
really a [Fvwm]<<ERROR>> to use a deprecated line, such as IconPath?





If I just drop this new version of fvwm on top of the old
installation, users will send email complaining of how the new
one is broken, and of how it keeps telling them about ERRORs.
I won't let someone sit at their computer one morning only to
discover that they'll need to spend their morning fixing their
dotfiles for today's new version of fvwm.

I have had requests to install the new version, so I've done so, but
it's sitting off to the side of the old version, named "fvwm2.4"
instead of "fvwm2".  That way people won't be able to accidentally
run it, and when they do explicitly run it, they'll be able to
put off upgrading their v2.2 config until they have time to do so.



In closing, thanks for working on fvwm.  I've been using it as
my main windowmanager for the past four years.  I'd love to see
it become more of a mainstream windowmanager and less of a
bleeding-edge windowmanager, but in order for that to happen,
fvwm will have to be more careful about backwards compatibility,
and about spewing diagnostic output.


Sincerely,

 Jacob Morzinski                                jmorzins@mit.edu

Hello,

I recall the problem:

If the locale gives a charset != ISO-8859-1 (or a subset of this
charset) and if the title of an application with i18n support
has non ASCII characters then the application gives a COMPOUND_TEXT
WM_NAME hints (same for the icon title).
So if fvwm is compiled without multibyte support the window title
contains string(s) of the form ?*ISO8859-15?* as the WM_NAME is
taken as a STRING.
Notes: - ISO-8859-1 is now obsolete in the all Europe
       - It seems that it is not easy to filter a COMPOUND_TEXT string
         by hands

Possible fix:
1) compile fvwm with --enable-multibyte.
2) apply the attached patch

I do not think that 1) is acceptable in the view of the state
of the I18N_MB patch (e.g., it gives memory divergence). This
patch should be used only when it is really needed (for multibyte
charset).
So, I think that I/we should apply the attached patch (+ appropriate
NEWS and ChangeLog) to 2.4.6. The patch add a new config.h variable
WEAK_I18N_SUPPORT hard coded to 1 (see below). If WEAK_I18N_SUPPORT
is defined then, fvwm2 call setlocale at initialization and non STRING
WM_[ICON_]NAME are converted using the XmbTextPropertyToTextList
function. This fix the problem (on well configured machine) and
allows fvwm to be usable with any 8bits charset without
--enable-multibyte.
One objection (from Dan) is that the use of XmbTextPropertyToTextList
causes some system to load an additional library for nothing. With the
patch you should edit config.h and comment out the WEAK_I18N_SUPPORT
line to prevent this.

So, here what I propose:
If there are no objection I will apply the patch.
Dan if you think a --disable-foo option is needed for disabling the
patch I can add it.
If there are objection(s) I will apply the patch with WEAK_I18N_SUPPORT
off by default and add a config option --enable-foo to enable the patch.

My problem with the configure option is (i) find the good name for
"foo" and (ii) document this option in INSTALL.fvwm.

Of course any comments on the patch is welcome. It is not
pretty but it is "minimal".

Olivier

At my site, I install every Fvwm release in a directory that includes
the release number.  The only copy of Fvwm in the users path
is a shell that adds Fvwm
to the users path, picks the release to run, and then invokes Fvwm.

For the 2.4 installation, the shell noticed that the user had
no .fvwm/.fvwm2rc, had a .fvwm2rc and ran fvwm24_convert.
fvwm24_convert will take care of those error messages.

I had a few site specific  issues that fvwm24_convert didn't deal with
and slightly modified fvwm24_convert before using it.

Another thing the shell does is detect first use of a new release
and send email to the user about the features.

Run configure tests using iconv trying to find the one that works?

I just didn't want to see the  warning generated in official releases,
we'll get loads of email about it.  As long as 2.5.x is an unsupported
release, its OK.

I'd like to fix the mess I made, but I'm not clear on the process.
The instruction in fvwm-menu-xlock.in isn't it:

#   pod2man -c "Fvwm Utility" fvwm-menu-xlock | nroff -man | less -e

The Changelog mentions the make target, _fvwm-menu-xlock.1 but that
doesn't work in the source or target directory.

The command:

 pod2man -c "Fvwm Utility" fvwm-menu-xlock.in > fvwm-menu-xlock.1

in the source directory comes pretty close.  We must be running different
versions of pod2man because my .IX records are at the end of
the file and a lot of stuff is indented differently.

> pod2man --version
Unknown option: version
/usr/bin/pod2man: Usage error!
usage: /usr/bin/pod2man [options] podpage
Options are:
	--section=manext      (default "1")
	--release=relpatch    (default "perl 5.005, patch 03")
	--center=string       (default "User Contributed Perl Documentation")
	--date=string         (default "3/Feb/2002")
	--fixed=font	      (default "CW")
	--official	      (default NOT)
	--lax                 (default NOT)

I understand your point about a generic "fvwmrc" and I wouldn't have
changed this if we didn't get a comment about it being confusing.

Sorry, no suggestions why "make" does not work for you.

But unless you create a new documentation section, you don't need to
regenerate anything. Just do the same word replace in the .in files too.

We use perl 5.6.x, it's pod2man generates a bit richier man pages.

you could, but that too would be more work than just have FVWM search
an additional path (taken from IncludePath or perhaps $FVWM_INCLUDE).

when i think about it $FVWM_INCLUDE would be really nice... that way
we could just set that variable depending on the users type and
location.

If thats what you want, you already have it:

Setenv X /usr/local/myconfig
Read $[X]

$X can be exported before Fvwm starts too.

Hello,

Here a proposal for an "API" for font loading and for displaying
string. Any comments welcome before I start the changes.

Before two questions:

The menus code use only XTextWidth and never XmbTextEscapement.
Are there good reasons to do not use XmbTextEscapement (via some ifdef)?

Does a font cache will be useful?

Olivier

and the will seach the given path for files i include from the config?

what i wanted $FVWM_INCLUDE to do was too add a directory to the
include path, after FVWM_USERDIR, before FVWM_DATADIR.

The X server already caches fonts, so an fvwm font cache needs to
cache only the information about the fonts that would have to be
queried from the server.  To me, it seems to be a good idea to do
this in order to reduce network traffic.

Looks good this far.  But let's rename I18N_MB to something that
makes more sense.  Also, I'd use "FFontStruct" instead of
"FvwmFont" to indicate that it's our replacement for XFontStruct.

Again, I'd use a different name since it is *not* an exact
replacement for XDrawString (the parameters are different).  The
idea I had in mind with the F... names was to replace 'X' with 'F'
if - and only if - the object is our own replacement for
functionally identical object in X.  If the parameter list is
different, I'd indicate that by giving it a different name.

Ok.

In addition, I'd prefix all the names from Flocale.h with
"Flocale" (only those that don't have an X->F name of course)

  FlocaleWinString
  FlocaleAllocateWinString
  FlocaleFont
  FlocaleLoadFont
  ...

BTW, the font handling functions should probably be moved into
Flocale.

Francly speaking, I do not understand, what are you about. May be you
do not want to keep mmultiple XFontStructs for, e.g., "fixed"? I am
very sure xlibs gives you the same XFontStruct for second and
successive queries of already loaded fonts.

Well, you probably already realize that an environment variable
can serve as a generalized read path, but:

Setenv X /usr/local
Read $[X]/myconfig

In "myconfig":

Read $[X]/anotherconfigfile

...

Read $[X]/anotherconfigfile/inasubdirectory

but I still think you should be looking at PipeRead.
PipeRead will read configuration from anywhere you like and
provides the necessary flexibility to tailor the Fvwm configuration
as its read.

Does this patch work if you have multiple instances of FvwmButtons
running?  For example, I sometimes have a number of FvwmButtons, one
that shows system names and swallows FvwmPager, another that swallows
FvwmIconMan and has "task bar" type buttons, etc.  Without assigning
names to buttons, how does FvwmButtons know which "button 5" is to be
changed?

Maybe to help, FvwmButtons could assign as "name" to a particular
button:

    *FvwmButtons(Icon status.xpm, Action 'beep', Title ' ', Name 'status')

    FvwmCommand "SendToModule FvwmButtons Title status 'I am up!'"

This way, you won't need to keep track of the internal button numbers.

Just a suggestion, anyway.

Yes, just use the alias name instead of "FvwmButtons" to send the change 
to only one of them.

As Dominik say this font cache can be useful to prevent  unuseful
multiple call to  XCreateFontSet/XLoadQueryFont. Also, in my machine

add memory to fvwm2 (around 10kb with a few xterm only) and really I
do not think that the problem is a pure fvwm problem (it just seems
that XFreeFontSet does not do its job).

One of my idea is that when fvwm will load a font either font or
fontset should be 0 at the end of the loading (font will never
be the XFontsOfFontSet of fontset). If fontset is not null the Xmb*
functions will be used and if font is not NULL XDrawString/TextWidth
will be used (the gc's will be set as needed). I do not see why a line
as

    Style "an-app" -a-funny-font-that-my-locale-dont-have-iso8859-1  

should give the "fixed" locale font. If a user add a charset
to its font I do not see why we should reject its query
(BTW, KDE app bother me because they never use the fonts
I specify). Maybe this will does not work, if it is the case
this will be easy to change.

Your motivations are rather obvious, but I thing before implementation
of mixed Xmb- and X- DrawString it will be good to get version where
only one Xmb-, or X- works, and then think if we need mixed one.

Hi Dominik,
	I'm just wondering if tear of menus would be better off in a module? 
Making fvwm create its own top level windows makes it more vulnerable to 
being killed (try xkill when you don't have anything important on 
screen). I seem to remember scwm having the same problem, I'm not sure 
what they did.

Is it possible to fork and reopen the display?

Cheers,
Tim.

I'd be much happier if the menu code was clean enough to be put in
a module.  It's too tightly woven into fvwm right now and that
causes a lot of problems with tear off menus.  At the moment, fvwm
can not do anything useful while in a menu without risking
crashes.  This is one of the reasons for the brain dead focus
handling with tear off menus (needs keyboard input but grabs the
keyboard itself instead of using the normal focus policy).

I don't think so.  The forked process loses the connection to the
original fvwm and can't trigger any menu actions without
interfering.  No, if we need a second process it must be a regular
module.

I'm open for any ideas how to solve this, but we should postpone
this discussion for two or three weeks.  I still have to do some
more basic work on tear off menus until the end of the week.
After that I'll be skiing for about ten days.  After that there is
plenty of time to thinks about it.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

	It's not mozilla, xterms have the same problem. It's like some of the

Full_Name: Markus Schwarzenberg
Version: 2.4.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.7
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (153.96.96.2)


Both FvwmWinList transient and FvwmIconMan transient
make fvwm segfaulting when trying to de-iconify an 
iconified window which is shown in their window list:

The (complete!) .fvwm2rc to reproduce this is simple: 

  Mouse 1 1 N Close
  Mouse 1 2 N Iconify true
  Mouse 1 R A FvwmWinList Transient

Start fvwm2. Open some windows (xterm, for example) and 
iconify a couple of them. Now, when Mouse 1 Btn is hit on the root 
window, the window list pops up. Now click an entry of this list 
for an iconified window: fvwm2 dies with a segfault, emmitting 
the following message (generated in module_interface.c):

[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor from
'FvwmWinList Tra
nsient':
- data available=Y
- terminate signal=N

[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor from '

I'm not quite shure (but I think so) wether the first of these 1.5 
error messages comes from a first (of the same session) try where 
fvwm2 still didn't crash.

This happens with FvwmIconMan and FvwmWinList, so I suppose it's
not (only) a problem of these modules but an fvwm2 internal problem.

It core dumps in PositiveWrite:

      if (rc <= 0 || read(channel, &targetWindow, sizeof(targetWindow))
           != sizeof(targetWindow))
      {
        /* Doh! Something has gone wrong - get rid of the offender!! */
        fvwm_msg(ERR, "PositiveWrite",
                 "Failed to read descriptor from '%s':\n"
                 "- data available=%c\n"
                 "- terminate signal=%c\n",
#ifndef WITHOUT_KILLMODULE_ALIAS_SUPPORT
                 pipeAlias[module]
                   ? CatString3(pipeName[module], " ", pipeAlias[module])
                   : pipeName[module],
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#else
                 pipeName[module],
#endif
                 (FD_ISSET(channel, &readSet) ? 'Y' : 'N'),
                 isTerminated ? 'Y' : 'N');
        KillModule(module);
        break;
      }

Further up un PositiveWrite(), fvwm gets a DeadPipe signal from
the closing transient module which destroys pipeAlias[module]
and pipeName[module].  Fvwm should detect that situation and not
even throw an error message.

Well, it's meant only for bug reports going to us.  Everybody can

That is because it's better to scream "ERROR" than to confront
users with broken config files that no longer work without a clue.
Most of the new error messages address commands or features that
are planned to phase out when fvwm-3.0 is released (whenever this
may be).

I see.  The man page is incorrect.  'A' matches any context,
including buttons.  I'm sorry if that has lead to

That's not a side effect but exactly what was always intended.
All title buttons that have a binding show up.  By accident,
before 2.4, only mouse bindings activated the buttons.

Title buttons can be suppressed with the NoButton style:

  Style * Nobutton 6, NoButton 7

etc.  Of course you'd have to change config files too.

See my comment above.  I fail to see why it should be better to
let users run into these problems without a hint what has gone
wrong.

We can't give much more of a hint than this.  GlobalOpts *will*
vanish some day and then the users would have to find out on their
own what to do.  BTW, there is a perl script that does most of the
conversions from 2.2 to 2.4 (utils/fvwm24_convert).

When developing we always have to make decisions about efficiency
vs. compatibility.  Sometimes we make decisions agains the latter
to be able to have progress at all.

If you think that 'main stream' means 'constant feature set and no
bug fixes' then you'd better use a different window manager.
Fvwm is constantly changing, and sometimes its simply necessary
to not be compatible.

Hm, when I run applications that you call 'main stream' my console
usually shows dozens or even hundreds of error messages ;-)

I'll try to break up these issues, to make them more manageable.

What I was trying to say is that I want bug reports, but I don't want 
the email to be directed to me personally -- I want it to go to 
windowmanagers@mit.edu.  How do my users know to edit the sender 
information, to add that to the header when they select the "both" or 
the "local" destination options?  I argue that the fvwmbug script should 
not hardcode username of its installer; it should use a configurable value.

Hardcoding "jmorzins" into the local address is as bad as hardcoding 
"dominik.vogt@gmx.de" into the global address -- we might both be 
interested in reading the local/global mail, but we shouldn't be the 
_only_ people reading the local/global mail.  It should go to a list.

Ok, in the next releases the local address will be taken from
$FVWM_BUGADDR if set in the installation time. It seems that you are the
first one not happy with the current default.

Until then, you as a sysadmin should edit this script to suit your
system to the best advantage. Or set $USER instead of $FVWM_BUGADDR.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thank you.  It would be lovely if that is specified in the installation 
instructions, but even if it isn't, people will no longer shudder at 
having to set $USER to an email address.

My "error message" frustration is a mix of issues.  One aspect, which 
your response primarily addressed, is the issue of introduction of new 
features and deprecation of old features.  Another aspect is the 
decision of when to produce a diagnostic message, and whether to mark 
the diagnostic message as an error, a warning, or something else.  A 
third aspect is that particular things are producing diagnostic messages 
when they absolutely should not be.




First aspect: new features and old features

> If you think that 'main stream' means 'constant feature set and no
> bug fixes' then you'd better use a different window manager.
> Fvwm is constantly changing, and sometimes its simply necessary
> to not be compatible.


I hope that you were merely typing quickly, instead of really thinking 
that I'm that simplistic.  Mainstream does not mean "stasis".  New 
features are good, and bug fixes are very good, and both can happen 
whenever they want to happen.  The crucial thing about good release 
engineering is that deletion of _old_ features needs to careful and 
(hopefully) slow.

GlobalOpts was a minor issue.  In case my point was unclear, I'll 
clarify that my objection is not the removal of GlobalOpts, it's that 
GlobalOpts is *already* removed, without spending a release being 
deprecated.  Anyway, it's not worth arguing about; now that it's 
obsoleted, let it stay obsoleted.

New features are good.  Removal of old features is fine.  But please, 
deprecate things before obsoleting them (and only obsolete them on a 
major release).



Second aspect: diagnostic messages

A deprecated config file option should produce either no output, or a 
warning.  An obsolete config file option should produce either no 
output, or an error.  My concern is that fvwm is being sloppy about the 
distinction between errors and warnings, with a minor concern that it is 
producing more output than it needs to.  Both of these are judgment 
calls; my point of view follows:

For the distinction between errors and warnings, it is good style for a 
computer to be consistent in its behavior, and errors and warnings have 
traditionally had specific meanings.  An error is issued when a program 
absolutely cannot perform a task, and a warning is issued when the 
program thinks it can do it, but needs to tell the user something. 
Since deprecated config options still work, it is not an error to use 
one.  Use of an obsolete config option is an error.

My personal preference is that deprecated options produce no output and 
obsolete options produce output, just in the interest of keeping the 
user's life simple.  They want the computer to Just Work, so I don't 
want to show them error messages until I have really important ones. 
This is merely personal preference; there are certainly arguments to be 
made in favor of producing diagnostic output for deprecated options.

But please, don't produce ERROR messages for deprecated options, or for 
other non-fatal situations.  It confuses the user, and teaches them that 
fvwm's messages are not worth reading.


 >>fvwm will have to be more careful ... about spewing diagnostic output.
[...]
 > Hm, when I run applications that you call 'main stream' my console
 > usually shows dozens or even hundreds of error messages ;-)

You haven't named the application, so I can't confirm whether I would 
call it mainstream.  But I question the wisdom of showing hundreds of 
error messages -- the user will either ignore the messages, or dump them 
to /dev/null (as we do for Gnome crap).  Fvwm isn't this bad, of course; 
I'm just trying to apply pressure to hope that it never becomes so.





Third aspect: particular points which SHOULD NOT produce complaints

  Two points are particularly bad: xbm files, and missing keysyms.


Fvwm2.4 will print a complaint each time it loads a xbm file.  As a 
policy issue, does fvwm support xbm files or not?  If it does, it 
shouldn't complain when it loads one (and the complaint certainly 
shouldn't be an ERROR, since the load succeeds).

The complaint is "<<ERROR>> XpmReadFileToXpmImage failed".  There's a 
simple techincal reason for the diagnostic complaint (fvwm tries the xpm 
loader before trying the xbm loader).  But from a policy point of view, 
a program that supports xbm's should not complain when it successfully 
loads an error-free file.



Fvwm2.4 will also print a complaint message when a config file Key 
binding refers to a keysym that is not present on the current X server.
I can conceive of this having some advantage, as a guard against typos 
in Key bindings in the config file.  This advantage is outweighed by a 
disadvantage: it breaks on cross-platform config files.

Some sites have multiple platforms and also have network filesystems; 
users can use different computers, but have the same home directory 
across all of them.  With one homedir, the user will have one .fvwm2rc 
file wherever they go.  Since different platforms have different sets of 
keysyms, it is best for fvwm to politely ignore keysyms that it can't 
find on the current X server.

For a specific example: I raise windows with Meta-F12.  The "F12" key is 
keysym <F12> on a Linux machine but is <SunF37> on a Solaris machine 
(the "Again" key is keysym <F12>).  The obvious solution is to put both 
a "Key F12" and a "Key SunF37" line in my config file, and this solution 
worked fine with fvwm2.0 and fvwm2.2.  In 2.4, if I sit down at a Linux 
keyboard I receive an error message: "<<ERROR>> No such key: SunF37".

A slew of Sun keys are not present on a PC keyboard; I know that the PC 
WinKey and MenuKey are not present on Sun keyboards, and other keyboards 
out in the wild almost certainly have their own special keys too.

The error message happens *every* time the user starts fvwm, and grows 
old after a few viewings.  If it were the result of a typo, the user 
could fix the typo to stop the warning.   If the user used a deprecated 
command, the user could update the command to stop the warning.  But 
there's no way to unify the keyboards of different hardware.  The better 
option is for fvwm to assume that the user correctly specified Key's 
keysym, and accept the line.




That's about it for my "error message" frustration.  I'm most concerned 
about fvwm producing ERROR messages for simple things like loading xbm 
images or foreign-platform keys, but also wish that it would be more 
conservative about its use of error messages in general.



Sincerely,
  Jacob Morzinski

	Hi!

	I've just downloaded fvwm-snap-20020206 and tried to compile it
with installdir ~/usr/ .  The commandline was

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr

	There was a line in configure output:

checking for gnomeConf.sh file in /export/ring1/bolkhov/usr/lib... not found

(my $HOME is /export/ring1/bolkhov) and finally a

  With GNOME support in FvwmGtk?      no: Can't find working gnome-config

	There is /usr/lib/gnomeConf.sh, so I modified the command line to

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr --with-gnome-libs=/usr/lib/

but that had no effect -- configure still looks in ~/usr/lib/.  I've
skimmed through the script itself, and there's a code to set $gnome_prefix
to the argument of --with-gnome-libs, but later there's some alchemy with
--with-gnome, which probably overrides the value of $gnome_prefix.

	Not that I care about Gnome, but just for correctness...  Am I
missing something, or is there really a mistake in configure script?

Probably a bug in the configure script.  According to the
documentation --prefix sets only the install path.  You can get
Gnome support running with --with-gnome-libs and
--with-gnome-includes (I hope).

It isn't.  GolbalOpts is still there.  If it were you would simply
get a "No such command" error message without any hint what to do
about it.  Right now GlobalOpts is in the state you call
'deprecated'.  I've never seen a proper definition of 'deprecated' and
'obsolete'.  For me, both have the same meaning.

Of course we do.  One thing we could thing about would be an
option to turn off the warnings about commands that do not work
properly anymore or that will phase out some day.

Yes, you're right and I'm aware of that issue.  The problem here
is that nobody has ever designed these error messages, so some
commands produce errors and some do not.

> My personal preference is that deprecated options produce no output

I think that's a bit short sighted.  As a user I prefer to get
warnings while the feature still works so I can choose when I fix
them.  When the feature is already gone I have no choice anymore.

Perhaps we'd be better off with a totally new message class for
these kind of messages.  In my eyes, a warning does not reflect
the gravity of the issue at hand.

I meant Gnome and KDE.  I never cared to find out which
applications spew which output :-)

Well, it's much more helpful to apply patches instead of pressure.
There is no monopoly on fvwm - everybody can make patches if she
can convince one of the people with commit privileges to apply
them :-)  Our biggest problem is that people have sooooo many good
ideas and there is so litte time to implement them all :-/

I'll look into that.  I wasn't aware of that problem.

This message can be suppressed by prefixing the command with the

Fvwm crashes when printing the error message :-)  The module name
has already been freed when the message is printed.  That's also
the reason why you don't see a complete message.

This will be fixed in the next releases (2.4.6 and 2.5.1) and
tomorrow's snapshot.

Hi All,
	Another patch, this one adds the ability to do

SendToModule FvwmButtons Icon 7 AIcons/appl/mail/xmail_new.xpm

No documentation yet since I'm not sure if this syntax is any good.

Cheers,
Tim.

There are keyboards that provide special keys such as Power, WakeUp or
Standby. These keys return special keycodes that can be mapped to the
keysyms XF86PowerOff, XF86Standby, XF86WakeUp - see e.g. the XKB
definitions in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/inet.

I did this mapping and I see the keysyms returned correctly when watching
them with xev. They are not mentioned in keysyms.h, but the XStringToKeysym
function also recognizes names such as XF86PowerOff and returns the
corresponding keysym.

I would now like to hook some actions to these keys. Unfortunately the fvwm
does not seem to recognize these keysyms and my bindings are ignored.

I am able to do this in the sawfish wm and I am successfully using other
keybindings in the fvwm, so I think that the problem is really in the fvwm.
The keysyms are a bit special in that they have the highest two bytes
non-null. My uneducated guess is that the keysym values get stripped to 16
bits somewhere.

I setted some keybindings for switching between workspaces.
ALT-1 for workspace 1, ALT-2 for workspace2,......ALT-5 for workspace5.
Whenever I entered into fvwm, these keybindings works. But,
When I opened emacs, open browsers, and after about 20 minutes,
the keybindings won't work! Even restart fvwm doesn't helps.
I have to exit from X, and then reenter it. And it works again, then after
some time, it stops working again.............

Really annonying bug, please fix it.
Thanks

Full_Name: Markus Schwarzenberg
Version: 2.4.5.
CVS_Date: 
OS: sunos 5.7
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (153.96.96.2)


after fvwm2 -restart  the FvwmWindow.flags.is_map_pending  bit
sometimes seems not to be set properly. 
This causes the function Iconify(in icons.c) to return in: 

  if (IS_MAP_PENDING(tmp_win))
  {
    /* final state: iconified */
    SET_ICONIFY_AFTER_MAP(tmp_win, 1);
    return;
  }

This makes fvwm2 sometimes refractorily ignoring any Iconify and DeIconify

actions (clicks) for windows which "survived" the restart in an iconified
state.
The bug is hard to reproduce (I have a very lengthy .fvwm2rc which
I don't want to include here) and seems to be related to a FvwmIconBox
running in my FvwmButtons. 

But here is a possible workaround (Beginning of Function Iconify(in
icons.c)):

  void Iconify(FvwmWindow *tmp_win, int def_x, int def_y)  
  {
    FvwmWindow *t;
    FvwmWindow *sf;
    XWindowAttributes winattrs = {0};
    unsigned long eventMask;

    if(!tmp_win)
      return;
  
    if (!XGetWindowAttributes(dpy, tmp_win->w, &winattrs))
    {
      return;
    }
    eventMask = winattrs.your_event_mask;
  
    /* correct is_map_pending if necessary ... */
    if((winattrs.map_state == IsViewable) && IS_MAP_PENDING(tmp_win)) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Window '%s':\nXGetWindowAttributes: IsViewable, but
MAP_PENDING set ... resetting it!\n",
      tmp_win ? tmp_win->name ? tmp_win->name : "NULL_name" : "NULL");
      SET_MAP_PENDING(tmp_win, 0);
    }
  
    if (IS_MAP_PENDING(tmp_win))
    {
      /* final state: iconified */
      SET_ICONIFY_AFTER_MAP(tmp_win, 1);
      return;
    }
  #if 0
    if (tmp_win == Scr.Hilite && HAS_CLICK_FOCUS(tmp_win) &&
tmp_win->next)
    {
    SetFocusWindow(tmp_win->next, 1);
    }
  #endif

    mark_transient_subtree(tmp_win, MARK_ALL_LAYERS, MARK_ALL, False,
True);

...

For me this completely seems to fix the bug. After the session restart
I once see the fprintf-message for every affected window and then fvwm
works OK again (of course the fprintf statement should be converted to
some debug message...).

More info:

Setting the step count higher than 1 gets rid of most of the problems 
but the titlebar of the panel seem to be above other windows even when 
the panel is lowered beneath others.

Does FvwmButtons mess with the fvwm_windows? Could any of the 
sub-windows be reparented back to the root?

Cheers,
Tim.

I have a series of mails from Dominik that are being rejected
by our mail filters.  I'll reconstruct and send them to the list
in a while.

Jason, let us know if you can do anything about it,
I'm including the parts of the mail that I think will help
figure out what the problem is:

Can you make a screenshot?

It only withdraws, maps and resizes the frame.

I've no idea how this could happen.

BTW, I tried that with "steps 200", and now sometimes fvwm hangs
in a "PositiveWrite" call when reading input from FvwmEvent.

Can you please make a patch with the 'diff' command?

  $ diff -u icons.c.orig icons.c

or if you diff does not have the -u option:

  $ diff -c icons.c.orig icons.c

On my system, the XStringToKeysym() function does indeed return
the proper keysym value, but then XKeysymToKeycode returns zero.
I don't know if it's the same problem on your system.  Try

  $ xmodmap -pke

and check if the KeySym is actually assigned to a keycode.  If
not, you have to use xmodmap to assign these keys to a keycode.

No, that's not the problem.  Fvwm uses the KeySym and KeyCode
types defined by the X headers everywhere.

No, it isn't - the following program:

=== snip ===
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  Display *d = XOpenDisplay(":0.0");
  KeySym ks = XStringToKeysym("XF86PowerOff");
  KeyCode kc = XKeysymToKeycode(d, ks);

  printf("%x, %d\n", ks, kc);

  XCloseDisplay(d);
}
=== snip ===

produces:
1008ff2a, 222


> Try

> and check if the KeySym is actually assigned to a keycode.

Yes it is:

keycode 221 =
keycode 222 = XF86PowerOff
keycode 223 = XF86Standby
keycode 224 =
keycode 225 =
keycode 226 =
keycode 227 = XF86WakeUp

> No, that's not the problem.  Fvwm uses the KeySym and KeyCode

These symbols are _not_ defined in the X headers. That the
XStringToKeysym knows about them is something buried in the
Xlib - the manpage says that this behaviour is implementation
dependent.

I am also using XKB and not the xmodmap mappings (maybe
it matters).

If you cannot reproduce it, I'll try to look into the code
myself and let you know the result - I just hoped you just
look and say "Ahh, this is trivial - just do foo" :-)

XStringToKeysym and related:

       Standard KeySym names are obtained from <X11/keysymdef.h>
       by removing the XK_ prefix from each name.  KeySyms that
       are not part of the Xlib standard also may be obtained
       with this function.  The set of KeySyms that are available
       in this manner and the mechanisms by which Xlib obtains
       them is implementation-dependent.

OK, thanks for the hints.

Oh, you don't respond quicker when on the holiday? :-))) Have
a nice holiday and thank you for the work on the fvwm.

Hello,

> If you want to debug this, you should
> start in the files fvwm/bindings.c and libs/Bindings.c.

Umm, you was right - I did not have the keycode mapping - at the
time of fvwm starting, that is :-( My environment starts a keyboard
mapping application, so I see the mapping when running my test
application, but this is of course after fvwm parsed the bindings.

So I know how to solve my problem, but this IMHO revealed another
one. There are environments that use to change the keyboard
mapping on the fly (and not via the keyboard specification
in the X server) - Slovakia (where I live) is one of such regions.
The fvwm binds its keys according to keycodes. So when the
keycode->keysym mapping changes, fvwm does not know about it.
On the slovak keyboard this could mean that Alt-Z on the
local keyboard must be specified as Alt-Y in the fvwm config.

I inspected the code and I don't see any easy solution. While
there is no problem to catch the KeymapNotify event, the user's
specification of the mappings is lost after the parsing and
cannot be reconstructed from the linked list of bindings.
I thought of remembering of the Key commands and replaying
them on the KeymapNotify, but all the possibilities of interaction
using FvwmConsole etc. make this no easy task.

I can live with what I have (I just change the map before the window
manager starts or reissue the "Key" command after each mapping change),
but if you have some idea, how this could be addressed in the fvwm
itself, let me know.

Thanks

I would add a menu item or a keybinding (that does not change) to rerun
all needed Key commands.

Or, it is possible to delay some commands in the cvs version:

  # postpone to 1 minute until keyboard mapping is stabilized
  Schedule 60000 Function MyKeyBindings

It probably makes sence to add an Id option to a button. And the commands:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeTitle <id> "text"
  SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeIcon <id> file

By default button's id (if not specified) may be set to +<row>+<column>
or =<total_order_number_without_containers> which ever is better.

Mail from Dominik:

There is a bug with the ewmh code that forces windows that
temporarily withdraw their windows into iconic state when they map
again.  There is a similar problem for shaded windows and possibly
other states too.  It's easy to reproduce:

 1) Fire up an FvwmButtons that has a panel.
 2) Open the panel.
 3) Iconify/Shade/... the panel
 4) Open the panel again by pressing on the panel button.

Now, the panels should be mapped again, but instead the icon is
unmapped and then mapped again.  I tracked that down into the
EWMH_GetStyle function.  What FvwmButtons does is this:

 - XWithdrawWindow()
 - set wm hints to start the window in normal state
 - XMapWindow()

But the code in EWMH_GetStyle() sets the do_start_iconic flag of
the style structure.  I think there should be some EWMH_... call
to set the EWMH state hint around line 1502 in events.c:

  SetMapStateProp (Tmp_win, WithdrawnState);

(or probably outside the enclosing if-clause).

Log message:
* Reworked the I18N_MB patch:
* Rename I18N_MB to MULTIBYTE
* New Font and Text API in libs/Flocale.{c,h}.
* A cache is used for fonts information. Font loading is more powerful as
both font or fontset can be loaded. See Flocale.h for details, more comments
will be added soon.
* Fortunately, it seems that there are no more memory problems with
--enable-multibyte!
* Added --disable-compound-text (COMPOUND_TEXT), so this is on by default:
If COMPOUND_TEXT, then non XA_STRING text properties are converted
with XmbTextPropertyToTextList. Of course MULTIBYTE "implies" COMPOUND_TEXT.
We should decide if this default is good. IMHO --enable_multibyte should be the
default.
* Used the new API everywhere, but in Form, Gtk and Wharf. I do not know
the i18n status of FvwmGtk (this depends on gtk I imagine). Form may be
multibyted (Dan?). I will not multibyte the Wharf.
* I do not remove GetFont.c because at present time it is used in FvwmForm.
Should we remove it in the future? The problem is that maybe external
modules use it.
* My TODO (monday): more doc (NEWS, Flocale.h, INSTALL.fvwm, web)
* (My) TODO: FvwmForm, right to left text support and make some tests

I mean the data types KyeSym and KeyCode, not the key symbols
themselves.

Which man page?

Sorry to disappoit you ;-)  If you want to debug this, you should
start in the files fvwm/bindings.c and libs/Bindings.c.  There, the
original binding command is processed (starting with Cmd_Key).
If that works fine, the code handling key presses is in
fvwm/events.c, HandleKeyPress().

Bye

P.S.: I can't reply to the list at the moment.  Please forward this
mail to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.  Also, please sent replies to that
list, not to the address I'm writing this from. This is not my usual
mail addres but only a temporary solution.  Finally, I'm on a holiday
for two weeks from saturday, so don't expect any quick replies
from me ;-)

I've committed an initial perl module library so that it may be tested.

This new perl library is based on the old X11::Fvwm module, but I redid it
and simplified. Hopefully it is more clean now. It should also support
extended module messages, but this is not really tested.

Here is a simple auto-raise module in perl:

  use FVWM::Module;
  my $module = new FVWM::Module;
  $module->mask(M_FOCUS_CHANGE);
  $module->addHandler(M_FOCUS_CHANGE, sub { $_[0]->sendInfo($_[2], "Raise") });
  $module->eventLoop();

The things that I will like to do sometimes soon:

  * implement missing module config methods
  * implement some alias handling (?)
  * finalize API
  * write documentation
  * think about an optional Perl/GTK and Perl/Tk support

There are 2 simple test modules in tests/perl directory, just run them
in FvwmConsole using their full path, after "make; make install".

A testing is needed. If someone searches for a challenging toy to program,
implement a one page pager in text mode inside xterm. No ncurses is needed
(unless you want to implement window dragging too), just standard terminal
escape sequenses and maybe pseudo-graphics. It should be not hard in perl.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Shure (attached). BTW, in the meantime I added the workaround also to 
the function DeIconify (In very rare circumstances it could
be necessary there too).

This is causing me problems when I try to set a button title to a 
number. I have three buttons in a container to display the day, date and 
time. This new syntax doesn't work with containers so I have to use the 
old style. Unfortunaltely the date and time are interpreted as numbers 
and so the new syntax is used.  Could we have +row+column for the new 
method?

Cheers,
Tim.

I want to add a new conditional "This" that is almost equivalent to both:

  WindowId $w (conditions)
  Silent Pick (conditions)

except that it by default ignores CirculateSkip/CirculateSkipIcon
unlike Pick and there are no escaping problems unlike WindowId.

This could be considered redudant, but I don't think so.
There are a lot of usages for "This" and most of configs have it.
The current way of one or another alternative is not intuitive.
I would prefer the name "This" rather than "WindowId $w".

Do you think there is a more intuitive name than "This"?
OperandWindow or ContextWindow are ok, but long. I would call it "Current"
and what we call now "Current" could be "Active", but this is impossible.

BTW, Dominik, I think "use_circulate_hit = 1" in CMD_PointerWindow should
be before CreateConditionMask, give a chance to a user to override us.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hey, you turned "multibyted" into a verb just like an American!

:)

I think I've changed everything that should change.

I think it can be safely removed.

It takes a while to figure out, but I didn't find it that hard to
change FvwmForm.

* new module FvwmPerl to handle perl online

This is all experimental. It is intended to enable perl code in fvwmrc and
probably perl pre-processing (if anyone has any ideas what does this mean).

Silly example:

FvwmPerl
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $a = "Next Focus"; command("$a NoWarp")
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval for (1 .. 5) { sleep(1); command($a); }

I just tried and the problem has gone away. The only thing I've done is 
restart the X server so it looks like that is the source of the 
weirdness (it was very wierd, I've never seen just parts of a window 
overlap others)

Cheers,
Tim.

If you want to login to fvwm with KDE Login Manager (kdm) it doesn't work.
Always started the failsafe Session.
Edit /etc/X11/wmsession.d/fvwm-2.4
Change the Name from "FVWM 2.4" to "FVWM2.4" (without blank)

And now it works....

Can't really speak for others, but. Dominik is on a vacation. Olivier, I
guess, deserved some rest after his huge work. I have spent 1.5 days
without a computer mainly in trips, and would like to do this again.

Mikhael.

Hi,

every windowtitle, which includes german umlauts like "//", isnt
displayed correct. For example:

programname: JIVe fr Image plus

the windowtitle which is displayed: JIVe f+##ISO8859-15+# r ImagePlus

If I look with xprop the name is displayed absolut correctly. 
I tried to change the windowtitle font in fvwm2rc but I cant see any
changes.

Any ideas or hints?
Thanks in advance, 

Ralph

With the recent work on multibyte support in Fvwm2 - has any thought been
given to those languages that are right-to-left oriented (Arabic, Farsi,
Hebrew, etc...) ?  In other words, have any considerations been given to
the addition of Bidi (Bi-directionality) ?

  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/

May I suggest a compile-time option of including Fribidi (open source Bidi
library),

  http://fribidi.sourceforge.net

I'd be interested in adding Arabic support to Fvwm but that is very much
hinged on the inclusion of Bidi (its a first-order requirement).  It would
greatly simply life for me (and others I'm sure) if there was an option
to include and enable Bidi without having to resort to hacks.

For what its worth - the inclusion of Bidi will certainly increase Fvwm's
user base, since it would be one of the few window-managers with FULL
multibyte support; a BIG deal to those that are right-to-left'ies :-)

Any takers ? Olivier ;-) ?

Thanks..

BTW: Please CC replies to all noted in header.

I don't know whether I will add bidi support, but I may try to start it.
At least I understand what this means. It is not trivial to immediately
understand why this is needed and even less trivial to understand that
it's all heuristics, there may be possible conflicts in any algorithms.
Examples of logical input / visual output.

  % echo "SHALOM, fvwm (SHALOM is hi in IVRIT!)." | fribidi -C CapRTL
                                 .(!IVRIT is hi in MOLAHS) fvwm ,MOLAHS
  % echo "hi 1-2 (english) is SHALOM 1-2 (IVRIT)." | fribidi -C CapRTL
  hi 1-2 (english) is IVRIT) 2-1 MOLAHS).
  # the second example seems like a bug in my fribidi, but maybe not

Actually, bidi is orthogonal to unicode and to aligment, i.e. it may be
applied to a normal 256-symbol charset, and, I think, we may assume it
only affects an order of symbols inside the string, not its alignment.

So, what I may do is to add --with-fribidi-{library,includes}, and try to
figure out where this bidi filter should be added. But I am not sure yet
what exact parameters should be used in all cases (MULTIBYTE or not) and
what are the conditions when bidi should be applied at all.

Regards,
Mikhael.

My understanding is, the inclusion of Bidi (even if it were enabled at
all times) should not adversely affect latin only characters that are
left-to-right (ie. the status quo).

I'd agree that your second example should be something the fribidi
people should be informed of on their mailing list.  In passing there
are other Bidi implementations out there,

  http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/ucdata.html

The point was/is to consider Bidi's inclusion, the various "minor" issues
within ought to be taken care of in other forums.

As noted above, I'd contend that Bidi's inclusion should not and will not
affect all current external display calls.  In other words, passing in

Hm, who added that check to configure originally?  Could someone
who knows how all this GNOME stuff works take a look at it?

With GNOME and EWMH we now have a flood of different methods to
specify style and state of a window that compete against each
other.  Since there already are a lot of problems, I think we need
to redesign how hints/styles/states are applied to a window.
Right now we have:

  GNOME hints set by the application
  GNOME hints set by fvwm
  EWMH hints set by the application
  EWMH hints set by fvwm
  Hints set by the application
  Fvwm's styles
  Fvwm's window states

For some styles/states it's already almost impossible to keep
track of the proper hint to use.  The latest example is the GNOME
layer hint:  when fvwm creates a window, it sets that hint.
Later, if you recapture the window or restart fvwm, fvwm finds the
layer property on the window and overrides the style, even if it
changed.  Note that this happens for windows that never set any
GNOME hints themselves.

I propose the following solution for the external hints (GNOME,
EWMH and possibly others in the future):

Every window property that is defined externally is duplicated
with an FVWM prefix.  E.g.

  NET_WM_FOOBAR --> FVWM_NET_WM_FOOBAR

When application provides a hint, e.g. the layer hint, that new
property is deleted from its window.  If fvwm sets a hint it sets
the original property and the FVWM_ property to the according
value.  Now, whenever fvwm checks for a hint (recapture, restart,
etc.) it prefers to use its own styles over any GNOME/EWMH hints
that were set by itself (or another fvwm).  So, the normal order
of preference would be:

  EWMH hints (by application)
  GNOME hints (by application)
  Styles
  Application hints
  EWMH hints (by fvwm)
  GNOME hints (by fvwm)

I feel positive that I could do that with the GNOME code, but I
don't understand the EWMH code enough to make the proper changes.

With the files you posted I can reproduce the problem.  Actually
it does not depend on the .fvwm2rc, but I need your .nedit file
as well as the data file (using nedit-5.1.1).

What happens is this:

 1) Start nedit
 2) nedit opens its main window with a width of 803 pixels and
    requests a character width (width_inc in the size hints) of 9
    pixels (for me).  All is fine for now.
 3) From the file dialog, load the data file you sent.
 4) nedit provides new size hints.  It again requests a width of
    803 pixels, but a width_inc if 1.  Now this is where the
    problem starts: according to the ICCCM2, the new requested
    width is ignored (honoured only when the window is mapped),
    but the width_inc is honoured.  So, the window shrinks to a
    width of 154 pixels.
 5) nedit resizes its window to 803 pixels width.  Actually, it
    seems to believe it still has this size.  Keep in mind that
    the character width is still 1.
 6) Again, nedit provides new size hints, with a width of 803 and
    a width_inc of 9.  Fvwm ignores the width as it should and
    honours the width .  Thus, the width of the interior of the
    window is multiplied by 9 which results in a window that is
    about 5500 pixels wide :-P

This is clearly a bug in nedit.  There is no reason to change the
width_inc to 1.  Also, it seems the author misunderstood the way
the size hints work.  For other files, nedit neither resizes its
window nor does it provide new size hints.

The reason why you don't see this with earlier versions and
probably not with any other window manager is that fvwm-2.2 and
above is the only window manager I know of that properly
implements changing the width_inc and height_inc hints.

Please report this to the nedit developers.

Bye

Nothing special. I will try to keep a synchronization between C and perl
libraries. If and when incompatible changes will be introduced, I will
increase the library version. I.e. future scripts containing the line:

  use FVWM::Module 2.1;  # at least version 2.1 is needed

will fail with the current library (version 1.1).

In the future we may use the same version number in both libraries,
making it a part of the module protocol if you think this is needed.
But the perl module library is not more special than the C one, except
that most of perl constants are autogenerated from C ones.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is not a bug in fribidi, but a bug in the Unicode BiDi

gnomeConf.sh is used as the last resort. First gnome-config executable is
searched. The question is why you don't have it in your path?

The logic about where to search for gnomeConf.sh (last resort) is from
gnome.m4, which is included in a lot of other projects, you may write to
authors of this macro if you don't agree with this logic.

I may fix this (risking to break something else), but is it really needed?
Just ensure you have the correct gnome-config in $PATH, as it should be.
In RedHat or similar it is /usr/bin/gnome-config from gnome-libs-devel rpm.

Regards,
Mikhael.

[SNIP, see mailing list archive for more details]

I've made a shot at the "if-else" syntax.  Now, all conditional
commands (and only conditional commands) have a return code that
can be true (1), false (0) or error (-1).  There are three new
conditional commands:

  Cond (returncode) command
  CondCase (returncode) command

These two execute the command only if the last conditional
command returned the given return code.

  Break

is not strictly a conditional command but terminates execution of
a complex function.  It only makes sense to be used in some
conditional context.  Example:

  AddToFunc PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
  + I Pick
  + I Cond (-1) Break
  + I Raise
  + I Iconify off

Return codes are only defined inside complex functions and are not
passed to sub functions or vice versa.  There is also a new
variable $[cond.rc] that is expanded to the last return code.
This is invalid outside complex functions or in conditional
commands.  The code is not well tested yet but complete.  I've no
problem to change it again if we can think of something better.
Now that the funtion arguments allow to pass a return code it is
easy to make changes.  If you want to play with it, be sure to
read the new parts of the man page (commands and CONDITIONAL
COMMANDS section).

I've no opinion about if it's needed or not, but looking for
the script in the path given with --prefix is *definitely*
wrong.  This path is reserved for things that get installed, not
for the dependencies.  Well, adding an additional check with the
path given in --with-gnome-libs shouldn't break anything.

In HandleUnmapNotify and HandleReparentNotify (events.c) fvwm call 
EWMH_RestoreInitialStates (ewmh.c) for restoring the initial
ewmh hints (basically fvwm delete the ewmh hints that it sets
itself when a window is unmapped or reparented).

I used such solution (in a not perfect way) at some point with
fvwm-ewmh (the module and the patch I wrote, not the 2.5.x ewmh
support). An other solution (used in the 2.5.x ewmh support) is to
keep in the FvwmWindow structure the "initial ewmh state" and
when a window is unmapped/reparented/recaptured/"restarted"
fvwm clean up the ewmh hints accordingly (delete the ewmh icons
that fvwm set itself, remove some ewmh state and restore the initial
ewmh hints set by the application in some case, ...etc.).
I think that this solution is more robust than hints duplication
(but there are probably still some bugs at present time, even if
I fix some after your remark about iconified/shaded FvwmButtons
panel):
- If an other wm is started it seems to me that the clean up
method is better
- For some hints clean up is really needed (e.g., the ewmh icons
that fvwm set itself)
- The NET_WM_STATE hint must be set by fvwm to the current
state of the window (as ewmh pager/taskbar get the information
on the windows using this hint). So here it is not clear how to
use the duplication method: FVWM_NET_WM_STATE should be set
to the initial (application) ewmh state? And after?

I do not say that the duplication method is bad. I just
think that for ewmh hints I prefer the "clean up" method.
There is no problem for using the duplication method for
GNOME hints and the clean up method for EWMH hints.
But maybe the good solution is to unify the GNOME and
EWMH code. Of course I think that if we do that we should
move the GNOME code into the EWMH code which is IMHO better
(e.g., it is easy to extend it) but maybe more difficult
to understand at the beginning. Any way I do not think
that this unification is a must.

That fix for WindowList works beautifully.
Any chance you can apply the same principle to the menus that popup when
you select the More.. option in the window-ops menu with fvwm-themes? On
the second xinerama screen the MoveToPage, Group Operations, Window
Style, etc..., menus popup on the primary screen for me.

Hello,

I've been developing some user-interface stuff on top of Fvwm and I found
it useful to be able to push the screen borders inward in window
placement.  The idea is that you can create a high-level toolbar (e.g. a
windows taskbar or mac menu clone) on a side of the screen and have
windows avoid it, even if Fvwm doesn't know there's anything special about
it.

The patch creates a command PlacementEdgeAvoid which sets the thickness of
the avoid-spaces on each side.  The syntax is 
PlacementEdgeAvoid left_width top_width right_width bottom_width
where each width is an integer measured in pixels.

Various placement schemes have their own edge-avoidance, which I have left
alone (therefore the two values add).  I have done this on the logic that
if it was bad to put a window too close to the top of the screen, it's bad
to put it that close to the bottom of the menubar at the top of the
screen.

I hope this patch proves useful to others (it has to me).  Feel free to
contact me with comments, questions, ideas or flames.

Right.  That's one weak spot in the approach I proposed.

Good point.

I agree.  Cleaning up the hints is better - but of course it fails
if fvwm is killed the hard way ("pkill -9 fvwm2").  The
duplication methods doesn't have this problem, but on the other
hand is can't deal well with switching to a different wm and then
back to fvwm.

Exactly what I'm thinking.  And while we do this we should take
care to strictly separate

 - Style like hints (honoured at map time)
 - State transitions (honoured immediately)
 - Hints donated by fvwm (completely ignored by fvwm)

Right now, all this state/style stuff is a mess.  Really, the
GNOME/EWMH/OpenLook/Motif/whatever hints code should not fiddle
with the style structures.  That only creates a constant stream of
problems.  It could be done like this:

 1) Write a unified "hints" library that handles all kinds of
    hints (GNOME/EWMH/OpenLook/Motif/SM, the application's icon
    hint and whatever 'hint' fvwm sets itself during a restart or
    recapture).

 2) The provided hints are all stored in a separate part of the
    FvwmWindow structure.

 3) The hints code does not touch the window style structure
    anymore.

 4) Instead, all window features that can be controlled by hints
    have a function in the hints library that takes the window
    structure and the setting from the window style as input and
    returns if the feature is to be used or not.  For example:

      hintlib_starts_sticky(FvwmWindow *fw, Bool style_is_sticky); 
      hintlib_is_maximize_allowed(FvwmWindow *fw);
      ...

   These funtions are the only way to access the hints from
   AddWindow() and other parts of fvwm.  Not that things like
   GNOME_IgnoreHints must be read from the FvwmWindow structure
   since the functions don't have access to style structure (I'm
   not happy about GNOME, EWMH, SM, ... accessing the style
   structure anyway.  It should be strictly local to style.c).

 5) The hints that are to be donated in some way get similar
    functions:

      hintlib_set_sticky_hint(FvwmWindow *fw);
      ...

    The code in the library takes care of doing the right things.

This way, all the EWHM_...() and GNOME_...() calls should go away
and be replaced with more general versions.

The longer I think about it the more 'hints' come to my mind.
Let's sum up again what we have at the moment:

 - GNOME
 - EWMH
 - Motif
 - OpenLook
 - Hints set by the application, e.g. StartsIconic or the icon
   pixmap
 - Preserved states from session.c
 - Hints set by fvwm itself
 - Styles

It's no wonder that states keep breaking again and again.

> Any way I do not think that this unification is a must.

Considering all this, it seems more important than I initially
thougt.  Let's give it a fancy name and put it on the to do list.
How about "Great Hint Code Unification" (aka GHCU) ;-)

Agree, but I am not ready to write the code now in the sense
that I am not really motivated to rework on hints at the present
time. IMHO the conditonal style are more important (but I've
no personal plan).

As you say fribidi works with simple bit charset so I think
that if libfribidi is detected we can try to use it
(HAVE_FRIBIDI).

The main problem to start is to detect the used encoding
of the string we display (window/icon title or menu item).
I suggest to compute the charset at font loading and
to add it to the FlocaleFont structure. Then, depending
of this charset we can apply fribidi filter (that is for
UTF-8(~ ISO10646-1), ISO8859-6 and ISO8859-8 and others?).

I think that first we can forget the alignment problems.
Alignment problems may be solved by adding a "width"
in the FlocaleWinString structure to get a bounding
box. This can be done progressively by using a flag
as FWS_HAVE_WIDTH (used similarly than FWS_HAVE_LENGTH).

Log message:
* new subclass in perl library for writting Perl/Gtk based FVWM modules
_ extra Gtk perl library from CPAN is needed to run new example FVWM module

Since the word "module" has 2 meanings on this subject:
FVWM module == executable
perl module == .pm file
I will try in discussions to use the word "module" only for the first and
"class in perl library" for the second.

I've installed the fribidi library (because I like to compile with
all possible libraries), but the configure script fails with an
(incorrect) error message:

And the output from config.log:

This is a generic error message. You will get it if you have a non correct
xpm or rplay or stroke headers too. You need glib-devel rpm in this case.
But if you have gtk support you already have glib-devel. I don't know.
Moreover my version of fribidi (I installed fribidi{-devel}-0.10.1-2 PLD
rpms) does not include glib.h at all.

I may replace "Can't find required foo.h" with "Can't find working foo.h".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Submission from: (NULL) (216.36.71.34)


FVWM v1.x supported two different directives, OpaqueMove [margin] and
OpaqueResize, for separately controlling opaque moves and resizes of
windows.  In fvwm2, these are apparently replaced by a single
OpaqueMoveSize directive, which controls only the boundary for opaque
window moves.  As far as I can tell, fvwm2 offers no mechanism or directive
at all by which it is possible to enable opaque resizes.

When I run make dist now, these errors have begun showing up since the
new perllib module has been added.

make[3]: Entering directory `/home/awol/cvs/fvwm/perllib/FVWM/Module'

Perhaps an oversight?

Version 2.2.5 is way too old.

glib-devel is installed (1.2.10), this is not the problem.  The
glib.h file is in /usr/include/glib-1.2, but the include path is
not set.  The fribidi version is 0.9.0.  To work with this
version, the flags from glib-config have to be added to the
gcc calls.  Is there any documentation about the dependencies of
the fribidi library?

As an addendum:  it's sufficient if gcc finds an empty glib.h in
the include path.  It doesn't have to be linkes with glib either.
If I issue

  # touch /usr/lib/glib.h

configure and make run without a problem.

Did you run automake and autoconf before "make dist"?  For me, it
runs through.  On the other hand, "make distcheck" throws an error:

  $ make distcheck
  ...

Tim, when you change an icon or title in a button, the window
shape is not updated.  Try this (replace the icon names first):

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*
  KillModule FvwmButtons
  *FvwmButtonsRows 1
  *FvwmButtonsPixmap none
  *FvwmButtons(Icon icon1.xpm, Title foo)
  FvwmButtons

and then

  SendToModule FvwmButtons Title +0+0 bar
  SendToModule FvwmButtons Icon +0+0 icon2.xpm

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I actually had tried autoreconf and automake first, but now that you
mention it, I've just tried everything I can think of, and I've run cvs
update with -A and -P with -R flags even. Still always get the same
error as above.

All the make dist, distcheck, dist2, rpm-dist, etc.. options return
those same errors for me.

The only way to modify this width is by choosing a different font.
It is actually the width of a single character in this case.
Changing the font won't help though, unless you can live with
characters that are only one pixel wide ;-)

The only workaround I can think of is limiting the size of the
nedit window with something similar to

  Style nedit MaxWindowSize 99 10000

This limits the width of the nedit window to 99% of the screen
width (plus borders).  The nedit window will still grow, but not
as much as before.

Log message:
* Added anti-alised font rendering using Xft. This is off by default.
* A font can now be given as a ";" separated list of either ","
separated list of XFLD font name or Xft font name with "xft:" as
prefix, e.g.:
xft:Verdana:Regular:size=12:rgba=rgb;-adobe-*-medium-r-*--12-*,fixed
See Flocale.h for details
* The main problem with Xft rendering is that we should always clear the
text area before drawing text with an Xft font
* Some Minor(?) FvwmForm fixes

Dominik, I think you should modify acinculde.m4 and not aclocal.m4
which is generated from acinculde.m4.

There is nothing about glib in 0.10.1 sources. The ChangeLog is not clear,
it just says something was removed regarding glib. I don't think we should
support 0.9.0 if it is different from 0.10.1, but if it has fribidi-config
it should say "yes" when I replace the detection mechanism.

  fribidi-config --cflags --libs
  glib-config --cflags --libs  # this is not needed, just for comparision

This is because HAVE_FRIBIDI is not really used yet anywhere.
Olivier, you may do it before me if you like. I am busy with perl now. :)

Ok, fixed locally.

Run ./configure before make, it's not done automatically in some cases...
Or, run "make" before "make dist", this after "autoreconf; automake"
usually runs ./configure with original params.

This is a good solution to the if-else problem.

However I may remind that my latest patch did a bit more. I feel that this
extra functionality could be useful, although more thoughts may be needed.

Every command not only conditionals could return status code (0 or Success
by default). For example, Read (NoFile) and ModuleSynchronous (Timeout).

I don't think limiting return codes to commands inside functions is
required (it is easier to implement, yes). This may be solved together
with "+" command validity by keeping some global data (in Scr) for every
pipe separately. I.e. last_added_item and rc should be local.

About names. Maybe to use "CondStatus" or generally "Status", not "Cond".
(Like some shells have $status that is another name for $? return code.)
Also I suggest a command "Preserve" that preserves the previous status.
I.e. your "CondCase (NoMatch)" could be "Preserve Status (NoMatch)".
This Preserve command is useful by itself, not only before Status command.

Status names should not be boolean names. "Match", "NoMatch", "Error".
Numbers are also ok, but "true" or "off" are not too much informative.

CondCase does not currently work.

Also $[cond.rc] outside of functions may be expanded to 0, not to itself,
but this is not important if "if-else" is limitted to functions only.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Full_Name: Daniel Speyer
Version: 2.4.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Debian GNU/Linux
X_Server: 4.1
Submission from: (NULL) (129.2.159.61)


I typically run with a toolbar of some sort on one side of the screen
(currently an FvwmButtons on the left, previously a combination of Fvwm
modules and Tcl/Tk scripts on the right, before that a taskbar-ish thing on
the bottom -- you get the idea).  However, when new windows popped up, they
didn't think of these bars as special, and went right over them (or under,
if I was using alwaysontop, but that wasn't much better).  This became
really annoying, because I think of those windows as seperate from my
desktop and I wanted windows to overlap them about as much as I wanted them
to run off the screen.

I've written a patch that makes Fvwm think the same way.  Essentially, it
lets you tell it how far from each edge should be thought of as
'off-screen,' and should only receive windows if they just don't fit
anywhere else.  

I've tested this patch for a while, and it seems quite stable.

--Daniel Speyer

P.S. I submitted the patch earlier to fvwm-workers but it seems to have
been ignored.  It occured to me that some projects prefer patches submitted
through bug tracking, so I'm trying this.

P.P.S Since every feature needs documentation, here's a man entry for it
(apologies for the plain text, I don't know man format)

  PlacementEdgeAvoid left top right bottom
	This command creates a region at each edge to 
	avoid when placing new windows.  This is useful
	for keeping toolbars, taskbars, global 
	menus, etc. from getting covered.  All arguments
	are mandatory.  If you don't have a toolbar on a
	given side, just use 0.

P.P.P.S. There doesn't seem to be an attatchment mechanism here, so I've
appended the patch:

Mikhael, with your latest commit I get a message from automake:

  fvwm/Makefile.am:30: variable `FT2_LIBS' not defined

(one for each Makefile).  This only goes away after I run
autoreconf and then automake again.  I assume this is a bug in the
Makefile setup.  To get a proper build I now have to call

  $ automake; autoreconf; automake; autoreconf

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I did not say that other commands *can* not have a return code but
that they *do* not have one.  My intentions was to keep the return
code of conditionals separate from normal return codes.  The
cond_rc function argument can easily be replaced with a return
structure that can store multiple types of return codes.  We
shouldn't mix both because it would become hard to understand for
example

  Current (foobar) Read <file>

returns (the rc of Read or the rc of Current?).

Yes, it would be nice if return codes work in scripts too.

First, I think that the names I chose are brain dead.  The reason
for "Cond" is to indicate that it uses the return code of
CONDitional commands.  Otherwise I'd simply have used "Else".
"CondCase" resembles the "switch/case" in C where you can check
against many values in a single call.

It's not necessary if we keep the return code of conditionals
separate from other return codes.

Can you give me an example?

I should rather have said that the behaviour outside a function is
undefined.

I'm sorry that you did all this work for naught, but the 2.5.x
betas already have a method to control placement preferences on a
per-window basis.  It doesn't work with all placement methods
though.  Please check the styles MinOverlapPlacement and
PlacementOverlapPenalties.

We prefer them on the mailing list.  I've been on a holiday and
had no time to reply yet.

If anybody has noticed:  I've changed the way I indent my code to
using a basic indentation width of 8 spaces instead of 2.  Nobody
needs to comply with that choice, but when I come across parts of
the code I might reindent it.  The reasons for my change of mind
can be found in the Linux kernel coding style document (usually
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle):

----------------------------- snip ----------------------------
                Chapter 1: Indentation                                          
                                                                                
Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters.             
There are heretic movements that try to make indentations 4 (or even 2!)        
characters deep, and that is akin to trying to define the value of PI to        
be 3.                                                                           
                                                                                
Rationale: The whole idea behind indentation is to clearly define where         
a block of control starts and ends.  Especially when you've been looking        
at your screen for 20 straight hours, you'll find it a lot easier to see        
how the indentation works if you have large indentations.                       
                                                                                
Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes          
the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a              
80-character terminal screen.  The answer to that is that if you need           
more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix        
your program.                                                                   
                                                                                
In short, 8-char indents make things easier to read, and have the added         
benefit of warning you when you're nesting your functions too deep.             
Heed that warning.                                                              
----------------------------- snip ----------------------------

(Note the parts about 'coding 20 straight hours' and 'if you need
more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway').

In short, it makes reading the code easier and forces you more to
think about what you code.

Bye

Oh, and I want you to take part in this pearl of wisdom from the
same document (about naming conventions):

----------------------------- snip ----------------------------
Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian              
notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can        
check those, and it only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft          
makes buggy programs.

If you agree about return codes for other commands, I am not sure having 2
kinds of return codes is needed. It is easy to invent a case when 3 kinds
of return codes or more are possible. How about to have these:

  * one for the last conditional (3 possible values)
  * one for the last complext function, they may just: Return any_number
  * one for the last, say, Exec/PipeRead (returns system's status code)
  * one for the last command (including all commands above too?)
  * one to bring them all and in the darkness bind them...

No, this is a joke, I think having one return code for all commands is ok.
If conditionals are commands and not language constructs, they should
behave like all other commands. But we probably should first see some real
life usages to decide about this.

It should return rc of Current. If someone needs to branch over Read, he
should do this in a function:

  Current (foobar) ReadOrWrite

But then it is nice to preserve the previous status of other commands.

Any example that works with Cond does not work with CondCase for me.
This is not expanding problem, just replace $0 with CondCase.

AddToFunc TestCondCommand
+ I Next ($1) Nop
+ I $0 (0) Echo ($0 0)
+ I $0 (1) Echo ($0 1)
+ I $0 (-1) Echo ($0 -1)

TestCondCommand Cond XTerm       # nothing is echoed, ok
TestCondCommand Cond _none_      # 0 and 1 are echoed, ok
TestCondCommand CondCase XTerm   # nothing is echoed
TestCondCommand CondCase _none_  # nothing is echoed

Sorry, I was too fast to reply.

It should return:

  * Current syntax: SyntaxError
  * Current failed: NoMatch
  * Read syntax:    SyntaxError
  * Read passed:    Success
  * Read failed:    NoFile

Note, there is no Match status, it is usually Success instead.

If you think this is a mix, yes, but it is not different from this:

  Current (foobar) Next (foobar2) Close

For me it should return:

  * Current syntax: SyntaxError
  * Current failed: NoMatch
  * Next syntax:    SyntaxError
  * Next failed:    NoMatch
  * Close syntax:   SyntaxError
  * Close passed:   Success
  * Close failed:   NoWindow

What should it return as it is now? Which is more useful? :)

I remember I thought about all this several months ago, and my decision
was one return code for all commands should be enough, functions may be
used to refine it. The only alternative is to keep an array of status
codes, one per a command in the line (three in the last Close example).

Regards,
Mikhael.

The commands are not language constructs, but the return codes
are.  To be honest, I limited the return codes to conditionals
because it will be a major effort to properly define the correct
return codes of all existing commands in a consistent way.  To
give all commands a return code, each and every command has to be
modified and the return codes defined carefully.

How about the names

  IfRc/SwitchRc or RcIf/RcSwitch

instead?  (And if we have a 'Preserve' prefix it should be
'PreserveRc'.

Doh.  Boolean values can't be 0 or one.  Nothing of the above
could have worked.  You to use symbolic names like "True" and
"False".  Anyway, I've fixed it.  The argument can now be either
a number (0/1/-1) or a symbol (Match/NoMatch/Error).  The example
works now for me with both commands.

I'm not sure if its relevant, but in our project we found that using an automated tool to force 
all the code into a single format as it went under change control helped immensely when 
comparing versions.  Often different contributors used different editors or conventions.  

I was against the idea of "forcing" a coding convention on individuals, but this turned out to 
be a great compromise.  Each person has their own conventions enforced by whatever tool 
they want, and then on checkin, it converts it into a common form (it turns out to be my 
personal form...because after all...I did set it up :-).  

Now when we do differences across versions, we don't get the preverbial "everything's 
changed".  When we do merges, we actually have a chance of making the merge work.

I don't know, but I do know that you did not get the idea what the
"error" return code stands for in the current code.  The idea was
to use it if the pre conditions to run the command at all are not
fulfilled, e.g.  if you issue "Pick" but select no window.  This
is quite different from syntax errors.  Handling syntax errors may
not be necessary at all.  Fvwm already prints error messages in
this case.

Of course, "Error" (better to be "Canceled") as it is now has nothing to
do with "SyntaxError" or "NoFile" or "NoWindow" that I used as future
status codes.

I did not add FT2 code, but it seems ok at a glance.

It should be "autoreconf; automake", so the first automake may not help.
Or maybe "aclocal; automake; autoconf; autoheader".

I didn't need to run "autoreconf; automake; ./configure; make" twice.
Anyway, I don't think we may fix this Makefile circular dependancies hell.

  * autoreconf is a script manipulating aclocal + autoconf + autoheader
  * aclocal produces aclocal.m4 from acinclude.m4
  * automake produces Makefile.in files from Makefile.am files
  * autoconf produces configure from configure.in and aclocal.m4
  * autoheader produces config.h.in from configure.in
  * configure produces Makefile files from Makefile.in files
  * configure produces config.h from config.h.in
  * configure produces executable config.status to rebuild files from *.in
  * config.status --recheck regenerates itself from configure
  * make _should_ run everything above automatically using Makefile

Now you may guess what happens when Makefile itself should be regenerated
when you issue "make foobar". I.e. it should first produce a new Makefile
instead of the currently run one, and then rerun "make foobar" on it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This works ok, except for -maximize. The last affected window borders
are highlighted, although the window under cursor has keyboard focus.
The pager may show one or another highlighted window.

I am not sure, but I think there is a problem in ResizeMoveMaximize,
because all others (ResizeMove, Move, AnimatedMove) work well. I will post
a minimal rc file if you can't reproduce it with FvwmCascade -m -maximize.

The point of -maximize is to help to restore the original window geometry.
Also, if we would have ResizeMove, the patch may be 1-2 lines shorter. :-)

Mikhael.

I mean MoveMaximize not ResizeMove.

I don't really request it, ResizeMoveMaximize keep keep emulates it well.

Do I need to change how snapshots are built?  This looks like what
caused this morning's failure.  The current script is:

#!/bin/zsh
VERSION=snap-`/bin/date +%Y%m%d`;
SNAPDIR=/usr/local/sina-ftp/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots;
TMPF=/tmp/fvwm.snap.$$
rm -f $TMPF
cd ~/fvwm
/usr/bin/cvs -q update -dPA                 >> $TMPF 2>&1 && \
/usr/bin/automake --add-missing             >> $TMPF 2>&1 && \

if [ ! -f $SNAPDIR/fvwm-$VERSION.tar.gz ]; then
  mail -s "Problems building $VERSION" fvwm-workers@fvwm.org < $TMPF;

Yes, of course, this is incorrect when acinclude.m4 is changed.
I believe that switching of these lines should be enough.

But if you really want to be sure, add aclocal without parameters:

  aclocal
  automake -a
  autoreconf

Mikhael.

Can you demonstrate the problem with simple commands instead of
FvwmCascade?

Jason, I think you might have missed Mikhael's answer.

At least for me, it showed up as an attachment I couldn't extract.

Heres his answer:

Yes, of course, this is incorrect when acinclude.m4 is changed.
I believe that switching of these lines should be enough.

But if you really want to be sure, add aclocal without parameters:

  aclocal
  automake -a
  autoreconf

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ah, there was an answer in there.  I've added the call to aclocal;
let's see how another snapshot builds.  (Sorry about the two false
starts, BTW.)

Jason, please remove this file and rerun the building process.
It should be an error if there are "M"-s while updating cvs.

It seems to have gone away; the snapshot built fine after those two
false starts.  Is that file autogenerated?

Yes run xv in the top-left corner and FvwmConsole at bottom-right.
In FvwmConsole (it is focused with SloppyFocus) type:

  Next (xv) ResizeMoveMaximize 100p 100p +10p +10p

xv is highlighted, but keyboard correctly goes to FvwmConsole.

I still prefer the name "Status" (or if you like "OnStatus").

But if we want some mnemonics, how about "On" and "PreserveStatus" (I am
speaking about general status codes, not only conditionals):

  Current (Raised) Lower
  On (NoMatch) Current Raise

and:

  Read file1
  PreserveStatus On (Success) Read file2
  On (NoFile) Read file3

I was wondering. Would you guys would consider adding a bootstrap
script for cvs, something similar to the above like:

#!/bin/sh
aclocal
automake -a
autoreconf

This would save me from having to remember so much :-)

utils/configure_dev.sh

Its missing the aclocal right now, but someone might add it.
It also invokes configure without args, but you might find that
acceptable.
