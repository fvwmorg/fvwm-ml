ms is not MR_STYLE(mr_to_copy) it is the menu style just created
by menustyle_parse_style(F_PASS_ARGS) where action is the address
of mr. Maybe, it will be good that menustyle_parse_style return
the menu style that it creates or modifies ... done.

When, you create a menu (with AddToMenu) MR_COPIES(mr) = 1.  The menu
code logic implies that MR_COPIES is never 0 but in DestroyMenu just
before it is totally destroyed (and maybe re-created and in this case
MR_COPIES is re-incremented).

Yes, I think it was a bug. What happen if you enter DestroyMenu
with MR_COPIES(dest_mr) = 0?

...
MR_COPIES(dest_mr)--;  <-- MR_COPIES is -1
...
if (MR_COPIES(dest_mr) == 0)  <-- leaks
{
   free some stuff
}

Any way if you change the test 

MR_COPIES(dest_mr) == 0

by 

MR_COPIES(dest_mr) <= 0

it is not a big problem to set MR_COPIES to 0 for a tear off
menu. However, it seems that the logic is to set MR_COPIES
to 1 when you "create" a tear off menu.

Yep, such naming scheme is good. Ha 2 questions.
Under which condition you start the function with "__"?
(a private version of an exported function?).
What is the goal of the TearMenuOff command, how can
we use it?

Yes, it may have been a bug.  However, testing for <= 0 hides
potential problems elsewhere.  Instead, we should call abort() if
it ever becomes < 0.

When I feel like it :-)  Seriously, the __ indicates its an
internal helper function that encapsulates some work done by
higher level functions of the same module.  Only static functions
can begin with __.  It indicates that the function is really,
*really* internal and must never be exported.

It is a dummy command only defined in menus, exactly like "Title".
Clicking on an item that uses it tears off the menu.  It's not
implemented yet, though.  If you try to write the command, the
following should be taken into account:

  a) It should work on all visible menu items:
      - normal items ("+ foo tearmenuoff")
      - separators ("+ bar nop tearmenuoff"?)
      - titles ("+ baz title tearmenuoff"?)

  b) An item that can tear off a menu must be selectable, i.e.
     must be hilighted when the mouse is over it.  This must be
     somehow merged into the IS_SELECTABLE flag.  Perhaps we need
     a new flag too.

  c) It would be nice if it worked in the dynamic menu actions.
     This is probably hard to implement, and thus optional.

I have to take back everything.  TearMenuOff is already
implemented.  Try

  AddToMenu ...
  + "" TearMenuOff

I ound the problem. There was an Xft/Xft.h in /usr/X11R6/include
(provided by XFree86). So I temporarily renamned that to Xft1.h (yeah, I
know it's no good solution, but that file was owned the XFree86-devel
RPM...)

Tack! (Thank you)

I am not agree with this. I think the code is safe. I do not
"understand" Dominik arguments against the patch (second version).
We have always added feature during feature freeze. Note also that
you can add bugs when you fix a bug... Currently, the existence of
the patch allowed to fix a few bugs!

Should I use similar arguments? At the present time I will not.

This is the only argument I see to do not apply the patch.
So now if the patch is not applied what I've to do with it?

I just commited my latest changes.
Now FVWM can render combinational characters superimposed on top of the
"base" character (even if there is no precomposed glyph).

I tested the code with and without xft fonts and with rotated text.
Please try make use of it to find any bugs.

What remains is to fix the drawing of underlined characters, which I think
is broken for BIDI locales (only partly related to combining charaacters).

By the way, I forgot to include the function FlocaleTextWidth in one
ChangeLog entry (only a minor change). Shall I commit just a ChangeLog
entry for this?

You may commit it individually or with the next commit, by your choice.

Hi there,

Since the birthday party is over one month ago we might want
to change the default theme to a less colorful version. 

Dominik said he would like to keep the pager on top of the
site.

So we may make a new default theme which uses the birthday
theme as template or we switch to the old default theme.

Regards, Uwe

I forgot to define the override macro when no FriBIDI (FBidiConvert)
Thank you Jason!

I'll make a test with FriBIDI disabled (it'll take some time, my machine
is only 400 MHz, so it takes ages to compile, please be patient)

Mikhael

In FvwmWindowMenu I noticed you changed the pattern type "title" to
"name". Why is this? I think it makes it consistent with
FvwmIdent output, but inconsistent with FvwmIconMan type=pattern
options.

People tend to think in terms of "xterm __titles__" and window
manager "__title__bars", etc, so I think using "name" is a little
confusing, e.g. xterms set their title with -T, and icon name with -n.

What is official X terminology on the issue?

Should we support both?

Cheers

I thought it is more important to make it consistent with FvwmIdent,
since this is what people use to find names.

Besides, we have now (well, I added these after the change above):

  $[w.name] $[w.iconname] $[w.class] $[w.resource]

We use internally .name and .icon_name fields in the code.
This is also the standard terminology in X:

  XA_WM_NAME XA_WM_ICON_NAME

We may if you need this.


Do you want to help me to simplify FvwmWindowMenu by using ModuleConfig
and PageInfo trackers (and WindowList tracker in the future)?

Do you want to add more functionality (see WindowList command for hints)?
Additional features may also include window groups arranged in submenus.

Mikhael.

All of that makes good sense.

Don't _need_ it :-)  We could make 'title' a synonym for 'name',
but that could be even more confusing for users.

Sure. I've not been paying attention to recent developments
due to pressure of work: when will trackers be ready to use?
I always approve of simplifying code :-)

Absolutely. Maybe in a few weeks when work relaxes a bit.

All trackers except for WindowList are usable now.

WindowList tracker is the largest one, it should optionally track
all window flags/names/stack list/icon files and probably more.

Hello,

Ok, this subject is delicate ...

Examples of pb:

- Start Mozilla, say that its position is +x+y. Set fullscreen (F11),
if you have a not too recent version of Mozilla this works (with
Mozilla-1.4 and maybe other this does not work as Mozilla use
NET_WM_FULLSCREEN which is not implemented in fvwm (this not the point
of this email). Reset to normal state (F11). Then, either Mozilla
crash or the Mozilla window totally disappear (strange) or the new
window position is
          +(x-"left_frame_width")+(y-"top_frame_height")

- Other Mozilla pbs: resizing the window with the internal Mozilla
resize grip.

- Tk experience:
[olivier@snoopy olivier]$ wish
% wm geometry . +0+0

The top-left part of the frame is out of screen

- This problem will happen with any QT, GTK, JAVA and Tk application
which "move-resize" itself (after mapping).


All this applications are not buggy! They all respect the ICCCM2 (or
at least a really reasonable interpretation of the ICCCM2).  Note that
most of the actively developed window manager respect this (e.g.,
icewm, kwin and metacity). Also this is documented in the EWMH spec.

Of course fvwm no that, however it use a legacy way to move-resize
a window because some "old" apps use this legacy logic (sorry I've no
example, but Dominik has surely some).

I suggest that we add a new style:

LegacyConfigureRequest / ICCCMConfigureRequest

or 

ICCCMConfigureRequest / LegacyConfigureRequest

to handle this problem. About default we can do something a bit more
complex: detect if the app respect the EWMH spec, if yes use
ICCCMConfigureRequest if not use LegacyConfigureRequest. However, I
think we need a new style (as there is no standard way to detect
that an application respect the EWMH spec).

Any opinions/comments/objections?

Regards, Olivier

Would people working on the screen shots page(s) be kind enough to
list image sizes (as in disk space, not length x width) (for those
who are on dial up)?  It is insane to wait for a >400 kB image to
load on slow dial up.

(I don't mind, however, missing image size listing, as of Jul 3 2003
0655 UTC, for images of vector buttons or menus as they are "quite
small".)


Also, could a request be made (in the FAQ) to keep the size small
(~200 kB) of the screen shots submitted?  It does not have to be
a requirement, just a polite request.

This will be done. However I am quite busy at the moment so
I won't have time to revise the screenshot page that
soon. The new screenshot page will be dynamic and therefore
able to display the file size automatically.

Yes, I noticed some of these problems too.  Yesterday I found two
download windows I had shaded on the right side of page (0 1) in
the middle of page (1 2).  I still have to find a way to reproduce
this, but chances are good that mozilla is doing something funny.

Mine doesn't have a resize grip.

See the endless discussions I had on the wm-spec list.  The bottom
line of them always was that nobody of the people there cares a
bit about the traditional way vs. the spec conforming way of
handling configure requests.  Thus, even with the latest EWMH
spec, manual user intervention is required to configure some
applications :-(

Yeah, but the wm-spec folks can't agree on a protocol for this :-P
In addition, it would be really helpful to have a standard way of
advertising which method the WM uses in order to allow
applications to detect it themselves.  This would fix most of the
notorious Java... problems with fvwm.

Having a style is not wrong anyway.

> Any opinions/comments/objections?

For a detection algorithm:

  1) If the windows CR algorithm was set by a style or detected
     before, use it.

  2) If a window resizes itself to the *exact* size of the
     display and the requested position of the client window is
     either +0+0 or +border_width+border_height, put it at +0+0
     and make a decision about the algorithm it uses based on the
     requested position.

  3) If a window resizes/positions itself so that interpreting its
     position would shift it by exactly the width/height of the
     left or top border, set the algorithm that would prevent this
     shift (if possible).

  4) If a window places itself in a way that would place it
     exaclty on the border of the display, choose the algorithm
     that keeps the border on screen.

So we should have three styles (I don't like the term "legacy"
because it displays a certain arrogance of the wm-spec people
against tradition):

  MoveByProgramAlgorithm [SmartTraditional|SmartICCCM|ICCCM|Traditional]

with "SmartTraditional" being the default (i.e. use above
algorithm and use "Traditional" by default).  However, the names
of the styles are all bad (hard too understand).

Cool. I'll take a look in a couple of weeks when work slacks off
a bit.

I think the resize grip only comes with certain themes for the gtk2 builds...
I remember seeing this kind of resizing when we had a demo of Gnome2 at my
LUG... was supposed to be some kind of feature introduced in Gnome2. 

I found a similiar resize-grip in nautilus... it manages to get the window
into resize mode... maybe mozilla is doing something different.

BTW is it possible that the problem with the resize grip and the window
shifting when coming back from full-screen are related... I seem to find the
mozilla window drifting towards the top-left corner when trying to resize ..
seems to be moving in a similiar ratio too (I didn't measure too carefully)

I don't think I have Gtk2 on my machine.
I don't see the resize handle with the Classic theme,
but it is there with Modern.

I don't know which version of mozilla that Gecko corresponds to, but
i have the same experience.

Using the "grip" in 1.4b version (to resize a window, "modern"
theme) makes the the mozilla window to dance around, which was not
the case in version 1.3-something.  (The "grip" thingy, in  the
lower right corner, seemed to be introduced in version 1.4b for
"modern" theme only.)

Also in version 1.4b, mozilla doesn't go full screen as it did
previously.  Now it just hides various bars and uses miniature
buttons w/ the same full screen window size as it was before going
full screen.

(I am using fvwm 2.5.6.)

I will add: if the window has _NET_WM_PID set use the ICCCM algo.

I.e., if the window attempts to become full screen, check whether
it took the border size into account or not.

I think that is because Mozilla assumes that if a wm implements
the EWMH spec, it also supports _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN.  This is
not true for fvwm.

I do not remember adding any new feature in feature freeze without
a very good reason why it has to be in the release.  I see none
here.  Fvwm existed ten years without window specific styles.
What is the reason why we can not live without the patch for some
more months?

I have held back dozens of patches for the sake of the feature
freeze and it's no fun for me either.  I refuse to abondon my
notion of software quality for the sake of making the developers
happy.  But of course I can't stop you from doing what I think is
wrong.  Take fvwm and have fun with it.  I give up.

Bye

I have mostly completed and applied the patch.  Still missing:

 * The window styles (although the members of the window_style
   structure are already defined).
 * Handling changes in update.c.
 * Write man page.
 * Check for _NET_WM_PID.
 * Test the patch.  I have only tried Mozilla yet.

I have some small requests regarding formatting and coding style.

 * Please use TABs (width 8) to indent your code.  Many lines in
   Flocal.c, FBidi.c, FBidiJoin.c and FCombineChars.c were
   indented by what looks like a random amount of spaces to me (2,
   7, 4, ...).

 * Please always compile with -Wall -Werror in you CFLAGS.  This
   save mew the trouble of fixing warnings before I can continue
   to work.

 * Do not write something like this:

     {
       int x;
       y = 2;
       int z;
     }

   This is not C and usually does not compile.

 * The file names beginning with a capital 'F' in the libs/
   directory are reserved for encapsulating third party libraries
   and X features with a similar name.  E.g.

     fribidi -> FBidi
     XShape -> FShape
     PNG -> Fpng
     XEvent -> FEvent

   etc.  I suspect that FBidiJoin.[ch] and FCombineChars.[ch] are
   ignoring that convention.  If this is the case, please strip
   the 'F' from their names.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I can do that if you want ... as I have also write down a patch
(partial) too!

Seems you do that.

Make some test with Tk it is ok.

With mozilla-1.1 when I press F11 to go to fullscreen and go back to
normal stat (F11) my mozilla window totally disappear (probably a
mozilla bug).

With mozilla-1.4 (no fullscreen) when I use the resize grip mozilla
do not go up and up anymore, however resizing is a bit erratic (probably
bad interaction with the inc hints ...).

By the way, should we implement _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN?
Also you just wrote all the code for _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW but
the trivial stuff in fvwm/ewmh*

Creating the headlines page from the following two URLs might be easier.(This

Well, they still kind of work, just no real news.

I'm already on the job - I'm getting nervous with a half finished
patch in cvs :-)

Actually, I have difficulties to understand the design of the
ewmh_...c files.  I understand there are properties that are

 * set once on the root window at fvwm startup
 * set on the root window but updated regularly
 * set by fvwm on application windows (?)
 * set by once applications on their windows when mapped
 * set by apps on their window and updated later (?)
 * client messages from apps to fvwm
 * client messages from fvwm to client windows.

Where is this all located in the code and how does it correspond
to the nine atom lists in ewmh.c?  What is the idea behind these
lists and how are they handled.  E.g., are the atoms in the lists
detected automatically?

I have written a small testing app and found a lot of bugs that
are all fixed now.  Can you check with Tk, please?  If anything
strange happens give instructions to reproduce and post the
console output.

The seven detection methods are:


  - _NET_WM_PID (dould not find an application that sets it)
  - full screen detection (icccm)
  - full screen detection (traditional)
  - moving window adjacent to a border (icccm)
  - moving window adjacent to a border (traditional)
  - moving window by the border width/height (icccm) while it
    would stay in the same placew with the traditional method.
  - same for traditional

I did not test the _NET_WM_PID detection yet.

> By the way, should we implement _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN?

Yes.  I'd like to do it myself to gather some experience with the
ewmh code.

> Also you just wrote all the code for _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW but
> the trivial stuff in fvwm/ewmh*

Yes, I think so.  The logic in the __cr_get_grav_position()
function should return the requested frame position.  It needs
some work on the interface, though.

It's clearly not C and should not compile.

Bitte :-)

I was the one guilty of decalaring a variable after a statement in a
block.
But I'm aware that this is not correct C. It was a mistake. I'm surprised
that could compile. (I'm using gcc 3.3), is this a bug in gcc?
That should only work in C++, shouldn't it?

And while we are at nitpicking:  we all use 

  foo.[ch], foo.{c,h} or Fvwm*.c

sometimes in the ChangeLog.  This makes it hard to grep for
changes.  We should not use these wildcard constructs at all in
the ChangeLog.

In fact. it's legal in C99.

Maybe we should state that code must compile in "C89 mode". A guess this
is not anymore standard in gcc (I'm pretty sure it was in gcc 2.x).
I guess -pendantic is a good idea to use.

That's declarations anywhere.

I think Dominik was objecting to block declarations.

I'm not sure of the exact status of block declarations.
I've been trying to find the standard with little luck.

By "block declarations", do you mean to declare variables in any block,
not just at the top of a function?
Declaring variables in in arbitrary block (before "real" statements), I
think has been allowed in C since at lest C89.

Sorry, I missed something in Dominik's original comment:

 * Do not write something like this:

     {
       int x;
       y = 2;
       int z;
     }

   This is not C and usually does not compile.


A block declaration would be:

int func()
  {
...
     {
       int x;
       int z;
       y = 2;
     }

I've added a document listing the coding/development conventions I
follow.  I hope it is useful for fvwm newbies.  Only a few rules
are absolutely strict.  If you want to discuss or add anything,
feel free to bring it up on the mailing list.

Yup.  Block declarations are fine.

Is it possible to change the behaviour of the C mode in Emacs?
It normally indents brases 2 columns from the "parent" line (if, while
etc.)
Or is there some alternative C mode recommended?

The problem with this is it is impossible now to know the exact command
spelling, previously CMD_TearMenuOff appeared in functable.c just like
for other normal commands. I may solve this by hardcoding some spellings
in perllib/FVWM/create-commands, but the previous situation was better
for parsing.

The logic in the lists splitting is a bit different. There are
comments which explain this logic where there are defined. Basically,
atoms in a given list are handled in the same way by the code. The
code is maybe a bit difficult to understand at first reading but it is
easy to add new EWMH stuff as a lot of things are done automatically:
_basically_ add an atom in a list with a function handler and you have
done.

Note that the signification of an atom can depends on how it is used.
For, example the atoms in the EWMH_ATOM_LIST_WM_STATE can be received
by fvwm as a client message (send by any application) to ask a state
change.  Secondly, the wm must set the _NET_WM_STATE on an application
window with the atoms of the EWMH_ATOM_LIST_WM_STATE accordingly with
the state of the window. Finally, a window can map with a
_NET_WM_STATE set on it to indicate a desired mapping state. It is
useful to have such a list for automatic handling of these 3
situations via the functions handler of the list. These functions
should handle 3 different situations:

- Client msg (ev != NULL && style == NULL)
- Initial Mapping with the state set (ev == NULL && style != NULL).
  Note the additional arg "any" (== has_hint) for recapture and
  restarting.
- Query of the state (ev == NULL && style == NULL)

Yes. For example to add a _NET_WM_STATE add it to the
EWMH_ATOM_LIST_WM_STATE list (in alphabetic order) and write down the
function handler (all the other stuff is done automatically: client
msg detection, initial mapping checking, state query for
_NET_WM_STATE, addition in the list of supported _NET stuff).

I will add more comment in ewmh code, but the list name and the
functions handler name can be used to know where a given EWMH property
is handled.

It seems to work as mozilla set it and the good algo is choosen.
(All KDE >= 2 and GNOME2 apps set this prop).

It seems that this start to work. But what about a FullScreen command
which removes the decoration, MoveResize the window to the size
of the screen and possibly put the window in a given layer:

FullScreen [bool] [StayOnTop|layer x y] [size_hint_override]

then we define defaults fvwm func:

AddToFunc EWMHFullScreenOn I FullScreen On
AddToFunc EWMHFullScreenOff I FullScreen Off

which are called when needed by the ewmh code.

What about building a ConfigureRequest event and send it to the
"events code" with an override_gravity arg (which forces icccm
motion algo and use the override_gravity gravity in the place
of the app gravity)?

I'd prefer doing this via a function.  We have way too many move/
resize/maximize functions already.  The new ewmh code calls the
ResizeMoveMaximize command.

Thath's what I thought about.  To keep the code clean, the gravity
should be passed in through the argument list, as opposed to
temporarily modifying the fw->hints.win_gravity field.  And it
should be safe to assume that an application using this protocol
uses the ICCCM conformant way of specifying its position in
ConfigureRequests.

Hi all,

I observed this with version 2.5.8 from last saturday. It happens only
with certain programs, such as an old gimp version (1.1.7). If I set a
style like this:

Style Gimp StartsOnPage 1 0

all is well: when the gimp window appears the screen jumps to page 1 0.
But when I add:

Style Gimp SkipMapping

the StartsOnPage style is completely *ignored*. I tried this with an
otherwise empty config.
The funny thing is, it only happens with certain applications. With other
programs (e.g. xterm, emacs) it works exactly as documented. The programs
'assistent' and 'designer' from Qt 3.0.3 surfaced the problem, too.
But some small programs I wrote with the same toolkit behave correctly.
I'm quite puzzled.

Best regards,

Jochen

Gimp by default remembers the position at which if was when it was
closed the last time.  As you probably were on page 1 0 when you
did this, It remembered for example (0 0), which is always the
page you are looking at when you start it.  Currently there is no
way to have both:  start it on page 1 0 and remember its position
on the page.  To 'fix' the problem, either disable that gimp
remembers its position in the preferences dialog or put this in
your .fvwm2rc:

  Style Gimp NoPPosition

Marcus, _very_ cool & sorry for the delay in getting back to ya.  I just
downloaded 'fvwm-snap-20030707' and tried the Arabic sample I mailed you.
It core dumps on me upon startup (well, fvwm never does startup) - you have
all my files, you don't get coredumps ?  I'll include the backtrace as well
as what fvwm spewed out upon its exit (for grins),

If I remove the Arabic strings, all works well.

Let me know if you need more info.

Yes. But I do not see how to restore the "initial" window state
without a designed command (or an new Maximize flags) for fullscreen:

AddToFunc EWMHFullScreenOn
+ I WindowStyle !Borders, !Title
+ I WindowStyle StaysOnTop
+ I Maximize ewmhiwa 100 100

AddToFunc EWMHFullScreenOff
+ I WindowStyle Borders, Title
+ I WindowStyle StaysPut
+ I Maximize off

works well only on decorated stays put window.

Again - use the ResizeMoveMaximize command.  It does all you need
at the same time.  I see no need to remove the window decorations.
Moving them off screen should suffice.

A more detailed reply.  I should have read more carefully.

 1) I think fiddling with the window's decorations and layer is a
    bad idea.  If the application wants the window on a specific
    layer it can use the layer protocol.

 2) The StaysOnTop style is used only for new windows.  The Layer
     command must be used for existing windows.

Without these two, restoring the initial state is trivial.

 3) And finally, I noticed that certain information about the
    window is not accessible from functions.  To allow placing the
    window with ResizeMoveMaximize we need:  the size of the
    window decorations on the top and left sides and the geometry
    of its Xinerama screen.  This can be done with a couple of new
    variables:

    Border width + title thickness:

     $[w.decorsize.left]
     $[w.decorsize.right]
     $[w.decorsize.width]   # sum of last two
     $[w.decorsize.top]
     $[w.decorsize.bottom]
     $[w.decorsize.height]  # sum ov last two

    Only title geometry:

     $[w.title.thickness]
     $[w.title.direction]

    Only border geometry:

     $[w.bordersize.left]
     $[w.bordersize.right]
     $[w.bordersize.top]
     $[w.bordersize.bottom]

    Screen related:

     $[w.screen] # Xinerama screen number
     $[scr.x.<screen #>]
     $[scr.y.<screen #>]
     $[scr.width.<screen #>]
     $[scr.height.<screen #>]

Phew, that's a whole lot of new code.

Bye

Oh well, I'm a bit slow today.  You meant a command that is called
by the user, not one to be called from the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN code, right?  As you said, it can't be
implemented in 2.6 because you can not find out the initial style
and state of the window.  For 3.0 I want to have more flexible
style parsing:

 - The setting for every style can be queried by a variable, e.g.

     $[w.style.StaysOnTop]   -> true/false
     $[w.style.HandleWidth]  -> <integer>
     $[w.style.TitleAtLeft]  -> true/false

 - For every style, an option that can be passed to a style
   command can be generated:

     $[w.styleoption.StaysOnTop] -> <nil>/Layer <n>
     $[w.styleoption.HandleWidth] -> <nil>/HandleWidth <n>
     $[w.styleoption.TitleAtLeft] -> <nil>/TitleAt{Top,Left,Right,Bottom}

 - Similar interface for querying styles by pattern.

 - Using style options in conditions, e.g.

     Next (TitleAtLeft, HandleWidth 0) WindowShade

But I don't see this in 2.6.

Bye

Yes, it works for me (although right now I'm rewriting the underline
textdrawing, so at the moment it's not compiling). Could you please send
me the output from ./configure

Another thing is that I renamed some files on 20030706.
Did you unpack the snapshot over an existing source? Could this be the
problem, I don't think so, but maybe...
I'll try to compile from the snapshot myself, and see what I find.

I tried the snapshot.
It worked for me, but when checking the code from the snapshot against
your trace, I found a bug that might be the problem:

The goes like this:

		char_len = 0;
		i = 0;
		while(fws->e_str[i] != 0 && i < len)
		{
		        curr_len = FlocaleStringNumberOfBytes(
				flf, fws->str + i);
			char_len++;
			i += curr_len;
		}

this code calculates the number of characters (not number of bytes,
"chars").
It traverses the string stepping for the amount of bytes comprising each
character. It stops when it encounters the NULL char OR when it has
traversed as much as the length specified.
But since here i is incremented by the number of bytes for each character,
if the string is invalid, i might be incremented past the end of the
string, if for example the last character is a 2-byte UTF-8 char but the
second last byte would indicate a 3-byte sequence. Then i would point PAST
the NULL-byte for the next check in the while-statement

So the conditions should be swapped (since C evaluates the second only if
the first was true).

		char_len = 0;
		i = 0;
		while(i < len && fws->e_str[i] != 0)
		{
		        curr_len = FlocaleStringNumberOfBytes(
				flf, fws->str + i);
			char_len++;
			i += curr_len;
		}
 
I'm not sure if this is why it crashes for you. But in that case running
with this rc-file should give strange results also in older snapshots.

I made the modification, but cannot commit right now, since I'm in a
non-working/compiling state...

Well, why don't you just fix it :-)

By the way, I don't understand why while loops are so popular.  In
this case, you have all four parts of a for loop:  initialisation,
condition, loop body and increment:

  for (char_len = 0, i = 0;
       i < len && fws->e_str[i] != 0;
       char_len++, i += curr_len)
  {
    curr_len = FlocaleStringNumberOfBytes( flf, fws->str + i);
  }

Easier to read and less error prone.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

then the whole FvwmWharf disappears.  This behaviour does not seem to be
unavoidable.  For example, under Afterstep the Wharf button where the
killed window was swallowed simply goes blank and the rest of the Wharf
stays.

[The reason I tried to do this is that I run xbiff on a remote host,
where my mail is delivered, displaying on my local host by tunnelling
the X traffic through an ssh login, but I need to kill the xbiff
before I can log out.  And I like to have the xbiff in my FvwmWharf.
But the bug I am describing occurs with entirely locally running
programs.]

This problem may be fixed, but FvwmWharf was not developed for years.

Most of the developers seem to use FvwmButtons that may do pretty
everything FvwmWharf does. It even has auto Respawn, UseOld, NoClose
and other swallowing options, so you should suggest to switch to
FvwmButtons if a user is not satisfied with swallowing in FvwmWharf.

Mikhael.

FullScreen should remove decorations, at least this is what a user
expects. A window in the full screen mode should occupy only one page.
A window occupying 9 pages (ResizeMoveMaximize) causes several problems.

fvwm-themes has MaximizeFullScreen functions similar to the ones above
for some years. Of course it uses Style $n to remove decorations,
so there are often glitches (unrelated windows loosing decorations).
The proper way to do this is using WindowStyle, not Style $n, of course.
There are several other things in fvwm-themes that require WindowStyle.

As for me, restoring the initial values of the layer and decorations is
a bonus, but not very important, the functions similar to the ones above
may be enough until 3.0. What is more important for 2.6 is WindowStyle.
So a user has a full control on his windows individually, something that
is possible in most of the other window managers.

Returning to this thread, it is nice that we support both application
move methods now. Nice work, Dominik.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Some shorter (and I hope understandable) suggestions:
MoveByProgramMethod, ProgrammaticMoveMethod.

OK, now I've submitted code to handle underlining, together with the above
fix.
But, just now I reallised I've been testing using a UTF-8 locale.
I tried to run with a non-UTF-8 locale (sv_SE). Using the Arabic rc file,
it dumps core. But my usual configuration works (except Cond is no longer
valid...)

Now I feel so stupid... So the risk is the current snapshots only work
using Arabic in a UTF-8 locale.

I'll do further debugging.... ^_^

This user does not.

I would like to have the fvwm decorations retained on
windows/programs that (try) to go full-screen by their own mechanism
(say mozilla) ... unless that is against some spec.  If fvwm's idea
of full-screen is different than the client, i would like to have
some control on the fvwm aspect.

(FWIW, i just tried acrobat 5.06; decorations are retained but title
bar is moved outside of current view.)

We speak about functions posted by Olivier, if you need decorations that
are out of the screen and unaccessible, define these functions
differently. Or maybe just don't request windows to go full-screen.

Removing decorations should be at least an option if not the default.
There are several problems in a window occupying 9 pages. For example: a
window looks a bit strange in a pager; 2 full-screen windows on different
pages overlap each other, without decorations they would not conflict;
when you shade such window it ends up mostly in the different page;
conditions Visible and CurrentPage work on 9 pages for such window
although a user intended a window to maximized on one page only; there is
also a Xinerama related issue:

  http://mail.gnome.org/archives/wm-spec-list/2003-March/msg00062.html

I may continue this list, for example if full-screen window has
decorations, it is not clear whether to start to count WarpToWindow from
decorations or from a window, either way may be problematic, currently it
counts from a client window with maximized mozilla, if full-screen window
has no decorations there is no such problem.

Again, removing decorations should not be forced, but at least allowed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The first one is fine.  I don't like the second suggestion because
the style name does not begin with "Move".

I agree with parv that this should *at least* be configurable.
Moving the title bar off screen or even disabling it completely is
about the worst abuse of the power given to an application.  In
many configurations this has the potential to make the desktop
totally unusable.  Perhaps we should think of an emergency key
binding to disable the full screen state of all windows on the
current page.

I don't think anybody suggested that.  I was talking about
Xinerama screens.

There may be an easy way to achieve overriding styles for a
limited period of time.  Add a field to the style structure that
can contain a unique style id.  Then throw in a couple of
features:

  StyleWithId <envvar> <Stylename> <Options>

    Like Style, but assigns a unique id to the style and stores it
    in the environment variable <envvar>.  Styles with different
    ids can not be merged.  By default, all normal styles have the
    id 0.

  DestroyStyleId <id>

    Destroys the style with the <id>.

Usage:

  AddToFunc foo
  + I StyleWithId SID_$w $n HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0, NoTitle

and later:

  ThisWindow DestroyStyleWithId $$[SID_$w]

(The ThisWIndow call is necessary to force expanding variables
twice - no idea how to do this in a functions.)

--

By the way, this idea shows nicely one of the shortcomings of a
WindowStyle command separate from the Style command.  You'd have
to add the id functionality to both.

Sure, I'll attach config.log/config.cache (let me know if you want these
things off-list).  Its also odd that my sample files work for you, but
not me.

I unpacked snap-20030707 onto its own new directory and do have the new
renamed files (ie. did the right thing all along).

Again, there is no difference in my Arabic setup compared to what I mailed
you - so I doubt I'm hitting any NULL or malformed characters (while you
are not).

Older snapshots (pre your changes) worked great for me in terms of Arabic.
With the exception of composing (the superimposing of characters).

As noted, I made the change but don't see any difference.  I got the same

Seems very good to me.

Minor things:

* I would add a word "usually" when you say a menu should be bound using
Key/Mouse, because there are a lot of other ways to open a menu, like
a command from a module, Schedule, PipeRead or another menu item.

* Typo "selcted".

* The following sentence is not strictly correct, replace:

  Clicking anywhere or pressing any key unposts the menu and reverts back
  to normal operation.

with:

  To unpost the menu wither click any key or press the same submenu
  again.

* The second "Ctrl-B" should be replaced with "b", the second "Ctrl-F"
with "f".

I may fix these if needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Let's see. :) This introduces 2 temporary commands that do not help at
all to implement invidual window styles. The style changes are still
applied to all windows with the same name, it relies on environement
variables and it still suffers from a problem that X assigns the same id
to different windows (close a window and open a new one).

WindowStyle and DestroyWindowStyle commands and their syntax was thought
and designed to be final, they do not need to be thrown away at all.
At least it is my impression that Olivier, me, Dan and Tim discussed it
and agreed that WindowStyle is good to be non temporary.

Anyway, if you can implement "WindowStyle <style-options>" syntax
differently than Olivier, it would be just fine with me. The point here
is to have individual window styles and thus to improve fvwm, not to have
an implementation that you don't agree with. Although I should say that
I think that the second Olivier implementation is good and clean.

If you don't agree with the WindowStyle syntax I would like to know why.
For me, regardless of how we may redesign (or not) Style command, the
minimal WindowStyle syntax working on window context will always remain
good and meaninful. Just what we miss for individual window styles.

I thought about this problem too, and the best I can think is using
Schedule 0 command... I guest we need a dummy prefix Expand or similar.

FVWM version i am using is 2.5.7.

I was trying to build a menu ("bg-menu" in this case) entries w/
help of a fvwm function ("bg-solid-add-menu") ...

  DestroyFunc  bg-solid-add-menu
  AddToFunc    bg-solid-add-menu
  # 0: menu name, 1: color name, 2: color value
  + I AddToMenu $0 "$1 - $2"  Exec xsetroot -solid $2

  DestroyMenu  bg-menu
  AddToMenu    bg-menu background  Title
  +  Function bg-solid-add-menu  bg-menu black black
  +  Function bg-solid-add-menu  bg-menu grey grey55


...but that leaves only "Function" named entries which do nothing.
(It is as if "Function" is not special when not used as an menu
action.)

(I know about "PipeRead" & "DynamicPopupAction", and thought that
they would not of help.  From the description of PipeRead, it
seems to execute only external commands, not the functions.  And
"DynamicPop*" functions would act/be usable only on pop up menus.)


What would be the correct way, short of executing external commands,
to use a fvwm function to build a menu?

(I have some faint memory of somebody's creation which created menu
entries and key bindings from one set of specification.  In any
case, i failed to find anything relevant at
http://www.mail-archive.com/fvwm@hpc.uh.edu/.)


Thanks for reading till here.

Remove "+" in the last 2 lines and it will work for you. Or just:

  bg-solid-add-menu  bg-menu black black
  bg-solid-add-menu  bg-menu grey grey55

You may do this line to create your menu:

  PipeRead `perl -e 'foreach ("black - black", "grey - grey55") { / - /; print qq(AddToMenu bg-menu "$_" Exec xsetroot -solid $'"'"'\\n); }'`

  Popup bg-menu

The original perl print command (after all escapes) looks like:

  print qq(AddToMenu bg-menu "$_" Exec xsetroot -solid $'\n);

Mikhael.

Whoopee!  That did it; thanks much.

This point (about not putting '+' to execute function in place, in
a menu) seems to be missing from the fvwm(1) page.  Only thing
i found....

  +     Used to continue adding to the last specified decor, function
        or menu.  See the  discussion  for  AddToDecor,  AddToFunc,
        and AddToMenu.


...there is no mention about the above in any of AddTo* sections.
Oh well.


(As to your perl code, i meant originally that i would *much* prefer a
fvwm solution before resorting to shell or perl. Thanks anyway.)

Or vice versa, same difference.  As long as there is a way to

>From the ewmh spec:

_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicate that the window should fill the entire
screen and have no window decoration.

Also there are stacking order recommendation in the ewmh spec. At present
time fvwm respect this recommendation only if the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints
style is used (off by default). The recommendation is:

- window with _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW
- normal window
- panel/dock apps (_NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK) without  _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW
- FULLSCREEN window with the _focus_

Regarding this there is two types of user. Those who want its
"panel" (or main Buttons or TaskBar) on top and those who want
its "panel" put (like me and you dominik I think). The first type
of users will want fullscreen window on top, the others will want
fullscreen window put.
I do not want to consider the _focus_ condition (but this can be
implemented with WindowStyle + FvwmEvent and a FullScreen condition).
So a reasonable alternative is to use the same layer than the "panel"
for fullscreen window.

So my suggestion is to add a new fvwm command

--
FullScreen [flags] [bool]

Without its optional arguments (or if the bool bit has the value
"toggle")  FullScreen causes the window to alternately switch  from
a  full-screen size without decoration to its normal size with its
normal decoration.  To force a window into full-screen (normal) state
you can use a "True" or  "False"  value for the bool argument.

The optional flags argument is a space separated list containing the
following key words: ewmh, layer x, ontop, decoration,
size_override. These options are useful only when the window switch to
full-screen and the possible effect caused by these options are
discarded when the window switch back to its normal size. layer x put
the fullscreen window into layer x, ontop put the fullscreen window
into the StaysOnTop layer, ewmh put the fullscreen window into the
StaysOnTop layer only if the window has the EWMHUseStackingOrderHints
style, decoration forces to do not remove the window decoration.  A
full-screen window may not be resized to the full size of the screen,
because a window may require some specific sizes.  The size_override
key word forces screen full size.
-- 

Of course as we are in feature freeze it is may be not reasonable
to add this command??

Then, we add default functions

EWMHFullScreenOn I FullScreen ewmh True

EWMHFullScreenOff I FullScreen False

that the user can redefine.

If we do not add such a command I think we should leave the code
at is now (decoration off screen!?) or we need to add new variables
as explained in 3) to be able to define EWMHFullScreen{On,Off}.

By the way, Dominik if I well understand your last mail in
the "StyleById patch voting thread" thread, the addition of the
WindowStyle command will not have grave consequence?

I think you know my opinion about the recommendations made by the
EWMH :-)  It's a license to annoy the users.  In my eyes, defining
policy in the spec is stupid.

Not for 2.6.  It is way too complex and error prone.

It already had the consequence that I no longer care about the
feature freeze.  Does that qualify for 'grave'?  And I made it
clear several times that I think adding a new command is a mistake
(see somewhere above in this thread for an example).

I thought it was clear that this isn't a proposal but a sketch of
the idea.

I disagree.  Separate commands will lead to matrices of commands
plus options they have to support.

Now it should work to use a Unicde font in a non-UTF-8 locale (I tried
using "C" and "sv_SE") and use composing characters (tried with the Arabic
strings Nadim supplied).

I tested this with normal and rotated text using locales "C", "sv_SE" and
"sv_SE.UTF-8".

Nadim, do some of the Arabic combining characters have there equivalent in
ISO-8859-6?
Could you supply me with some strings in ISO-8859-6, I would like to test
it.

Thank you in advance.

//Marcus

I can not reproduce bug C.17 with Intellimouse scrollwheel (from that big
company staring with an "M"....)
Reportedly, Olivier couldn't reproduce it on his touchpad wheel either...

It says:

Popup command opens popup menus.  Releasing a mouse
              button over a popup menu activates the  item  below
              the pointer and executes the associated action.

              Menu  is  a  very similar command, but the menus it
              opens are  slightly  less  transient.   A  separate
              click is required to activate a menu item - releas=AD
              ing a mouse button does not activate it.

but, releasing the mouse over an item activates it also using using the
command "Menu". Or did I misunderstand the sentance?
A popup will get unposted on release, a "Menu" gets unposted by selecting
a non-menu item or clicking outside. Isn't that correct?

I agree.

Thinking about the emergency key. We already have Alt-Tab that may be
used to switch to any (non WindowListSkip) window. WindowList calls
WindowListFunc that currently contains this line among others:

  + I Iconify off

In case we will have FullScreen command, I think, we should also add:

  + I FullScreen off

to the default WindowListFunc. This will help users to bring their
windows to a normal state. Just an idea, nothing else.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You may run "iconv -f utf-8 -t iso8859-6" to convert from any encoding to
any. Another way to get some strings is: "env LANG=ar_JO.iso8859-6 date".

Then, probably, this is a good idea to schedule FvwmWharf removal from

Great, let me see if your changes are in the 0709 snapshot.  Yup
they are.

BTW: on some systems I get the following error,

 cd . \
   && CONFIG_FILES=Makefile CONFIG_HEADERS= /bin/sh ./config.status
 creating Makefile
 ld.so.1: make: fatal: librt.so.1: version `SUNW_1.2' not found (required by
file make)
 Killed

and on others I don't - thought it might be of interest to add that
check as well into configure possibly.

Problematic - uname -a : SunOS pez 5.7 Generic_106541-15 sun4u
OK          - uname -a : SunOS pod 5.8 Generic_108528-15 sun4u

Marcus, I'm confirming that your changes in fact work :-)  Well done !!!

Its a long story, but don't bother with ISO-8859-6 (its not usable),
you won't see shaping.

In short, per

  http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html#ISO-8859-6

   ''This fixed font is not well-suited for text display.
     Each Arabic letter occurs in up to four (2^2) presentation
     forms: initial, medial, final or separate [and 8859-6 is
     missing all except "separate"].''

All of our work on Arabeyes.org have been strictly UTF-8.

Regards,

 - Nadim

The Function lines without "+" do not belong to the last AddToMenu.
They just happen to extend the same menu, but they may be placed
anywhere after adding the title of the menu.

Your original posted code does exactly what is explained, it continues to
add menu item to the last "AddToMenu bg-menu", the name of these items is
"Function" and they call your function bg-solid-add-menu with parameters.

If you actually run the original code above, do "Popup bg-menu", choose
some item named "Function" this same menu bg-menu gets extended with real
"black - black" items, that you may see on the next "Popup bg-menu".

I don't think any documentation is missing, maybe just add a more
explicit note in the first paragraph of the new MENUS section that
AddToMenu commands must not be continuous, one can remove or extend any
menu at any point dynamically.

Mikhael.

Excluding FvwmWharf and some other non maintained modules is a matter of
time. Probably in 3.0.

Looks like you're using a make which was compiled on Solaris 8 and
requires symbols from the librt that was installed on that system.  If
you recompile your make on your S7 box, it should work fine on both S7
and S8 (and up).  Alternately, have one compiled for each OS, but that's
usually a waste of effort.  Or use /usr/ccs/bin/make.  :)

This unfortunately does not work if the full screen window is the
only window.

We could extend the Ctrl-Alt-Escape sequence we already use for
similar purposes.  In addition to what it already does, it would
call a "Quarantaine" function that quanrantaines the window under
the pointer.  Ideally the function would

 * Remove the window from the desktop, perhaps by iconifying it.
   The window must be unmapped to ensure it can not cause further
   damage on the desktop.

 * Show a reprensentation of all windows in quarantaine and allow
   the user to end the quarantaine by clicking on the placeholder.

You are right.  "Menu" behaves exatly like "Popup" if you drag the
pointer with a button held.  The only difference is that the menu
is held open if it's invoked with a click whereas a Popup would
close immediately.

Is there any feature that can not be simulated by FvwmButtons?  We
already have eliminated some modules by providing emulation of
their syntax by another module (FvwmAudio, FvwmTalk).  FvwmWharf
seems to be another good candidate.

If WindowListFunc includes "FullScreen off" it will work even if there is
only one window. Or do you mean extreme cases unrelated to full screen?

I would think more before implementing something like this. A lot of
users already have bindings that make such emergency key redundant.
I may count several such bindings in fvwm-themes, for example Alt-Mouse1
inside any window opens the root menu, Alt-Mouse2 raiselowers/moves the
window, Alt-Mouse3 opens the window menu and Alt-F9 iconifies the window.

Another Alt-Tab based solution may be as follows. When we will support
different mouse buttons in a menu, i.e. supporting different menu item
actions depending on the mouse button, we could bind a window operation
menu to the right mouse click in the WindowList menu. Such window
operation menu could contain Iconify, Move and other window operations.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just for the curious, I tried to find all emergency keys in fvwm-themes,
and it is not easy, there are a lot. :) Like Ctrl-Alt-arrows to switch
pages, Ctrl-Alt-1 to Ctrl-Alt-4 to switch desks, Ctrl-Alt-0 to go to the
previous page/desk, Shift-Ctrl-keypad or Shift-Alt-keypad to move the
window to either other pages or for some pixels in the given direction.
Additionally, Alt-F6 may be always used to restore the window from the
maximized/iconified/shaded state, it will be surely extended to support
full screen as well. Did I mention Alt-F11, Alt-PgDn and Alt-PgUp? :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

I was thinking about an aid in finding memory leaks.
We already have wrappers for malloc,calloc,realloc.

So it would be easy to make theese macros (to be able to print the name of
the argument for debug) and also print-out the returned adress.

Then the hard part: there will need to be a wrapper for free
(safefree?) that can print the adress when debugging. So, here all
occurences of free will have to be replaced.

(By the way, free(ptr) is equivalent to realloc(ptr,0) )

Is this an idea that sounds interesting? Or am I the only one who think
finding memory leaks can be tough?

I know there is tests run with Purify at times, but this to me seems like
a good thing. The problem is that it might get a lot of output for stuff
that is not relevant when debugging some newly written code.

I believe there are a few OpenSource memory checkers:

http://www.consistent.org/terran/memorycheck.shtml

Purify does more than leak checking, it has bounds checking
and notices if you process uninitialised memory.
It sometimes flags things that aren't real problems,
but its not a big problem.

I've been tied up doing work for quite a while, and it looks
like it will continue but I usually find time to run tests
under Purify when asked.

I think it's a sad comment on the ethics of humanity
when we have to hide our email addresses.

Regrettably, I've obscured my email address on my personal web pages
and stuck NOSPAM into my Usenet postings.  I don't know how
much harvesting takes place against this list but I suppose
there is some.

There is also probably a major leak from robots scanning
the ChangeLog (for the developers).

Anyway, if you don't get a response this time, send mail
directly to Jason.  I don't know that he reads every mail
on this list.

If this is regarding a MHonArc update then I'll be happy to accept the
donation of a MHonArc config file and save myself the work.  If it's
not involving a MHonArc update then please supply some more context.

I think we should switch from the birthday web theme back.
At least take off the colorful background.

Hi,
I was testing the new combining character feature with cvs fvwm
(checked out on july 12 03). I found that I can make fvwm Segfault
by doing the following:

with my locale set to en_US.UTF-8
start fvwm with the following in my .fvwm2rc

########
Mouse 1 R N Menu  TestMenu
AddtoMenu TestMenu
+ ""  Nop
+ "a+b " Nop
+ "TE SG-1, a = v = r, a  b" Nop
+ "    " Nop
+ "     " Nop
+ "" Nop
+ "" Nop
+ " " Nop
+ "" Nop
+ "" Nop
+ "   " Nop
+ "  " Nop
+ "  "
########
#

then click mouse button 1 to pop up the menu,
then move the mouse up and down, going through the menu items a few times.

this is when I get the core dump.

If you need more info let me know,

I dont think that .fvwm2rc made it to the list properly,
you can download it here if you need to:

We do not currently support GTK+ version 2 in FvwmGtk, so it is good that
it is not detected. There was once a patch to add the GTK+ version 2
support (to 2.5.x of course, 2.4.x will not be extended) and it used
pkg-config I think. But the author probably has no time to finish it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I found a bug that can cause FVWM to crash in some circumtances.
I've checked in a bug-fix. So it should be OK in the next snapshot.

By the way, I was thinking about generating random UTF-8 strings for
testing. How did you generate these strings?
Did you just pick some characters? I could see there is even runic letters
in there (but the reading makes no sense...)

And thank you for finding the bug.

I couldnt understand them either :-)
I found them here: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt
this program might be of interest too:

We tried insure++ in the past which is cool but waaaaay too
expensive.  We never managed to get a free copy from the company,
so we have to do without it.  Recently, Olivier discovered
valgrind, which does a fair job in finding memory leaks without
having to recompile.  ANd it's free.  You will want to use the
latest code from CVS (sourceforge).

Hm.  I upgraded my system to Gnome 2.2.  The default window manager is
sawfish.

When I run "fvwm -r" (this is FVWM 2.5.7) then FVWM starts, but sawfish
doesn't stop!!  IOW, my FVWM button bar appears but all my windows,
including the button bar, are still decorated by sawfish not FVWM.

Any ideas?

If we could get this working it would be nice to have an entry for Gnome
2 in the FAQ, because the current info there for Gnome is all Gnome 1.x
based (there is no Window Manager option under the control panel
etc. anymore, that I can find...)

"killall sawfish"? If this does not work and it is restarted, try to
remove sawfish from the Session Properties dialog (I hope there is one
in GNOME 2).

Yes, this is what I eventually did.  Yes there is a session control
dialog; it's here:

  Foot -> Applications -> Desktop Preferences -> Advanced -> Sessions

However, after I killed sawfish and started fvwm, fvwm does not appear
in the list of apps in the current session in the session manager.  It
used to appear there in Gnome 1.4 (that's how I switched last time), but
no longer.  Note I'm using the gnome session manager, not fvwm's session
manager.  Do I need to start fvwm with a special flag for this?

I compiled fvwm with almost everything enabled, except the GNOME support
for FvwmGtk (because there's no gnome-config on my system: for some
reason it's not provided with the gnome2 development packages on
Debian).

Since it's not there, when I save my session, then log out and back in,
it won't know to restart fvwm.


Another thing is that the fonts don't look so hot anymore: I'm using
Microsoft's Arial TrueType font for window titles, menus, etc. and they
used to look excellent, but now they look blocky and uneven.  They still
look great in some parts of the desktop (stuff that's rebuilt
specifically for Gnome 2?), but not others.  Anyone have any ideas?  I
think it's because I'm using a different font server/rendering engine
(freetype2?) but I don't know the details.

I don't know about the rest of your issues, but gnome-config
is for Gnome 1.

pkg-config is for Gnome 2.

So, I guess this means that the FVWM configure.in needs to be updated to
grok this change--or, Mikhael/Olivier, do you think there are other
changes needed to support Gnome2?

I can do the configure.in changes, if someone can tell me how pkg-config
should be invoked.  Unfortunately on my system when I invoke --list-all
I get weird errors, so I don't think using my system as an example is a
good idea:

  # pkg-config --list-all
  libpng                    libpng10 - Loads and saves PNG files
  libpng10                  libpng10 - Loads and saves PNG files
  glib-2.0                  GLib - C Utility Library
  libxml                    libXML - libXML library.

  Package gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-2.0.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  Package 'gtk+-2.0', required by 'gnome-window-settings-2.0', not found

:(

So, is there a particular pkg-config package we should be looking for?

Don't worry about gnome-config, there are bigger issues like adding
support for GTK+ version 2 in FvwmGtk.

You don't need gnome-libs support. The only difference is whether you get
core file dumped or the GNOME Bug Report dialog when FvwmGtk is crashed
(if you use FvwmGtk at all), nothing more interesting then this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Great.

At present time we have to "fix" our default configuration files
to get a fixed set of strings to translate (we do not want to ask
you to translate strings which will change ...).

We will not forget you! Thanks, Olivier

What are your exact fvwm configuration lines for loading font?  Do you
use Xft or core fonts rendering?

About FreeType2 lib, a compile time option (off by default for licence
reseon) can lead to a better font rendering.

Using a font server (as xfs) or not can also change fonts rendering
(for core fonts rendering).

The obvious idea after reading the SM spec (and the ICCCM2) is to use
the SM_CLIENT_ID property (on a possible WM_CLIENT_LEADER window) But,
at first view the gnome panels have no SM_CLIENT_ID set!!  I think
that sawfish, metacity, icewm and kwin simply ignore window without
the SM_CLIENT_ID property set (on the client leader) regarding session
management.

I think we should add the SM_CLIENT_ID as the main identifier in
the session code and either:
 - do not reset "session state" for windows with an identifier
   (sm client id, name ...etc) with two matching identifiers in the
   session window list.
or
 - simply do not save/restore state for window without SM_CLIENT_ID.

Oh gack.  This one is my fault.

I'm using Arial at home, but at work I was using adobe-helvetica.  I
guess it was a bitmapped font or something, anyway it looked bad.

I installed the new free Bitstream Vera TrueType fonts and switched to
using those with the xft: method, and it looks sweet now!  You do have
to remember to put in the minspace=True, I find, because the default is
definitely False and you definitely get too much space above/below the
font without minspace=True.

Cool!


And sorry about the false alarm...

All the rest of my problems seem solved, except this one: anyone have
any idea whether the Gnome 2.2 session manager is sufficiently different
that it doesn't grok FVWM?

It is a fvwm bug. I hope that we will be able to fix it soon.

I switch to the fvwm-workers list.

The problem is simple: all gnome panels have the same name, icon name,
res name and class name! So when we restore the window state fvwm/session.c
is unable to make the distinction between all the gnome panels.

Any idea for a fix?

Regards, Olivier

Does not gnome-panel set unique CLIENT_ID? Any SM aware applications
(like fvwm itself) should support (re)starting with a given client id.
Application names are only an additional confirmation.

I did not notice these additional messages before writing my previous
reply.

I think this bug (gnome-panel does not support XSMP and does not set
SM_CLIENT_ID) should be reported to gnome-panel developers.

Old application do not support XSMP (I think xterm already supports
XSMP, but probably rxvt does not).

After name comparision there is a command line comparision. So if 2
windows have the same command lines (say "xterm -ls -g 80x40") it is
really not important if we replace them, since they are just indentical.

I can't explain how 2 gnome-panel use the same command lines and open
different panels (one at top and one at bottom). I guess one gnome-panel
process opens 2 windows, at top and at bottom.

I would really fix this in gnome-panel, because the current fix makes
old applications (like 2 rxvt with the same parameters) to lose all
fvwm properties/flags on the next session. This is only my understanding.

Regards,
Mikhael.

my rxvt support XSMP.

I do not think there is a gnome-panel bug here: SM_CLIENT_ID and
WM_COMMAND are not set on the managed gnome-panel windows (no leader too).
I think that gnome-panel developer does not want that the gnome-panel state
be restored by the window manager. By the way there is an unmanaged
"gnome-panel" window with SM_CLIENT_ID set.

I think that the correct fix is that session.c totally ignore windows
which do not set SM_CLIENT_ID neither WM_COMMAND. There is no way
for a session manager to start such application at session startup.

Other problems I see with the session code:

- Some session manager now only consider window with XSMP support.
  So an app which use WM_COMMAND will not be started by the session
  manager. So maybe the user will start the app after session startup
  and can be troubled by the fact that fvwm restore the windows app
  state.
  Solution? Detect the session manager and support only XSMP app if this
  session manager support only XSMP app.

- Some app with XSMP support may use the RestartNever style hint.
  The session manager will not start such app at session startup.
  If the user start this app later, again fvwm will restore the state.
  Solution? Can we query the restart style hint or only the session
  manager can do that?

The only general solution I see is a way for the session manager to
say to the wm which apps it will restart at session init.

Hi,

Wouldn't it be a good idea to allow different sizes for the four borders?
(left,right,top,bottom). If one wants to merge the borders with the
titlebar (eg. same color and --flat option), and uses a large border (6 or
more pixels) now he gets a bad-looking titlebar: the text is not verticaly
centered (because there  are also the extra-pixels of the border on top of
titlebar), and the titlebar itself is too big.

Just an idea :-)

Giulio

Greetings to all,

I have changed the default theme of the web page. I made a
new theme which is a bit simpler and therefore a bit faster
than the decorated themes we had before.

As always comments are welcome.

Cheers, Uwe

Ok, I've found the problem: the gnome-session editor wants
the SmCloneCommand. I will commit a "fix" soon.

I can't say I like very much name TestRc. I have a suggestion that makes
names to be single words. For me they are more simple and intuitive:

  rename On, now Test                   ->  Given
  rename Cond, now TestRc               ->  On
  rename CondCase, now KeepRc TestRc    ->  KeepRc On

Here is my reasoning why I think it is more intuitive. The problem with
the test(1) association is that it is too weak and neutral, I may say:

  test -x /usr/bin/xmessage && echo 1

and:

  test -x /usr/bin/xmessage || echo 1

I.e. test as we know it from shell may be used for both "then" and "else".
However, "given <something>" means "if <something> _then_". Similarly,
"on <result> do" means "if we have <result> _then_ do". Just what we need.

For example, here is the syntax in the current cvs:

  Test (Init) Exec exec xterm
  Test (Version 2.5.*) Echo Do not run betas
  Test (f $[HOME]/.fvwm2rc) Echo Move ~/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm/

  Next (FvwmConsole) Focus
  TestRc (Match) Raise
  TestRc (Error) Echo This is probably can't really happen
  TestRc (NoMatch) Module FvwmConsole

When I read this, I can't immediatelly recognize that the if-then
contruction is used. The following looks better for me:

  Given (Init) Exec exec xterm
  Given (Version 2.5.*) Echo Please do not run betas
  Given (f $[HOME]/.fvwm2rc) Echo Suggestion: move ~/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm/

  Next (FvwmConsole) Focus
  On (Match) Raise
  On (Error) Echo This is probably can't really happen
  On (NoMatch) Module FvwmConsole

Like I wrote in one of my previous messages I would unite these two
commands into one Given, but this requires some additional code, so
having separate commands, Given (for any non-window conditions) and On
(for comparing the return code of window conditions), seems good to me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I decided against these terms for three reasons:

 1) "On" and "Given" are not commonly used in programming or
    scripting languages.  I wanted to stick with terms that are
    widely used for checking conditions.
 2) The names do not indicate that only function return codes are
    tested which may be confusing.  I think you wouldn't be happy
    with "OnRc".
 3) For non-native English speakers the terms "On" and "Given" are
    often confusing.

For me it's vice versa.  I'd never catch the idea that "On"
denoted a conditional command unless I knew it before.  It's only
intuitive if you are already aware that it refers to conditions,
not to switching something on or off.  Likewise, "Given" is very
ambiguous when read out of context.

For the same reason "Test" is not used in programming languages to mean
the if-then construction that we need. The purpose of test(1) is to set
the shell return code "$?" and just this. We need something else, a
conditional. Actually "given" is a keyword in Perl 6 for "switch".

IMHO, "OnRc (Error)" is a bit better then "TestRc (Error)", but
"On (Error)" is even better when we need a single word comparison.

We can't really know this, but I think we may ask on fvwm@fvwm.org which
of the 2 syntaxes below the native and non-native English users prefer.

I tried a lot of alternatives before suggesting these terms. I would like
to find clear terms. We have 2 conditional commands, one that requires a
single return code name and one the requires a more complex non-window
condition.

"Given" is not any more ambiguos than "Test". It sounds like a
conditional command. "Test" sounds like we are going to run some
diagnostics and probably to set some return code that is not the case.

When checking for a single return code, "On" seems to be very good:

  On (Success) do something
  On (Failure) do something different

It is possible that my sense of English is bad, but what do others think?

Mikhael.

With the new theme, the window decorations come up blank.  When
the page loads, I see it tries to load the buttons and the window
title, but when it finishes all I get is an empty title bar and
border, although with a relief.

Bye

I agree with Dominik.

On and Given are too ambiguous.

"ON" isn't too bad, its a common idiom from PL/1, and
COBOL, but I can't think of any common UNIX language that
uses "ON".

I can't find anything that uses "GIVEN".

Do you say that for you "On" and "Given" is more ambiguous then "Test"
and "TestRc"? Then I think we should ask our users, because anything we
say about what would be ambiguous or not is only our conjectures.

I would like to find better terms, I just can't find anything that is
more intuitive _for me_ than "On (Success)" and "Given (Version 2.5.x)".

Mikhael.

Yes.  Maybe non-intuitive is a better word than ambiguous.

Its more of an opinion than a conjecture.  :)

I have no objection to gathering more opinions (conjectures).

Hi there,

The web theme is taken from the default fvwm look without
the handles. I tried to make the web page a bit simpler and
therefore faster.  
The reason why there are two buttons is the relief in the
title. One needs left and right in title different pics.

It seems that after you set a ButtonStyle in a Decor, it is impossible to
change it with the single command AddButtonStyle. the onle way to do so is
to use AddToDecor. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just the worng logic in
the program. if, let say, I am not happy with one of the settings in a
decor I've created, I should be able to change that particular setting with
a single command without altering the decor. in other words, the command
issued later should override the setting in the decor.

ChangeMenuStyle only affects the menu if the assignment is issued after the
defenition of the meny. you have to first define a menu and them assigne a
style to it using ChangeMenuStyle. this is probably due to the way the
program works. in my mind, the program should first read the whole
configuration file (fvwm2rc, post.hook,...) and then does the assignments.

Subject: Remove swallowed app / icon limitation from FvwmButtons

Full_Name: Marc Jackisch
Version: 2.5.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.4.21-ck3
X_Server: XFree86 4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (217.82.22.86)


Somewhere in the 2.5 series, a limitation has been introduced, which
prevents a button in FvwmButtons to get an icon AND swallow an
application.

This is purely a check done while reading the config. (Namely in parse.c,
lines 928 and 1028 as of 2.5.7 sources.) Removing this check does not seem
to have any adverse effects. Thus, I guess that this limitation is just
artificial. However, sometimes this kind of configuration is necessary to
make a button "fit right in", if the application uses shaped windows.

Here's an example from my config, which only works after a little source
screwing:

*RightButtons(Icon new_button_base.xpm Swallow(UseOld) "xeyes123" \
              'Exec xeyes -bg SteelBlue2 -title xeyes123 &',\
              Action 'Exec "jpview" jpview &')

(Swallowed xeyes over icon background starting an image viewer on click.)

Note: though I have not installed it yet, the limitation is still present
in 2.5.7 from reading the source.

Please restore the previous functionality, where this was possible.

Best regards,
Marc.

PS: Obvious: remove the "_dontyouspamme" from the mail address before use
;-)

I think you misunderstood me.  There is no title and no buttons.
The title is completely blank.  See attached picture.

You are right, it *should* be possible.  The design of both, the
"Decors" and the "ButtonStyle" features is flawed and not as
flexible as it should be.  Both will be replaced by a better
mechanism in the future.

This is how it should look like ;-) I ran fvwm without a
config and got this look. I removed the title string and the
handles. 
We may put a string in the title like "Offical FVWM
Homepage" or a page specific one line "Fvwm - Links". If you
think it is to simple or plain I can make it a bit more
fancy :-) 

Cheers, Uwe

Well, you can't change the settings of something that does not
exist.  Processing configuration commands out of order is not a
good idea because fvwm does not have a real "configuration file".
All the commands in there can be issued at any time in any order,
and the order does matter.

Please explain what the problem is.  I removed this possibility
because (a) it was never intended to work and (b) it did indeed
not work.  The code never handled sizing of the button and
placement of the icon correctly.

Yes, I think it's too simple.  We should rather provide a better
default config than adapt our web page to the bare minimum to
start up :-)

I have a look if I can find some time tonight to make the
deco more fancy. Has anyone a window decoration screenshot
as suggestion for the default theme?

Hello,

Current bug: Start a session manager on display 1 "with fvwm" and save
your session. The restart commands will look like:

	fvwm -d :0.0 -s -clientId clien_id0 -restore restore_file0

(with two screens an other fvwm is restarted:

        fvwm -d :0.1 -s -clientId clien_id1 -restore restore_file1)

Then later you start X on display 1 with the session manager, fvwm
will not start at all (if there is no X running on display 0 or if a
window manager run on display 0.*) or fvwm starts on the screen(s) 0.*
(if there is an X connection on display 0 and no window manager
running on screen 0.*).  So, we get a session with no window manager
on display 1.

Solution: Add an argument to -s which gives the screen on which fvwm
should run (the display will be found either with $DISPLAY or the arg
of the -d option or with a dummy XOpenDisplay). The Restart command
will look like:

      fvwm -s screen_number -clientId clien_id -restore restore_file

and will restart fvwm on the display "good_display.screen_number".

Do I miss something? Any comments?

Regards, Olivier

If you put your ChangeMenuStyle command into StartFunction then the order
will not matter. StartFunction (and InitFunction) is designed to be
executed after the entire initial configuration is read and processed.

  AddToFunc StartFunction

Dominik already rised this problem.

Some commands have Desk and some DeskTop in their names.

I think I will just add the following aliases to 2.4.x and 2.5.x:

  DeskSize   - the same as DesktopSize
  DeskName   - the same as DesktopName

In the future we may remove the second, i.e. "Desktop", form.
Does someone think the "Desktop" names are preferable?

Regards,
Mikhael.

No.

Shouldn't this all wait for 3.0?  These issues are going to be
cleaned up anyway, so why add to the confusion now?

Bye

This is a smooth conversion service to the users, they will have enough
time to do the change. Only one (the final) version is documented.

Hi Dominik,

first of all, sorry that this does not come as a direct reply to your
message, but I have demonstrated some personal incompetence by
accedentily deleting it... :-(

However, regarding the ability to overlay a swallowed application and
an icon in FvwmButtons, you said "it was never meant to work and
indeed it did not work" as icon placement and resizing (?) won't be
correct.

The problem is, while I have never experienced any problem using this
combination in the last 2 years of using it, an I really have come to
find it one of the nicest things about FvwmButtons (design-wise, that
is... from the functionality, there's much more... :)

OK, as I would not say, that just because I have never encountered a
problem in my little part of the world, there aren't any, I'll just
have to accept that it does not work... *sigh*

Thus, the whole thing mutates to a RFE: is there a (working) way to
have a button with an icon (as background) _and_ a swallowed
application at the same time? Or even a dirty hack like changing the
error message to a warning "don't use unless you are mtj or want to
lose all data (including email) stored on this computer..." :-)

Or I'll either have to learn something about X programming and prove
it myself, or write replacements for the swallowed apps that include
background icons. (Consider this a threat, I know *nothing* about X
;-))

Bye, Marc.

PS: To all of fvwm-workers: thanks a lot! - In my book, the "f"
stands for "final", as I'll never need another WM.

I'm not sure if the patch got to the mailinglist (i've been having some
e-mail problems), but since it's been a month since i posted it and
haven't got any replies on it, i'm reposting it. If it's being reviewed,
please ignore my mail ;)

This patch adds a new 'Relief' option to FvwmButtons. The syntax is
described in the man page.

cheers,
Remko

There is a general problem with the new motion method detection
code with windows that can be moved by grabbing a handle inside
the client window.  Gkrellm and xmms are examples.  Both are
shaped and use the 'traditional' movement method.  Under fvwm,
shaped windows get a title by default, but not under many other
window managers.

Dragging these windows close to a screen edge (with the internal
handles) may trigger detecting the "ICCCM" or "traditional" method
at random, depending where you drag it.  If it detects "ICCCM",
the window is suddenly shifted by the title height, now and for
all future move operations.

Although this behaviour violates the ICCCM way, the window
managers claiming ICCCM compliance have no problem with it since
these windows usually have no decorations and thus "ICCCM" and
"traditional" way give the same results.

Any suggestions how to prevent this mis-detection?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

FVWM, CVS version, two weeks old. The IconGrid option doesn't seem to
work properly with arguments smaller than defaults (IconGrid 3 3).

Style * IconFont xft:arial-10, \
IconTitleRelief 1, \
IconBackgroundRelief 1, \
IconSize 52 48, \
IconBackgroundPadding 6, \
IconBackgroundColorset 2, \
IconBox 310x300+0+0, \
IconGrid 1 1

should (according to fvwm man page) give a nicely packed box of icons, with
no gaps (1 pixel long "steps" when searching for free room).

In reality "IconGrid 1 1" gives me 3x3 spacing. "IconGrid 2 2" gives
4x4.  Starting from "IconGrid 3 3" (fvwm default) things start to work
as expected. Is it my fault, or is something wrong with IconGrid?

I have both xft-config and pkg-config that report about Xft.

xft-config detection is fine, but when I remove this executable, then Xft
is not detected. XFT_LIBS is set, but not Xft_LIBS. FC_LIBS is empty too.
with_xft=no, so the Xft1 detection code is entered (I have 2.1.0).

I have found the problem, it is missing fi in line 1413 of acinclude.m4.
But when I add this missing fi, configure is broken (unexpected `fi').

After finding this bug, I spent 2 hours to debug where we have one more
"fi", so it closes "if" earlier then needed, but without success for now.
It is pretty messy. I don't have a lot of time to continue my debugging
in the next several days, so maybe someone else will be more lucky.
If no, I will fix this problem several days from now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, this is it. I only debugged AM_CHECK_XFT, not AM_CHECK_FC, and then
moved to debugging configure.in.

Fixed, together with several other small things.

Only in theory.  Note that the IconGrid style says nothing about
the distance between the icons, only about the allowed positions.
What you see is a hard coded minimum distance between two icons
(3 pixels).  This should be tunable too, but it isn't yet.  You
can only modify it by changing the number MIN_ICON_BOX_DIST in the
file libs/defaults.h.

After the "diving tours" into all of these combining characters and stuff,
something hit me: how is string comparison (for sorting) done in Fvwm?
Do we use strcasecmp or strcoll, if avaialble.
I did some "experiments" using ls and different locales. I also looked at
some discussion lists.

It seems to me strcasecmp is simply something like "return tolower(c1) >
tolower(c2)" whereas strcoll is more locale-aware.

But still strcoll (at least the one in glibc) doesn't handle combining
characters at all.

There is also an interering report at Unicode.org:

http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/

I'm not sure if this should be implented in Fvwm, or if contacting glibc
developers is the way to go...

I will be away for the next week approximatly, will perhaps be able to
read mail sporadically.

Yup. Changed it to 0 and it now looks/behaves properly. Thanks.

Log message:
* Respect the SmSaveGlobal save type. This may fix some session locking.
* Set some sm properties when fvwm start for fixing a problem with
the restart style hint after a restart.
* Added a possible positive or null arg to --single-screen:
* This forces fvwm to start on the "current" display and the given screen.
Use this to fix fvwm starting under a session manager: specify only the screen
and not the display.screen for the restart sm command.
* Fixed possible memory corruption if a display has more than 10 screens.
* Better debuging msg in the session code
* Fixed handling of the _NET_WINDOW_TYPE prop when there are more
that one type and we do not support the first one.
* Fixed conflict between extended variables name (desk.name and desk.n)

Hello,

Note first that this subject has been already discussed in the pass

running under a session manager):

No solution was found and this bug was "postponned".

In fact there is a solution. From the XSMP spec:

  "Some clients may wish to manage  the  programs  they  start.
  For  example,  a  mail program could start a text editor for
  editing the text of a mail message.  A client that does this
  is a session manager itself; it should supply the clients it
  starts with the appropriate  connection  information  (i.e.,
  the  SESSION_MANAGER  environment variable) that specifies a
  connection to itself instead of to  the  top  level  session
  manager." [end of section 3]

So, the solution is to make FvwmButtons (and FvwmScript which may
swallow some applications too) a "simple session manager".

I've writing down in libs/ a "fsm" library which allows FvwmButtons
to be a simple _dummy_ session manager. When a XSMP award application
is started by FvwmButtons it contact FvwmButtons and not the top level
session manager and so this application is not restarted by the
session manager (we may even improve window swallowing by using sm,
but this is for the future).

Unfortunately, there is two problems (with solutions I hope).
Any advice/comments is welcome.

- As a session manager FvwmButtons should start applications with its
own SESSION_MANGER env variable (network address). As it is fvwm which
execute the swallow action a workaround should be found. What I do:
FvwmButtons defines a function:
 
DestroyFunc xxxFvwmButtonsExecuteSwallowActionXYZ
AddToFunc   xxxFvwmButtonsExecuteSwallowActionXYZ
+ I SetEnv SESSION_MANAGER FvwmButtons_SESSION_MANAGER
+ I $.
+ I SetEnv SESSION_MANAGER SESSION_MANAGER_orig

where SESSION_MANAGER_orig is the value of "$SESSION_MANAGER" for
fvwm (FvwmButtons has it because it is the value of "$SESSION_MANAGER"
at FvwmButtons startup before its become a session manager).
Then, a swallow button action is executed by sending to fvwm:

xxxFvwmButtonsExecuteFunctionxxx action

Can this cause problem? Should we have only one such function in
the default fvwm config (for Buttons, Script and any module which
can swallow window)?
 
- smproxy and gnome-smproxy (a modified version of smproxy) break the
XSMP protocol: they always contact the session manager which start it
(most often the top level session manager).  When a top level window
is mapped the a proxies should compute the value of the
SESSION_MANAGER ev on the application which maps the window and should
either ignore this window if this value is not equal to the proxy
SESSION_MANAGER ev (a one sm proxy only) or should contact the session
manager identified by "$SESSION_MANAGER".  smproxy and gnome-smproxy
do not do that and this is *not* impossible to do.

So with the current version of smproxy and gnome-smproxy applications
which use the old session management protocol (e.g., xload but not
xclock) are started by the session manager and FvwmButtons.

One obvious solution is to do not run a sm proxy ... however I will try
to convince XFree and GNOME developers to fix their sm proxies (yes
I know I am optimist ...):

  A session manager (master or not) can set on a leader window
  (which use the old session manager protocol) a property
  SESSION_MANAGER(STRING) to the value of its network address
  (i.e., the value of "its" SESSION_MANAGER environment variable).
  A sm proxy should use this property to contact the correct session
  manager or to ignore this window if it works for only one sm
  (e.g., the master one) and the value of this property is not the
  network address of its session manager.
  The proxy should monitor the SESSION_MANAGER property and update
  its connection(s) accordingly (typically a window will map without
  the SESSION_MANAGER property set, if SM_CLIENT_ID is not set a
  concerned sm can then set the SESSION_MANAGER property).
  [We can do a more safe stuff: add a SESSION_MANGER_CHECK_WINDOW(Window)
  property that should be also set by the sm on the top level window
  and gives the id of a window which belong to the sm and have the
  property SESSION_MANGER_CHECK(STRING) set to the value of the
  SESSION_MANAGER property. This can be used by a sm to answer the
  question: does an other alive sm already set the SESSION_MANAGER
  property?]
   
I've already patched smproxy (and it will be easy to patch gnome-session)
and FvwmButtons and this solve the problem.

I have some troubles with WindowStyle/fvwm functions.

This sample code:

	DestroyFunc FSMax
	AddToFunc FSMax
	+ I WindowStyle !Borders, !Title
	+ I Maximize true

should, according to my knowledge of fvwm:
a. remove the title and borders from a window
b. and then maximize it

but strangely, it seems to:
a. maximize the window first
b. and then remove the decorations

could someone verify this?

The man page is your friend :-)  It's documented behaviour.
Window styles are only applied when fvwm has nothing else to do
(for performance reasons).  To apply them immediately inside a
function use the RefreshStyle command.

P.S.:  Please keep in mind that the first thing I'll do if 2.6 is
ever released is to remove the WindowStyle command.

Well, I stand corrected. Again.

Really? Then I'll need to prepare a patch and add it "at home".
WindowStyle adds an incredible amount of new functionality to fvwm
- it's just what the doctor ordered.

It is called UpdateStyles (RefreshWindow is ok too). Should be executed
after Style, FocusStyle, WindowStyle, TitleStyle, Colorset if needed.

I don't think the global function is the way to go. We have commands for
this. So you mat add a command "RunWithSM <sm-value> <fvwm-command>" or
a more generic:

  RunEnv [var=value ...] <fvwm-command>

that works like /usr/bin/env; sets variables, runs the supplied command
as is (without expansion) and restores modified variables.

Mikhael.

Okay, it's named UpdateStyle.  As I said, the man page is your

All I said was that you should keep that in mind.  In 3.0, I want
to clean up all the misdesigned features.

Maybe UpdateStyles and UpdateDecor should be renamed to RefreshStyles
and RefreshDecor? It would look better next to Refresh and
RefreshWindow.

And I'll keep that in mind - I'll have to create a diff to get
WindowStyle back :) BTW, why won't you accept WindowStyle as
a "temporary solution"?  According to "todo-3.0" the whole Style system
will get rewritten anyhow. And even if WindowStyle is "misdesigned"

As an end-user (not fvwm-hacker, so I'm not "tainted") I can say that
the biggest "misdesign" in current FVWM code is the scripting engine. It
has this "I'm a never ending hack" look&feel. A true overflowing
bucket'o'patches.  Employing a true scripting language (python maybe?)
would make fvwm much easier to understand and script. It would also be
a great opportunity to reduce the number of commands and clean it up.

FVWM is now very complex, there are tons of different commands but the
scripting interface is incredibly primitive. If only fvwm would resemble
Sawfish in this aspect...  the level of "power" is about the same in
FVWM and in Sawfish, but scripting Sawfish is much easier, even if their
chosen language is a lisp variation (not the best choice for a WM, but
still better than fvwm scripts).

Yeah, I know it would be a hell of a job to repair it now. But it would
improve fvwm's usability by a tremendous ammount, and if you really
intend to remove/fix fvwm's biggest flaws - well, that's my Misdesign#1
(it wasn't so bad ever since - it's just that fvwm grew bigger,
and bigger, and more complex... and the scripting "base" got "out of
sync")

Sure, you must know it.  I guess you have spent weeks studying it.
Apart from its lousy speed and some problems with quoting, the
scripting engine isn't *that* bad.

Actually, it would make it much harder to script for the
non-(insert scripting language of your choice)-junkie.

Funny, a couple of lines further up you complain about exactly
this:  that I want to remove superfluous commands like
WindowStyle.

I disagree.  Lisp allows only hardcore programmers to do anything.

That's the point. I don't study it - I just came, compiled it and
started to use it.

I wanted a "QuakeTerm" once (a xterm window sliding from top of the
screen and hiding) - a toggle function actually, very simple, move the
window from desk 666 to current, bring it to the front and unshade. Then
shade it and move it back to 666. In the end I needed to split the code
into 3 functions just to keep it sane with all those Cond and CondCases.

Quoting is very bad, those ugly hacks with PipeRead just to get
something expanded right. But the real problems are (IMO) the way to many
commands, functions which can't really return useful results, no
internal data structures (only env. vars).

You say it's not bad because you have been sitting in its code for such
a long time you've got the Blessings of Immunity :)

And right now it's hard to script for _everyone_ but fvwm-junkies. It's
unlike any other language. Choosing a widely-used scripting language
makes it _easier_ for some people, but not harder for anybody else. Do
you think that if fvwm would use perl natively I would have bigger
trouble learning it (I'm no perl junkie, so according to your words
switching to Perl would mean trouble for me)?

I mentioned Python because it has a reputation for an "easy to learn
language" with clear and well-thought syntax. If you don't know it, you
have to learn it. If its fvwm or python, doesn't matter. With Python (or
perl, or scheme, or lisp, or ruby) there is simply the possibility that
some users will already know it and that there will be good books on the
topic.

>> It would also be a great opportunity to reduce the number of commands

>=20

What I was thinking about: if fvwm had true programming abilities, you
know, loops, data structures, conditional blocks etc. you could
represent windows, keybindings and the likes as ordered structures of
properties (or groups of variables, if you like). A window could be
represented by an object with a set of keys (properties). You could
alter these properties by assigning values to them. Like change the name
of a decor assigned to a window by changing a "decor" property.  Or
check if a window is maximized by checking the value of the "maximized"
key.

Keybindings could be represented as a table, with pairs of
key-context-function. This table could be searched or altered just as
you do it with variables - by using simple assignements.  Styles could
be represented by a list similar to the "managed window list", with the
twist that windows in the "styles" list would serve as masks altering
the properties of matching windows. It's hard for me to explain, I'm no
programmer. But maybe you understand what I mean.

The simplicity lies in the reduced amount of commands. You no longer
need the Style command - you just change a group of objects, defining
their properties. You don't need the WindowStyle command - you operate
directly on the list of managed windows. Arrange the internals in a neat
and clean way, show them through an API to the user and that's all.
Instead of a "All" or "Any" command the user could loop over the list of
managed windows and test some keys. Deleting styles would be possible.
A couple of lines of code and you could remove all defined bindings for
the "R" context. Silly examples, but they show how flexible it is.

And adding new features means mostly "adding new properties" to objects.
Once you've done it, there's no more work. For instance now in fvwm you
can test only certain conditions, those that were predestined by the
coders. For instance it is impossible to select all windows of the same
decor or all of a certain size. Because no-one thought that it could be
usefull and added a link between such properties and arguments to
Current/All/Any.  Now fvwm is doing the "a function for every occasion"
thing. That's nice, but for simple programs and spawns problems as the
whole code gets overly complex and hard to understand in its
interdependencies.

If, however, you would choose to simply show all the props of objects to
the user, those functions could be implemented as scripting functions
- easy to redefine or customize. Adding a new property to a window
wouldn't require changing anything else - for instance the ability to
have titles at left implies the existence of a property
"title-placement".  And if it exists it could get values assigned or
tested in conditionals.  So you don't need to add new Style options
"TitleAtLeft, ..." or new Conditions to reflect the changes.

That's what I was really thinking about. Anybody that ever Sawfish-ed
will know what I mean. I'm just trying to show an approach that could
really simplify things in fvwm. Of course it comes with high initial
costs - dumping the current model and quite an amount of code, backwards
compatibility gets lost, but it's more, how do you say it, "ready for
what the future brings". Sorry for making it that long and boring.

I was able write some simple extensions to Sawfish on my own (random
background changer, desk title popup after desktop switch, center window
on screen, functions like FvwmBacker, popup-clock-and-date etc.) but
I don't consider myself a hardcore programmer. Sawfish comes with good
Info documentation, even regarding the basics of sawfish-lisp (no wonder
since it's a dialect), so I quickly knew how to write simple loops,
conditional blocks or manipulate lists. :) There are things in fvwm that
are IMO way more difficult to understand than the basics of Lisp, like
the ItemFormat option of MenuStyle.

Feel free to use any language you want.

FvwmCPP
FvwmM4
FvwmPerl
PipeRead
FvwmCommand

Except when playing pysol, I don't have the python interpreter in
memory.  I wouldn't be happy with a window manager that pulled
an interpreter into memory.
