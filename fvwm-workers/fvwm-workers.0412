fvwm.1.in is not checked in.  Did you really change it?

For FvwmIconMan, I adjusted the first  paragraph, but got stuck on the
second:

.IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id] MaxButtonWidth \fIwidth\fP"
Defines a maximum for the width of a button (in pixels). By default there
is no maximum. A value of 0 resets the default. The maximum is only used
with a non growing manager (the ManagerGeometry option
specifies non zero width and height).

.IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id] MaxButtonWidthByColumns \fIcol\fP"
This is equivalent to MaxButtonWidth ManWidth/col where ManWidth is
the width of the Manager. 


What is "ManWidth"?

Should this be "MaxWidthInColumns", or just "MaxColumns"?

Yes, but I probably forget to save the file before the commit
I will commit again soon.

ManWidth is the width of the full FvwmIconMan. For example if the
width of the FvwmIconMan manager is 1024, "MaxButtonWidthByColumns 4"
is equivalent to "MaxButtonWidth 256". This is useful when you do not
know, at config time, the width of the manager (e.g., for swallowed
IconMan). In a certain sense you will never have less than 4 columns.
So maybe, MinColumns is good. I used MaxButtonWidthByColumns to say
that the MaxButtonWidth is expressed in terms of columns (or computed
from a number of columns. I like the idea to use something like
MaxButtonWidth_something_good to express the fact that this option
is just an other way to set the MaxButtonWidth option.

I will follow any suggestion.

Thanks Dan, Olivier

I think, "MinColumns" name is more intuitive. You should probably mention
that setting "MinColumns" disables "MaxButtonWidth" (or vice versa), so
it would be clear that they describe more or less the same thing.

I think Uwe may take a look at this error.

Thanks for the hint.

It seems to me that this was caused by different php
versions. On fvwm.sourceforge.net php 4.3.9 is installed
while fvwm.org and my servers use version 4.3.8. Maybe
this broke the construct which avoided double loading of
the definition file.

I use now the new php4 construct include_once in all files
to avoid double loading of the definiton file. This should
work on all php4 or higher versions.

Regards, Uwe

I think I have it now.  Please check and see.

In another part of the same man page, I don't follow
part of the TipsJustification description.  The part
between the lang_check markers (which I did modify a little):

.IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsJustification \fIvalue\fP"
where \fIvalue\fP can be leftup, rightdown or center.
Specifies
the justification (direction) of the tips window relative to its button after
the tips window has been placed.
\."#needs_lang_check
Default is leftup which means that if a tip is placed above or below
(respectively, on the left or on the right of)
its button, 
then the left
(respectively, the top)
border of the tip 
and of the button are aligned.
\."#end_needs_lang_check
The alignment is adjusted by the TipsOffset option.
See next option.


The way you use "respectively" is very hard to read
in english.
Just describe leftup then
start a new sentence and say
rightdown and center work like leftup but in different directions.

I tried to read it ignoring the repectively stuff and
still couldn't follow it.
If you just expand on it or give an example like you
did above that would help.

Hello, I have another FAQ suggestion based on a question I've seen quite
frequently on irc and email, etc. feel free to modify/correct/rewrite :)

Q. When I Maximize an application, sometimes I get gaps around the
edges, and other times I don't. What's going on?

A. The ICCCM specification allows applications to specify certain
properties the window manager should honour, such as aspect ratio 
(PAspect) or increments to be resized in (PResizeInc). Of course,
sometimes these properties won't perfectly match the size of your
desktop (or ewmh struts), if that should happen, you will get gaps.

In general, the application will have a good reason for doing this (for
example, a terminal window may not want to have only part of a column
visible), but you can make fvwm ignore the hints with ResizeHintOverride.


(The docs suggest only Max/Min size is ignored with ResizeHintOverride,
but that doesnt seem to be true...not that I'm complaining, I like this
feature! (well, i'd prefer it didnt clobber P/USPosition, but I can live
with that!))

Subject: Left Mouse double click root later hangs

Full_Name: Bill Vrotney
Version: fvwm-2.4.19
CVS_Date: 
OS: Fedora Core 3
X_Server: Xorg
Submission from: (NULL) (165.247.208.116)


I encountered this bug in fvwm-2.4.0 so I just downloaded fvwm-2.4.19 and
the bug is still there.  What I do is the following


    In ~/.fvwm/bindings

       Mouse 1          R       N       RootMenu-or-WindowList

    In ~/.fvwm/functions

        DestroyFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
        AddToFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
        + I Menu Root-Menu mouse -1p -1p
        + D WindowList mouse -1p -1p NoGeometry

It works as expected, ie. when I left click in the root layer fvwm pops up
the root menu and when I left double click in the root layer fvwm pops up
the window list.  BUT, with this setting when an application is launched
fvwm hangs until the mouse is moved.

If you can suggest a work around please let me know.

Thanks.

Yes, you're right.  I'll add it as 5.16.

Both those functions "menu" and "windowlist" are meant to grab the
xserver and cause the "hang" that you observed.

There has been some experimental code developed for "tear off menus" which
would be a prerequiste for solving this problem with menus.

You might try the Module FvwmWindowList instead of using the built in
windowlist.  The FvwmGtk might serve as a substitute for the menu.

I've closed your problem report as "not a problem". Send mail to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org if you feel this is still a problem.

This function works fine if bound to almost anything (like a button):

    Single click RootMenu, double click WindowList
    DestroyFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
    AddToFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
    + I Menu Root-Menu mouse -1p -1p
    + D WindowList mouse -1p -1p NoGeometry

If bound to mouse 1 on the root plane

    Mouse 1		R   	N       Menu Root-Menu mouse -1p -1p

it also works fine but, after executing it successfully, fvwm hangs until
the mouse is moved.

Is this a bug? Is there another way of achieving this?  It seems like a bug
because it seems to imply that one can not have a flawless binding to a
single and double click on the root plane.

It looks like earthlink put my reply in your "suspect email" folder.

Here is one more attempt to reach you and my original reply:

Both those functions "menu" and "windowlist" are meant to grab the
xserver and cause the "hang" that you observed.

There has been some experimental code developed for "tear off menus" which
would be a prerequiste for solving this problem with menus.

You might try the Module FvwmWindowList instead of using the built in
windowlist.  The FvwmGtk might serve as a substitute for the menu.

I've closed your problem report as "not a problem". Send mail to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org if you feel this is still a problem.

I got your first reply.  Thanks.  If I don't get to look at my suspect email
soon enought to put a previously unknown sender in my address book the well
meaning sender gets the alert that you got.  Sorry about that.

But shouldn't the code waiting (or hanging) on a user's menu choice release
the wait when a menu choice has been chosen?  Maybe my use of the term
"hang" along with lack of some more information was misleading.

I took your advice and posted a slightly revised and hopefully more accurate
explanation to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org that (see below) where I say

    > > the mouse is moved.  For example if you launch an application using
    > > this it will not come up until the mouse is moved.

In other words, fvwm does the right thing according to the
RootMenu-or-WindowList function and displays the root menu or windows list
depending on whether the user single clicks or double clicks.  But when this
RootMenu-or-WindowList is asserted for "mouse 1" and then the user launches
an application from the root menu, *then* the application does not come up
until the mouse is moved.  If however, the RootMenu-or-WindowList function
is asserted for a title bar button this works fine.  And therefore this
seems like an inconsistency in the way that fvwm works,
ie. RootMenu-or-WindowList works fine at one place but not at another.

The below patch to version 2.5.12 fixes a problem I found while building
FVWM.

In the "configure" script, The assignment to variable "png_LIBS" that I
have removed was overwriting a previously computed value for that
variable that was derived from the --with-png-library option.  So unless
the assignment below is removed, the --with-png-library option is
ignored.

I suspect that the file "configure.in" also needs to be changed, but I
don't know enough about autoconf syntax to do that.

I hope this helps.

My previous patch to 2.5.12 to make configure not ignore
--with-png-library accidentally removed a "-lz" option that is needed
when linking fvwm.  The below (improved) patch solves this problem and
should be used in place of the one I submitted previously.

Again, I suspect that "configure.in" must also be patched, but I lack
sufficient knowledge of autoconf syntax to do that.

Sorry for the confusion.

The problem is still in the sources. Could anybody please

I discovered a workaround to the below bug that I posted Dec 12.  The only
caveat is that there is a slight delay to the single click.

     # Single click RootMenu, double click WindowList
     DestroyFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
     AddToFunc RootMenu-or-WindowList
     + C Menu Root-Menu mouse -1p -1p
     + D WindowList mouse -1p -1p NoGeometry

By replacing the "I" immediate action modifier with the "C" click modifier
the bug goes away.  This might also give a clue as to the nature of the bug.

Hi,

I use fvwm-menu-directory for a couple different directories (one for 
playing music, the other for setting backgrounds.)  Recently I organized 
my backgrounds in to alphabetical subdirectories which is when I began 
to have problems.

I have two functions that use fvwm-menu-directory, as follows:

#####
# FvwmXmmsMenuDirectory
###########
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ I PipeRead '/home/mdeluco/root/bin/fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" \
        --links --command-file="Exec exec xmms \\"%f\\"" \
        --command-title="Exec exec xmms \\"%d\\""'

#####
# FvwmBackgroundSet
###########
DestroyFunc FvwmBackgroundSet
AddToFunc   FvwmBackgroundSet
+ I PipeRead '/home/mdeluco/root/bin/fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" --links \
        --fvwm-function="FvwmBackgroundSet" \
        --command-file="Exec exec Esetroot -s \\"%f\\""'


It took me a while to figure out that fvwm-menu-directory only uses 
"FuncFvwmMenuDirectory" as the fvwm function for all generated 
submenus.  I had a look at the command's output in the shell then dug 
through the perl script to figure this out.

So what I did was add another command line option to 
fvwm-menu-directory.  You can actually see it in the above functions 
"--fvwm-function".  It defaults to FuncFvwmMenuDirectory unless $reuse 
is set.

Here are the changes I made:

At the top of the script at the end of the variable declaratoins, I added

        my $fvwmFunction = "";

At the end of the GetOptions, I added

        "fvwm-function=s" => \$fvwmFunction,

And here is where the old MissingSubmenuFunction was printed out,

        # set the 'missing submenu function'
        #print qq(+ MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory\n) 
unless $reuse;
        if ($fvwmFunction ne "") {
            print qq(+ MissingSubMenuFunction $fvwmFunction\n);
        } else {
            print qq(+ MissingSubMenuFunction FuncFvwmmenuDirectory\n)
                unless $reuse;
        }

It didn't look to me as though there was any other way around this.  The 
change seemed easy enough anyhow :)  I suppose I could have setup a 
shell script, but I like this better ;)

What does everyone think, and did I miss anything?

Thanks!

     -- Matt.

Accourding to NEWS file, fvwm-menu-directory --func-name option
was added in 2.5.11. I may backport it to 2.4.x if you want.

At http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/faq/#0.3 at question 1.7 the config
file appears to be 'fvwm/config'.  It should be '.fvwm/config'.  The man
page is correct.

Cheers!

Well, the full wording would be "~/.fvwm/config or $datadir/fvwm/config
together with previous ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc and several other locations". The
short term "fvwm/config" is used in some FAQ places to imply this list.

I will expand the wording in #1.7.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello all,

I recently started using FvwmScript as part of my setup. One of the 
functions performed by the script is displaying CPU load, memory usage and 
swap utilization. The output is displayed using small VDipSticks on my 
"panel". Since these VDipSticks are rather small (11x56), having them sunk 
and raised by 2 pixels results in a rather cluttered look (8 of 11 pixels 
by width are taken up by "relief").

I created a patch to address this issue. The patch adds a new option for 
VDipSticks and HDipSticks called ReliefDepth. This option allows setting 
a number of pixels to raise/sink the dipstick by. The default value is 2, 
so omitting the option would result in "normal" behavior and existing 
scripts would not be affected.

The patch is fairly large due to the changes in files generated by 
lex/yacc, the actual changes are fairly small. The patch file is located 
here: http://crion.no-ip.org/fvwmscript-nrdip2.patch

Hello,

I am running fvwm2 2.4.19 on Fedora Core 2. I am experiencing several
freezes
under fvwm2 when I undock/dock the toolbar from glade or dock/undock a
window
from JDeveloper. This forces me to have to log out of fvwm2 with
ctrl-alt-del.
This is the only time I experience fvwm2 freezes.

Regards,

Neil
