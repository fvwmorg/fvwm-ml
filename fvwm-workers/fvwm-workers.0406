I found this in the code:

  
  /* the spec says that if d = 0xFFFFFFFF then we have to Stick
   * the window however KDE use 0xFFFFFFFE :o) */
  if (d == 0xFFFFFFFE || d == 0xFFFFFFFF)

So, fvwm actually accepts both.  However, it only ever *sets*
0xFFFFFFFE itself.  I have fixed this.

Ciao

Subject: Mouse Move stopped working

Full_Name: Yedidyah Bar-David
Version: 2.5.7
CVS_Date: 
OS: Debian sid
X_Server: XFree86 4.3
Submission from: (NULL) (132.66.16.34)


I have the following line in my .fvwm2rc:
Mouse 2         A       CS      Move
(Also other such things, for other combinations and actions, behave the
same).
It should move a window when pressing Ctrl-Shift-Button2 anywhere on it.
It works well with 2.4.18, 2.5.[56] (probably earlier too), and stopped
working in 2.5.7 (checked 2.5.{7,8,9,10}). Stopped working means:
In those working, I press Ctrl-Shift-Button2, move the mouse, the window
moves, then I release the mouse, and things go back to normal.
In those not working, I press Ctrl-Shift-Button2, move the mouse, nothing
happens. When I release Button2, moving the mouse moves the window, until
I press and release Button1 (or other things, e.g. Return, Space).
I guess the bug is in the file fvwm/binding.c, but the change between
2.5.6
and 2.5.7 is too big for me to understand without speding a lot of time.
I might be wrong, of course. From skimming the diff, it seems reasonable.
I will probably try to debug it myself eventually, but will appreciate it
if someone (maybe the one that did it, around a year ago) already knows
how
to fix this.
Thanks,

Once you add the possibility of "AND" as well as "OR", you get into the
realm of boolean expressions, which require a parser.  For instance, if
someone can write the above, he'd naturally expect to be able to write

	Netscape local* |konqueror |Mozilla*

which presumably would be parsed with the normal boolean precedence, as

	(Netscape AND local*) OR konqueror OR Mozilla*

That sort of parser would be about thirty times as much work for me; and
I figured "OR" was far more useful than "AND" -- it was certainly the
only thing I wanted for my own use.


>This also works well with "not" commands:
>All (Netscape |konqueror |Mozilla* !Opera) ...

>(which is subtly different to the patch syntax's implied "OR NOT")

Actually NOTs are all "AND NOT", in the patch; just leave off the '|'s,
and that line'll work fine.  (Yeah, the logic for mixing wanted
window-names with unwanted window-names is a bit confusing; my first
version of the patch, which was implemented differently, simply refused
to accept such mixtures.)  Perhaps a better way of describing it would be
to say that NOTs take priority: if any name with '!' in front of it
matches, then the condition fails, no matter what else matches or doesn't
match.

>I guess one could implement an "OR NOT" rule, but i strongly doubt the 
>usefulness of it.

Yeah, I too figured "AND NOT" was much more useful than "OR NOT".

The way I've used this patch is to program a bunch of hotkeys for
specific windows or classes of windows, and then add one final hotkey for
"all other windows":

Key F1          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage xterm1) goto-window            
Key F2          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage xterm2) goto-window
Key F3          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage xterm3) goto-window
Key F4          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage emacs) goto-window
Key F5          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage Netscape konqueror Mozilla \   
                                                mozilla-bin) goto-window    
Key F6          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage xdvi xpdf Xpdf gv acroread) \
                                                goto-window
Key F7          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage xv ee Gimp) goto-window
Key F8          A  N    Next (CurrentGlobalPage !xterm1 !xterm2 !xterm3 \
                                          !emacs !Netscape !konqueror \
                                          !xdvi !xpdf !gv !acroread !xv !ee \
                                          !Gimp !Mozilla !mozilla-bin) \
                                                goto-window

Uh, there you're reversing the normal rule of boolean precedence, which
gives AND a higher precedence than OR.  With the normal rule, that'd be
parsed as

	Netscape OR (konqueror AND http*) OR
			(file* AND NOT http://www.google*)

whereas you want

	(Netscape OR konqueror) AND (http* OR file*) AND NOT http://www.google*

This sort of thing is why I think the only sensible next step would be a
full-blown boolean-expression parser, which would accept parentheses as
well as AND, OR, and NOT operators, and store the boolean expression as a
tree structure.  (No, I'm too lazy to write such a thing; I don't have
any use for it.)

Hi Mikhael, :)

Find attached a patch that includes the WindowList tracker &
updated FvwmWindowMenu module which actually utilises the new
tracker.

Comments most welcome.

SCoTT. :)

Please do what the error says, create a symlink to the source tarball.
This is intentional, not to depend on hardcoded places different
rpm based distributions expect source tarball to be in.

Or better yet follow alternative instructions in
http://fvwm.org//documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think we should give CVS write access to Scott.  Anybody to
second that opinion?

(To Scott:  I know I promised to look more closely at the window
specific key bindings patch, but I just don't find the time to do
it since I became a freelancer.  I think the functionality is
fine.  The only concern I have was something about the interface.
If you'd write an example binding line I will remember immediately
what it was.)

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hrm.  I suggested it two days before, but that mail did not make
it to the list.  Then I thought I saw Mikhael's message for a
second before accidentally deleting it.  However, his message
never made it to the mailing list archives.  Strange :-/

Ciao

Subject: StartsOnPage + SkipMapping failure

Full_Name: Paul Vojta
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.6
X_Server: Solaris 9
Submission from: (NULL) (169.229.58.215)


I have the line:

    Style "Mozilla" StartsOnPage 0 1, SkipMapping

in my .fvwm2rc file.  If I start Mozilla while page 0 0 is showing, then
Mozilla pops up on page 0 2 instead of page 0 1.  If I move to page 0 1
before starting up Mozilla, then it starts up correctly.  Upon further
experimentation, I find that if I say "StartsOnPage a b, SkipMapping",
and page c d is currently showing, then Mozilla starts up on page
2a-c 2b-d (in other words, it starts on page c+2(a-c), d+2(b-d)).
The bug also occurs in the snap-20040602 cvs version of fvwm.

If you build from cvs, you have to run the autotools first:

  $ aclocal && autoheader && automake -a && autoreconf
  $ ./configure options
  $ make

The precise procedure is described in docs/DEVELOPERS.

This is a very strange story. I wrote this message on 28-May.

I am very interested to know why it is not in the archives and why the
31-May date. I have a suspicion of losing some incoming and outcoming
messages (not related to this mailing list), and any light would help.

Returning to the topic, Scott, please read dev_cvs.php and follow the
encrypted password instructions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Dominik,

: I think we should give CVS write access to Scott.  Anybody to
: second that opinion?

Can I vote? :)

: (To Scott:  I know I promised to look more closely at the window
: specific key bindings patch, but I just don't find the time to do
: it since I became a freelancer.  I think the functionality is
: fine.  The only concern I have was something about the interface.
: If you'd write an example binding line I will remember immediately
: what it was.)

Sure. Here's an extract from an earlier post:

===

Syntax is:

Key Tab (FvwmTabs)A C Function NextTab

Now, Ctrl-Tab in an FvwmTabs window invokes the NextTab function whereas
in any other window the key event is passed through to the window with
the focus.

Other examples:

Key V (rxvt)A C Echo ctrl-V-in-RXVT
Key V (xterm)A C Echo ctrl-V-in-XTerm
Key V A C Echo ctrl-V-elsewhere

The only difference is an optional regex-pattern field denoting the
window class/resource/name (appearing in ()-brackets at the _START_
of the context field) that the binding applies to.

===

It seems I neglected to mention that it works with Mouse bindings
as well.

SCoTT. :)

Ah, yes.  Could we make that

instead?

Thanks a lot! It does work.
I suggest to try and write a script for 2.4 users to help them move.
Those who only want to have the old config working will simply run it,
those that want to know what changed might find it easier to diff their
file and the output than looking through the changelog. I am not sure
how much work this is - maybe I am writing nonsense, but at least for
this thing I saw in the link you wrote that it was already written.
Anyway, thanks for a quick and helpful answer.

Actually the function is (or better should be)
executed/called when the pan frame gets an enter event. For
some reason this event is produced several times if a
complex function is bound to an edge. For example:

   EdgeCommand N Echo EdgeCommandNorth

works as expected while

   AddToFunc EchoFunc I Echo EdgeCommandNorthFunc
   EdgeCommand N EchoFunc

shows the behaviour you describe. This is actually a bug. I
hope we get this fixed soon.

Cheers, Uwe

Any hints where to look at? I use debian sarge which comes with 
"automake (GNU automake) 1.4-p6". It sayed before that it misses 
./ABOUT-NLS as well so I copied it from
/usr/share/gettext/ABOUT-NLS hoping that the other errors 
disappear as well. But they remained :-(.

Cheers, Uwe

Submission from: (NULL) (213.112.162.173)


FvwmWinList leaves a one pixel thick line between the buttons where nothing
is redrawn. This has occured with many different versions of FVWM with my
config saying:

*FvwmWinList: Geometry +0-0
*FvwmWinList: ButtonFrameWidth 0
*FvwmWinList: DontDepressFocus
*FvwmWinList: MaxWidth 250
*FvwmWinList: MinWidth 250
*FvwmWinList: useskiplist

I gladly answer questions and reproduce the error.

Note: this thread moved to fvwm-workers list.

:   - Key binding in the Root context won't work, for example
:     Key F1      R    M    Exec exec rxvt
:     it won't start rxvt but pop up the default menu instead.
:   - StrokeFunc in the Root crashes X, for example:
:     Mouse 1     R    N    StrokeFunc DrawMotion FeedBack StrokeWidth 2
:     now when you click the Root, you'll exit X and there is no error msg.

I've not used Stroke, but I changed the mouse binding to:

Mouse 1 R N Echo myMouse1BindingInvoked

for testing.

In both instances I found the bindings to be ignored. This was because
FVWM defines default bindings for the F1 key & left mouse button. They are:

Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
Mouse 1 R A Menu MenuFvwmRoot

If I do a:

Key F1 R A -
Mouse 1 R A -

Both bindings are successfully invoked when expected.

So the question is: what's changed?

The binding list used to use the _earliest_ matching binding. The
current implementation uses the _latest_ matching binding. It would be
trivial to make it utilise the _earliest_ binding, however I am undecided
if this is really the behaviour we want.

The current & previous implementation match on (in this example)
F1 bindings with 'A' (any) modifier or 'M' (meta) modifier.

ie. they match on _both_ bindings, its just which one appears first/last
(depending on implementation) in the internal binding list that gets invoked.

Should I extend the binding-comparison code to discrimiate on the
modifiers further? (Dominik, I hope you're reading this? :)

ie. choose 'M' modifier bindings (if they exist) before 'A' modifier
bindings if the 'M' modifier is actually pressed.

I should have renamed this thread "degrees of matchingness"! :)

SCoTT. :)

Damn. Got that the wrong way 'round.

The binding list used to use the _latest_ matching binding. It currently
uses _earliest_ matching binding.

I'm sure you knew what I meant anyway.

   I would argue that while it's harder to do, it should prefer
most specific, rather than either earliest or latest.  ie, if
something requests M, and something else A, then it should
respond to M, and only A when there isn't a specific binding
for the modifiers in use.

   Should "M" match when Ctrl-Meta is down?  Does that work
currently?  Or will that match only Meta?  This complicates
the above, but it can be done either way...

In fvwm, the last command always wins, be it a binding or a style.

Hi Liu,

: Stroke behave strangely, the latest stroke sequence overrides
: all previous stroke sequences.

Ok, fixed.

Please email future bug reports to the fvwm-workers list, not the
fvwm list. Most subscribers to the fvwm list aren't interested in
bug reports.

Thanks for testing. :)

SCoTT. :)

Hi all,

I define the following key binding:
Mouse (Totem) 1 W A MaximizeFullScreen2

AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
 + I ThisWindow (Maximized) WindowStyle Title, Borders
 + I TestRc (NoMatch) WindowStyle NoTitle, !Borders
 + I TestRc (NoMatch) Raise
 + I TestRc (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
 + I Maximize ewmhiwa
AddToFunc MaximizeFullScreen2 D MaximizeFullScreen

Then, Double-Click Mouse1 will maximmize totem.
But all other key bindings (using mouse1) set by totem
are disabled. I can't even use mouse1 to pull down menu.

I suspect this a bug.

Regards,
Liu Shidai

No, it's no bug.  You told fvwm to handle any button 1 click with
the MaximizeFullScreen2 function, and so it does.  A click that is
eaten by a function is never passed to the application, not even
if the function does nothing with the click.

What you are trying to achive isn't possible with fvwm.  Think
about it:  once fvwm knows whether you made a single or double
click it's already too late to pass the click to the application.

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi,

I'm using fvwm from CVS, on RHEL 3, and since a week or so it crashes when 
I use it to quit fvwm, like this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmForm-Quit: *

*FvwmForm-Quit: TimeoutFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmForm-Quit: Line       center
*FvwmForm-Quit: Text       "Do you really want to exit FVWM?"
*FvwmForm-Quit: Line       expand
*FvwmForm-Quit: Button     quit "Logout" ^M 
*FvwmForm-Quit: Command    Quit
*FvwmForm-Quit: Button     quit "Cancel"
*FvwmForm-Quit: Command    Nop
*FvwmForm-Quit: Timeout    20 Quit "Automatic logout will occur in %% seconds."

the core gives:

Subject: xft and fedora linux

Full_Name: Don Duttweiler
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux Fedora Core 2
X_Server: xorg
Submission from: (NULL) (68.7.63.215)


Antialiased fonts do not seem to work when using the recent Fedora Core 2
linux distribution.  Under the earlier RedHat 9.0 they were working fine
for me.  This is true whether using freshly compiled (under the new OS)
executables or the executables that were used under RedHat 9.0.  The
configuration file (fvwm2rc) is unchanged.  I've played around with
various compile options but changed nothing in so doing. 

No error messages appear, but the font used is clearly not an anti-aliased
one.  What is particularly puzzling is that even the application xterm
does not properly pick up the anti-aliased fonts when I run fvwm as the
window manager.  Under gnome it does.  I don't understand how the window
manager could be even involved here.  With fvwm 2.5.10 and RedHat 9.0,
xterm picked up the antialiased fonts just fine.

Hi Marcus,

for me, ir crashes 'sometimes' when I hit the 'Logout' button.

I've never seen (up to now) a crash when letting it time out.

Maybe a problem with the module exiting while updating the string with the 
number of seconds left ? (I don't know what I'm talking about)

regards,
Giuseppe.

-/* Description:
-
-   This widget works like a normal menu_item, but you can insert a
-   arbitrary widget (most often a pixmap widget), which is displayed
-   at the left side. The advantage is that indentation is handled the
-   same way as GTK does.
-
-   (i.e if you create a menu with a gtk_check_menu_item, all normal
-   menu_items are automatically indented by GTK - so if you use a normal
-   menu_item to display pixmaps at the left side, the pixmaps will be
-   indented, which is not what you want. This widget solves the problem)

Nice, but I hope you have read all replies in the mentioned thread too.

I would not remove the gtk version 1 support, and support both versions
instead. This is a bit harder, but will make existing systems happy.
Can you try to do this? Version 2 may be preferred if both are found.
If you can't do this, then maybe we need FvwmGtk2 module in addition to
FvwmGtk, with both built when available.

Please do not remove block brackets for consistency with the rest of
the fvwm code.

Please stay with K&R style, with tabs, no spaces after the function name
and so on. At least do not undo this style that is the main in fvwm.

Thanks.

I think, separate modules for Version 1 and 2 of GTK would be a batter
solution, because i plane add some new widgets (primary - GtkTree).
Imho, code will be more easy for maintain in case of two differnet modules.

Hello, telling windows to AnimatedMove while already in an AnimatedMove 
operation seems to leave the server grabbed, i work around it with a 
simple wrapper function that uses States to make sure it's safe:

DestroyFunc LockingSlide
AddToFunc LockingSlide
+ I Test (!State 2) Break
+ I State 2 False
+ I AnimatedMove $0 $1
+ I State 2 True

You can test it with this: 

DestroyModuleConfig MoveTest: *
*MoveTest: Geometry 100x100
*MoveTest: (Action Current AnimatedMove w-10p keep, Title "Click Me")
Module FvwmButtons MoveTest

if you click it really fast a few times, you will see what I mean :)

Is this workaround nescessary, or have I found a bug?

secondly, is there any reason why fvwm-menu-directory has the menu name
'FuncFvwmMenuDirectory' hardcoded?

I have two different functions that handle browsing directories, one is 
a general browser and the other browses images, in the second one I have 
to sed out the menu Name so that moving to a subdirectory doesnt confuse 
it...would a patch be accepted that stopped it from ignoring the --name 
option witout --reuse?

you can see the functions I use here
http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/fvwm2rc.html one is called
FuncFvwmMenuDirectory, and the other is WallpaperBrowser.

Probably a bug, but something is missing here for a minimal reproducable
config. Probably you use FvwmEvent too.

This is not a good fix. --name is a menu name in all fvwm-menu-* scripts,
using it as a function name would be confusing. I will add some new
option like --missing-subdir-function (or better yet --func-name) later.

Hi,

i've tried to use FvwmAuto to automatically shade windows, emulating
auto-hide panels. For example my FvwmPager is in the upper-right corner
and shaded, if i put the mouse over it, it is automatically unshaded, if
the mouse leaves it, it is shaded again.

The problem with FvwmAuto is that if the mouse leaves the window for a
short time (less then the delay set for FvwmAuto) and re-enters it,
FvwmAuto calls both, the leave and enter functions, on the window, which
results in the mouse leaving the window again when it is shaded (leave)
and re-entering again when it is unshaded (enter), creating a loop. This
leads to flickering of the window.

You can reproduce this using:
Module FvwmAuto 500 -menterleave "Silent WindowShade" \
"Silent WindowShade"

Then enter a window with the mouse (a shaded one will probably work
better), leave it for a short amount of time and re-enter it.

The attached patch simply compares the last 'raised' window (which would
be 'lowered') to the one that has been entered, if they are the same,
the action is canceled.

Please CC me when replying.

Bjoern

Hi all,

The default config for FVWM is (IMO) yuk!

I propose we update it to actually make it usable & also to make it a
little more aesthetically pleasing.

As an initial step, find attached a .fvwm2rc file. This syntax could
be added to ConfigFvwmDefaults (& SetRCDefaults() in fvwm.c potentially
updated as well).

A screenshot is available here:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/tmp/defaultLook.png

I would like to emphasise that the goal is NOT to have a whiz-bang,
super-dooper config showing off all FVWMs bells & whistles! (For that we
have custom .fvwm2rc files (hi Tavis! :) & fvwm-themes, etc.) The
default config should remain simple with a reasonable level of intuitive
functionality ... but it also shouldn't look like FVWM got stuck in the
90's! :)

All comments/suggestions/criticism most welcome.

SCoTT. :)

There are two big problems with improving the default config
(which is actually more an emergency fallback config with a
minimal set of options to allow the user to use the desktop at
all).

  1. It has to support black/white displays.  That rules out
     almost any attempt to make it visually more pleasing,
     especially any use of gradients (which may be a performance
     problem on very old machines too).

  2. I am highly reluctant to add new mouse or key bindings.  The
     man page documents these defaults and shows the exact
     commands that are necessary to remove them.  Many users rely
     of these commands and would not like if they had to change
     these settings once in a while.

As a compromise, we could add a root menu entry to switch between
the plain and a more fancy setup.  But then, wouldn't it be better
to integrate a minimal version of fvwm-themes into fvwm to get the
user going?

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I don't think the default configuration is so bad. It is intended to be
the fall back configuration and as such it is ok. It may be improved.
The default menu lists two non fall back setups to install.

I see some problems with your specific suggestion. The more bindings you
define (especially uncommon ones) the more users should undo in their
configs. This is one of the repeating questions even if we don't have
many built-in bindings right now.

The colors are sharp, they are not very pleasant for a long work, so I
see no real improvements in this area.

You use 3 titlebar buttons on the right without redefining their look.
It is very bad that a button looking like Maximize does Close.

I have no final opinion yet. But if you absolutelly want to have a new
default look and feel, then I suggest to borrow it from the default theme
of the current fvwm-themes cvs. This should not be much larger than the
config you posted. Here how it may look, compare with your screenshot:

  http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/tmp/fvwm-default.png

> 
> TitleStyle Active HGradient 255 2 MidnightBlue 50 black 50 MidnightBlue
> TitleStyle InActive HGradient 255 2 RoyalBlue 50 black 50 RoyalBlue

If we do this (with more soft colors), then we will need to explain how
to disable these forced gradients in all documentation. This may easily
become FAQ 0.0 question. Also, I would encourage the colorset syntax here.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael & Dominik, :)

Dominik says:

: > The default config for FVWM is (IMO) yuk!
: You obviously never took a look at sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc

Perhaps my definition of "default config" is wrong. To me, this is
an example .fvwm2rc file that users have to explicitly copy to
~/.fvwm/config or wherever. (Incidentally, this file does not appear
to be installed with "make install".)

I was more interested in the look & usability of FVWM when no
~/.fvwm2rc, ~/.fvwm/config, etc file is found.

: 1. It has to support black/white displays.

Surely we can get around this with PipeRead & xdpyinfo, or (even better)
FVWM probably knows when it's running on a monochrome display.

: 2. I am highly reluctant to add new mouse or key bindings.

see next point.

Mikhael says:

: I see some problems with your specific suggestion. The more bindings you
: define (especially uncommon ones) the more users should undo in their
: configs.

What if we made FVWM "Read" a default config file iff no config file is
found in the usual places? Maybe we should make it read system.fvwm2rc?

: The colors are sharp, they are not very pleasant for a long work, so I
: see no real improvements in this area.

I'm not married to any of the aesthetics - just anything other than
grey & black! :)

: You use 3 titlebar buttons on the right without redefining their look.
: It is very bad that a button looking like Maximize does Close.

Good point.

: I have no final opinion yet. But if you absolutelly want to have a new
: default look and feel, then I suggest to borrow it from the default theme
: of the current fvwm-themes cvs.

Ah! Good idea!

I guess I'm trying to guard against this situation:

Newbie tries FVWM for the first time. Starts it up. "YUK!". (never
uses FVWM again)

Maybe it doesn't happen as much as I think it does.

Still, my hypothetical newbie gets a vastly different experience when
trying fvwm-themes, KDE, Gnome, etc for the first time.

SCoTT. :)

If you start fvwm without a config, you should end up finding the menu
that lets you choose a starting config.  Right now, that will lead you to the
Setup Form of the Setup Script.  From there you make choices about
the setup you want.

Hi Mikhael,

What needs to be done for items E.11, E.12 & E.15 in docs/todo-2.6?

Oh! I just noticed item F.1! :)

E.11 and E.12 are mostly done unless you (as an application writer) find
something missing. I plan to make small clean ups however.

I planned to have more things, like better tests for fvwm perllib and new
classes, but I have no enough time to complete them right now. Some ideas
are FVWM::Module::Terminal (think FvwmConsole, but it also implements all
dialog methods of the abstract FVWM::Module::Toolkit, using xterms or
similar); FVWM::Module::AnyToolkit to create simple GUIs without
requiring to install GTK or Tk perl bindings (they are autodetected and
the best class is used, otherwise it fallbacks to FVWM::Module::Terminal).

E.15 is optional, it would be good if FvwmWindowMenu had all WindowList
functionality (so it may eventually replace it in the future). But
currently it is far from this (and some fvwm tweaks are needed), so
unless you may quickly add missing functionality, this may be postponed.

> Oh! I just noticed item F.1! :)

I think the solution is just to add/replace some menu items to the
fallback menu. For example, to add new item "Install fvwm-themes" that
may use FVWM::Module::AnyToolkit to ask questions, then "wget;
rpm/deb/make". Reworking the existing two Setup items would be good too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

When I try to install the themes PKG, I get a dependency error, saying that
I need to have >= 2.5.8.   Since I am running 2.5.10, I should be fine.  I
have also tried this with FVWM 2.5.8, and got the same results.

Either your fvwm-2.5.10 is not properly installed (fvwm-config is
not in the PATH) or an older fvwm version is installed too and its
fvwm-config is before the new one in the PATH.  Check your PATH
setting carefully.  If that does not fix the problem, try
deinstalling all fvwm's on the system and reinstall only 2.5.10.

This is a general rpm dependency problem that has nothing special to do
with fvwm and fvwm-themes.

Like the error says, you should install fvwm rpm before installing
fvwm-themes rpm. Both rpms are available in the same place. If you prefer
to install fvwm from sources, then install fvwm-themes from sources too.

Think about it. You installed fvwm into the /usr/local or some other
prefix, but this rpm uses the /usr prefix, it simply can't work together
with your manual installation and thus the dependancy error is good.

Regards,
Mikhael.

As for E.15, there is a bug number 1146 (escaping the special characters
in menu labels).

You may go to http://www.fvwm.org/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug.private (password

Subject: keyboard focus is nowhere

Full_Name: Brent
Version: 2.4.16
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: XFree86  4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (209.30.201.134)


Sometimes the active window does not get the keyboard focus.  Happens with
Mozilla 1.4 (20030915).  Clicking on the title bar, in the window, or in
text entry boxes in the window does not move keyboard focus to the window. 
There was only one window, the title bar was the active window color, a
cursor was present in one of the text entry boxes, but keystrokes did
nothing.  Alt-tab did nothing.  The only way I found to get keyboard focus
to the window was to right click on the background to bring up the list of
windows (which had only one window in it) and select that window.  Mouse
clicks (like, on links) work.

I have fvwm2 set up with no pager and no task bar, just the mini buttons
(ps shows fvwm2 and FvwmButtons in list).  I am using Slackware 9.1, which
came with those versions of Mozilla and X.

Haven't figured out how to reproduce this problem reliably.  Has happened
several times.

I'm already aware of this problem which appeared with mozilla-1.4
and still occurs with mozilla-1.7.  All I found out yet is that it
happens more frequently if you have web sites with input fields.
Although I suspect it's a mozilla bug, I'd like to see what
happens in detail with a debugger attached to fvwm.  But I never
could make it happen on demand.

Subject: FakeClick generates EnterNotify event

Full_Name: Piotr Zielinski
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Red Hat Linux 9
X_Server: 4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (128.232.8.138)


I use FakeClick to intercept clicks in some windows, and pass the click to
the others, for example

AddToFunc HandleClick
+ I PointerWindow (FvwmPager) DoSomethingSpecial
+ I PointerWindow (!FvwmPager) FakeClick depth 0 press 1

This sometimes doesn't work.  For example, in xdvi should react to such a
click by displaying a window containing a magnified version of some part of
the document as long as the button it pressed.  It does not.  Using xev I
discovered that FakeClick produces an additional EnterNotify event just
after the button has been pressed.  Is this a bug?

Hello,

Maybe some people can be interested by this experimental software:

http://insitu.lri.fr/~chapuis/metisse

It is a 3D X desktop based on Xvnc, XDarwin, FVWM and Ametista.
There is a special version of FVWM included in it.

Regards, Olivier

It would be nice, at least as an option if not default, for windows with
shaped icons to have said icons clickable within a rectangular area
(defined by the shaped icon itself), and not just within the non-
transparent parts of the icon. 

As it is, An icon like a transparent X logo can be very hard to hit. :)

Thanks much

Please carefully read the description of the FakeClick command in
the man page.  A binding like yours can not work reliably with all
applications.  Windows need to be clicked at various "depth"
values, and it's impossible to know without trying.  In case of
xdvi the problem is that is does not react to the button press but
to the button release.  You can try

  + I PointerWindow (!FvwmPager) FakeClick depth 0 press 1 release 1

or shorter

  + I PointerWindow (!FvwmPager) FakeClick d 0 p 1 r 1

No.  EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events are generated by the X
server automatically when a button is pressed or released.

Hmmm, I thought specifying fvwm-workers@fvwm.org in the notification
list (of the fvwm-bug website) would ensure this note got sent to the
list - obviously not:


> use FakeClick to intercept clicks in
> some windows, and pass the click to
> the others ...

The correct way to do this now is with a window-specific binding. ie.

Mouse (rxvt) 1 A N Echo "mouse1-in-rxvt"
Mouse (xterm) 1 A N Echo "mouse1-in-xterm"

Note that this feature is currently in CVS & will be available in
2.5.11.

> xdvi should react to such a click

I can't reproduce your problem. It worked fine for me with:

sleep 2 && FvwmCommand 'FakeClick depth 0 press 1'

The sleep is so I have time to move the mouse cursor to the xdvi window.

SCoTT. :)

The correct way to do this now is with a window-specific binding. ie.

Mouse (rxvt) 1 A N Echo "mouse1-in-rxvt"
Mouse (xterm) 1 A N Echo "mouse1-in-xterm"

Note that this feature is currently in CVS & will be available in 2.5.11.

> xdvi should react to such a click

I can't reproduce your problem. It worked fine for me with:

sleep 2 && FvwmCommand 'FakeClick depth 0 press 1'

The sleep is so I have time to move the mouse cursor to the xdvi window.

Subject: FakeClick generates EnterNotify event

Full_Name: Piotr Zielinski
Version: 2.5.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Red Hat Linux 9
X_Server: 4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (128.232.8.138)


I use FakeClick to intercept clicks in some windows, and pass the click to
the others, for example

AddToFunc HandleClick
+ I PointerWindow (FvwmPager) DoSomethingSpecial
+ I PointerWindow (!FvwmPager) FakeClick depth 0 press 1

This sometimes doesn't work.  For example, in xdvi should react to such a
click by displaying a window containing a magnified version of some part of
the document as long as the button it pressed.  It does not.  Using xev I
discovered that FakeClick produces an additional EnterNotify event just
after the button has been pressed.  Is this a bug?

This probably awaited the moderation.

Log message:
* Fixed bad interaction between SnapGrid and paging that could lead to
paging or no paging at all.
* Implemented a partial workaround for buggy XFree 4.1.0.1 which does
deliver MotionNotify events if the pointer hits a screen cornet while
very fast.  It's an ugly hack, but it improves the situation somewhat.
