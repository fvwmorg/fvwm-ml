No core dump. 

The pager just closes or gets closed. On my Linux system  at
home  I  noticed that weired color change after changing the

Both may be caused by the same problem.

BTW: I changed the config a bit without success.

Could you attach a debugger to the running pager and single step
through it to see where it exits?

I do not understand the problem, sorry. But two remarks/questions:
What about merging FCombineChars, FBidi and FBidiJoin?
Which charset (in the sense of the FlocaleCharsetTable from FLocaleCharset.c)
needs Char Combining and which charset needs Joining (I know for
Bidi)?

Can you send some relevant strings (in UTF-8 or/and others encoding)

Sometimes there is no character defined in Unicode for a specific
combination of an ordinary character (for example an "o") and some unusual
combinational character.
In this case, the best thing to do is to draw the combinational character
at the same position as the "o", to get an approximation of what the
combined character would look like.

I think the combination algorithm is a bit different from the contextual
shaping used for Arabic. Also the Arabic joining and shaping is only done
if BIDI is enabled (and using a charset needing BIDI).
I think Arabic joining should only be done if BIDI is done. It seems to me
it wouldn't make sense to do that without BIDI.
Nadim, do you have an opinion? 

I found some case where the algorithm fails, so I will continue to refine
it before making further descitions

Yes, I will take care of this.

It might be worth while to read over the following thread then,

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0303/msg00080.html

the crux of which is spelled out in (IMHO),

I think, as was noted previously, the best approach to take here is to
do the following (order matters - I'm listing in execution order),

 1. Do Bidi
    - if needed of course
 2. Do Shaping (sometimes described/termed joining)
    - Shaping/Joining is the morphing of characters based on their
      location within a word (initial/medial/final/stand-alone)
 3. Do Combining
    - There are some characters out there that will need to be combined
      (meaning you take A+B -> C -- yup, two characters result in one;
       this is a complete replacement act. C is brand new glyph)
 4. Do Composing
    - This is the superimposition of one character on top of one that
      proceeds it (meaning you take E+F -> G -- yup two characters result
      in one; the key here is that G is NOT a new glyph its simply E with
      F superimposed on it).

Everything is currently coded-up (in one state or another) except for #4
above (its still a mystery to me how that is done, Olivier ?).

Marcus, if you are in essence describing "composing" (or superimposition;
point #4 above) then I agree.

Yup, as noted above shaping/joining and combining are two different things.
In the case of shaping/joining they are specific to those language that
usually require Bidi.

I would tend to agree, but there might be instances where it might be useful
to have it without Bidi (for debug purposes, etc) and/or if others might
require similar functionality for one reason or another.  I'd vote to
simply have all functions be self-contained and not dependent on each other.

To reiterate the end-result (once we know how to code-up #4 - composing)
could look like this in pseudo code,

  if (bidi_enabled)
     str = bidi_run(str);

  if (shaping_enabled && shape_range(str))
     str = shape_n_join(str);

  if (combining_enabled)
     str = combine(str);

  if (composing_enabled)
     str = compose(str);

I'm opting to include all under qualifiers for speed and controllability
aspects.  What this will then mean,

 /* Assume all options FALSE apriori */
 if (Arabic_enabled)
 {
   bidi_enabled      = TRUE;
   shaping_enabled   = TRUE;
   combining_enabled  = TRUE;
   composing_enabled = TRUE;
 }
 elsif (Nordic_enabled)  /* Marcus' concerns */
 {
   combining_enabled  = TRUE;
   composing_enabled = TRUE;
 }

Hope that makes sense.

PS: CC for faster replies (I'm an archive mole :-)

Hi there,

I had a try using fvwm without a config - only with the
config I posted. The problem disappeared. 

So it might be my configuration too.

I attached an archive with my whole config, maybe you can
have a try.

I've done 4 also.
But I do 3 and 4 before 1 and 2. maybe this is not so good.
How does the BIDI handle combining characters?
Does it preserve the order?
So that for example "Alef + combining character" is not swapped.

If that's the case, maybe I should do the combing and composing after
BIDI and then extract remaining combining characters to allow for
"superimposing"

Ah, cool - I'll need to see how you did it (I'm dying to know).

Bidi knows nothing of combined characters; it would be wrong for
Bidi to actually see them since they are only noted in 'visual' context.
The added wrinkle to Bidi (and alot of the effects noted above) with
regard to Arabic is that they are all done strictly for visual affect.
In other words, if I have a string on disk somewhere - it'll get Bidi'ed
combined/composed/etc (mangled) so that a user can see it, but the bytes
on the disk never change.  To make a long story short, Bidi only knows
discrete (non-combined/non-shaped) characters.

> "superimposing"

Yeah, I would stick with the order noted above - that would work best.

I'm seeing some strange behaviour with Acrobat Reader 5 on Red Hat Linux
7.3 with FVWM 2.4.16 and 2.5.7.  I'm using ManualPlacement.

With 2.4.16, when I start Acrobat Reader I get a splash screen and then
an outline window.  When I click to position this window no window appears
and instead I get a second outline.  When I click a second time the
window finally appears.

With 2.5.7 I get the splash screen and an outline.  Clicking makes the
outline go away but no window appears.  The Acrobat Reader process is
running but with no window.

The 2.4 behaviour is tolerable, but 2.5 is a bit of a problem.

Ron

How about renaming move/resize to describe what they do,
something like "resize-on-release"?  And then make move/resize
built-in functions.

Otherwise 2.6 is going to need a conversion tool.

I have something like that.

I would like Dominik to decide here.

Regardless of this problem, I think we should supply the conversion
script, even if most of the old things are supported. I am slowly
starting to write out things that better be converted.

So, I do not use Icons - I am just interested in that many
mini icons are set properly.

This where no KDE2 nor GNOME2 applications. It was
gnome-1.2.7. So there must be any other mechanismen which
extracts this icon. Maybe the X-Server takes the big icon
and scales it down.

> Your feature request should be send at the good place :o)

So I would like to do that hereby ;-) 

If the big icon is available from an application can fvwm
scale it down and use it as mini icon? This would be a fancy
feature for winlist, FvwmWindowList and FvwmTaskBar.

Also, it would be nice if there is a way to extract this
icon from the application so that it can be used in the
menus :-) Possible that a tool does already exists to do
that.

Cheers, Uwe

We don't seem to have the png or colorset support in FvwmBanner.

So if a logo with an alpha channel wins, we will not be able to show it
as nicely as we could with such support.

Is it hard to add the colorset or png support to FvwmBanner?

Additionally, I would like to have the following in FvwmBanner.

  * add the logo that we have right now on the web like Dan suggested
  * add options -0 and -c --colorful, -r --reduced, -m --mono that mean:
     -c - use colorful banner (from the web, will be the default for now)
     -r - use up to 20 colors banner (it is used in FvwmBanner right now)
     -m - use b&w xbm banner (it is used right now if needed)
  * when we have a winner logo, we will add option -1 (the new default),
    we may also add more nice logos in the future (options -2, -3 etc)

For each built-in logo, 3 images are supplied. If color options are not
specified, then -c is used on good video, falling to -r on 8bpp, and to
-m on 1bpp.

Is this acceptable?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think Olivier says that the right place is to ask the application
authors to add EWMH mini icon hint support. :)

Just my opinion on the subject. Most of the old applications set the
icon image that is very bad for my taste, I would like to use only the
icons that I define (using wm-icons icon sets), so IconOverride for me.

Unfortunately, IconOverride is even not strong enough for me, I would
like "Style * IconOverride" or at least "Style ** IconOverride" to mean
no application icons are ever used, even if no "Style pattern Icon" is
matched for a window, for such windows the icon defined in "Style * Icon"
should be used, not the application icon. Is this a bug or a feature?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Probably not difficult.  Keep in mind that if the image comes from
a colour set, the reserved space is not freed when the banner
closes.

Only if the various logos can be downloaded separately.  We don't
want to distribute 3x3 or even more images in the tarball.

Yes, the colorset support is not really needed if there is PNG support.

If we don't build-in several logos, then it is useless to speak about
these options, the current hardcoded logic already handles xpm/xbm.
And the user may just supply the image he downloaded, no options needed.

I don't see a problem to distribute 2-3 logos in 3 variants (or include
them all into C source if they are xpm/xbm). My FvwmBanner binary is
677052 bytes with -g used (default), adding 3 more 10-40Kb images does
not make an appreciable difference. I am more than sure not everyone will
like the new FvwmBanner logo, so we may include several nice logos.

Regards,
Mikhael.

:-) Maybe I got that wrong - but I have thought about many
applications so I cannot contact all the authors.

At the moment I do the same since there is no  other  choice
for  applications  which do not support EWMH mini icons. But
seeing that X-Win can obtain the mini  icons,  even  of  old
applications, made me think this would be a nice feature for
my fvwm setup. 
If I have some time maybe I have a look how  this  might  be
done. If fvwm already extracts the big icon it should not be
that hard to implement it. 

But I agree fully that both the icon and the mini  icon  has
to be overrideable by the config. 

Regards, Uwe

I'm speaking about tarball size, not executable size.

So it will be 2283442 instead of 2243442 for each new logo. Why not?
It is still much less than some applications like emacs, perl, mozilla,
linux kernel. Even the size of zsh sources (one single executable) are
comparable with fvwm. And one may think fvwm does more than all these
together. (Yes, this last sentence is a joke.)

Because the gain you get for the additional size is close to zero.
It's against the philosophy fvwm development always hung on to.

Well, for me it is vice versa, the gain is big (more happy users) and the
cost is close to zero (we already build in a logo in several variants).
But I don't want to force it.

I think Mikhael is trying to upgrade the builtin banner
which I think is a good idea.

I also agree with Dominik, we should strive to
keep the base package as small as possible.

I agree with both of them too, but I thought the disagreement was about
extra banners and not the default built-in. Sorry if I misunderstood.

Oops.  Too early for me.

Yep, rereading the original proposal, I don't see the need either.
One banner will do.  The builtin color limiting should take care
of the color options.

I only really care about the default banner looking better.

There is png "support" in FvwmBanner. There is just a bug ... fixed
soon (I hope).

However, the support is limited: no alpha blending! if a point has
an alpha of <= 130 then the point is removed and if the alpha > 130
the point is fully displayed ...

Now, we can add alpha blending but on what? X has no translucent
support ... So, we can either (if the image has some alpha):

1 - blend vs the Root window (need ParentalRelativity Style)
2 - or over a colorset background
3 - or over a colorset background without the shape from the image.

1 and 2 may look ugly under certains situations. For example,
with 1 and FvwmBanner over an other window than the root window.
So, 3 can be a default (with colorset 0). This leads to new options:

*FvwmBanner: Colorset cs
Specifies a colorset for the bg of FvwmBanner (default 0).
This is only useful if the image has a transparent part
and the Shaped option is used or if the image has an alpha channel.

*FvwmBanner: Shaped bool
Shape or not the FvwmBanner window with the transparent part of the image.
Default is false if the image has an alpha channel, true otherwise.

With these two options we can do 1, 2 and 3.

Nothing critical here except for inconsistency with height hints in one
of your apps. But you may consider to upgrade your old fvwm version.

I agree with your analyze.

I just commited 2 png banners in fvwm-themes for your testing, one with
and one without alpha channel (maybe it is even too much alpha-ish).
The one without alpha was created by applying on the black background,
converting to transparent xpm, manual editing and converting back to png.

Currently the banner without alpha channel looks definitely better,
because the flattening threshold of 130 is bad for this specific png.

Mikhael.

Previously I got "Failed to write descriptor to 'FvwmConsole'" often, but
now I can narrow the problem, this time with FvwmBanner, not FvwmConsole.

Minimal rc file:

  *FvwmBanner: Timeout 200

  OpaqueMoveSize unlimited

  FvwmConsole
  FvwmBanner

If you don't do anything during 200 seconds, everything is fine, but if
you start to move FvwmConsole then after 1-2 seconds of dragging the title
there is the usual hanging of 30 seconds and then:

[FVWM][FlushMessageQueue]: <<ERROR>> Failed to write descriptor to
'FvwmBanner':
- select rc=0
- terminate signal=N

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael,

I tried out your ModuleConfig tracker with FvwmTabs - it works great.

Should I expect to get an 'observation' if I dynamically change
config parameters? (using FvwmTalk or FvwmCommand) The dynamic values
are only propogated after I restart FvwmTabs.

Also, you need to s/InitialConfig/DefaultConfig/ in the perl POD
at the bottom of ModuleConfig.pm.

Thanks!

SCoTT. :)

Seems that there is no conclusion here. It seems that there is two
votes for it (me and Mikhael) one vote against (Dominik) and one
unclear vote (Dan). So I ask for more votes and clarification
(Dan?). For that I send an other version of the patch (attached).
I've followed all the advice (I can follow) that I get in this
thread.  In particular, I've followed all the remarks (as I can) of
Dominik regarding the code. So, Dominik I even hope you revert your
vote (very little hope ...). Also: the cmds are named WindowStyle and
DestroyWindowStyle and act on the selected window and there is the
doc and some tests in purify.fvwm2rc.

Regards, Olivier

PS: What are the rules for the votes?

You documented the command, and supplied test cases, so those objections
are withdrawn.

There was same talk about StyleById being temporary and you chose
WindowStyle instead of
using a null pattern to select the context window:

You used:

Next (window*) WindowStyle BorderWidth 7

instead of:

Next (window*) Style [] BorderWidth 7

I think I prefer the null pattern, but only slightly.

I don't think I have any other objections.
The code you added looks pretty good.

> PS: What are the rules for the votes? 

We never had formal rules.
I think these are fair rules:

anyone on the list can vote.
votes from people that contribute more should count for more.
votes should include reasons, the reasons matter too.

Anyone else seen this?

I have FvwmIdent configured like this:

*FvwmIdent: Back Black
*FvwmIdent: Fore white
*FvwmIdent: Font 9x15bold

I invoke it with a keypress:

Key F3          A       M       Module FvwmIdent

Sometimes the FvwmIdent window comes up all black.
I don't see anything on stderr.

Seems to be happening about 1 out of 5 times.

I have the following line in my config which used to work fine until I
upgraded to 2.5.7

Key -XF86Standby A N Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xset dpms force off

The name of the key appears correctly in "xev" but FVWM doesn't seem to
notice the key-press at all.(I ran FvwmDebug and tried pressing the key)

I couldn't find anything in the NEWS/man page to suggest something has changed.

Can you please clarify one thing. You previously said that after applying
many WindowStyle commands and switching themes the style list didn't grow.
Do I understand you correctly? Because it is the Dominik's reason against
the patch (you seem to cover several other reasons with your new patch).

I started to write an answer some weeks ago, but I didn't have a time to
complete it. I don't have the time now too. But I will try.

There were ideas 2 years ago to have powerful conditions, but instead of
duplicating them in both conditional commands and Style command, to get
rid of Style and introduce WindowStyle instead. I.e. currently unexistent

  Style (Class XTerm) NoButton 6

is replaced with:

  Next (Class XTerm) WindowStyle NoButton 6

that is placed in StyleFunction and applied to all new windows.

So, at least by these ideas, it is not clear whether to have Style
command at all in the long run. On the contrary, having WindowStyle that
does not receive any condition parameters, but works on the context
window instead is a good and complete thing.

The second reason against 2 different cases of Style (one that works on
window context and one that ignores it) is no well-defined behaviour.

I understand that you want to have class/resource patterns in Style.
Then what should this command mean for you:

  Next (XTerm) Style (Resource mozilla) TitleAtBottom

1) Only windows that are both "XTerm" and "mozilla" are affected.
2) Any mozilla is affected if there are some xterms on the screen.

I would prefer to leave the current Style as is, i.e. to ignore any
window context for the sake of consistency.

The third reason to have a separate WindowStyle command is that it
may eventually replace all state commands, i.e. "Stick" is the same as
"WindowStyle Sticky". But this is not really a separate reason, because
you may say that "Style [] Sticky" will do it. It is possible, but not
as clean as "WindowStyle Sticky" for me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

FYI, FvwmDebug is for module communication debugging, not key bindings.
Modules know nothing about key bindings that are handled by fvwm.

The key release binding functionality was removed on 2003-03-09,
because it does not work relably.

Instead of adding the 2.5.7 item, the corresponding 2.5.5 item was
removed from NEWS.

I think we should start only to add NEWS, not remove them backwards,
because many users use 2.5.x now.

Mikhael.

I think I'm starting to understand.

The Style command stays around, it affects
all current windows that match and any new window that
match.

The windowstyle command only affects the context
window that the Next, All, etc. window select.

The command you show above:

  Next (XTerm) Style (Resource mozilla) TitleAtBottom

doesn't make sense.  It sould only get executed if there
was an XTerm window somewhere, but then it would change
Mozilla windows, and any future Mozilla windows.

WindowStyle does make sense as a separate command.
When it gets processed, it gets turned into a style
with an ID so that if there is a restart, it can get reapplied
to the window.

In the case you give above:

   Next (Class XTerm) WindowStyle NoButton 6

I don't see how that can replace the Style command, unless
we also saved the "Next" part of the command.
Even then, its not quite the same, Next only executes
when it matches something.  The current Style command
doesn't have to match anything to work.

Dominik can defend himself, but his reasoning is that if you are
using the betas, you should be following the development process.
(If I remember right.)

That seems right to me.

Well, the original idea that removes Style command completely was:

  AddToFunc StyleFunction I Next (Class XTerm) WindowStyle NoButton 6

and StyleFunction is applied on all new windows.

But I would not discuss this idea now. I am sure we will have many
discussion after 2.6.0. :)  Even if we don't implement this idea and
implement "Style (Class XTerm, Resource rxvt)" syntax instead, still
I think it is good to have 2 separate commands: Style that ignores
window context and WindowStyle that requires window context.

Mikhael.

Something like an "AddWindowHook".

It helps us to create 2.6.0 announcement if we remove backwards.
It helps users if we add news items. I think I prefer to add, but
if someone remove, it is ok to me.

Yes, with fvwm-themes I've tried to switch and add some window style,
switch and add some window style ..etc and the style list does not
grow (in a not reasonable way). However, one can succeed to found a
way for making the style list to explode (with a limited number of
name) with or without the WindowStyle command. I think you have to do
very strange things for this (with or without the WindowStyle
command).

By the way, I think we may improve a bit __simplify_style_list, by
remplacing:

if (!styles_have_same_id(*cur, *cmp))
{
	blockor((char *)&interflags,
		(char *)&interflags,
		(char *)&cmp->flag_mask,
		sizeof(style_flags));
	blockor((char *)&interflags,
		(char *)&interflags,
		(char *)&cmp->flag_default,
		sizeof(style_flags));
	cmp = SGET_PREV_STYLE(*cmp);
	continue;
}

by something like:

Bool one_fw_can_match_both_ids(window_style s, window_style t)
{
	if (SGET_ID_HAS_WINDOW_ID(s) && SGET_ID_HAS_WINDOW_ID(t) &&
	    SGET_WINDOW_ID(s) != SGET_WINDOW_ID(t))
	{
		return False;
	}
	if (SGET_ID_HAS_NAME(s) && SGET_ID_HAS_NAME(t))
	{
		if !(there exists a string which match 
		     SGET_NAME(s) and SGET_NAME(t))
		{
			return False;
		}
	}
	return True;
}

if (!styles_have_same_id(*cur, *cmp))
{
	if (one_fw_can_match_both_ids(*cur,*cmp))
	{
		blockor((char *)&interflags,
			(char *)&interflags,
			(char *)&cmp->flag_mask,
			sizeof(style_flags));
		blockor((char *)&interflags,
			(char *)&interflags,
			(char *)&cmp->flag_default,
			sizeof(style_flags));
	}
	cmp = SGET_PREV_STYLE(*cmp);
	continue;
}

but I've to think more and we have to found a cleaver algo for: 
 "there exists a string which match SGET_NAME(s) and SGET_NAME(t))"

Can you please provide some arguments?

Do you see your proposed WindowStyle command any different (in terms of
syntax and meaning) from the new command added by the posted patch?
For me they are identical, so your ideas become more real in the long run.

Or you mean that there may be the different implementation after 2.6.0?
Because starting to replace Style now before 2.6.0 is not a possibility.

Mikhael.

There is a typo, it should be of course ThisWindow, not Next:

  AddToFunc StyleFunction I ThisWindow (Class XTerm) WindowStyle NoButton 6

I don't mean to change or remove the Style command so I don't want to 
wait until after 2.6.0. The old proposal is to create a new command 
"WindowStyle" that sets the style of the target window. It would be 
called as "WindowStyle Sticky" in which case it operates on the target 
window or as "WindowID XXX (<conditions>) WindowStyle Sticky" in which 
case it operates on the window XXX.  The WindowStyle command would not 
do any pattern matching, It would use the pattern matching of WindowId 
so that if the WindowId command were to be upgraded to use a 
"Class=<pattern>" that syntax would be usable in the WindowStyle and 
Style commands for free.

The old proposal is also to change the Style command to manipulate a 
"StyleFunction" function rather than have it maintain a style list. The 
StyleFunction would be run on every window that is created and would 
consist of a sequence of "WindowId XXX (<condition>) WindowStyle YYY" 
lines. The proposal would have to implement a command to delete lines 
from a function as a method of controlling the growth of the style list. 
As a debug aid there would be a PrintFunction command which would 
probably be useful on its own anyway.

As I see it the new StyleByID proposal would complicate the (already 
complicated?) Style function and style list management. The old proposal 
would simplify the style list management.

The new proposal would require extra code to handle the deletion of 
windows, the old proposal does not need to do this.

The new proposal may change the behaviour of Recapture by making the 
StyleById settings more powerful than simple Style commands, I'm not 
sure if this is the intention. If it isn't then the Recapture command 
would have to delete all the Style "id=XXX" settings from the style list 
or do something clever.

Cheers,
Tim.

The updated Olivier's patch in the parent message does exactly this.
No less and no more. Actually it also adds DestroyWindowStyle command.

Should changing "the Style command to manipulate a StyleFunction" be done
before 2.6.0 or after it?

I suggest to use "ThisWindow" as a better syntax than "WindowId $[w.id]".

While I agree that the old proposal may be a good thing, it is unclear
whether its implementation is easier or open to less bugs than the
Olivier's patch.

As I understand the patch, window id entries are not more powerful than
the usual Style entries. There was a discussion to make them more
powerful by supplying an optional WindowStyle Permanent prefix.

For example this should reduce the style list to only Sticky entry:

  Next (XTerm) WindowStyle !Sticky
  Style XTerm Sticky

For me, the Olivier's patch is the safe thing to apply now before 2.6.0.
Trying to change the Style command by replacing style list with
StyleFunction before 2.6.0 is problematic. This maybe done after the new
stable release or it requires a separate voting. At least I hope you
agree with the syntax and meaning of the WindowStyle command as added by
the Olivier patch, this is more important than the actual implementation.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think that now I understand what you meant better.

Recapture should restore only Style setting for the window and not
WindowStyle settings. This is a small difference between your WindowStyle
and Olivier's WindowStyle. I don't know which behaviour I prefer, both
may be reasonable in different situations. I may even think about 3
usages of WindowStyle in the future, but this is not important now:

  WindowStyle           <flag> <setting>  # just like with Olivier patch
  WindowStyle Permanent <flag> <setting>  # use the separate win-id list
  WindowStyle OnlyState <flag> <setting>  # do not store it in any lists

Just noticed, there is a bug in WindowStyle_proposal.txt:

  # Style XXX YYY is equivalent to SetOneStyle XXX YYY
  AddToFunc SetOneStyle  
  + I AddToFunc StyleFunction I ThisWindow ($0) WindowStyle $1 $2      
  + I All StyleFunction

The last line should be:

  + I All ($0) WindowStyle $1 $2

There are some large issues with WindowStyle_proposal.txt to solve, like
reduction of the StyleFunction otherwise it will grow infinitelly when
switching themes, here the current Style is more optimal. Also currently
multiple Style commands are queued and executed at once unless
UpdateStyles is given.

I really prefer the Olivier solution before 2.6.0. I am not even sure it
is not the best for the long run. Style list with all its optimizations
is not nessesarily a bad thing, so adding WindowStyle to it may be good.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm implementing the next step of combining characters. Separating out
combining characters that couldn't be combined into a list for drawing as
superimposed characters later on.
So I gather these and there positions (the index of the last non-combining
character).
Then I need to know how characters are re-organised by the BIDI step.
So I changed the call in FBidi.c to this:

pos_l_to_v = 
	  (unsigned short int *)safemalloc((str_len + 1) * 
					   sizeof(unsigned short int));
fribidi_log2vis(
		logical_unicode_str, str_len, &pbase_dir,
		visual_unicode_str, pos_l_to_v, NULL, NULL);

where pos_l_to_v is upposed to contain a mapping afterwards.
But when I fprintf the content, all I get is
135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992
135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992 135243992
135243992

(in this case)

(The first string to be run through FlocaleEncodeString is " +8888 x +8888
"
(for calculating geometry windows..)

And also FVWM segfaults later on:

(gdb) bt

(gdb) 


If I change "pos_l_to_v"  back to NULL in the call to FriBidi, it works as
before.

Am I foreseeing something here?

Ooops.

The information on FriBidi's webpage is not up to date.
There it gives the lists as "gint16", but in the actual headers there is
a "FriBidiStrIndex" (which is defined as int).

it's very simple.

The apps (dockapps) swallowed in FvwmButtons don't respond if there is
other actions asigned to same space or button. 

That is, in old versions there were posible extensible panels with dockapps
activated by mouse buttons (open, hide, close). Now is not posible because
de main dockapp or aplication proper buttons don't respond if there is
other action asigned in that button. 

is that a bug? or maybe a new feature? or is a particular problem at my
system or compilation of fvwm?

Thanks

There were some problems that are fixed now.

I was stuck on one impossible problem. The ModuleConfig tracker in
FvwmDebug persistently did not want to report the dynamical module
configuration while it reported the statical configuration fine and the
same code placed into FvwmGtkDebug did work. It turned out that when the
module is started as:

  FvwmDebug -t ModuleConfig

fvwm thinks that "ModuleConfig" is an alias name and does not pass any
"*FvwmDebug: config value" while the module is run. Bad, I myself added
these heuristics. So be aware of this in your modules. The work around
here (at least for perl-based modules) is to start it differently:

  FvwmDebug --track=ModuleConfig

The good side, I improved several things while debugging this unexisting
problem. Also be aware that your module should be in ModulePath for
configuration to work at all. I think nothing may be done here until we
replace the module protocol to support module name/alias directly.

Please try new Colorsets tracker. Making the colorset fg/bg work is not
interesting. It would be nice if you can make colorset pixmaps work using
Perl/Tk or X11::Protocol. Maybe you can create a Tk window that shows all
available colorsets using rectangle of 48x48 and some text in it (like
colorset number in brackets). I am waiting for your experiments. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Now, after 11 days, is there any progress in moving 2.5.7 tarballs from

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/incoming/fvwm/

to their usual place, so I may replace the links? Thanks.

Hi David,

hehe! I like Dillo too.

Sure, I'll make sure there's a config option in the next release.

Hmmm, that's interesting. I thought I guard against this. Certainly if
I create a tabber & try to add it to itself it reports a:

"Can't add self to tabber!"

warning on stdout!

Could you elaborate on what you did to trigger this bug? I can't
seem to replicate.

Thanks,

SCoTT. :)

Fixed.  The COnfigureNotify handler threw away the initial Expose

Ah, CVS version works as expected - thanks.

Well my "experiments" are complete. I couldn't work out a way to do it
with just Tk so I ended up using Tk & X11::Protocol. Be warned though:
this is nasty code - its only purpose was to provide me with an intellectual
challenge! (or did you have a greater purpose in mind?)

I am not sure about JavaScript on the fvwm web site.  We  do
need  a solution which works even with browsers which do not
support dhtml or only parts of it. 
The background color change on the logo page would have been
possible  with JavaScript too. But I thought it may not work
in all browsers. 

But we may try to use dhtml for the man page sites if we can
get it work.

BTW: I am off for holiday from June 14 to 28. So I cannot
     check my mail nor working on the web site. Maybe I find
     a little bit time till the end of this week.

Regards, Uwe

With Dillo you can observe a behaviour that i don't like:

When you open in one tab an URL with a long <title> the button, the
FvwmTabs window and (only) the current Dillo window gets resized.

Maybe the size of the buttons should work similiar to mozilla (all
fixed size, when no more space is available all buttons shrink as
needed).

I get this too, but only sometime ;-)

It seems to appear randomly, to increase the chance it happens try
this:

  - Open a FvwmTabs Window, Close it=20
  - Open another FvwmTabs Window
  - choose "Multi Add", insert some normal windows and then try to add
    itself.

Here is some output:=20

first lots of

but they dont seems to be related to the crash. And then:

Another one: When i close the FvwmTabs Window with n xterms in it,
it may happen that it releases only n-1 and crashes, from stdout:

Maybe thats interesting to, i get some warnings on startup:

I hope this will help you,=20

I see no problems with a bit of javascript or css (it is possible to
write javascript that works with all browsers). The idea is if the user
browser supports it, the user may open/close sections, otherwise all
sections are statically open just like now.

I can reproduce this. The problem is that no expose event are
received by FvwmIdent and so the text is never drawn ...
I.e., the "mapping expose event" is not cached by FvwmIdent.
I've no fix right now. Dominik?

This is nice. And it is not such nasty, I can understand it, no problems.
It seems Colorset tracker has a small problem in reporting the new
colorset data in the place where the old should be reported.

The purpose of such tool is clear. If you have a lot of colorsets, for
example fvwm-themes uses about 37, you want to see them all.

Some problems with the attached module:

* It doesn't sort colorsets, I added "sort { $a <=> $b }" to keys.
* It shows only 12 first colorsets for me, the scrollbar widget should be
  added. I should add "Style ShowColorsets ResizeHintOverride", otherwise
  Tk limits its windows to the screen size.
* It is a bit slow. Yes, it creates 148 colored rectangles in my case,
  surrounded by other widgets, but 14 sec even on my slow CPU is many.
* There is an error in line 49, dump() gets a wrong parameter.
* There is a problem with refresh, try to WindowShade the window.
* Only tiled pixmaps are supported. But here probably nothing can be done
  without implementing rendering for other pixmap types.

Actually I intended that one 3d-looking rectangle (that uses all fg, bg,
sh, hi, fgsh, pixmap) is shown for one colorset, but showing 6 rectangles
may be useful too.

Other than this, a great tool. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Of course the main purpose of my request was to have an exapmle of
colorset usage in Perl. But if it is evolved into interactive tool to
change colorsets using a dialog box, it would be nice to have too.

As for the tool that shows colorsets just like they should look, here is
an FvwmButtons configuration. Save the attached file and execute:

  FvwmButtons Dummy /real/path/to/FvwmButtons-ShowColorsets

In order to raise only mozilla windows that are not mail, I use this
command, but only the first condition is taken in account : it raises all
windows whose name end with Mozilla. Moreover, the manpage does not precise
wether the conditions are ORed or ANDed. I expect that they ere ANDed, but
tell me if I'm wrong.

This is a documented feature, currently only one name may be used in
conditions. Here is the solution for you:

  All (*Mozilla) ThisWindow ("!*for julien.cervelle@* - Mozilla") WindowListFunc

Uwe, I hope you will update the index too (the overview and increase
a number of images).

Since both me and Uwe leave for 2 weeks, someone else should take
a care of the logos for this period. Alternativelly new submitters (if
any) may be asked to wait a bit until their logos are added.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Marcus, I just tried 'snap-20030611' with regard to combining
(which also includes composing -- that's what unicode calls the
act of 'superimposing of characters atop each other').  As far
as arabic is concerned, still no composing is taking place.  I'm
wondering if you are abiding by the order of things that were
suggested (it seemed like that was an issue before),

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0306/msg00042.html

I can mail you sample test cases and fonts off-list if you'd like.
Its rather simple really - you'll need,

 + a font
 + a sample minimal .fvwm2rc
 + an xterm invoking script with the title to be composed
 + an image of the expected results (to compare against)

I took a very quick peek at the code and don't see any considerations for
true composing (and not replacing - what did I overlook ?).  Case in point
0x0646 followed by 0x064E, don't see how composing is being taken care of
(there is no resulting stand-alone glyph for what's noted) they need to
be superimposed on top of each other.

Regards (& keep up the great work coming),

 - Nadim

Hi David,

: Maybe the size of the buttons should work similiar to mozilla (all
: fixed size, when no more space is available all buttons shrink as
: needed).

Agreed. I'll put it on my TODO list.

: > >  And a small bug: it crashes when

Hmmmm, this is a symptom of a focusing bug. I was looking at it
last night & damn its proving elusive to fix. It's on my TODO list
anyway. Thanks for the extra info.

SCoTT. :)

Yes, the first thing I did (which is in current CVS), is to combine for
those characters were a composed glyph (equivalent to a base character and
one or more combining characters) exists in Unicode.

The next part (which I have more or less working, need some testing), is
to pick out those remaining composing characters (like U+064E) into a list
of (position,value) and also reoreder those positions after BIDI is
applied.

The next thing to do (the most complicated, I'm afraid), is to draw those
composing characters on top of the "normal" characters.
The hard thing, as it seems to me, is to calculate the position of each
character in the ordinary string.
One way is to draw each character separately and take care of all
composing characters for a given character. The other might be to first
draw the "base" string, then use the "TextLength" routine to
"backtrack" the positions (in pixels) of each individual character.

I like the pager in the birthday layout much better than on the
regular page.  I suggest that we switch to a horizontal pager
there too, but below the page title:

  +-----------------------------+
  | The official fvwm home page | <- front page title
  +-----------------------------+
  +---------------------------+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | <- pager
  +---------------------------+
  +-----------------------------+
  |                             |
  |                             |
                ...               <- page contents
  |                             |
  |                             |
  +-----------------------------+

On the subordinate pages, the pager would be at the top.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Thinking some more about this I think the patch should be applied. It 
doesn't stop us changing the internal format of the style list in the 
future and if it works well there will be no need anyway.

We can change the default theme whenever we got a new one. 
Since the birthday theme support a simple multi-pixmap style
I would like derive a new default theme from it. Appart from
that I still got in mind to provide a fvwmrc which make fvwm
look the same as a web page theme. Another idea would be to
provide a simple (or complex :) fvwmrc generator on the web
page. The user may choose titlebar, mouse behaviour etc. and
gets a fvwmrc.

I leave for holiday in a couple of hours. So I would like to
shift that discussion two weeks from now.

Can anyone take care on new submitted logos for the logo
page? Either Mikhael nor me can do that in the next two
weeks. 

Cheers, Uwe

I've been pretty busy lately, but I'll try.
I don't see how these source forge lists work.
Send me instructions.

Ok, can you implement showDebug for Tk too?

As the first implementer you may do whatever is useful for you, for
example the dialog may include an option to redirect the debug to file or
stderr or just do what GTK+ does.

If you want your patches to be included without changes, use Tabs like
you do, but make sure it looks structured with any Tab width, like 3 or
20, and surely not just 4.

Regards,
Mikhael.

fvwm-logo is a regular world-writable list without any moderation for now.
It is also non world-readable to be SPAM-less (very hopefully).
So unless it is hard SPAMed (didn't happen yet) no control is needed.

I know Swirl is GPL'd, more simple backgrounds are probably free to use.

Hello,

My "WindowStyle" patch leads me to study the __simplify_style_list
function.

Here some possible amelioration:

1 - style name compatibility:

Example:

Style abc* options1
Style hop* options2
Style abc* options3

with options2 flags-inter options3 not empty. This is not simplified,
but as no window can match both abc* and hop*, in fact this can
be simplified to 

Style hop* options1
Style abc* merge(options1, option2)

The point is to write down a efficent algo for: given two pattern p1
and p2, decides whether there exists a string which matchs both p1 and
p2. I've done this.

2 - string matching sets inclusion 

Style hop options1
Style hop* option2

where options1 is a "flags-subset" of options2. This is not simplified
but as every string which match hop match hop*, this can be
simplified to

Style hop* option2

Again the point is to write down an efficient algo for: given two patterns
p1 and p2, decides whether all string which match p1 match also p2.
I should write this ...

3 - Upward simplification

Example:
 
Style * SloppyFocus
Style toc ClickToFocus
Style * NoIcon

is not simplified into:

Style * SloppyFocus, NoIcon
Style toc ClickToFocus

This type of case are easy to handle.


Any comments?

Olivier, Regards

The problem here is that it is easy to create a window that matches both
"abc*" and "hop*".  xterm -class abc -title hop

I suppose the second pattern may be also "ho*", "h*" or "*".
This seems to be safe simplification.

This seems to be safe simplification too.
I.e. it is safe to move any style entry with some flags down or up
through all style entries not containing these style flags.

Ooops, yes this simplification was stupid.

transparency + FvwmWinList:

I'm trying to use as much transparency as possible (similar to the Crystal 
theme), this includes using transparency with the FvwmWinList module.  I find 
that it often uses the wrong window names/titles in the list.  Sometimes an fvwm 
restart can fix this (most often not).  Fully login out of X and then back in 
sometimes fixes it (more often than an fvwm restart).  Basically the behavior is 
FvwmWinList will use window names of windows that have WindowListSkip in their 
Style to replace window names that sjould be in the list.  For the record, I've 
never seen this happen when not using transparency.  I've only seen this when 
Fvwm starts.

transparency with title bars:

Transparent title bars can often get locked into a particular portion of the 
background.  No matter where you place the windows they maintain them same 
portion of the background.  This can happen when Fvwm starts or after some use 
of the WM.

Transperent title bars sometimes show the given background color and do not do 
transparency.    This can happen when Fvwm starts or after some use of the WM.

transparency with FvwmButtons:

The same sticking image problem can happen as with title bars.

transparency with FvwmPager:

Not sure if this is transparency related, but sometimes FvwmPager just doesn't 
start or it wont swallow into Buttons.  I've never seen this w/o transparency.

My .fvwm2rc is attached as "fvwm2rc.jyg"

thanx,

jason

transparency + FvwmWinList:

I'm trying to use as much transparency as possible (similar to the Crystal 
theme), this includes using transparency with the FvwmWinList module.  I find 
that it often uses the wrong window names/titles in the list.  Sometimes an fvwm 
restart can fix this (most often not).  Fully login out of X and then back in 
sometimes fixes it (more often than an fvwm restart).  Basically the behavior is 
FvwmWinList will use window names of windows that have WindowListSkip in their 
Style to replace window names that sjould be in the list.  For the record, I've 
never seen this happen when not using transparency.  I've only seen this when 
Fvwm starts.

transparency with title bars:

Transparent title bars can often get locked into a particular portion of the 
background.  No matter where you place the windows they maintain them same 
portion of the background.  This can happen when Fvwm starts or after some use 
of the WM.

Transperent title bars sometimes show the given background color and do not do 
transparency.    This can happen when Fvwm starts or after some use of the WM.

transparency with FvwmButtons:

The same sticking image problem can happen as with title bars.

transparency with FvwmPager:

Not sure if this is transparency related, but sometimes FvwmPager just doesn't 
start or it wont swallow into Buttons.  I've never seen this w/o transparency.

My .fvwm2rc is attached as "fvwm2rc.jyg"

thanx,

jason

I will take a look at this pb but you start your module as

> Module FvwmWinList
> Module FvwmButtons

This is not a good idea (as the man pager says). This should be

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmBacker
+ I Module FvwmTheme
+ I Module FvwmWinList
+ I Module FvwmButtons

I think that these stick images problem come from your FvwmBaker
config:

You should use the "--retain-pixmap" option of fvwm-root

Do you have any error msg (X stderr) or a core dump file when this
happen?

Some others remarks on you config.

First you do not always define the bg color in the Colorsets. This
causes fvwm to compute the "average" color of your root pixmap. If
you do not want this for a colorset define the bg color (this speedup
colorset loading). 

> ModulePath /usr/libexec/fvwm/2.5.7

This line is not useful and cause pb when you upgrade

Please replace any line of the form:

*FvwmThemes: Colorset

by

Colorset

and be sure you do not start the FvwmTheme module.

Marcus, I mailed ya a tarball a few days ago of all the files you'd
require off-list - hope you got it.

Yeah saw that.

Sounds good.

Yeah, this is where I get lost.  I haven't looked at how other
applications do it as this might be a source of enlightenment (you
might consider doing that).  Unless I'm misunderstanding you though,
I don't see why you'd care to know the TextLength.  The way I view
this (and I could off mark here), one could simply right-align the
glyphs and draw them on top of each other (order should not matter).
The glyphs should be designed in such a manner so that superimposing
these composing glyphs remains within the realm of self-alignment (any
overlap ought to be considered a fault of the font file and not of the
superimposing process).

Regards,

 - Nadim

An update on an old problem.

I was able to easily recreate Larry's problem on a new Solaris 8 build that
had older Solaris patches than I normally run, despite the fact that my PGX
is a double-buffered FFB2+ with Z-buffer.

Long story short:  I fixed my problem by installing Solaris patch 108606-31,
which patches the PGX (m64) device driver.  Patch 108606-31 appears to be
publicly available from sunsolve.sun.com.

Larry, if you're still having the problem, run:

   showrev -p | grep 108606

If you're not up to at least version 30, the patch should take care of it.

Regards,
Gregg Dameron

Hi Xavier,

The perllib interface (upon which FvwmTabs is built) is rather new, so
it's only available in the 2.5.x series. To make FvwmTabs work in the
2.4.x series would involve back-porting most of perllib to 2.4.x. I think
this would be a bit premature at this stage as perllib is a work in
progress. (ie. there are still sections of unimplemented code.) Perhaps
Mikhael can comment?

I'm not sure what your reasons are for sticking with 2.4.x releases. If
you're worried about stability - don't be, 2.5.x is quite stable.

SCoTT. :)

just because i wanted to use packages. (running debian here.)

well, thanks for your answer, continue on the good work,
and don't waste energy on backporting !

i'll just use the source.

thanks again,

It should be done neither before nor after 2.6.0.  Given the state
of the function execution code, that would yield *horrible*
performance.

I don't know about your hope, but the chance that I do is zero. It

I tried various acroread versions on both 2.4.16 and 2.5.7 and

Does fvwm leave a core file?  If so, please fetch a stack trace
and post it at fvwm-workers:

  $ gdb fvwm core

The CVS version now has --disable-gtk.

Done.

I leave that for Mikhael to do.

Hi Mikhael,

You must be a seasoned Perl/Tk hacker ... like me! :)

Attached is a second (still buggy, but much improved) attempt.

This version only shows 1 colorset & allows you to cycle through
them all. This eliminates these problems.

> * It is a bit slow. Yes, it creates 148 colored rectangles in my case,

SCoTTie has dual AMD1900 so he doesn't notice things like that. :)
This version should have much improved performance.

> * There is a problem with refresh, try to WindowShade the window.

Yes, I haven't worked out why this happens yet.

Enjoy!

SCoTT. :)

Hi,

I've noticed that in the development branch, the "Start" button from
FvwmTaskBar uses the same font as the unselected buttons. I thought that
it would be nicer if it used the selected buttons' font, and after
looking around in the code, I've seen that this is the author's
intention too. So, I've made a small patch that fixes things.

I also have another question: I would like to implement another "goodie"
for FvwmTaskBar, namely a CPU usage meter. Is anyone interested in such
a thing? Should I post the patches once they are ready?

Bye,
-=[david]=-

The reason of my hope is that the new version of the patch take in
account the reasons why you reject it. You give 7 arguments.  The new
patch handle arguments 3, 4 and 6. Moreover, I've worked on argument 5
and style list simplification has been improved.  About 1 and 2 I can
just say that I do not _think_ that the patch can cause instability.
Finally, I do not understand argument 7.

But, maybe the most important is that there is 4 votes for the
patch (Dan, Mikhael, Olivier and Tim) and one vote against (Dominik).
So, I think we should apply the patch.

Regards, Olivier

I have applied the patch.

Apart from the fact that fvwm-2.5.x is in feature freeze at the
moment, we are always interested in patches.  In this specific
case, I somewhat doubt that it is possible to write a *portable*
CPU meter.  Keep in mind that fvwm code has to compile and run on
any UNIX system and Cygwin.

Nothing on earth can make me agree to adding huge features in
feature freeze.

As I said before, I reject making facts now that can never be
changed again.  The way the style list works has always been a
mistake.  No matter how much time you spend on optimising the
style list code, it will always be a memory leak.  This logic is
due for replacement, not for expansion.

It has already consumed much time in pointless arguments that
could have been spent stabilising the code.  There is a direct
relationship between my motivation to work on the remaining
problems and the amount of distractions on this list that have
nothing to do with it.

> Finally, I do not understand argument 7.

It's an ad-hoc syntax that *will* be thrown away right when we
start thinking.  I have many enhancements in mind that have no
chance of being implemented with this kind of just-throw-in-a-new-
command-whenever-it-seems-to-work-for-the-moment approach.

Of course Dan can speak for himself, but according to the mail
archive he did neither vote for nor against the patch.  Not that I
think it matters.

> So, I think we should apply the patch.

Then take the consequences and abandon the idea of a stable 2.6
release.

IMHO it would be great if you could implement the 
swallowing-functionality from FvwmButton in FvwmTaskBar. With this you 
could include any tool like aload, mixers, FvwmPager(!), etc. in the 
taskbar. (I tried to use FvwmButton as a taskbar, but this is very 
complicated.)

FvwmButtons with a swallowed FvwmIconMan already does a very good
job of emulating a task bar.  It would be much easier to just
provide a taskbar-like config for FvwmButtons.

Ok.

Does anybody have a good and general solution for this that could be 
provided e.g on fvwm.org as a partial configuration example?

Hi,

I have a patch lying around here (for a few months now) which adds an 
option to FvwmButtons for customizing the relief (flat/raised/sunken) for both
states. Do you suggest i polish it and send it through now, or should i wait 
for 2.7 ?

cheers,
Remko

Full_Name: E. Weber
Version: 2.4.14
CVS_Date: 
OS: red hat linux 8.0
X_Server: Xfree86, Exceed
Submission from: (NULL) (53.122.197.194)


The problem appears while using Motif (version 2.2.3) option menus under
FVWM2 with the  Focus Follows Mouse option. (It doesn't appear with fvwm1
or with Click To Focus option).
Selecting option menu entries twice or more the option menu looses focus.
The related window is still the active window, but there isn't a focus in
the whole window. 
Focus reappears as the mouse is moved out of the window and in again.

The problem seems to be caused by calling XmAddWMProtocolCallback for Atom
WM_TAKE_FOCUS.
Reproduction of the problem can be done with the following code: 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <Xm/RowColumn.h>
#include <Xm/RowColumn.h>
#include <Xm/Protocols.h>
  

void emptyCB(Widget widget, XtPointer clientDaten, XtPointer aufrufDaten)
{}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	XtAppContext kontext;
	Widget	applShell;
	Widget  box, option_menu, menu, button1, button2;
	int ac=0;
	Arg al[64];

	applShell= XtAppInitialize( &kontext, "focustest", (XrmOptionDescRec*)
NULL, 0, &argc, argv, (String*) NULL, (Arg*) NULL, 0);
  	box= XtCreateManagedWidget("box", xmRowColumnWidgetClass, applShell,
(Arg*)NULL, 0);
  	option_menu = XmCreateOptionMenu ( box, (char *) "option_menu", al, ac
);
	menu = XmCreatePulldownMenu ( option_menu, (char *) "menu", al, ac );
	button1 = XtCreateManagedWidget("button1", xmPushButtonWidgetClass, menu,
(Arg*)NULL, 0);
	button2 = XtCreateManagedWidget("button2", xmPushButtonWidgetClass, menu,
(Arg*)NULL, 0);

	XtSetArg(al[ac], XmNsubMenuId, menu); ac++;
	XtSetValues(option_menu, al, ac);
	XtManageChild(option_menu);
    
	Atom  wm_take_focus = XInternAtom( XtDisplay( applShell ),"WM_TAKE_FOCUS",
True );
   	XmAddWMProtocolCallback( applShell, wm_take_focus,  emptyCB,
(XtPointer) NULL );
  
	XtRealizeWidget(applShell);
	XtAppMainLoop (kontext);
}

Hello,

Once again fvwm support for java swing applications is plain bad.
I installed the following from Sun's site:

j2sdk-1_4_1_02-s1studio_ce-4u1-bin-linux.bin

The buttons at the bottom do not even show up, but they do with any other
window manager (such as window maker). Last year I also had a problem with
fvwm not setting the correct size of launched applications on startup.
Another time I had a problem with a Qt application not rsponding
well to resize events: the problem was fixed under sawfish, but
persists under fvwm. So, I don't know what fvwm is doing differently,
but it's doing something wrong. Blame it on Java, but every other
WM out there does it right. Just try to install the above from
Sun's site.

Regards,

Neil

Let us have a look at the patch; then we can decide.

Hi,

This makes a nice "+" button for a window decoration.
I thought you might want to add it to the website.
It's from the default fvwm config from SuSE 5.2.

ButtonStyle 3 13 20x60@1 20x40@1 40x40@1 40x20@1 60x20@1 60x40@0 \
80x40@1 80x60@0 60x60@0 60x80@0 40x80@0 40x60@1 20x60@0

gif image of a window is attached.

Yep, it is sorta nice, I'll add it but it might take a while.
I'm curious, what does a + button do?

A while back I volunteered to handle any logo submissions while
Uwe and Mikhael were on vacation.

I never did find the mailing list
on the sourceforge site so I have no idea whether there have
been any submissions.

I apoligize for being too stupid to find something that is probably
pretty obvious.  If there are any submissions, I guess they'll just have
to wait.  I'm sort of on vacation myself.

It's fvwm, it can do anything you want it to:-).
I use it to toggle whether or not a window is sticky.

That's because the mailing list is invisible.  You need to be a
member of the project to see it.  You need to register a sf
account, then tell me your user name.

It is not a huge feature, it is one of the few features that fvwm miss

I will say that this has almost nothing to do with the WindowStyle
cmd. This is a general problem regarding styles. Any way, I will
be interested to see a natural situation where the style list
go to infinity (with a fixed number of names).

I do not see the problem. If I follow your logic the Style command
will drastically change. Moreover, I cannot imagine that we
rework the style stuff and that at the end it will be not possible
to set "window attributes" on a given window.

In general Dan does not vote. He gives arguments. At the end there is
no arguments against. But yes it is possible that Dan use abstention.

Here what was the problem:
 
NoIcon and animation enabled in the TaskBar. If the TaskBar is shaded
when you (de)Iconify a window the animation proceed as if the TaskBar
was not shaded. Various solutions:

1. Unshade, animate and shade (the solution I've just committed).
2. Animate but take in account the shaded geometry of the TaskBar.
3. Do not animate at all (I do not like this solution).

I've used 1 as it is the "simplest" solution and it is fun (if the
user want animation he get a triple animation). 2 seems to be a
reasonable alternative.  Note that IconMan, IconBox and WinList have
this problem and that the case of a swallowed Icon{Man,Box} into a
FvwmButtons should be handle too.

Any advice before I continue to fix this problem?

Regards, Olivier

Looking at the patch, I agree, its not huge.

I don't agree that the Style code is fundamentally broken.
But I know from past experience that Dominik's standards are
higher than mine.  To me, the style code does the job
so I don't see a problem with it.  The way matches work
may seem odd, but I don't think there's a better way.

I don't understand the comment about the memory leaks.
I remember Dominik doing some work to combine styles as they
were issued.  There shouldn't be any leaking going on.

I agree with Dominik, my vote hardly matters.
As I said before, I think votes should be in proportion to contribution.

In this case, I've been agreeing with both sides.
Dominik has some very good points.
I don't agree about the Style code being a problem and therefore
shouldn't be extended, but I do agree that we need to freeze
features to create a stable release.

I think Oliviers point about this nicely rounding out
the feature set, and not being a big change is
very good.  Also, he supplied test cases, so
it shouldn't hold back 2.6 on that account.

I don't want to put words in Dominiks' mouth, but I think
he's been pretty clear, he doesn't want this patch applied.
See his sentence above about motivation.

Considering Dominik's strong opinion, it might be a good idea
to hold that patch for a while.
Use your judgement.

Did I vote?

I guess I should, even if it doesn't count for much.

Damn, I can't make up my mind.
I give up, I was hoping I could come up with some argument
or line of reasoning that would settle this, but I admit,
its beyond me.  I'm not going to vote.

Try to see the other persons viewpoint and then ask yourself,
can I give in on this a little for the sake of the team.

Well, FvwmGtk and FvwmGtkDebug are different stories.

There is actually nothing bad with FvwmGtkDebug installed. It is just a
perl script. It does not require GTK+ in the installation time, only in
the running time (and only indirrectly using Gtk perl package). So one
may install fvwm and then Gtk-Perl in this order and FvwmGtkDebug will
work. This can't be said about FvwmGtk.

The same reason here. There is nothing bad in installing FvwmWindowMenu.
It is just a perl script. So one may install fvwm and then perl in this
order and FvwmWindowMenu module will work.

We don't have 30 options for installing our 30 modules.

I am not sure having the same man pages installed on all user systems is
a mistake, but I have no strong preference here.

The invisible list only affects the way one sees archives, otherwise it
is a normal list that may be subscribed/unsubscribed at:

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fvwm-logo

I see that for some time now list archives are integrated into the SF
project pages (archives were external), so probably SF login is required
now, but then it is SF bug, only subscription login (using email address)
should be required for invisible lists.

Anyway, seeing archives is not required to answer messages. :)

The list is not moderated, anyone may write to it. So if you don't see
messages there are no ones. :) Actually there were several, I hope Uwe
will process them when he has time (not urgent).

Mikhael.

Am I just missing something (it seems clear in the man page), or I am right in 
believing that TaskBar is always horizontal?  If this is so, how can it be a 
true replacement for WinList?

(Even MS Windows can do a vertical icon bar ;)

Try now, but this time login at the left when it says about restriction.

You may change your subscription details online using the subscription
password that MailMan sent to you initially, or request sending the

Yes, you are right.

It can't :-)  The only feature FvwmButtons + FvwmWinList is
missing that FvwmTaskBar has is limiting the width of the window
buttons.

I didn't say your vote hardly matters.  I said the difference
between abstaining and voting for the patch hardly matters in
this specific situation since most people seem to be mad about
committing the patch anyway.

Really, I think once voting has become arguing it isn't worth the
effort anymore.  The idea was to reach a consensus while in
feature freenze or even code freeze.  But this requires talking
with each other.  We have not done this in a long time, and
frankly, because of the events around the licensing argument, I
can not stand to talk with some of the people here anymore.
All that still can happen in this thread is to alienate me even
further from the project.

I'm almost done now with the implementation of superimposing combining
characters.
I wonder why the function "FlocaleDrawUnderline" doesn't call
FlocaleEncodeWinString (to perform BIDI and so on).
Or did I misunderstand the code?

Is it possible to use Xft with Xnest.
I use to Xnest to debug FVWM when developing. I was about to try my patch
with Xft fonts. But I get this message:

Xlib:  extension "RENDER" missing on display ":1.0".

And all title bars appears empty. I tried using the line:
Style	*	Font 	xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14

from the man page. It doesn't indicate that the font is missing, and if so
wouldn't it use a default font?

Hm. That shouldn't be a problem. Maybe the first versions of Xft, but
current versions and a while back can use RENDER to speed up
antialiasing but work without.. I use it at work on the Solaris boxes
which doesn't have a new enough X server to have RENDER..

What version of Xft are you using?

I just installed Xft 2.
xft-config says
2.0.0

but when I run configure (for FVWM), I get this:

checking for xft-config... /usr/local/bin//xft-config
checking for Xft - version >= 2.0.0... no
*** The Xft test program failed to run.  If your system uses
*** shared libraries and they are installed outside the normal
*** system library path, make sure the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
*** (or whatever is appropiate for your system) is correctly set.

and if I run "which xft-config" from the command line, I get:
/usr/local/bin/xft-config

So, shouldn't it work?

Probably a bug ... I never test underline with "non standard"
strings.

OK, I'll take a look at it.
I guess we need to translate the positions from the original string to the
corresponding positions in the new string.
There is the ability to do so in FriBidi (I used it keep track of the
positions of the combining characters.
So I guess I'll add a the ability for FlocaleEncodeString to give back
such an array mapping the positions, and then use that to to draw the
underline.

Should I put this in todo-2.6 as a "normal bug" (section B)?

> What is "vfolders XML Category description"?

On the current redhat distribution (and I've no idea which others, but
I guess anything keeping with the everchanging gnome2 landscape),
the .desktop files include an extra piece of meta-information.  For example,
my gnu-emacs.desktop contains the line:
	
	Categories=TextEditor;Development;X-Red-Hat-Base;Application;

Then, .menu files  a menu structure is defined, with each submenu defined
by a set of categories which can be ANDed and NOTted together, in the style
of Apache XML configuration.

/usr/share/applications has no subdirectories, so I end up with a flat menu
list that is about twice the height of my desktop, and doesn't split into 
multiple columns.

All the best,

Matt

Yes, fvwm-menu-desktop should be rewritten to support "vfolders"
and the "new" spec (http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/desktop-entry-spec/).
I've not the time to do this. Sorry.

Obviously, the instructions in the DEVELOPERS file for
regenerating the AUTHORS, NEWS and man pages for the web site are
out of date.  But what are the correct instructions?

Each of the directories faq/, authors/ and latest_news/ (I want to
rename it to news/) contains its script that should be used like:

  news2php < ../../fvwm/NEWS > index.php

I will regenerate these pages now (after some script rearrangements).

There are some parts of the patch I do not understand or that are
bugs.

1) In menu_tear_off():

	ms = menustyle_find(buffer);
	if (!ms)
	{
		/* this must never happen */
		fvwm_msg(
			ERR, "menu_tear_off",
			"impossible to create %s menu style", buffer);
		free(buffer);
		DestroyMenu(mr, False, False);
		return;
	}

Is there a specific reason why you use menustyle_find() instead of
"MR_STYLE(mr_to_copy) " which is much simpler and can not fail?
Even if there is a reason, I don't think you can return from the
function.

2) In clone_menu_root_static():

What is the logic of changing

	MR_COPIES(dest_mr) = 0;

to

	MR_COPIES(dest_mr) = 1;

?  Was it a bug?

3) This is a bug:

	do_menu_close_tear_off_menu(pmp->menu, *pmp);
	pmret->rc = MENU_ABORTED;
	discard_window_events(
		MR_WINDOW(pmp->menu), EnterWindowMask);

do_menu_close_tear_off_menu() destroys the MR_WINDOW(pmp->menu)
and thus discard_window_events() operates on a random Xid.

4) Please name all functions exported in menustyle.c
"menustyle_something()".  (I renamed copy_menu_style() to
menustyle_copy()).



Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Sorry it is:

http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec.html

Also

http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/menu/draft/menu-spec/menu-spec.html
http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/basedir/draft/basedir-spec/basedir-spec.html

should be taken in account
