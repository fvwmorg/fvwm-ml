Please supply a patch against the current CVS code (diff -u prefered).
BTW, since 2.3.10 there is no 'BORDESRSTYLE' macro anymore, so if you
want the code to be executed, you should remove the ifdef.

I'm puzzled.  I *did* commit geometry.[ch] and I *did* add it
to the Makefile.am in the fvwm directory.  If I hadn't committed
it I wouldn't see it here at work (I created it at home).
Unfortunately I have no CVS access for a few days.  Can somebody
else look into this problem, please?  If necessary I can provide
the latest files via mail.

Bye

The close_fifos() function was indeed called twice, I guess once
when fvwm signaled shutdown to the modules and once when
FvwmCommandS got the dead pipe signal.  I wonder if any other
modules might have the same bug.

I'va attached a patch.  Could someone please apply it?

ChangeLog:

1999-12-01  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

* FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS.c (close_pipes):
prevent multiple call of this function to prevent core dump

Hello,

May be it is a story of memory corruption. I recall the story:
Nadim Saeed and me noted random crashes of the TaskBar and of WinList.
The errors were of the kind mentioned above and came from the SendFvwmPipe
of these modules. So, I took the SendFvwmPipe of IconMan put it in the 
library (libs/Module.c) and do so that any module that used the
SendFvwmPipe function (bad function any way ???) use the one of the
library. This modification fixed the random crashes of the TaskBar and of 
WinList. Now, we 've got new crashes ...

I am not a specialist of memory allocation but my intuition is that
we have such a problem in libs/Module.c (SendFvwmPipe).
I suggest that some one that know really something about memory
allocation take a look to SendFvwmPipe (moreover, I am at work and
do not have cvs access at the present time). 
It seems to me that the memory allocation logic in SendText is better than
in SendFvwmPipe.

Olivier

You only added geometry.c, not geometry.h .. fixed now..

Hi -- 

	I'm finally back from the badlands of Glibc conversion, and trying to
catch up on what's changed.

	The Pager seems to be hopelessly confused these days.

	First, there's a problem that I believe is the same as reported in
PR#512. A Button-1 click on a different desktop in the Pager moves you
to the appropriate page,but always on Desk 0. I've found that if you
Button-3 click (move without snapping to a page boundary), you do get
moved to the correct desk. After that, the Button-1 click behaves
normally, switching both desk and page - until you return to Desk 0.
Then it reverts to the buggy behavior again.

	Secondly, the Pager seems - randomly - to miss the DeskTopScale
command, and to appear at whatever its default size is. I like a small
pager tucked neatly in the lower right-hand corner of my desktop, so I
specify

*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 40

but I routinely get a much larger Pager. I tried several Restarts, and
it would appear large a couple of times, then suddenly decide to assume
the correct dimensions, then large, then small, and so on. Once it even
appeared ultra-tiny, almost as though it had applied the scaling factor
twice.

	I'm not sure how the Restart logic is affecting this, but from my
limited experiments it always appears large when I do a cold start.


Cheers,
Bob

	geometry.[ch] are definitely in the repository - I did builds from CVS
on both 11/29 and 11/30 with no problem. Is there possibly a problem
with building the snapshots?

Are you absolutely sure we're talking about the latest CVS version?
I'm sure that I fixed that bug about ten days ago.

Tim wrote a bug report for this a while ago.  I don't remember the
details, though.

I took a glance at both SendFvwmPipe an SendText and both seem to be
handling memory correctlly. Was there something specific you saw or just
stepping through your problem and this was the next step?

I am ok with you: SendFvwmPipe seems to handle memory correctly.
But I think that the errors that Giuseppe Della Ricca have come
from SendFvwmPipe and when I see a message like:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module(0) command is too big
(536863056), limit is 1000

I imagine that a crazy thing has been sent to fvwm2, so ...

But I've almost no experience in C programming, so I ask someone
to do something by giving MHO. Moreover, it seems that this problem
is machine specific ...

My idea is to do something more safe than:

  const char *hold = message;
  const char *temp;

by allocating memory to these pointers even if in *theory*
this not useful ...
But, I do not want to do things that I do not understand.

	The recent changes in the border drawing code make my setup look really
awful. I've put a tarball with some screen shots and the pertinent parts
of my .fvwmrc at

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmBadBorders.tar.gz

If I need to make changes to my setup because of the code changes, I'm
open to suggestions - as long as I can produce the same result I had
until a few days ago.

	I think some changes made in events.c a couple of weeks ago cause a
problem for file managers of the xfm family - they no longer seem to
detect double clicks with Button-1, which is how you navigate through
the directory tree.

	I've found that if I hold down the Alt (Meta) key while double
clicking, the clicks get through. Does anyone have any idea what's
happened here?

Well since Giuseppe is the only one who has seen the problem thus far, I
would suggest he put an fprintf in SendText so he can see what message
is cossing the error.  Looking again at the error string it looks more
like 536863056 would be a window id, not a strlen, and I'm not sure how
that would have happened.

How large (how many bits) is an unsigned long on Alpha?  Is it 32 or 64
bits?

I looked for, but can't find, a message I sent almost a year ago; it
_could_ be causing the problem if the Alpha compiler has a 64-bit long
but 32-bit int.  Maybe.

The problem is that our Send functions are now variadic (like
SendPacket()), and the variable arguments are expected to be of type
unsigned long.  But sometimes the arguments we pass to these functions
are just "int"; since we are using a variadic prototype there's no
automatic integer promotion.  In a correct ANSI C program we have to
cast all these arguments, but we're not.

This might be completely off the wall; it just popped into my head
again.

	I was going to suggest that, since it seems to be machine dependent,
you should look at the discrepancy between HandleModuleInput, which uses
plain old int variables, and SendText, which plugs the window id and the
length into the data stream as unsigned long ints. You're right, that
does look like a window id!

I have a Digital OSF1  V4.0 1091 alpha at work. Here the machine limit:

Maybe some of these limits depend on the kernel compile time
options.
I have just tried 2.3.10 (first time I test an alpha version at work, I don't
want to have problem with my sysadm, neither work to much on fvwm2 here).
The point is that no module work (I use fvwm2rc-sample). Either nothing
happen or the process is on but no module on the screen and fvwm2 is 
locked, I have to kill the module process to unlock fvwm2 ...
No error message, no core file ...

It seems that we have to do that ...

Using Tru64 Unix and Compaq C (which comes with it), unsigned longs are 64
bits.  As far as I know, this has always been the case.  This is also the case
with gcc 2.95 (I just checked).

Hmm.  We might have a bigger/different problem.

I _think_ most of the packet encode/decode stuff is based on the
assumption that we are sending 32-bit quantities of data.  If a long is
64 bits, we may have larger problems than just throwing a few casts in
there...

It's been more than a year since I looked at that but we may need more
fundamental changes--either allow the elements of the package to be as
large as a long, regardless of how large that is, or use a typedef like
eint32 or something to mean "an int exactly 32 bits" and have configure
or somesuch work out what the right type for that would be (the new ANSI
C spec has some kind of int_types.h standard header which is supposed to
define lots of stuff like this, but I'm not that familiar with it yet).

Hello,

*FvwmPagerSolidSeparators does not seem to be working with fvwm 2.3.10.
The lines still appear as dahed lines instead of solid lines:

Here is the code fragment from my system.fvwm2rc config file:

Then you are most likely not really running 2.3.10.  Do you have an
older version of FvwmPager in your path perhaps?

Hm, I don't know how window id's look on other X servers, but
with XFree I always get something like

  0x0?000???

but 536863056 in hex is 0x1FFFE150 which doesn't fit at all into this
scheme.  Of course this might depend on the X server.

Bob, can you convert the images to a format that preserves
the exact colours?  The images are speckled with atrifacts
when I view them with xv, so I can't discern if what you are
seeing is a bug or what I intended with the border patches.

Bye

Yes, I rewrote part of the decor code to make it work with rxvt's
transparency.  I'm quite sure there are several binding problems
cause by the introduction of the new decor_w (it has the size of the
frame and is the parent of all decorative sub windows).  Bob, could
you try to debug this?  I've got no time at all right now.  I've
noticed the same with XNest but thought it was a XNest bug:
My double click bindings on windows inside XNest running fvwm
don't work either.

I noticed this yesterday when I was trying out the latest CVS
(2.3.11). Firstly, there seems to be an undocumented extra button
style FvwmIconMan*iconbutton, with a default value of
"flat". (Explicitly setting the value to "up" works fine.) What I see
is:

(a) Iconify a window that (according to the Icon Manager) does not
    have keyboard focus. The Icon-Manager initially draws the button
    in the up-style, although it is redrawn correctly when you pass
    the mouse over it.
(b) Select (but do not deiconify) an icon: the icon's Icon-Manager
    button is drawn in the "up" style. This style-error is *not*
    corrected by passing the mouse pointer over the button.

On a possibly related note, I also see that the Icon Manager loses
track of which window currently has the keyboard focus if you transfer
focus to another window by clicking on the title-bar or border
decorations instead of the window itself.

Does anyone have a head-start on solving these bugs?
Cheers,
Chris.

	Seems like 'tis the season...  :-(

	I'll try to take a look at it this weekend, if I can figure out what
the change was.

	Hmm...sounds like you're stuck with a less than TrueColor visual: the
colors look pretty accurate on my machine (I used xv to create them).

	I can try to recreate them this evening, and save them as TIFFs, but
I'm afraid you'll have the same problem unless you can view them with a
TrueColor visual. Right now I've gotta run to catch a train into
Manhattan. Later....

I'm not sure I understand b so if this fixes that good, otherwise send

Well if you think about it just means you don't have enough windows
open.  A quick look through xlswins says that I have window ids in
the range of 0x0* to 0xe*.  Not to say that that particualr value is
a window id, I think I'm leaning more towards the 32 bit vs 64 bit
problem.

I don't care if the colours are wrong, but I can't use dithered pictures.
BTW, if you recreate the screenshots: I need to see the top borders
and the bottom borders of the two windows in your last screenshots.

Well, X doesn't support transparent windows.  That's the whole problem.
With all the work I and Geoff Wing spent debugging rxvt's transparency,
I guess you won't find a better implementation.  Eterm uses a different
approach, but that requires a third-party program (esetroot).

Don't mind about the individual changes, they're not going to change
back.  Try to track down what is happening with the Button... events
instead.  We've got to find out why single clicks pass through to the
application but double clicks do not.  I'm quite sure this problem
can be resolved within HandleButtonPress() alone.

Subject: *FvwmTaskBarMailBox

Full_Name: Marcel Landman
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.12
X_Server: X11R6
Submission from: (NULL) (195.224.86.173)


Short:
The option 

*FvwmTaskBarMailBox

wich works with a previous version (2.0.46) no longer works with 2.2.2.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed:
When I am running X as root, I want to see when I get mail (as user
marcel)
thus I have:

*FvwmTaskBarMailBox /var/spool/mail/marcel

which works on 2.0.46 but not on 2.2.2. FvwmTaskBar continues to look in 
/var/spool/mail/root, which is the default. All other options to the
taskbar
such as the name and icon for the start button are read, so I know for
sure
that the configurationfile (.fvwm2rc) is processed. In both cases I have 
FvwmTaskBar version 2.6 (or so it seems from the man page).

Olivier,

Thank you for the fast response and fix.  You really don't know how useful
something is, until you lose it.

Again, Thank you.

All,

With the last several beta versions of Fvwm, I've been having problems with
FvwmAuto.

It appears that the process just dies.  If I run a "ps" while FvwmAuto works I
can see the process, but if I run a "ps" when it doesn't work there is no
process to be seen.  I can restart it without any problems, but that is becoming
tiresome.

Is there anything I can do to help debug this problem?  No core file is created.

Thank you for any help/advise.

Bob

I've seen this too, _very_ intermittently (it's probably happened twice
to me so far).  No core and no messages in the log file.

I suggest you attach to a running FvwmAuto with gdb, set a breakpoint at
abort(), _exit(), etc., then continue and leave it, and keep working
normally.  Next time you notice FvwmAuto has died, go back to that xterm
and it should be stopped in the debugger; you should be able to get some
info about what is going on.

I think this is the result of the changes to the border relief drawing.
You are using FvwmBorder style ith a borderwidth of 5.  This used to
result in the border being invisible (5 pixels of relief and shadow).
What happens now is that you get a one pixel wide border and the shadow
or relief is thinner.  You can't do anything about this in the config
file.

Cheers,
Tim.

What are the problems that this solves?  I don't think we should be
adding stuff to fix bugs in other clients especially GPL ones under
current development.

Well, I grepped through my installed man page for FvwmIconMan for
iconbutton and found nothing. Maybe I've got an old version of this
page cached somewhere?

Problem (b) is not fixed by the above diff. All I'm doing here is
single-clicking on desktop icons. When I do this, the Icon Manager
button is drawn in the "up" style ... and I think I understand: the
button is suddenly drawn in "focusbutton" style instead of
"iconbutton" style, although it's still an icon button. Maybe we need
new styles "iconfocusbutton" and "iconselectfocusbutton" to clarify
the ambiguous cases?

Anyway: from my .fvwm2rc file:

The problem that most 'transparent' applications set
'CopyFromParent' background on all their ancestory to
get the transparent look.  In my eyes it's the only
sensible solution, but it doesn't work if the window
manager wants to set its own background in a direct
ancestor of a client window.  Hence I introduced the
decor_w.  Now the frame windows is neither visible
nor ever drawn into and rxvt can happily do whatever
it wants with the frame background.

Furthermore:

My patches for smooth windows shading w/ bottom titles and
smoother opaque resizing wouldn't have been possible without
the decor_w.

I've noticed that the M_FOCUS_CHANGE packet holds some weird
information that is probably completely useless:

 - if the focus change was caused by mouse interaction
 - the hilight colours

Can we safely scrap these arguments?

That's very bad. Clients should not draw in other windows. It will
always cause problems.

Well if the client want to be bad mannered and impose its ideas of
border appearance it could shape it's top level window and fvwm would
shape its ancestors to match (shape it with a rectangle of the same size
as the client). e.g. oclock. Personally I would like to be able to
decode if the borders are there or not.

I'm concerned that this is going to add to load on the x-server.  There
are now three fvwm windows roughly the same size as the client instead
of two. Only one of them has the BackingStoreNotUseful flag set (rxvt
will load a pixmap into two of them and fvwm draws in the other) so the
server memory will go up 33%.

Fair enough, this is a good reason to keep it.  I hope this doesn't
drive you over the edge but smooth shading doesn't work perfectly with
shade windows.  Try oclock, the oddities are different with
titleattop/bottom.

If we are going to keep it I think we should put in some efforet to
ensure the load on the server is kept low. We could make the frame and
parent windows depth 1 since neither are visible.

Cheers,
Tim.

Nooooo! FvwmWinList uses the mouse interaction flag so that it can
accurately display the windowlist order.  I think the focus colours are
used by the pager by default. The bit that is useless in most packets is
the address of the fvwm window structure (word 5). This is what was
replaced by the focus type in M_FOCUS_CHANGE.

Cheers,
Tim.

And I can confirm that the pager uses the colors.  In fact I know quite
a few people that define different hilight colors for there windows and
like the fact that the pager reflects that color.

Well you are in fact focusing on the window when you select its icon,
so focusbutton would be the correct style to show here, I really didn't
want to have to right to more styles into the code.  So I think I'm
going to pole the workers list on a seperate thread to see what the
consesus is.

Shaping is no solution for terminal emulators since they don't
really want to be transparent but rather let the root background
show through.  Furthermore changing the shape of a window
is really *really* slow.

So, then let's set BackingStoreNotUseful for the frame window.  It's
*never* visible.  It should be possible to reduce the frame window's
memory consumption to the size of the structures on the X server.

8-) He, that's funny!  Does anyone know how to move the shape
mask?  Is there something like win_gravity for shapes?  BTW,
does anybody know where I can find documentation for the
shape extension?

Hm, if we make it depth 1 I think it's not possible to make
the background 'CopyFromParent'.

I'd like some opinions here.  I added, as was requested quite a few
times, an option to FvwmIconMan to control the style for Iconified
windows.  Now as Chris pointed out it can be quite confusing if you
also have icons else where on your desktop and select those, because
the IconMan will mark the window with the focus style instead of the
iconstyle.  His suggestion is to add two more options "iconfocusbutton"
and "iconselectfocusbutton".  And now that I think about I guess we will
need iconselectbutton as well.

I'm afraid that would begin to get a bit unwieldy for users to
configure.  Giving you 8 different button styles to set.  I could
default iconfocus to focus until it is explicitlly set and do the same
for iconselectfocus and iconselect.

Any thoughts here, comments?

Bob mentioned a problem that application double clicks don't work.
I know why this happens, but I can't figure out how to prevent it.
It's a very tricky problem with button grabs:

At the moment, the Parent window of the client window has established
a passive grab on all three buttons.  Now, when I press a button over
the client window, the parent grabs the button and fvwm gets the
event.  But at the same time a 'LeaveNotify' followed by an
'EnterNotify' event is sent to the client windows and thus to the
application that created it.  This Leave/Enter prevents the double
click detection.  I'm not sure how to prevent this.  Would it help
if fvwm selects ButtonPress on the client window?

What I want to do in the end is:

 - Grab all buttons on the parent window permanently.
 - If a button is pressed over the client, check if fvwm can use
   it.  If not it is passed to the client.  Otherwise the button
   press may or may not be passed to the client, depending on what
   fvwm actually did.  

I can't figure out how to do this.  The description of the
XAllowEvents() function in my Xlib manual is very foggy.  Can
someone explain the exact meaning of 'SyncPointer', 'AsyncPointer'
and 'ReplayPointer' in conjunction with '(A)Sync...' passed to
one of the XGrab... calls?

Bye

Paul (PDS), I've tried to compile with dmalloc, but I get a syntax
error in FvwmEvent.c when rplay.h is included.  Can you figure out
where the problem is?

8 sounds like too many. Personally I would reduce it to four: plain,
iconified, focussed and selected in order of increasing priority

if (button is selected)
  use select
else if (window is focused)
  use focus
else if (window is iconified)
  use icon
else
  use plain

It seems like a lot less pain than trying to come up with an orthogonal
set, besides that using a priority style would let us put in a style for
shaded windows with only one extra test rather than go to 16 options.

Cheers,
Tim.

which is how it stands now with the addition of focusandselected and I
would feel is sufficient, so Chris so far that is two votes in favor of
no more options and one vote in favor of more.

I think you misunderstood. What I meant that rxvt could create a filled
rectangle the same size as itself and shape itself with that.  It
wouldn't look transparent at all but fvwm would detect the shape and
remove the borders. I don't think it would be much slower as it would be
a very simple shape.

Anyway I think what rxvt is doing is wrong.  It should not be attempting
to alter the appearance of the window manager frame.  Users are quite
capable of typing "style rxvt handlewidth 0" if they want the frame to
be gone.

I've had a peek in the rxvt sources and it looks like setting the parent
win to depth 1 may fix the problem that decor_w fixes.  If it does would
you be happy about removing decor_w?

Cheers,
Tim.

Hello Dominik,
I am volunteer to add the following feature to FvwmButton panel:

"position +/-x+/-y"

which modify in a *relative* way the position of the panel

Also we may add a "buttonsborder" option which do
 
position +0+win_border for a down panel
position +0-win_border for an up panel
position +win_border+0 for a right panel
position -win_border+0 for a left panel

where win_border is the border width of the Buttons not of the
panel (need to add M_ADD_WINDOW | M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW in the message
mask).

So I ask for an "authorization" for such options (since we are not
far from feature freeze (I hope) and since you are the author of
the new (good !) panel implementation).

Three.

Let's rather keep it simple (or is anybody able to control all the
'dirty'-flags in icon man?).  If we make it even more complex we
won't be able to maintain icon man soon.

I don't know about you but I'm finding it dificult to follow even now,

Hmm, I tried compiling fvwm with dmalloc but I don't configure rplay so
I didn't see this.

Most likely there's a definition of a standard *alloc() or similar
function in rplay.h that's conflicting with the dmalloc.h file.  I'll
have to download rplay to check it out.

One thing that would work, very likely, is to move the #include of rplay.h
so that it's _before_ the <libs/fvwmlib.h> include.

Forget this, I've just tried and failed to get the client parent window
to be depth 1. decor_w lives.

The reason why I'm reluctant is that the code is already implemented
for menu position hints.  I don't like the idea of duplicating the
code.  If you make a try, please use a similar syntax.

Hm, funny idea.  But I definitely *want* a border on my 'transparent'
terminal windows.  On the other hand I don't use transparency because
I like to change my background pixmap from time to time.  Instead I
use a dimmed version of my standard background.

I don't think that rxvt was trying to annihilate the window
border.  It's just that is set 'CopyFromParent' on it's
ancestors so that the root background would be visible in
the client window.  Unfortunately we used the background
for a similar purpose.

Will the X server need memory for the parts of the frame/parent
that show through the client window because it uses 'CopyFromParent'?

I've changed the frame window to BackingStoreNotUseful.  Fvwm doesn't
draw into the frame window anymore.

Just as an aside you should try Eterm in conjuction with esetroot, it 
allows you transperancy with a shading wich gives a very nice effect.

Yes we probabbly should, that hadn't occured to me.  If you want you can
modify the packet and I can take care of modifying the pager code.

Hello,
I think that there some problems here (may be older than this commit).
One problem is that if the panel has some min width/height hints then
the firsts (or the lasts) setps of the sliding for a left/up panel may be
not has expected. Moreover, we may imagine other problem with width_inc
and height_inc. You may do some test with a multi desk FvwmPager as a Panel.
If you want I can try do somthing.

Dom, is there anyway to do "relocate m+0 m+0" instead of "move m+0 m+0" (I
know there is no such command), but what I'm getting at is I don't want to see
the window mapped and _then_ move it.  I'd like to just see the "rubberband"
and not the window itself - is there a way to do that ?  My old comma
separated function list used to function in that manner - sometimes :-)

In other words, I want to press on the FvwmWinList button and see a
"rubberband" of the said window ready to be moved without seeing the mapped
window right underneath it.

Would something like this make sense ?

  AddToFunc DeiconifyAndMove
  + i iconify off			# uniconify
  + i movetopage m+0 m+0		# relocate to current page (no mapping)
  + i move				# show rubberband and move window

Just tried it (without the m+ parts though, that's not implemented), it
still maps the window to the current page and then moves it - I just want
to bypass the mapping portion if possible - sorta like just move the
window's anchor and then move it with mapping it first.

Thanks for the help

Actually, my suggestion isn't 100% serious here ;-). It's just that
different styles for different window states are fine provided that no
two of those states can happen at the same time. Here we have "focus",
"selected" and now "icon", any one of which may apply to a single button
at any given moment. That's 8 possibilities (well, 7 because
unfocussed, unselected and non-iconified is "plain"). Add another style
and suddenly there are 15 possibilities. This gets unmanageable very
quickly.

Hopefully sent to the right bloody list this time.

I have been able to mostly catch up with real life and am actually looking
forward to a weekend with no pressing matters.  This means that I can do
some much needed infrastructure maintenance.

I will be changing xxx.fvwm.org -> www.fvwm.org soon; this should be
painless as the old site will still run while everyone's DNS expires the
old entries.

Can folks point me at other things that need taking care of?  I also want
to move the FTP and CVS servers, but this should all be transparent
(although CVS will have to go offline for a bit).

Feel free to play with it, but I don't think we'll get a nice solution
in FvwmButtons.  There are too many problems that will prevent it from
working properly with generic applications.

xxx.fvwm.org is current.  Nothing there should need any adjustment.

Hello,

I don't know how hard it is to implement it, but I think it looks very
nice and can be useful.

When I start moving a window - using the mouse or keyboard - all window
output seems to be blocked. Other windows can't get on the screen, the
top in an xterm stops refreshing and xclock doesn't tick anymore. Can't
fvwm2 still do the movement without blocking the other output?

Kind greetings,

Tung

I switched the web server over; it tests OK from here but you may have to
wait for the DNS to update globally.

If you have the bug tracker bookmarked, you will need to update them.
Currently Jitterbug is running on yyy.fvwm.org.

What release are you using?

Is this an Opaque move or a rubberband move?

The server must   be grabbed  during  an  rubberband move since    the
rubberbands are Xor-ed onto the background and would cause specs to be
left around if the server wasn't grabbed.  (I believe.)

I just tried  an Opaque move with the  latest CVS and my other windows
continued to update while the move was in  progress.  I don't remember
if this is a new feature, hence my question  about the release you are
using.

Fvwm2 has been handling opaque moves w/o grabbing the server for as long 
as I can remember.  It'd be great if someone could figure out how to use 
the overlay plane of X servers that have them to support drawing into
the overlay plane so that grabbing the X server would not need to be
necessary for rubberband moves, resizes, and other overlayed effects.

I'm used to the rubberband moves, because they seem to be drawn faster.
I didn't know the opaque move doesn't grab the x server. For the moment,
I will use the opaque move for "smaller" windows.

Thanks for the help.

     and using the fvwm cvs tree.

     You can download it at:
     http://www.arrakis.es/~carroj/FvwmModules/FvwmMod.html

     If someone with write access to the cvs tree can upload the
     sources into fvwm/modules/GFvwmDebug I will be very glad.


     Bye,

         JCT

Thanks for your feedback but I tried:

Style "Netscape: Find" GrabFocusTransient

as well as Style * GrabFocusTransient and Style * GrabFocus .
but it did not seem to do what I was looking for.

I would like the "Netscape: Find" window to have the focus as soon
as I pop it up so that I don't have to keep on moving the mouse
pointer back and forth.

Thanks for your help,

Best Regards,

Neil

Hello,

It seems like *FvwmPagerGeometry is still broken. For example the command

*FvwmPagerGeometry 115x79+3+3

gives me a pager size that is larger than the one I specify.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice if there were an option to FvwmPager so that one
could invoke FvwmPager -transient with mouse button 3 and be able
to move the viewport without having to reclick. Releasing the mouse
button would unpost the pager. The command

Mouse 3 R N Module FvwmPager -transient

does something similar but one has to clcik first, then move the pointer
to the viewport, and then click again, making the procedure a little bit
long.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice if there were an *FvwmPagerIgnore command so that if for
example
I wanted to prevent FvwmButtons and xclock from showing up in the pager
then I
could say:

*FvwmPagerIgnore FvwmButtons
*FvwmPagerIgnore xclock

etc...

Thanks,

Neil

I can only guess here, but I can remember a similar problem
with XEmacs.  Sometimes it happened that fvwm thought the
window was iconified although it wasn't.  The effect was
the same althought what you say doesn't sound like it.  Can
you try to download the 2.3.10 beta release and see if that
helps?

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.3.10.tar.gz

BTW, don't use it for production, it won't make your users
happy!

Bye

Dominik ^_^

The simple truth is: no.  If you move with the wire frame the only
way to make sure it can be undrawn again is preventing all other
screen output.  If you move windows opaque this limitation doesn't
apply.

Matt, I've finally applied your patches.  Can you please provide
a man page patch for the GnomeShowDesks command?

One of these days I'll have to get my GTK installation working, it
looks neat.  Since I don't have a working GTK enviroment, I wasn't able
to compile or test it (or apply it).

Watch out for this logic from main_window.c:

    case M_ICONIFY:
    case M_ICON_LOCATION:
    case M_DEICONIFY:
      {
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Application Id" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Frame Id" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+1) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Database entry" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+2) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "X icon position" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+3) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Y icon position" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+4) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Icon width" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+5) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Icon height" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+6) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "X window position" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+3) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Y window position" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+4) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Window width" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+5) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 strcpy( Property[0], "Window height" );
	 snprintf( Property[1], 256, "%u", *(pPacket->body+6) );
	 gtk_clist_append( GTK_CLIST( MessageInfo ), Property );	 	 
	 
      }
      break;

Iconify packets come in various lengths.  
Perhaps thats why body+3 thru 6 are used twice?
You will have to check
the length before reporting all the values.  Also in deiconify
packets the icon location information comes first.

There is one drawback: If you open the window with a mouse click
from a menu, the pointer and thus the focus (Mosue or Sloppy)
will immediately leave the newly mapped window again.  It
should work if you use the keyboard shortcut to open the window.
It should work too with ClickToFocus.

I assume you are referring to:

http://www.fvwm.org/mod_f2m_communication.html

Where it describes M_ICONIFY and M_DEICONIFY.

I can see how  you might  miss the part  about  the packets coming  in
different lengths and orders,  but it  is there.  I guess the variations
on M_DEICONIFY aren't that clear.

I don't think there is any one person that can tell  you about all the
packets.   I  got a deeper  understanding  of  the iconify  packets by
working on FvwmAnimate.

I think this is more of a Netscape bug, but maybe there's a fix in fvwm.

I'm using netscape 4.08:

When I start netscape4.08, the window comes up.  I have my first page
pointing to a company internal webpage that has a password on it.  However
it's a little slow to come up (maybe 1 second).  So I press the Bookmarks
button on Netscape to goto a new page.  However, then the webpage password
prompts come.  When this comes, I lose focus of everything and I can't
switch
windows or anything.  The machine is completely operational, all other
windows
continue to work properly, however, no focus and no mouse clicks, so I
can't
do anything.  Can this be fixed in the windowmanager, though it seems to
be
a netscape bug?  Telnetting into the machine and killing netscape allows
fvwm2 to work properly again.

I hope this isn't a duplicate...  I'm currently downloading 2.2.4 to see
if
it fixes the problem.

I've had similar problems with other programs, but I haven't been able to
reproduce it at all, so I haven't reported it.

I just noticed that the NEWS for the stable branch is not
available anywhere on the web page.  There's only a link
to the 2.3.x NEWS file.  We should provide a link from
the main 2.3.x page to the branch file too.

Bye

Wouldn't it be easier to just copy the 2.2.2 thru  2.2.3 news into the
2.3.x news file?

Wouldn't 1 file would be easier to understand?

If I'd be interested in the changes between 2.2.2 and 2.2.4, would I
be supposed to page over 430 lines of 2.3.x?  I think we should have
a place where you can see the diffs in the last stable release fast.
If this is a link to a certain position in the 2.3.x NEWS file I
have no objections.  Can this be done?

Your module isn't properly "autoconf'ed" yet.  I added it to
the Makefile.am in the modules directory locally, but it won't
compile because it looks for some header files

------------------------------------------------------------------------
make[3]: Entering directory `/home/domivogt/src/fvwm/modules/GFvwmDebug'
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../..  -I/usr/X11R6/include    -g -O2 -c module_main.c
In file included from /usr/local/include/gdk/gdktypes.h:33,
                 from /usr/local/include/gdk/gdk.h:31,
                 from /usr/local/include/gtk/gtk.h:31,
                 from module_main.c:8:
/usr/local/include/glib.h:66: glibconfig.h: No such file or directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course I don't have gdk installed, but that has to be handled
by configure so that the module isn't compiled it it's not there.
BTW, would it be possible to have a 'compatibility' version that
just dumps the packets to stdout if gdk is not installed?  Then
we can scrap the old FvwmDebug module.

Oops, I take everything back.  I do have gdk installed, but 
glibconfig.h is found at /usr/local/lib/glib/include/glibconfig.h.

I have noticed several bugs (screenshot in xwd format attached).

 1) The window is partially placed off screen when mapped first.
    The screenshot shows my entire desk (but I removed all other
    windows so that it's as small as possible).

 2) The menu bar is too big.

 3) The 'Property' filed is not wide enough.

 4) When I select 'Hide menubar', the complete module vanishes.
    It isn't visible in the process list but there's no coredump.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

	Hmm...I've found that if I use mousey-focus, the problem with xfm/moxfm
goes away. Dominik, I thought you were a mouse focus kinda guy. Do you
by any chance have the MouseFocusClickRaises GlobalOpt set? (I've also
found this to cause the same problem.)


Cheers,
Bob

Greetings and salutations:

My name is Joshua and I work at andover.net, the company that owns 
freshmeat.net.  My role here is basically that of community relations and 
although I'm not too well known among the developer community (because I'm not 
a developer myself), I have been advocating the use of, and actually using 
open source software in my role as project manager at various companies over 
the last 5+ years.

Basically, I'm writing to say 'hello', and to ask you a couple of questions...

We're thinking of adding some features onto freshmeat such as hi-bandwidth ftp 
and, say, CVS mirroring... If you don't mind, I'd really appreciate it if 
you'd take a few minutes and think about what kinds of things might interest 
you as a developer... In other words, what might andover/freshmeat do to make 
your life as a developer easier?  What can we do to help get more people 
contributing to your project, knowing about it, using it?....

I look forward to hearing from you, and if there's anything the 
andover/freshemat folks can do for you, just let me know!

Thanks for your time!

best wishes,

J.

Bob, I could narrow the problem down over the weekend.  It happens
exactly if buttons are grabbed in the setup_focus_policy() function
in add_window.c, i.e. if you use MouseFocusClickRaises or
ClickToFocus (plus I didn't care to remove the grabs if you switch
from ClickToFocus to Sloppy/MouseFocus).

My earlier guess that this might be caused by the excess Leave/EnterNotify
events proved wrong.  With xev I can verify that the window does indeed
get the double click, but for some unknown reason it doesn't interpret
it this way.  This seems to depend on the application: my rvxt windows
still recognize multiple clicks.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I searched Freshmeat.net for fvwm information and found this:

urls
                                   
 Download:
  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.2.2.tar.gz (573 hits)
Alternate Download:
  ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.2.tar.gz (97 hits)

Appindex Record:
  http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1998/12/04/912820069.html


Here are some updates:

Our latest non-beta is 2.2.4.  (Same location, different file name.)

Your alternate download site is the same site as the main site.
Our alternate sites are mentioned in our FAQ.  Here's one:

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/window-managers/

A better reference to our "Changelog" (NEWS) would be:

http://www.fvwm.org/generated/NEWS.html

Under "Appindex" I  see  the  current  development version listed   as
2.3.4, right now we are at  2.3.11 (2.3.10 is  the lastest beta).  (It
is  a  beta  and  not recommended for   use.)   We'd prefer  to direct
developers to our anonymous CVS.

It looks  like your announcements are  coming  in from various people.
Did you   subscribe to the fvwm lists,   or would  you like  copies of
announcments?

Which "gtk-config --cflags" and "glib-config --cflags" will tell you..
(CFLAGS = `gtk-config --cflags` ...)

Here's a little form to configure FvwmBacker
It provides 6 command lines (as described in "man FvwmBacker")
per desk. It requires 2.3.11 
Any number of desks can be configured, with Page x y and pixmaps etc...
Try it out, and if you like it, let me know.  If there's something wrong with it
PLEASE let me know!      :-)

<awol@dove.net.au>

P.S. Instructions for use are on the top of the form. Invoke it with
      Module FvwmForm FormFvwmBacker.

Someone check me  out on  this.   I  removed GFvwmDebug this   morning
because I  assumed  I was going  to   have building  problems,  then I
committed by mistake, then I put it back in.

But, I don't see the directory in the source tree after an update, and
the name "GFvwmDebug" doesn't seem to follow our naming conventions.

Sorry for the confusion.

Ho.

As I stated earlier, I made another GNOME patch, but I need some help to
make it work fully.. I need to update some things whenever a window
moves or something changes the fact which virtual page a window is on
(top left corner at least).

Is inside update_absolute_geometry() a good candidate to place it?

Well, I couldn't figure out how to set a simple breakpoint in gdb so I just ran
it and hoped that bt would give some useful info... Well it didn't.  Here is
what back trace reported:

(gdb) bt
#0  0xef439690 in _write () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
#1  0x11024 in _init ()
#2  0x10dd8 in _init ()
(gdb) 

I don't know if this is enough in information to help debug this problem or not.

As you can see, FvwmAuto dies at least three to four times daily.

To set a breakpoint in gdb, do a:

(gdb) break exit
(gdb) break abort

and that should do it. Then you give a

(gdb) continue

and wait for it to die on you... at *that* point a backtrace should be
informative (it'll show how FvwmAuto came to close). Incidentally, you
can always issue

in gdb. It actually is fairly helpful, I find. Otherwise there's

Dan, you (and anyone else) can create freshmeat account and change info
or announce any application (it is moderated).

I have updated an FVWM info (still not fully applied as of now) and
will announce 2.2.4 and 2.3.10 tomorrow if there are no objections.

Mikhael.

	OK, I put up a new set:

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmBadBorders2.tar.gz

There are a couple of differences (thanks to Tim for prompting me
actually to read my config!).

	I removed the extraneous TiledPixmap BorderStyles, which removes the
real grotesquerie. I had thought I had commented those out long ago;
they were vestiges of another style. They simply never showed up with
the earlier border drawing code, as Tim pointed out.

	This set shows 2 small windows (one highlighted) in their entirety,
before and after. It seems to me that with border widths of 5 pixels or
less, the right and bottom borders look to be all shadow and no relief,
at least in these examples.


Cheers,
Bob

GFvwmDebug is in modules/Makefile.am, but the sources are not in CVS.

You should really be more precise about the version you are using :-)
'these days' is a bit foggy for my taste.

Okay, just as I expected.  It seems the calculations are confused about
the width of some relief rectangles.  Unfortunately I don't get the
same borders with the config bits you sent.  Can you mail me your
complete config file, please?

No!  I can't answer your question unless you explain in detail
what you want to do.  The 'update_absolute_geometry()' function
is responsible for updating the absolute desktop position if the
frame has been moved.

Perhaps we shouldn't announce 2.3.10.  Its way too unstable.

There is a problem with specifying non-default DeskTopSize (3x3).
A pager calculates its geometry as if it were specified for this default
desktop size and then recalculates it for the real desktop size.

Here is a minimal rc file:

DeskTopSize 2x2
# Press Ctrl-Mouse3 on the root to get a pager
Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient
#*FvwmPagerGeometry 300x300+0+0

Here the pager immediately changes its size by 2/3.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Agreed.  2.3.10 in particular.
We haven't had a 2.3.x beta that I'd recommend.
Lately our CVS or snapshots is the only way to go.

I'd like to see the reference to 2.3.4 changed to point to the
CVS.

For more GNOME compliance I want to update an XAtom (XA_WIN_AREA) on a
window whenever it changes virtual page (calculated by the top left
corner of the window right now).

----8<----
  atom_set = XInternAtom(dpy, XA_WIN_AREA, False);

  val[0] = fwin->normal_g.x / Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
  val[1] = fwin->normal_g.y / Scr.MyDisplayHeight;

  XChangeProperty(dpy, fwin->w, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32, PropModeReplace,
      (unsigned char *)val, 2);
----8<----

This correct?

	Right. The problem with xfm/moxfm is that the grab for Parent has to be
released at the same time as the grab for decor_w (in DoSetFocus) - and
reinstated for the window losing focus. Unfortunately, from there on
it's just gotten more and more convoluted - I never realized what a
delicate balance this was. After "fixing" this as described, I found
that I could no longer catch the focus change click in the client
window, without putting a grab on frame as well. That almost works...now
I'm trying to figure out how I've messed up the focus click on the
decorations (e.g., I can't click-hold-drag on the titlebar, I have to
click-release-click-hold-drag).

	It's very definitely application-dependent - I have several others that
understand double-clicks; and, at least in the case of xfm/moxfm, what's
really happening is doubtless buried under layers of Xtlib cruft.

Bob

	What gives with the Pager lately? (Lately = since around the week
ending 11/13 - the last version I consider stable enough to do any real
work dates from sometime in that week.)

	As I noted on 1 Dec., the Pager also seems - most of the time - to
ignore DeskTopScale, except on random occasions when it decides to
notice it. I've also seen it size itself very small, as though it were
doing a double calculation as you suggest (my DeskTopSize is 4x4). And
I've seen it get so tiny I can't imagine *what* it's thinking. I can see
no pattern to it yet.

	I just discovered - by forgetting to change my ModulePath before
switching versions - that the current Pager works fine with the 3 or 4
week old version of FVWM (the Button1-won't-switch-desks problem also
disappeared). So, I tried it the other way around, and the old Pager
misbehaves the same way with the current FVWM. 

	So, what's changed recently in the FVWM core with respect to module
communication that could get the Pager so hopelessly confused?


Cheers,
Bob

Oh I think I see what rxvt is trying to do.  It sets CopyFromParent on
itself and all its ancestors and then does an XClearWindow on them all
when the root window pixmap changes.  I'm sure this is not the way to do
it.  It will fail if fvwm is run with a non-default visual option, and
it draws in the window managers windows. It doesn't work either. If I
use xv to set the root background rxvt doesn't notice until I move the
window.

All this is besides the point which is: fvwm should not be doing
anything to help or workaround bugs/features in rxvt.  That said it
looks like decor_w is useful for other things so let's keep it.

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't think so. It will just use the pixmap (which is shared among
many windows) to paint those areas when a refresh is needed.

OK

There should be no grab on the parent window anymore and the decor_w
has simply selected. The current method is summarised in the table
below (for ClickToFocus):

Frame            no grabs, not selected
  decor_w        selected
    title_w      no grabs, not selected
    left_w[]     no grabs, not selected
    right_w[]    no grabs, not selected
    button[]     no grabs, not selected
  Parent         no grabs, not selected
    client       grab all buttons

So you should never have to mess with 'Parent' or 'frame'.
I think all the grabbing in DoSetFocus is unnecessary now.
What happens if we remove thie grab/ungrab stuff there?

I think this is killing one of my programs. It's cutview (version 1.62)
and it fails if fvwm has grabbed meta-button 3:

Mouse 3 A M StrokeFunc EchoSequence Feedback DrawMotion

the error is:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
  Serial number of failed request:  645
  Current serial number in output stream:  646

In the cutview source is:

static char defaultTranslations[] = "<Btn3Down>: menu()";
XtTranslations trans_table;

I don't know Xt so I don't know if this is an Xt bug.

Cheers,
Tim.

        trans_table = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);
        XtOverrideTranslations(multi_buffer, trans_table);

Perhaps the fix in the gotoDeskAndPage_func() (virtual.c) is
responsible?

new code:

  if (is_new_desk)
  {
    UnmapDesk(Scr.CurrentDesk, True);
    Scr.CurrentDesk = val[0];
  }
  MoveViewport((val[1] * Scr.MyDisplayWidth), (val[2] * Scr.MyDisplayHeight),
               True);
  if (is_new_desk)
  {
    MapDesk(val[0], True);
  }

old code:

  if (Scr.CurrentDesk != val [0])                                               
  {                                                                             
    UnmapDesk(Scr.CurrentDesk, True);                                           
  }                                                                             
  MoveViewport((val[1] * Scr.MyDisplayWidth), (val[2] * Scr.MyDisplayHeight),   
               True);                                                           
  if (Scr.CurrentDesk != val [0])                                               
  {                                                                             
    Scr.CurrentDesk = val[0];                                                   
    MapDesk(val[0], True);                                                      
  }                                                                             

With this change the current desk is changed before the MoveViewport()
call instead of after it as it was before.  I'm not sur why this might
confuse the pager, though.  Can you try using the old code, Bob?

Isn't XA_WIN_AREA supposed to be set for the root window only?
As far as I understand this XA_WIN_AREA denotes the coordinates
of the currently visible viewport, not the coordinates of the
viewport where a window is located.  This wouldn't make any sense
with fvwm anyway.  If a window is halfway between two pages, which
coordinates would we use?  BTW, I don't have the spec handy, what
I say is based on the comments in gnome.c.

Probably not.  I guess it fails because two applications can't
have the same button grabbed on the same window.  Sigh, seems
I have to switch back to grabbing in Parent (==> Leave/EnterNotify
==> pager ballons flicker :( ).

I figured  that would be   happening, and it  looks like  Dominik  has
corrected it.

Jason,
  Wouldn't it save you work if you got  your snapshot build scripts to
send mail to fvwm-workers when theres a build problem?

I should probably do this; I'll deal with it as part of moving the snapshot
building process to a better machine.

Hello,

First of all forget the subject of this message :)
The subject is the new GnomeShowDesks function. I think there is
a problem here. The problem (IMHO) is not this function neither the 
patch of Matt (the gnome pager works find after you have discover the
GnomeShowDesks function in the source), but the way that fvwm deal 
with the situation: "fvwm compiled with --enable-gnome but not executed 
under a gnome-session"

With the current GnomeShowDesks implementation, even if you run fvwm
alone, you've got error if you go to an unknown desk for GnomeShowDesks
or if you open an app on an "unknown desk" (and the app can work in a
bad way: try xman). I'm sure that we can fix this, but in the future
we probably get similar problems.
My suggestion is to add a -gnome option to fvwm, if this option is not
set then all the "gnome functions" will simply return. Or better
can we detect if fvwm is executed via a gnome session ?   

Olivier

This is the problem I was talking about a while back.  From what I gathered
from the gnome sources, it's actually set for both the root window and
application windows.  (The failure to set it for application windows is why
everything appeared in the upper-left area of the desktop).  I wasn't sure
either, though, so I didn't follow up with any code...

	I believe the M_NEW_PAGE packet always came through with the current
desk in it before, so you've effectively no-opped the change in
virtual.c. Did you observe some improvement with this change?

	I haven't tried to follow the logic to see what happens if the Pager's
notion of CurrentDesk changes during this function, I merely suspected
that it was probably not a Good Thing. If you could confirm that it
produces undesirable results, then Dominik may feel more comfortable
with my changing virtual.c back to the way it was (well, this part of
it, anyway) this evening. Or at least I will.  :-)

	Of course, this begs the question of why we should bother having the
desk number in the packet at all, if it's always going to be the
"currently current" desk, but we can discuss that another time.


Cheers,
Bob

I am not telling it where to place, so I can not imaging what is wrong.

The window has a default size of 300x200 and the resize politic is not
handled properly, I will fix that.

The size of the columns can be changed just dragging, but I will set it
widder by default.

Hide menubar is not jet working, and to test I link that to the quit
function. My fault. :-D

Bye and thanks again.

Well I have copied the configuration from other module and tried to adapt.

Well that is a GTK problem with the configuration of gtk/gdk/glib but it is there

It could be done for people that do not have GTK, but it will be hard to do. I think that it is
easier that the user chooses the set of modules that fits his/her posibilities. If you have GTK
and you fancy choose GFvwmDebug, else choose FvwmDebug.

I would like to see the name changed.  Right now all our modules start
"Fvwm" and I've found that handy on more than one occasion.  Why not
something like FvwmGtkDebug?

Hello,
Unfortuately, I do not understand really what you say ... 
However, it seems that everything work find with the two versions of virtual.c.
The only thing I did with the pager is to not update the Currentdesk
with a M_NEW_PAGE message, because the pager is mad so that such an update
must be done with a M_NEW_DESK message.

Yep, in the case of the pager when you change of desk and page by clicking
on a page, you first get M_NEW_PAGE and after M_NEW_DESK. Any way, maybe
the better thing that we can do is to suppress M_NEW_DESK and to rename
M_NEW_PAGE.

Sorry for misunderstanding the real question.

	Yes, I see you've made a lot of changes since I'd last updated.

	It doesn't help the double-click case. I think the grabbing/ungrabbing
is necessary for exactly the type of programs represented by xfm/moxfm.
I suspect that our grabs clash with a grab done internally by some Xtlib
routine. I'm consistently seeing that we have to release our grab once
we focus the window (for ClickToFocus) in order for the app to recognize
the second click as part of a double click.

	The MouseFocusClickRaises case is a bit more awkward - the places where
grabs are released and restored for ClickToFocus won't work for
MouseFocus. The grab probably has to be freed in HandleButtonPress, when
we decide to raise the window.

	I'll tinker with it some more tomorrow.


Cheers,
Bob

Some people might even think this form's a bit silly.
But it does clearly demonstrate Dan's new innovative changes
to FvwmForm. Thanks Dan, you're a clever man!     :)

FormFvwmWinList. allows the user to change command
line parameters as specified in "man FvwmWinList". To save
space only colorset options are used, so to change individual
colors (fg bg etc), the colorsets must be edited. (use FormFvwmTheme.)
The users chosen preferences are saved to a ConfigFvwmWinList file to 
be read at Init & Restart etc. Once the form has been saved, the user
can then "Test" this configuration, and change it if necessary.
To keep it "simple" all options have the same names as the command
line minus the *FvwmWinList prefix. Refer "man FvwmWinList" for syntax.
If an options is not selected a blank line is produced in the ConfigFvwmWinList
file.
It seems to work for me ok, so I hope it works as well for you.
Let me know if it does or doesn't.

Alex

P.S. You need to have the CVS or wait till the next snapshot for this to work.

Some people might even think this form's a bit silly.
But it does clearly demonstrate Dan's new innovative changes
to FvwmForm. Thanks Dan, you're a clever man!     :)

FormFvwmWinList allows the user to change command
line parameters as specified in "man FvwmWinList". To save
space only colorset options are used, so to change individual
colors (fg bg etc), the colorsets must be edited. (use FormFvwmTheme.)
The users chosen preferences are saved to a ConfigFvwmWinList file to 
be read at Init & Restart etc. Once the form has been saved, the user
can then "Test" his choices, and change them if necessary.

Well, I'm one of the most interested 'customers' for such a module.

I think the reason might be that the module sets a smaller size
at first (when it creates and maps its window), but then resizes
itself to a larger size. Fvwm would places it with the smaller 
size at first and if the window grows, the bottom moves out of the
page.  You should try to find out the final size before the window
is created.

Yes, I did.  The GotoDeskAndPage command confused the pager in the past.
And no, before I made the patch the *old* desk number was sent with
M_NEW_PAGE.

It may reduce flickering in some modules.

I think I have fixed it in list_new_page() in FvwmPager.c.  If the pager
detects a new desk in a M_NEW_PAGE packet, it calls list_new_desk() first
to switch to the new desk.

I basically agree. Although I think leaving M_NEW_DESK is ok for modules
not wanting to have page awareness. The modules wanting to be page aware
like FvwmPager, FvwmBacker should listen only to M_NEW_PAGE (which should
be compatible with M_NEW_DESK, i.e. to hold a new desk, and could be
renamed to M_NEW_DESKPAGE, and its 3-rd parameter "desk" should be first).

Mikhael.

Yes, FvwmGtkDebug is a good name. Although I would prefer one modular
module FvwmDebug with frontends --gtk, --stdout, --xterm etc..

Fine, I will change it along the next days, but consider it as changed. Even more
I propose that all modules using GTK are called FvwmGtk* so replacing can be done
easely in the config files.

I wrote the module as a trainig for writing others, so be carefull about the
information shown in the lower window before accepting it as good. It seems
I have made some mistakes when intrerpreting the data and some cut and paste
errors, The code tries to be rather clean, so please check that the pakect
body is well treated in process_packet_data() before thinking there is an
error in your code.

It sounds reasonable, I have made some modifications to see what happens. I
do not have that problem, can you send me the line you use to launch the
module and what placing policy you are using in the .fvwm2rc to see if I can
reproduce the error. Are you using the last fvwm version, the one from the
CVS tree ?

Waiting your news,

I'm *always* using the latest CVS; most of the time my code is
even more current ;-)

  Style * SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

  Module GFvwmDebug

Try cluttering the screen so that you can only see the background near
the bottom border of the screen.  The placement policy should make sure
that the window is placed over the free area.

Yes, this fix is better than my since I suppose that it is better to
begin with a desk switch than begin with a page switch.
Sorry to not coming in the discussion between you and Bob, but I never
see the bug of the first message of Bob (Wed, 01 Dec 1999 08:32:29 -0500)
and I think that my pager commit had fixed the "desk-page" bug when
Bob (Tue, 07 Dec 1999 09:56:19 -0500) used "incompatible" (fvwm, modules)
couple.
Any way, I think that every thing is ok now :), at least for the Pager

I guess you should have commit privileges for CVS so you can
commit your changes yourself.  Anyone out there who wants to
back up my vote?

Yes I'm there, maybe I'm a little bit young in the list for a vote,
but a like the new module !

Unless _init  is recursing into  _init and  doing a write,  it doesn't
look like a valid stack trace.

I just changed  FvwmAuto (in the current  CVS), so that if you compile
it  with CFLAGS set to "-DDEBUGTOFILE",  it will put  its debug output
into $HOME/.FvwmAutoDebug.

I did find a bug in the debug logic itself, but I don't think that
had anything to do with the symptoms you reported.

I do suggest you try to recreate the problem with debugtofile enabled.

I don't see what you are basing this on.

Does the latest version of this obsolete FvwmDebug?  Not that I'm
proposing that as a precondition, its just that the logic of a debug
module doesn't demonstrate anything to me.

	OK, I have this fixed now. Dominik, in my working copy I've changed the
grabs from the client window back to Parent. It seems to me that the
window manager shouldn't be putting grabs on the client window, any more
than the client app should try mucking with the window manager's
windows. Am I way off base here? Any other opinions?

	...which is exactly what I did. AFAIK, this bug has been in
MouseFocusClickRaises ever since it was introduced. It's nice to see it
finally working.

I moved the grabs to the client window because this prevents the
Enter/LeaveNotify events and is a bit easier to handle.  If it
works with the parent window - fine.  There were one or two places
where changes are necessary for client/parent grabs.  I'll take
care of these.

Sigh! I thought it was clear that the border drawing changes I
made are *not finished yet*.  That's why I asked explicitly
that somebody checks if there are noticable (and undesired)
effects.  Please! Statements like "I don't like the new borders"
do not help at all.  If there is a problem, please provide
a detailed description, the corresponding config lines and -
most important - screenshots of the borders before and after
the changes (2.3.9 has the old drawing code).

Bye

Dominik,
This is a little late probablly but for future reference here they are.

AsyncPointer - Specifies that pointer event processing resumes normally
if the pointer is frozen by the client when XAllowEvents is called with
AsyncPointer.

SyncPointer - Specifies that pointer event processing resumes normally,
until the next ButtonPress or ButtonRelease event, if the pointer is
frozen by the client when XAllowEvents is called with SyncPointer.

ReplayPointer - Specifies the conditions under which queued events are
released: ReplayPointer has an effect only if the pointer is grabbed by
the client and thereby frozen as the result of an event

Okay, my proposal triggered a bit of discussion because JCT
(sorry, I couldn't find a better hint what your name is) has
appeared on the list only recently.  I think we can all agree
to give him CVS access for a limited period of time at first,
say until 2.4 is released - under the assumption that he
makes changes to GFvwmDebug/FvwmGtkDebug and related files
only.  Is this okay for everybody?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hi,

It seems that a SnapAttraction 10 SameType Screen on 2.3.10
does not give the expected result on icons.

The top of an icon Snaps to the bottom of another icon by
overriding the icon title (the one below the icon).

Is it possible to avoid this behavior ?

Attached is a gif showing this. The bottom Icon is snapped
to the top icon, making its title not visible (as compared
to the icon on the right).

Another question would be to know if it is possible to
automagically snap Icons together without using FvwmIconBox
or FvwmIconMan. I'm not happy with :

Style "*" IconBox 231x980+2+2, IconGrid 2 2

A 2/2 Grid, 10/10, 3/3 or 1/1 does not give the expected
result, which would be to have a good packed appearance.

Last think, what about a way to "Reorganize Icons", something
"a la" Windows ?

Thanks
Stephane

Hi,

When adding the following lines to my .fvwm2rc file, every program
should start on the upper left page of my first (and only) desk.

GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage,
RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
Style "*" StartsOnPage 0 0 0

However, they didn't. Not even xterm, which behaves perfectly if I
add the command line option -xrm "Fvwm.Page:0 0 0".  Unfortunately,
I'm trying to get this feature to work with another program. (The
"*" style is a test to see if the option requires the programs to
accept -xrm "Fvwm.Page:...").

Is it a bug, or am I doing something wrong?
(I hope the latter; that's easier to fix)

mvg,
Oscar

Probably not, it seems that icon titles are not evaluated right,
but I am not familar with attraction code.

The icon snap attraction is really somewhat useless as it is now.
Do you really need to move your icons? It is possible to get very good
results with multiple IconBox/IconGrid/IconFill without moving.

You'd better use IconGrid 80 100 (according to your large icons).
And this only affects placement grid (once it is placed, IconGrid
is not used, for example on moving).

There was some discussion two months ago. But it seems that noone has a
free time now to improve IconBox's (or proposed IconArea's).

The following will rearrange your icons:
  All (CurrentPage Iconic) RecaptureWindow

Also search for DeiconifyAndRearrange in the fvwm man page.

add_window.c	-  Good catch, I'd missed that one!

events.c	-  The first block (around line 1423) didn't seem to be
necessary, but I'm leaving it as you changed it. I don't think it does
any harm, and maybe you've observed something I've missed.
		   The second block I'm not sure about. Again, I only found the test
for Tmp_win->Parent to be necessary. I'm commenting out the tests for
Tmp_win->w and Tmp_win->frame for now. Give this a try and see if you
notice any bad behavior. If so, we can easily uncomment the other tests.


	There's one thing I haven't addressed yet, in focus.c (DoSetFocus).
It's the multi-head code, which looks like it's been way out of sync
with the regular code for quite a while. We still have to look into
this.

	(Gee, if only some nice corporate user would donate a nice multi-head
card and an extra monitor to the cause, maybe we could actually test
this multi-head stuff....  :-)  - That's OK, Bob, go back to sleep,
now!)


Cheers,
Bob

I can think of one nice corporation that recently floated an IPO and
is just drowning in cash.

I don't have the room for a second monitor, but I bet you could get
one by just asking.

Try the last version of the module, I have tried it and seems to work fine.

My name is Javier C. Tarradell, I thought it was appearing in the mail
address.

That is fine for me, I will be working only on modules so I only need
access to the modules branch.

I have prefered to participate in the list only with something done, even
if it is not very impressing. I hate theese people that talks about what
tey want to do but finally they do never find the time to do it.

Thanks a lot for the access and please forgive me if I make some errors
at first.

Finally I am very sorry but I have a lovely dog.

Bye,

    JCT.

Hello,
So, I put the rotated library in my archive for the 2.5.x series ?
Or maybe I have two (maybe I need 4) months to implement title on 
the left/right ?
Sorry to bother every body with this but I think that this is the only
important thing (with a GUI config module with "theme" support) that fvwm 
do not have. Of course this is subjective ...

No answer means "ok, do that ..." or "No, this is crazy ..." ??
Note that I've got an off-list "vote" by Matt for the -gnome option.
Here the message:

Dominik and I exchanged mail on this and I didn't realize we were off
the list.  For   the record, previously I  voted  to wait.  With  this
understanding I withdrew any objection.

If you don't, you may be the first.

Thats fine!

You may notice that we already have one strange looking cat on the
cats page.  Another one wouldn't hurt at all.

Feel free to add your pet to the cats page.

You got no response at all the last time you brought this up.
Whether its a good idea or not, that must be frustrating.
Lets see if I don't stir this up a bit...

I felt titlebars on the bottom went too far.
In the past when we discussed frame decoration going completely crazy,
it was always on the condition that it would move into a module.

On the other hand, I no longer have access to a slow machine and I only
have 3 or 4 users at work using fvwm on slow machines.

Given the shape of most monitors, aren't titlebars on the window sides
a feature that will never get used?

If you  rotate the font, its  still not going  to  be readable without
turning the monitor on its side.

OK workers, if you want titlebars on the sides of windows with rotated
fonts, say so...

I don't know which of the tests are necessary.  But since the code
has changed back and forth in the last month's it's probably best
to make unnecessary checks.

Do you mean the change in GetContext()?  I think we can't do this.
Tmp_win->w might occur as the subwindow and I saw Tmp_win->frame
there with passive grabs in the past (but I'm not sure if it can
still happen today).

:-) I have a second card and a second monitor, but my X server doesn't
support multi head yet (XFree 3.3.4).

To be honest I don't want to start this before 2.4.  I think
you underestimate the work this would cause.  There are *so
many* places where fvwm assumes that the title height is always
added to the height of the window, not the width.  And don't
forget the WindowShade command.  It was already very difficult
to make it work with bottom titles.  And then the 'rotated font'
utility will require different font handling: at the moment the
height of the title is determined by the height of the tallest
letter, but with rotated font this has to be changed to the width
of the widest letter.  This may not sound much of a change, but
there are many places where this would have to be adapted. It
even appears in the 'Decor' code.  Furthermore all the decorative
subwindows have to be rearranged.

I'm sure I sent some kind of reply :)

Bottom titles came nearly for free.  They required very little effort
to code (except adapting the WindowShade command).

I don't understand what you want to say with this. Are you concerned
about performance? If vertical titles are too slow, then don't use
them.

I have found one use for bottom titles. I have bound a double click
on the frame to the WindowShade function. Now I can 'ManualHide' :)
my FvwmButtons window: It's at the bottom of the screen and has
'TitleAtBottom' set.  Of course I don't use a title bar ('NoTitle').

Not in 2.4.

                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latter ;-)  This should be a command, not an option.  And the default
should be to enable GNOME support, not disable it (I think).  If we had
such a command, would the '--enable-gnome' option still make sense?
Should it be replaced by an option '--enable-gnome-by-default' or
'--disable-gnome-by-default' instead?

	No, it's in HandleButtonPress around line 1459, where we handle the
MouseFocusClickRaises case. I'm pretty certain of this one, but let me
know if you see any suspicious behavior.

	As for GetContext, I didn't want to change it, not just yet anyway,
without doing some more observation. I don't think we should see any
more Tmp_win->frame stuff. Tmp_win->w *will* definitely show up as the
subwindow a lot.

	Maybe next year I can rig up a multi-head setup. I'm not sure where
I'll find the space to put a second monitor, though. (You really
wouldn't want to see my desk!  :-)  )

The machines are slow not only due to slow CPUs, but due to memory
limitations.  Fvwm will probably never use much CPU, but every little
feature chews up another chunk of precious memory.  Once you cross
that magical boundary where you move into constant swapping land,
the machine grinds to a halt.

I can believe that title bars at the bottom didn't really use too much
memory, but I agree with your assessment that titlebars on the side
would not be trivial.

OK, I admit, it looks cool.  I just don't think I'd put up with it
for any useful amount of time.

We'll have to do a detailed 'bindind' test before 2.4 anyway.  Key
bindings on decorations have already stopped working (at least the
last time I tried).

I don't want to see mine :-)  Space desk is always a problem.  I'd have to

We already have a performance issue with modules.  Communication
over pipes is way too slow, even on a fast machine.  If you want
to know what I mean, start e.g. 30 sticky pagers and then switch
the page.

	We would have to see your entire .fvwm2rc file to figure out what's
going wrong. The fact that using the -xrm technique seems to work for
those apps that understand it suggests that there must be something that
is overriding your StartsOnPage style.

	First, try this. See if your .fvwm2rc contains the style spec

Style "*" NoPPosition

If it doesn't please add this and try again.

	If that doesn't work, could you send us your .fvwm2rc file, so we can
take a look at it?


Cheers,
Bob

Dominik: did you say once that you didn't know how to remove shaping
from a window? I think I remember you saying so in a discussion about
FvwmTheme shape masks.  Anyway FvwmIconBox unshapes the icon windows
when a client changes its icon pixmap. It uses

XShapeCombineMask(dpy, win, ShapeBounding, 0, 0, None, ShapeSet);

Cheers,
Tim.

Oooh, switching to shared mem!  Now _that_ sounds like cool project to a
OS/system hacker like me (all this X grabbing, etc. is not my cup of tea
:).  Really, it's probably not _that_ hard, either.

I'd have to go back and check out how abstract the current modules
interface is to see whether we could just swap in a new implementation
or not.

Mind you, I'm not saying I'm going to start work in this right now--just
that it sounds fun! :).

PS. Has anyone heard anything else about the problem getting FVWM to
    work on a 64-bit system?  Have we determined that it is actually a
    64-bit long that's causing the problem with the module interface, or
    is it something else?

    I don't have any systems available that do 64-bit long.

How big is it?  An alternative to adding in a library is to do our own. 
Double buffering via a pixmap may be the simplest (it would also fix
some of the flickering I see when moving windows over titlebars)  It
would add extra memory demands on the server but titlebars are fairly
small.

Cheers,
Tim.

Sounds like a can of worms to me.  The nice thing about pipes is that
they are a reliable comms method that is very portable.  It wouldn't be
hard to implement a FvwmRsh module that ran any module on a remote
machine (why you'd do that I don't know but you could).

With shared memeory you'd have to implement locking and you would
probably have lots of problems with fvwm locking up.  I've also seen
problems with speculative execution on Alpha's breaking lock schemes.

Cheers,
Tim.

	Well, I'm mystified. It works on my system. 

	I had to change a few things in your .fvwm2rc, obviously. The
ModulePath, PixmapPath, and IconPath were changed to fit my system, and
I had to comment out most of the things in your InitFunction, since you
invoke several programs I don't have. I also added a Pager invocation to
your InitFunction so I could easily see where things were (since I had
to comment out your Buttons setup).

	Then I had to add a StartsOnPage style for something, since the only
one you had was for Licq, which I don't have. I tried setting a
StartsOnPage style for "xterm*", on several different pages, and it
worked fine. Then I tried the

Style "*" StartsOnPage 0 0 0

that you mentioned in your original note, and tried starting things from
several different desks and pages, and they always fired up on 0 0 0.

	I'm grasping at straws here. Are you, by any chance, running your tests
with no other windows active other than Sticky ones? Since you don't
specify SkipMapping for your StartsOnPage windows, the viewport is
switched to the target page and desk when the app starts; but you would
have no visual point of reference to tell you that you've switched
pages, unless you're looking at the Pager. As I said, I'm really
grasping at straws, because I can't make it fail on my system.

	Can you see any error messages from FVWM startup on the console log?


Cheers,
Bob

Well, every X implementation I've used in the last 5 years at least uses
shared mem to talk to the local server, and they don't seem to have any
problems with locking or reliability, that I've noticed.

Anyway, I wasn't suggesting requiring it; if the module API is properly
abstracted it could merely be a compile time (or, if you like, even
runtime) option.

Again, though, I'm not running out to implement it.  I actually feel the
module interface is surprisingly fast for how low-tech it is--but I
don't push it much; I don't use Icon* or WinList or anything, just
FvwmAuto, FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, and some FvwmForm.  _If_ we started
abstracting out decorations into a module, etc. like we've discussed
before we may need to start thinking more carefully about module
interface performance.

Hmm, perhaps there's a geometry/placement resource setting? Maybe a
'grep geometry' from your X resources database would be
enlightening... Best of all, maybe a:

xrdb -query | grep geometry

and maybe a:

xrdb -query | grep Fvwm

while we're at it?

I would not underestimate your "very little effort".

Here is a new bug, which can be demonstrated using WindowShade.
  1) Shade a window MyName with a top title
  2) Execute: Style MyName TitleOnBottom  (no changes to a shaded window)
  3) Unshade it (it's funny)

The right fix is: a shaded window should change its position in step 2).

egad, I need to have mutt trim my headers.  Anyway, if you feel like
experimenting, put "#define long long long" in fvwm.h and fvwmlib.h, and
*theoretically* this will emulate the same effect...

Nope, it's not a bug. I thought about it and decided for me that
it's less confusing to keep the shaded titles in place instead
of warping them to their new locations (= confusing).  Of course
you may disagree.  However, I don't think it's worth the effort
to do anything about it.

Ok, I perfectly understand. I think that everybody want to see 2.4 to appear
as fast as possible. fvwm had mad so many progresses since 2.2.
If Linus decides that the next kernel series is 2.9, I think fvwm is ready ;)

Ok, the main interest of side title bar is its used with small screen
(i.e., 12'' or less which do 800x600). There are a category of users 
that will always have such screens: the laptop users (I'm one). 
Since Linux (and BSD) become popular, I think that this category is 
and will become a large one (see os.comp.linux.portable). More and more applications and environments forget poor screen, I do not want fvwm 
do that.

I tried wmx/wm2 and titles are readable on my 12'' 800x600 screen. 
Moreover, the look will be I think pretty. But the main point
is not the font rotation but the side title bar.

It make sense for an "expert" that compile itself fvwm. But, the problem
here (in my subjective opinion) is that a number of users will do:
rpm -Uvh fvwm-2.4.0.i386.rpm (--force --nodeps)
Anyway, the point for me (and I think for every body) is that we must be 
able to run fvwm alone without trouble even if it is compiled with GNOME support, and it seems that GnomeShowDesks breaks this. But, I'm sure that 
someone (not me, since my idea seems to be bad) will commit a solution.

I think now that an answer have to wait the 2.5.x series, but since

This change can break non-shaped Colorsets (I had an FvwmButtons with a nice
array of colors-- none if which I chose :)  The offending line seems to be
Colorset.c:148.  I believe this patch fixes the problem while keeping the
intended functionality, but if it doesn't somebody else will just have to
fix it ;)

	This patch fixes the XA_WIN_AREA problems with GNOME (it does indeed
need to be sent for both the root window as well as application windows).=
=20
This fixes the GNOME Pager/Tasklist problems (with everything appearking on
the upper left workspace) that I e-mailed the list about a week or two ago,
which IMHO was the most annoying GNOME-related bug.

Full_Name: Neil Zanella
Version: 2.3.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.13
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.2
Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.153.50)


Hello,

It would be nice if FvwmButtons had the following feature:

When a button is pressed with mouse button x a square box pops up with a
message
in it. Such message could be the name of the application launched or of the
action
that is about to be taken. The square box goes away each time the mouse
button is
released. The square box is especially useful when a button has a different
action
associated with it for each mouse button.

Thanks,

Neil

I have noted the same problems and enable debugtofile (Auto die quite
rarely on my machine)

start 58 (ri = 0, hnw = 1, usec = 1000)
select: delay = 1000 usecs
pw = 0x4000003, fw=0x4000003, rw = 0x4c0004e, lw=0x4c0004e
raise packet 0x4000003
its the old window: don't raise

The others messages never contain "its the old window: don't raise".

	Well, this may not be the best fix (I was kind of tired at the time
I noticed this).  I just know that it fixed my problem ;)  Had it been
earlier in the day, I would have tried to figure out a better solution (this
was intended more as a bug report than a fix-- the fix was just a "hey, if I
got lucky and this is the right thing" patch).  I *do* know that certain
swallowed apps caused FvwmButtons to change to a dark shade of black or a
dark shade of blue (instead of having the colorset I assigned to them), and
my best guess is that something is uninitialized...

What is the problem with my patch?  I don't understand why the shape
shouldn't be reset if the colour set has a pixmap.

This.  (See attached screenshot.)
Each button is assigned the same colorset, however, the change causes
buttons 2, 3, and 5 to have strange colors instead of the gradient.  These
colors are not my foreground nor background for the colorset.

I'm guessing the new deiconify behavior is great for some users, but
the way I use fvwm, every time I deiconify a window and it disappears
below some other window, it just looks like the wrong way to go.

I'm guessing its  because I never work with  stacks.   The windows are
either side  by side, or  on top  of each  other with the  "Front" key
being used to toggle their appearance.

Shouldn't this new behavior require a config file change to activate?

Something like "Iconify Raise" being the default, and getting the
new behavior with something like "Iconify NoRaise"?

I wasn't aware that this patch slipped into CVS.  I didn't intend
this (i.e. will be removed in a minute).

I am running snapshot fvwm-snap-19991214 and now I am getting the following
"ERROR" message in my console on startup:

[FVWM][GNOME_SetCurrentDesk]: <<ERROR>> Attemped to change to desk gnome does
not know about
[FVWM][GNOME_SetDesk]: <<ERROR>> Attemped to set window to desk gnome does not
know about

What could have changed to make these messages start coming out? 

The previous snapshot I was running was fvwm-snap-19991201 since then, these are
the only "Gnome" related changes I see: 

1999-12-05  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

        * fvwm/gnome.c (HandleGnomePropRequest):
        use DrawDecorations() instead of old SetBorder()

1999-12-04  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

        * fvwm/gnome.h:
        * fvwm/gnome.c:
        applied gnome patches by Matt Rossmiller

Am I missing something?

Thank you for all the help and for a great window manager.

Bob

Well it died again, (fourth time today).

Here is what I get from gdb: (nothing different)

Continuing.

This message tells you that some desk change command has been issued for a desk
outside of the range you have told gnome to expect.  Using FvwmPager with Gnome
will cause this to happen as when changing between two desks, it first changes
to desk 1000, then to the new desk.

well I was really bored today being off from work so I hacked up Patrick

Volkerding's lesspipe.sh which comes with slackware to work with
fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh so it doesn't try and use vi on everything.
It just goes by the file extention so it's not perfect if I'm bored
again later this week I'll probably hack it up some more to use the
file(1) command

Any way it's small and I figured other people would like it so here it
is.
And it's tailored to my system so you'll have to change a few things in
the script so it does what you want but they are all right at the top so

it shouldn't be that hard.

This is fixed in version 2.3.3 and anything more recent than 1999-05-25

I've noticed that clicking in a window with said GlobalOpts set
doesn't raise the window reliably anymore.

  - start DDD 3.1.4 with a program; it opens the command and the source
    window (I have configured ddd to use separate windows).
  - now open a data window by double clicking on any variable
    --> The data window is mapped over the source window.
  - click inside the source window; it is *not* raised as expected

To fix this, I just raise another window.  After that is works fine.
This sounds awfully like a screwed up stacking order (but the stacking
order in the pager is okay).  On the other hand it might as well be
caused by Bob's last changes to fix mouse bindings.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Sigh!  I'd really appreciate if I get a chance to fix the
reported problems before we start implementing new commands
to tune unfinished features.  I'm still hoping to get more
feedback from Bob and Mikhael on their problems (I did mention
that I can't reproduce your problems, didn't I?).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Okay,  I have my first FvwmAuto failure of the day and here is what got printed
into .FvwmAutoDebug:

start 799 (ri = 0, hnw = 1, usec = 500000)
select: delay = 500000 usecs
pw = 0x6c000fa, fw=0x780000e, rw = 0x6c000fa, lw=0x6c000fa
raise packet 0x6c000fa
Leaving via DeadPipe

Does this help any?

The back trace still reports the same message.

Is there anything else I can do to help resolve this problem?  It is really
becoming an annoyance.

Thank you all for the help thus far.

Subject: Java windows migrate across screen at popup time

Full_Name: 
Version: 2.2.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: OSF1 V4.0 878 alpha
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (134.101.28.104)


During the popup process of a JAVA-window (JDK 1.2.2) under fvwm 2.2.4 the

window is displayed first and in a second step the entire window moves 
upwards. It does not change size, it moves. Even setting a position in the

code has no effect, because the position will be changed through this 
jumping behavior of the window manager. The internal layout is 
not changed after popup-time.
Behavior seems to be ok under dtwm of CDE. So what is missing in fvwm??

Sorry Dominik but it's only a minor mod to turn off the changes you made
to the border drawing.

Cheers,

Well you will find that behavior in quite a few window managers, except
dtwm and openwindows.  The reason: SUN has workarounds in the java code
for there own window managers.  The fix: I'v found a call to setBounds
before the call to show works better than setLocation, so you might try
that.

Dan, 

I'll direct this to you since you have been handling most of the web
pages of late.  The link to the bug system on www.fvwm.org points to
yyy.fvwm.org and gives an error on a cgi.  Can you check this out.

Besides the FvwmAuto and GNOME_SetDesk issues I have mentioned to the list
already, here are a couple of other oddities I have experienced with the
December 13th snapshot.

FvwmBackground is easily confused.  If I change to different desktops quickly
then FvwmBackground starts displaying the wrong image.  If I re-click on the
current desktop, then the correct image gets displayed, but then the next
desktop I change to will not have it's background changed.

When I need to restart of FvwmAuto (which is often), my whole X session dies.  I
am restarting FvwmAuto by running FvwmTalk and entering "FvwmAuto 500 raise
Nop".  If I restart fvwm2 then it starts okay.

Now when I do a restart of fvwm2, "Restart fvwm2", windows that I had started on
other desktops are moved to the first desktop.

When I am using Netscape's Messenger, I have mail filtered to other folders. 
When I am finished with the current folder I click on "Next", a selection box
pops up and asks if I wish to read the messages under a different folder.  Well,
I have to click yes twice for this to happen when before it only took one click.

I am not very articulate, but I hope I have conveyed my problems well enough. 
If not please ask me for a clearer report.

Thank you.

	Strange. I just tried this scenario with DDD 3.1.6, and I can't make it
fail. I tried it with both canonical and sloppy mouse focus, just to be
sure, and I've tried it about a dozen times without seeing this happen.

	I've been down with the flu all week, and I haven't updated since last
Thursday (12/09) - any chance that something since then has introduced
this?


Cheers,
Bob

I figured out that this only happens if you do not change focus
between the double click to open the data window and the click
to raise the source window.  I tried to debug this but didn't
get very far yet sinde my ddd windows are rediculously large
and overlap my debug output window.  I'll have to configure a
keyboard sequence so that I don't have to raise the debug window
with a click.

Can't remember any.  The few bits of debug output I could see yet
seem to point to your patches though.  I'll have to spend more
time debugging.  Hopefully that happens on my home machine too.

Jason did  this.   My guess is that  he's  working  on the systems  in
question.  I don't think we should fool with it unless he says to.

Well, it doesn't look like its any particular packet that causes the
problem.

Yep, bugs, I hate em.

I've started to run FvwmAuto myself, but so far, no luck.

It sorta looks like fvwm is stopping the module.

Perhaps you might start with a print in fvwm/module_interface.c in the
KillModule function, just  to  see if  fvwm  is deciding to  stop  the
module or if the pipe is just going bad for some reason.

This is untested, but:

fprintf(stderr,"Killing module %s\n",
	 (pipeName[channel] ? pipeName[channel] : "Noname"));

	Owww! Because there's no focus change here, the source window never
gets regrabbed.

	Oh, it will, as long as you have the same sequence of overlapping
without having the data window pop up under the mouse to cause a focus
change.

	[Sigh.] I'm beginning to wonder if it's possible to satisfy all
applications and situations with this MouseFocusClickRaises thing. I'll
have to think about this some more. I suppose we need to regrab the
currently focused window when a new window is created, if that causes
the currently focused window to be no longer at the top of its layer (at
this point Scr.Ungrabbed should not be NULL, and should point to the
window with focus).

Bob

I'm still not sure what caused this; I restarted the web server on
yyy.fvwm.org and all seems to be well.

In the CVS's version, M_NEW_PAGE once again contains an old desk number.
FvwmBacker requires a new desk number to work.

Bob, can you please explain, why do you need an old desk number in this
packet? I think you should undo this change.

Robert, can you find a reliable way to reproduce this?
The following is probably unrelated, but...

Please only specify parameters for Restart if you want to restart another
WM or to specify some unusual option. If you want to restart the same
WM with the same initial arguments, use Restart without parameters.
In your case the problem can occur if you have another fvwm2 in $PATH.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hm, my windows don't do this.  Is this a general problem (i.e. with all
your windows) or does it only happen intermittently or only for a certain
kind of windows?  In the latter case, could it be caused by some style or
global option in your config?

This is probably fixed with one of my patches from today. Can you verify
this, please?

Finally I was able to reproduce this.  I've made some patches that
should take care of it.  Do they solve your problem?

I didn't see any notice that you have access to CVS now.  If
this is correct you can send a user name plus an encrypted
UNIX password to Jason Tibbits (tibbs@fvwm.org) and he will
take care of the rest.

Does this mean that (A)SyncPointer throws away the event that caused
the grab while ReplayPointer releases this event so that it can be
processed normally?  Perhaps I'm being dumb, but I don't understand
'pointer event processing resumes normally'.  I have read this in
three different places (X man pages, Xlib manual, your mail), but
I can't make sense of it.  How does this affect events that have
already been caught by the grab and processed by the grabbing client?

I've applied the patch (with several changes), but I still think

 1) The tasklist/pager are buggy if they fail to work correctly
    without this hint set.
 2) This hint is the wrong way to do this.

Just consider windows that are halfway between two (or even four)
pages.  Which would be their correct page coordinates?  The
tasklist should take the window's geometry and then decide for
itself on which page to put it.

Only in theory. I can't reproduce it on demand at home, but I still
see it sometimes. Well, let's just try it out. Can you make the
appropriate patch, Bob?

[Double Sigh] Something strange has happened in HandleButtonPress too.
Before I put the XUngrabPointer() call at the end of the function,
my transient pager (bound to button 2 via 'Module FvwmPager -transient')
didn't get drawn properly until I relesed the button.  It hung when it
tried to grab the pointer.  Although fvwm already left the
HandleButtonPress() function, it still had a grab active.  I can't
fathom where this comes from.

Sorry, this is not the right fix, although it can work with a flickering.
Still if you are on (desk 1, page 2 3) and switch to (desk 4, page 5 6)
firstly the command for (desk 1, page 5 6) is executed, which is a bug.

The right thing is to fix M_NEW_PAGE. :)

Mikhael.

I agree, though I can *kind of* see the reasoning for it.  There are a lot

desktop areas (although I truely can't imagine it being much different).

Again, I agree.  *BUT*, GNOME is a real pain to use efficiently without the

	Well, not quite, but maybe it's progress.

	Now, instead of a random occurrence, it consistently comes up too big.
I've put up a couple of screen shots to illustrate at

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/BigPager.tar.gz

I use

*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 40

with a 1280 x 1024 screen.

	Wrong. M_NEW_PAGE contains neither an old nor a new desk number; it
contains the *current* desk number. Why do you assume it must contain a
new desk number? We switch pages all the time without switching desks
(and vice-versa).

> Bob, can you please explain, why do you need an old desk number in this
> packet? I think you should undo this change.

	The change was put into gotoDeskAndPage_func because, at the time, the
Pager got confused if M_NEW_PAGE came through with a changed current
desk number. Someone (Dominik or Olivier, I forget) has since fixed the
Pager code to Do The Right Thing if the desk is changed when an
M_NEW_PAGE comes through, but none of us ever got around to changing
this function back.

	Remember that this is not simply a matter of the contents of some
packet: what's being updated here is FVWM's notion of what the current
desk is. The justification for this cheat, which updates Scr.CurrentDesk
prematurely (the new desk hasn't been mapped yet) was to reduce flicker
in some cases by letting the Pager update both desk and page at the same
time. (Actually, at the point where gotoDeskAndPage_func calls
MoveViewport, there is, properly speaking, *no* current desk - both old
and new desks are unmapped.)

	I think we should change this back, but...I think Backer needs to be
cleaned up first (just as the Pager had to be cleaned up so we *could*
change it back). You cannot assume that a page switch implies a desk
switch or vice-versa; it seems to me that Backer should be able to
handle the two as discrete events, or as a unit (i.e., the M_NEW_PAGE
packet carrying a changed desk).


Cheers,
Bob

	No, it is impeccably correct. But the commands are not what you're
concerned with. You're interested in the notification of the results of
the commands, and you're asking to be notified of the results before
they have happened.

	M_NEW_PAGE is not broken, and never was. However, if I'm interpreting
this correctly, it sounds like you're saying that Dominik's fix *does*
make the Backer work correctly with the current desk switch handling,
although I'll bet it's really an awful sight to behold if you're
switching desks and pages at the same time. If that's the case, then I
think it's time to change gotoDeskAndPage_func back to doing the cheat
of sending the desk switch notification prematurely in the M_NEW_PAGE
packet. But let's not forget that we're not doing it because it's the
Right Thing, but as a performance hack.


Cheers,
Bob

this specific property has even more problems. according to the old
wm spec, pagers/tasklists should send a client message to the root
window for changing the current area, and for changing the current
area of a specific window. many window managers though expect the
pager to modify this property directly and will change the current
area for client messages that should only change the current area
of a specific window.

with the new wm spec coming out, i'll probably overhaul the pager/tasklist
wm backend to determine the current area purely based on the clients
geometry, especially with window managers that don't necessarily align
the current area to some multitude of the screen size (i.e. viewport
scrolling).

you should probbaly mail to wm-spec-list if you think that this property
should completely vanish (iirc it needs to be there at least for clients
to specify on what area they want to be initially mapped).

I love text that makes less sense every time your read it.  When I
mailed this to you it made perfect snese and now I'm getting confused.
However, your summary sounds about right.

Yes, without M_NEW_PAGE carrying the new desk, no hacks will help
FvwmBacker and other page-aware modules to behave right.

I suggest to move this discussion to another thread.

So, just don't send M_NEW_PAGE when the desk is not yet updated to a new

"The Right Thing" you are speaking about is a hack, not a good solution.
The solution is to listen to M_NEW_PAGE (M_NEW_DESKPAGE) and remove
listening to M_NEW_DESK.

I suggest to reread Olivier's and my suggestion on this:

How exactly M_NEW_PAGE carrying the old (or current whatever) desk number
helps the pager to reduce flickering? I think it only makes things worse.

The Backer is clean (the version of 15 Dec, without M_NEW_DESK at all).

Exactly, this is my reason why we should change meaning of M_NEW_PAGE.

Because it's the only packet which informs the modules of the
new page. In my eyes it's nonsense to have the desk number in
this package at all when there is a distinct desk package. I'd
replace both packages by a new M_NEW_DESK_OR_PAGE package.

No, you can't simply stop listening to M_NEW_DESK because
backer won't catch simple desk changes then. BTW, this is
what my patch fixed. Nothing else.

	Now I'm confused (but, as I said yesterday, I've got a really bad case
of the flu, so I'm pretty befuddled even when I'm not trying to think.
:-( )

	I was just about to change gotoDeskAndPage_func back in the hope that
it would satisfy everyone's needs at the moment, but I'm not sure what
you mean by "broken". Or did you mean before your fix?

	Here's my thinking at the moment. 

	We should think of these packets not as commands to take some action
(switch desk, page, or whatever), but as a reflection of a change in the
status of FVWM (hmmm, page has changed...oh, desk has changed, too), and
take whatever action is appropriate for the module to react to the
changes.

	1) Both Backer and Pager (and anyone else who listens to these 2
packets) should be able to handle a change in desk and page reflected in
a single packet.

	2) They must listen for *both* packets, in order to catch the cases of
a simple desk or page switch.

	3) If M_NEW_DESK comes through and the desk hasn't actually changed
(because they already caught the desk change with the page change), then
they should do nothing.

	If these conditions are currently met (are they?), then it seems
reasonable to change gotoDeskAndPage back, and let's see what the visual
performance looks like. If it seems satisfactory, then we can look into
your idea of replacing both packets with an M_NEW_DESK_OR_PAGE packet.


Cheers,
Bob

This happens to any window that I do not specify a "StartsOnDesk" Style.  I use
FvwmSaveDesk, in my .fvwm2desk file, windows start on the desktops they where on
when the FvwmSaveDesk was executed.  I don't have a StartsOnDesk Style for every
window I run.

This problem started with the December 13th snapshot.

Does that mean fvwm-2.3.11?

I snatched it from the CVS but they still seemed solid to me.

The new border drawing code is now finished.  I hope all
the problems reported earlier are now fixed.  Now I would
like to remove the new GlobalOpts BORDERCOLORPRIORITY
and BORDERRELIEFPRIORITY.  I've checked mwm/fvwm borders
with widths between 1 and 6 pixels and can hardly see a
difference.  I find the new BORDERCOLORPRIORITY style
gives a better 3d look except for MwmBorder with
HandleWidth 2.  In this case you don't need the
global option though but you can simply use a lighter
border colour.

There are two definite advantages of the new code:

 - thin borders have a colour closer to the
   colour that thick borders have
 - Shaded windows without a title don't look like
   a drawing bug.

So, is there any chance to convince you (Tim) that we
don't need this global option?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I mean FvwmBacker was broken before.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

No, they are not. FvwmBacker does it's stuff even if neither the
page nor the desk has changed.

There is no 2.3.11 yet. 'Development code' means 'the code in
CVS'.  This will eventually become the 2.3.11 release, though.

> I snatched it from the CVS but they still seemed solid to me.

If you look close you should notice a grey border around the
black one, just as in 2.0.46.  Don't use the 'NoInset' border
style, otherwise you will get the hilighting only on the top
and left border.  If the hilight colour is not bright enough,
try increasing the CONTRAST_MIN macro in libs/fvwmlib.h.

Does that help you?

Ha!  You're such the optimist :)

Recent changes to the ANNOUNCE file, etc. notwithstanding I can't see it

 43) Several pager bugs (bug #379).
 44) Fix TaskBar crash caused by latest patch in RemoveButton().
 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]
 54) Find a better solution for raising/lowering of transients.
 55) FvwmGtk can't be killed with 'KillModule'.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.
 57) Fix autohiding and TaskBar tips.
 58) DeskTopSize is not honoured upon a restart (the old one is reused).
     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.
 66) Fix ddd problems.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a

     [only colours used yet]
 79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?
     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]

 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the

Let's see. 1280 / 40 = 32 pixels. I.e. each page should be
represented by a page that is 32 pixels wide in the pager.
You have 5 desks with 4 pages each = 20 pages.

  20 * 32 = 640

Now add one pixel for each separator and two for each border:

  640 + 19 + 4 = 663 pixels.

This is exactly the width of your pager (give or take a few
pixels).  So the new (big) size of your pager is the correct
size and the old size (around 460 pixels) was wrong. Phew!
you scared me for a moment. To get the old size again, the
correct scale is:

  *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 55

I should warn you if you want to use this script.
It is not complete yet, I am planning to add a usual icon support
and some more features, but it is already usable.
And you should be online to get results, of course.

Now, the second usage as described in the man page (generated on fly)
crashes fvwm for me. The first and third usages should be ok thought.

Dominik, can you reproduce a crash? If not I will investigate it later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Now there's a radical concept, using actual measurements! Wish I'd
thought of it.  :-)

	I'd never actually checked the size. I just tried a couple of numbers
and then said, "Yup, that looks about the size I'd like it", and I've
been using an incorrect scale for years.

	Thanks, and sorry to distract your attention from real bugs.

You can get rid of it if you can come up with a way to have a two pixel
wide border just show the relief and none of the border color.  I do
this with NoInset and I find it useful for dialog boxes etc. that don't
need to be resized but look funny with no border at all.  Without the
globalopt you always get a pixel of border color which I don't want.

I know it's only a minor thing but it's a backwards incompatible one.

Tim.

I beleive the day I sent this message was the last day it

Description:
	Doing an on the fly style change from "Style * Icon" to
	"Style * NoIcon" without a recapture seem to cause confusion.
	Iconifyinf after the style has changed to NoIcon causes FvwmAnimate
	to draw an animation to where the icon would have been.  The space
	seems to be occupied as no other icons appears there when windows
	are iconified.

Fix:
	It may be that the icon_width and icon_height aren't being reset
	to zero when the style NoIcon is applied.  I think theis is what
	FvwmAnimate uses to decide not to draw an animation.

Is there a fvwm command which sends M_NEW_DESK, but not M_NEW_PAGE?
All my arguments are based on the fact that there is no such command,
so M_NEW_DESK is just redudant if the module listens to M_NEW_PAGE.
This is why I think the answer here is "No". Correct me if I am wrong.

Simple error, really:

  int xneg,yneg,usposition; /*window size stuff*/;
-------------------------------------------------^


If you look carefully, there are two semicolons on the line; the second one
implying an "empty statement" which is technically not allowed in the middle
of a structure definition.  (Why doesn't GCC notice this???)


Next problem.  In modules/FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c, we have lines like the
following:

  { "quit",        builtin_quit,        0, {} },
 
For some reason, COMPAQ C is choking on the empty bracket declarations.  The
structure used in fvwm 2.2 was:

  { "quit",        builtin_quit,        0 },

(simply ignore the missing arguments).  I've changed the former to the latter
in my distrubtion, and the rest of the compile went well.

I'm not sure who's at fault here.  I'm not sure if the former is valid C (I Am
Not A C Language Lawyer).  If there was some overarching reason for the change
between 2.2 and 2.3.10, then maybe it might be nice to document this within
the source file as a hint to Tru64 Unix users.  Or, maybe, have some code like
this:

#ifdef __DECC
#define	ZERO_ARGS	/* nothing */
#else
#define	ZERO_ARGS	{ }
#endif

(I think that COMPAQ C also allows { 0 } or { NULL } instead of the empty
braces).


If this is fixed in the current CVS, feel free to ignore.


I'll send reports of any other problems I notice

The "{ 0 }" solution looks like the cleanest solution to me.
(I'm not a C lawyer either.)

Could you let us know if that makes COMPAQ C happy?  (It seems obvious
it would, but testing before change is always a good idea.)

It works as well.

Now, I'm having runtime problems.  I'll start a new thread on them.  [smile]

Description:
	FvwmTaskBar hangs when moved. It gets into a 100%cpu loop due to

	The Alarm() signal handler has this in it:

    event.xmotion.y = -1;
    event.xany.type = MotionNotify;

I managed to build fvwm-2.3.10, and am now having the following problems.

1.  It seems to ignore my .fvwm2rc file.  Instead of my nice decorations, I
    get a dull looking motif-style screen with a root menu with four options:

	Xterm
	Setup form
	Issue FVWM commands
	Exit FVWM

    I run fvwm2 from my .xsession file as such:

	exec $HOME/bin/fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4prog /usr/lar3ry/bin/m4 $HOME/.fvwm2rc"

    I know that the file is there, and if I switch back to fvwm 2.2 the
    same command line works.

2.  I play with this "mini root menu"

    - Xterm works  (nice!)

    - Setup form causes fvwm2 to hang.  A telnet into my system at this point
      shows that FvwmForm is running (although I have no form displaying on my
      screen).  Killing the FvwmForm module unfreezes fvwm.

    - Issue FVWM commands brings up a window, which quickly disappears.
      My session log file shows the following error messages:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module 0, Size Problem: cont is zero
[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module 0, Size Problem: cont is zero
[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module 0, Size Problem: cont is zero



So... can anybody give me some clue as to how to get a .fvwm2rc that works
fine with 2.2.2 to work with 2.3.10?


I'm going back to 2.2.2 until I get some feedback.  I don't see anything in
the docs subdirectory or the README, NEWS, etc. that gives me a clue here.
Also, most of your docs imply that I'm using fvwm 2.2; you may wish to change
these.

	Something has changed that causes the FvwmScript Colorset to hang
	when Auto-Apply is selected.

Repeat-By:
	FvwmTheme without the *FvwmThemeReadWriteColors option, run FvwmScript
	on the Colorset script, select Auto Apply, pick a colorset, pick the
	background change radio button and try to move one of the sliders.
	
	After a few pixels of movement FvwmScript hangs until you let go of
	the mouse.  At this point the movement catches up. What is interesting
	that the cursor changes to the "Cursorstyle Wait" cursor.  I have
	set "BusyCursor * False" so this shouldn't happen.

It looks like you don't have fvwm2 in your $PATH, and since you haven't
read your .fvwm2rc, you don't have ModulePath set either, so I'm guessing
that its running your old modules.  Do you have old modules somewhere in
your PATH?

The 2.2 version of FvwmForm will definitely have problems with the new
setup form.

I think this can also account for the M4 problems.

Before we got the code from SCWM, I was toying with a design like this:

Shadows and highlights are perceptual issues, perhaps  not the same in
all people. From my  limited understanding of colors, color  closeness
is non-linear, and perhaps there is no single formula that works.
The more advanced formulas that I've toyed with (in Colorlimiting)
use way too much CPU to be useful.

I thought I'd create 4x4x4 = 64 data points like this:

#000000
#000044
#000088
...
#004400
#008800
..
#FFFFFF

and come up with visually appealing shadows and highlights for each
(by just trying different colors).

Then I thought I could extrapolate any other shadow/highlight color.
(The idea being that small differences could be treated as linear.)

I got as far as trying and writing down some values, and it didn't
look like there was a formula that would produce the same numbers.

I was pretty happy with the SCWM result, so I don't have my notes
any more.

I am unable to repeat it. The thing I can see is a lot of crazy move
when autohide is enable. Do you have problem without autohide ?
With resize I see only one crazy move (I've work for that ... and decide
that the user has no need to move an autohide taskbar ...).
I've no crazy move with non opaque move/resize.

Okay I put the fprintf in fvwm/module_interface.c, I see "Killing module FvwmM4"
and "Killing module FvwmBanner" when these are done, but when FvwmAuto stops
working there is no message printed.

The same message is printed into .FvwmAutoDebug:

start 636 (ri = 0, hnw = 1, usec = 500000)
select: delay = 500000 usecs
pw = 0x880007b, fw=0x0, rw = 0x880007b, lw=0x880007b
raise packet 0x880007b
Leaving via DeadPipe


Is there another way to duplicate what FvwmAuto does?  I'm starting to think
this is a hopeless case.

You can do everything FvwmAuto does with FvwmEvent, (I think),
but we've barely scratched the surface on debugging this thing.


So far we've tried:

1) breakpoints in gdb at the exit point and we had "nonsense" results.

2) turning on debug which seemed to indicate that "DeadPipe" was being
called by the modules signal handler.

3) debug logic in fvwm  to see if fvwm  was closing the pipe to  cause
the signal.   It doesn't seem  to be, so the origin  of  the SIGPIPE is
mysterious.


I've had FvwmAuto  running  a few  days without   any problem.  I   am
running  it   under "purify"  and   my configuration  for  FvwmAuto is
probably different...


Here are some more things to try:

1. To tell for sure if the modules signal handler is calling Deadpipe,
change:

  signal (SIGPIPE, DeadPipe);

to

  signal (SIGPIPE, DebugRoutine);

In "DebugRoutine", print a message and call "DeadPipe".


2. If a "sigpipe" signal is being raised, we don't yet see why.
Attaching "truss" to FvwmAuto and fvwm might help.  (You'll get a whole
bunch of output.)


3. The "gdb" output didn't make sense to me.  Have you tried "dbx"?


4. The "gdb" output didn't make sense, perhaps the stack would make
more sense if you added this to the "Deadpipe" function:

  strcpy(0,"a");  /* Force a core dump */

$HOME/bin/fvwm2 -version reports:

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.10 compiled on Dec 17 1999 at 10:50:46
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  XPM

So, I know that I'm running the correct version.  I would imagine that the
following line should work in my .fvwm2rc:

ModulePath	FVWM_MODULEDIR:/usr/lar3ry/bin

(My $HOME is /usr/lar3ry, fyi, and /usr/lar3ry/bin is in my PATH.  I promise.)

> I think this can also account for the M4 problems.

How?  My .fvwm2rc file IS there.  It DOES get read by fvwm 2.2, but doesn't
seem to be read by fvwm 2.3.10.  There is an inconsistency.  Somthing worked
in 2.2 that doesn't work in 2.3.  I'm trying to find out what isn't working.

This is the procedure that I use to switch between 2.2 and 2.3:

	# To have fvwm 2.3 run:

	cd /usr/lar3ry/src/fvwm-2.3.10
	make install

	# To have fvwm 2.2 run:

	cd /usr/lar3ry/src/fvwm-2.2.2
	make install

Both were configured with --prefix=/usr/lar3ry, so the executable in both
cases is /usr/lar3ry/bin/fvwm2, and the program should be able to find FvwmM4
in the "proper" place, since it should be run out of wherever "make install"
puts it.

Or is this an incorrect assumption?

I find calling abort() leaves a much better core dump.

It is possibly an incorrect assumption. fvwm2 now builds in the

M4 is a module.  If you are getting bad module versions, (old ones),
then that might explain why your .fvwm2rc doesn't work.

Uh, just realized that you are using M4, I guess you wouldn't need a dollar
sign after all.  Still, I think you might be running the wrong module
versions.

Dominik, if you are farmiliar with expression "knock on wood", that 
is what I should have done when sending my reply today.  I just saw it 
again.  This time it was a mapped java window, but it has happened with xterms and emacs frames as well.  I grabbed the stack trace maybe you can figure something out I'm missing.  And no I'm not running FvwmEvent or Auto.  
And this is current CVS minus your last commit for WindowList, Stlye cleanup, and Titlestyle stuff.

Brad

Also, please double- and triple-check that you've compiled with
debugging on (-g) and it might be helpful to compile with optimization
off (no -O).  And recheck that your ModulePath isn't set or is set to
the right value so you're really running the right FvwmAuto.

I have to say I've always run FvwmAuto and except for that one time I
mentioned in my first response to you I've never had it die on me.

Whoa! When I first saw this message, I thought "that's not how the
signal handling works". However, I have now looked at this module and
see that I haven't updated the signal handling here. I don't see that
it can be making too much difference since gdb does say that FvwmAuto
receives a SIGPIPE signal. (I handle signals; I don't send them.)
However, it does mean that we might all be using signal() here and
possibly using different semantics.

I can update the handling NOW, or after we discover where the SIGPIPE
is coming from; which do you feel would be more useful?

Cheers,
Chris.

Yes, it's gross and illegal. It should also be migrated out of the
handler. The fix involves finding a place (or places) in the code to
check "trigger event" such that it will be executed as soon after the
handler returns as possible, and BEFORE the values of dpy and win
change. That's nasty.

It seems that you forget to add update.h :

Ok, I have found the problem. This always happens with animated menus.

Hi. Most importantly, I just updated my source tree for the first time
in a while. The build fails in builtins.c, trying to include a
nonexistent "update.h". I don't see it in fvwm/... Huh? What did I do?

On to other less pressing things. First, a proposal: with the amount
that's changed between 2.2 and the current FVWM (and more importantly,
between the current version and 2.0), might it not be warranted to
call the next release 3.0?

Next, does anyone know of a way to get *all* of the current
configuration lines through the module interface? I suspect it's not
possible, but I wanted to check to make sure there's not something I'm
missing. If I'm correct, what does anyone think of adding FULL_CONFIG
or something to the module interface? I'm thinking it'd be useful for
two things I've seen requested:
    1) a way to dump the currently running config into a file
    2) help balloons
I'm not sure help balloons could be done in a module, but if they're
to be done at all, I figure the module needs to know what fvwm's
bindings are.

I have written a simple and small desktop themes package for
the latest development versions of fvwm ONLY! You must have 
the CVS or a current snapshot for this package to work.
IT WILL NOT WORK! on versions below 2.3.11!
The forms in this package use features not in the source code
a month or so back.

The basic package without sounds and pixmaps is a 45K tarball
but it unpacks to over 200k.
The package contains a suite of forms and all the config files you
need to start with. In most cases you can still use your old .fvwm2rc
file as all this package does is manipulate colors and sounds and
configs. You must therefore remove all references to such in your
.fvwm2rc  In fact there is provision to load several user.fvwm2rc
files for each theme. Each config configuration can be different for 
each theme. The same for window colors, sounds etc....

A makeshift README follows this message.

Some help with debugging this thing would be appreciated because
I know there are some bugs, I just forget where. I don't get errors mesages
so I hope you don't too. The FvwmBacker form IS broken, partly
because it's source was being changed only last week. So I thought
I'd wait a bit, maybe I'll get back to fixing it soon.
The system wide install section like other parts is still unfinished.
Apart from that, I think it works.

I like and use builtin-rplay as my FvwmEvent command and it works
fine for me. So it defaults to that. If you want a different command for
FvwmEvent, change it via the form. If you dont want FvwmEvent,
switch it off. The Backer module is off by default untill I fix the form.
I'd prefer to remove as many bugs as possible before making this 
public but like any work in progress they always creep in from time to time.
If someone wants to help on this please email me, and I'll send you an
ftp URL to get it. I'm about to upload now.

P.S. I don't know how much longer I can work on this, my computer
is NOT Y2K compliant !   :(

INSTALLATION

I've been using $HOME/.fvwm2/ as my $FVWM_USERHOME so the package untars to that dir i.e. .fvwm2/
To install simply set $FVWM_USERHOME to some directory by editing ~/.profile
and entering the following lines

FVWM_USERHOME=/home/your/file/path/.fvwm2
export FVWM_USERHOME

Once done source the file or logout then back in again.

Then you can start fvwm2 in your usual manner. (e.g. startx or xdm)
If all goes well you should see different colors than the normal default.

If you want a system wide install simply comment the line in .fvwm2rc to read the forms.
Then untar the forms tarball into <prefix>/etc/fvwm/

There's a default rc-file that's essentially the default install file. If you want to use your own 
.fvwm2rc then copy it to ConfigFvwmRc/new.name.fvwm2rc  You must then edit it to remove ALL commands
related to colors, colorsets, AND any/all modules except for window colors that you want to remain
fixed between "themes". Module configs can be specified separately or together as parts of different
themes. If you have rplay support compiled in and you add the sample sounds/ files to rplay.conf
then you will hear sounds upon starting the window manager. Otherwise there might be errors in your
X server logs so switch the Events module off. I like builtin-rplay so I use it. I'm not sure if 
other commands will work as well with this themes package though. I've kept the actual *.wav's
in a separate tarball. 

All the user modifiable stuff is in the directories prefixed ConfigFvwm
All the system non-modifiable stuff is in .fvwm_config/

There's a spare tarball of dotfiles in .fvwm_config/ in case of trouble. If you get errors about
symbolic links, remove the link and copy a Default file to Current
The link should then replace the file once reset without problem.
It's best to save each theme at least once upon starting.

If you are not using the default user.fvwm2rc supplied with awols themes, then to some Menu add

AddToMenu SomeMenu "Desktop Themes" Module FvwmForm FormFvwmTheme. "ThemeFile=.fvwm_config/.ConfigFvwmThemeCurrent"

Then when you select "Desktop Themes" from that menu the form will always display the theme last 
'set to current'. The 'current theme' is always loaded at Starts and Restarts.

Hello, 

Here I suggest that we open two new "source" trees: fvwm-samples and fvwm-icons
with an autoconf install procedure.

fvwm-icons: This is easy to be done and in fact it is done on my machine.
 The advantage is that ./configure find the FVWM install-prefix and
 then "make install" install the icons in, say, install-prefix/share/fvwm/icons.

fvwm-samples: At first step it is easy to done. Just one directory "Windoze95"
 with the system-sample-95 file and the autoconf stuff that will be able to
 solve the "!!! use configure" problems.
 After, we may add other "configuration systems" and use configure to do
 intelligent jobs (e.g., internationalization and check for apps when building
 menus).  Moreover, each "config-sys" can have some icons, sounds, Forms, 
 Scripts that can be installed in  
 install-prefix/share/fvwm/{icons,sounds,forms,scripts}/config-sys/
 for example.

Of course I am volunteer to do a large part of the work, however, I do not
know how to create a new source tree.

I forget why Icon distribution is still open.

Is that really any easier than the instructions at:

http://www.fvwm.org/icons.html

"Note, make a directory to  hold the icons and put  the "tgz" file  in
the directory before unpacking."

But my main point is that you haven't mentioned the existing icon
distribution, so if you are considering anything new, make sure your
plan includes the existing distribution.

Most  of whats currently in "sample.fvwmrc"  is  now spread around the
source tree  in multiple "ConfigFvwmXXX"  files.   The main thing that
has not  been moved  out of this   directory are the   various "decor"
examples.  If we deal with the decors, we can just remove the whole
directory.

I think the stuff that Alex Wallis has been working on is the right
way to deal with the decors.  I don't know if "configure" is a good way
to deal with this.  A user should have some sort of GUI thats lets them
try out a decor and modify it.  (Thats what Alex's stuff does.)

Alex,

  I think you should post the URL to the workers list.

  I downloaded the latest package, set FVWM_USERHOME to point at it,
and restarted fvwm.  Most of the themes stuff I tried seemed to work.
The number of things on the forms is overwhelming, I think its going
to take me a while to find everything.

  On the form that  lets me change  the menu  colorset, I changed  the
color set number and hit save.  I noticed that the menus didn't change
color.  If some of this changes on the spot, and some needs a restart,
I think the forms should show that.

Yes, and update.c too.  Seems that I'm unable to add files to CVS
without doing something wrong :-(

Beacause I forgot to commit update.[ch] earlier
I had to check in some unfinished work on updating
styles/decors.  So don't be surprised if strange
things happen with decors, fonts, hilight colours
etc.

My latest work implies that the HilightColor(set) commands

HilightFore, HilightBack and HilightColorset have to be used.

Ok I been told just to post this.

At www.dove.net.au/~awol/fvwm2 you can download a 
desktop themes package that not only actually works,
but is also multi-useful.
But it does need a lot more docs. Oops! C'est la unix!

Alex

P.S. You still need 2.3.11 or better to run it.

It'd be fairly easy to have a "set" of different "sample decors" and switch
between them with my GUI. Just have a basic user.fvwm2rc and the
decor stuff can be on separate configs to be read at Start/Restart.
Several configs can be read depending on what the user specifies.
You can even try out other peoples configs with minimal fuss.

I am neutral here. Since it is only one directory to install, the current
solution within fvwm-web is ok for me. Of course it is nice to have fvwm
and fvwm-icons to share the same paths, but this only matters if we supply
ready to use rc files which use these icons.

Until now OS distributions provided the fvwm-icons package ready to use
with fvwm and default rc files using these icons.
As fas as I know, in Debuan the upcoming fvwm package will go with the
wm-icons as the icons distribution for it.

I already said before that fvwm-themes repository would be nice. You can
find some discussion in the summer on this topic. This matches well enough
what Alex is doing now. Also I know that Jason Kibblewhite
<jkibble@home.com> worked on similar issues.

New repository tree should be planned well first, it is difficult to move
files/directories in CVS. I will send soon to Alex a list of improvements,
covering the directory structure among other things.

After we have a good designed working example (probably based on Alex's
solution, but definitely with a better directory structure) we will ask
Jason to create fvwm-themes repository.

That the points: system-sample-95 is done for fvwm-icons (only need to
replace mini- by mini. in this config file). Moreover, it can be a base
set of icons for certain "config-system" in a future fvwm-themes branch
(others using wm-icons).

I vote for this. So, we will have a place with more or less independent
directories as:

Windoze95/
awol/
...etc

and we can apply bazar techniques to improve all the stuff !

My idea was to move the existing icon distribution to fvwm-icon. The
reason is to give a base set of icons for a future fvwm-{samples,themes}
source tree. Then, having an installation procedure is useful to place 
the icons in a standard place.

Hi,

I have different icons based on window titles/icon names. Depending
on the app currently running in a shell, I would like that
the icon (actually in FvwmIconBox) reflects this app.

Of course by default, the icon is the one reflecting the
window when it opened the first time and does not change
unless I Restart/Recapture all. How could I make
the icon dynamically change when the icon name changes ?

I think of using FvwmCommand and watch for "icon" or "window"
triggers, and send a WindowId $0 RecaptureWindow each time
I get those.

Although I've set RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage, it seems that
RecaptureWindow moves the window to its starting place, is that
correct ?

Anyway, is this the only way to do it ?

Thanks !
Stephane

Well, I found that the .fvwm2rc file was being properly interpreted by FvwmM4
(I found copies in /tmp), so for the time being, I have taken this preprossed
output and am using THAT as a start.  This allows me to get past the "silly
four line menu" thing.  Once I get the RC file correct, I'll debug the problem
with fvwm2.3 and M4.


Next problem:

fvwm2.3 starts up, and hangs.


I telnet into my workstation, and find that I have a FvwmBanner and
FvwmButtons process running.

I kill them, one at a time, and fvwm2 continues its initialization.

I note that the command line being executed shows that these modules are being
run out of /usr/lar3ry/libexec/fvwm/2.3.10, so this is not a case of running
the wrong modules.

Error message(s) in the log file shows repeated messages like:

[FVWM][DrawButton]: <<ERROR>> unknown button type
[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module 1, Size Problem: cont is zero


Next problem:  No modules seem to work.  Not FvwmPager, not FvwmButtons,not
FvwmForm.  Nothing. Except for tkgoodstuff, which occasionally has fvwm2
generating messages due to the fact that the module protocol has been
modified.  (tkgoodstuff was built outside the fvwm2.3 sources, obviously.)



Yet another problem:

My .fvwm2rc decors, which looked nice in fvwm2.2 look horrible.  My ActiveUp
window color should be DarkBlue with white fonts.  It's a light gray with
white fonts.  (I have a display of depth 16; I seriously doubt that I'm
running out of colors.)

I'll be investigating this further.



>From the look of things, it looks like going from fvwm2.2 to 2.4 is not going
to be a "simple upgrade" for most people; if their 2.2 RC files won't work
unmodified in 2.4, there is going to be problems.  Maybe somebody can come up
with a perl script to do conversions?  Or maybe somebody should up the version
number to 3.x to indicate some incompatible changes.


I'll report with more information as I get it.

I would prefer 3.0 to mark the start of a much trimmed down fvwm with
things like decors removed, all color/pixmap selection moved to
colorsets, border/title/button styles removed and replaced with a module
for fancy ones.

I think 2.4 is going to be mostly backwards compatible with 2.2 with a
few minor variations but not enough to warrant changing the major
number.

Cheers,
Tim.

I noticed FvwmTheme made direct calls to what I thought were the internals
of the shadow/hilite routines.  I don't understand why yet, so I haven't
changed them.  (I left the old routines in ColorUtils.c for a while).

There also seems to be an extra Percent sign at the end of the format strings
in pixel_to_color_string.  I haven't tracked down how thats used either.

Meanwhile, the new logic looks pretty good to me.

I have to do some real work for a while.  Anyone else want to look into
FvwmTheme?

Tim?  Why can't we call GetHilight() and GetShadow here?

Huh? What's wrong about

  sprintf(output, "rgb:%04x/%04x/%04x%n", ..., &n);

and

  sprintf(output, "#%04x%04x%04x%n", ..., &n);

Do you mean the final '%n'?  This writes the number of characters
printed up to the %n into a variable (like sscanf would do).

FvwmTheme can operate with read/write colors.  It can't use GetHilight()
in this case since that calls XAllocColor().

Do you mean the %n in this?


    sprintf(output, "rgb:%04x/%04x/%04x%n", (int)color.red,
(int)color.green,
            (int)color.blue, &n);


It's used to tell the caller how many character were placed in the
output string.  It may not be used but I don't think it's a bug.

I'll have a go.

Cheers,

I think with the work on update w/o recapture in the last
weeks you should be able to trigger this from FvwmEvent.

Yes, FvwmEvent can do this.  You won't need FvwmCommand, though.
(It's a bit slow).

May be a bug.  Which version do you use?  With 2.3.10 and up
you won't need a recapture to change the icon anyway.

It *is* used.  It's the function's return code.

Sounds very appealing to me.  We could get rid of much redundant code,
syntax variations, icon management modules, ...  The things I'd *love*
to remove are:

  Decors           (replaced by more flexible styles)
  Style * UseStyle (replaced by other commands)
  Style * Color    (buggy and unnecessary)
  Style * Icon     (to define a default icon)
  BorderStyle      (clumsy and has a horrible syntax)
  ButtonStyle      (dito)
  TitleStyle       (dito)

I'm not convinced that window decorations can be moved to a
module though.  We're pulling off a lot of tricks that are
simply not possible in a module (e.g. shading/resizing).  May
be too slow too.  I'm not against trying to modularise this,
but my hopes don't soar either.

Yes.

No.  HilightColor(set) ... is translated to the corresponding style
option.  The problem is that I trashed the pointer to the rest of
the command line before copying it.  I'll commit a fix in a minute.

Hello,

It would be nice if the NoOnBottom / OnBottom / OnlyOnBottom

Subject: Mouse bindings with 'W' context

Full_Name: Chris Rouch
Version: 2.3.10 and 2.3.11
CVS_Date: 
OS: RedHat 6.0/Solaris 2.6
X_Server: Matrox / Sun
Submission from: (NULL) (193.134.254.74)


[I see something similar in the duplicates for 2.3.7, so I guess 
you've fixed this once and it got broken again]

I have mouse buttons set as follows:

Mouse 1 W               M               Iconify

With 2.2.x and 2.3.9 this does what I expect - clicking the leftmost
mouse button with the Mod key pressed anywhere in the window 
iconifies the window. However for 2.3.10 and 2.3.11 all I get
is a beep. I used the same configuration file for all the 2.3.x versions.

Great! icon_name and window_name are nice triggers... BUT...

With
*FvwmEvent window_name WindowId $0 RecaptureWindow

It sends in fact WindowId RecaptureWindow window_id

- Is there a way to put the window id in the *middle* of a
command instead of at the end ? Why $0 does not work here...

- The other thing is that I can't use FvwmEvent with two
different FvwmEventCmd right ? Either I play sound, either
I update my icons...

Thanks!

I have 2.3.10, I will try this again just to be sure. Why is
that I shouldn't need a recapture then ? Do you mean that
fvwm would automatically check for dynamic style changes ?

I don't believe this is currently possible. A patch should be fairly
easy to do though...

You can start FvwmEvent under an alias like:

Module FvwmEvent IconHandler

Then configure

*IconHandlerCmd foo
*IconHandlerPassID

etc.

We don't need Jason's help to create another source tree.

Somehow, after fvwm-web was created, I never got around to documenting
the commands, but  there should be sufficient  information in the mail
archives.  If we really decide  to go with another tree,  I can dig it
out.

I still don't see the need for another tree.  We have fvwm-web for the
static stuff, that users  don't  need to  download,  and fvwm for  our
source.

The forms and scripts needed should be in "fvwm" and any canned themes
would naturally end up in "fvwm-web". (My opinion.)

If we create another tree for themes, and expect that to propagate
onto our web pages, we are just creating another area that Jason has
to make propagation to the web pages work for.

Not for changes in the icon name, but style changes are applied
immediately without the need for 'Recapture'.  I have been working
hard on this for a while now.

Today we replaced the whole colour calculation code.  The
new code (= new snapshot) should fix this problem once and

Just let me know what you end up deciding on.  I appreciate you folks
trying to save me effort, but this isn't a really a huge issue.  Pick what
organizes things the best.

Perhaps fvwm-web is just ill-named and it should have been instead a
collection of stuff that doesn't get built into the distribution.

There were some interesting comments in the module we just pulled the
Hilight/Shadow logic out of:

 * At one time there was no cache in the color routines. When displaying
 * remotely, profile data indicated that the vast majority of the time
 * spent in _XtCreateWidget was spent getting colors from these routines.
 * In Aug 1997, Jon Christopher (jac8792@tamu.edu) added a cache to each
 * of these routines so that it will remember the data from the last call
 * and avoid server round trips if they are called again under the same
 * conditions.  These changes speeded up _XtCreateWidget by 10 times.


Running fvwm remotely, I see huge amounts of data flying back and forth
during startup.

I keep getting these errors whenever I use kde apps.

Thought someone might find them interesting.
The apps still work, but I keep getting a crosshair cursor and have to click
on a window before fvwm2 resumes. Then all goes well again.
Seems like it's getting an extra grab window or something.
Every kde transient causes this to happen too.
Otherwise kde apps work well with fvwm2

Netscape transients also produce the "grab window" syndrome.
This has been happening for awhile now. I've got the 991220 snap
but 2.3.11 and earlier did this too. It may be something with this 
installation. I'm picking up a new HD and probably OS too today.
Will see if it happens on a BSD install soon.

Fvwm is trying to tell you these app windows are broken.
Having minimums greater than maximums is not a good sign.
You can verify this by typing "xwininfo -all" in an xterm
and then clicking on the window in question.

If you get the same kind of information from xwininfo, you might
consider forwarding the output to the responsible developer.

I'm not too sure what the crosshair is about.

Hmm, I have noticed I have to place Netscape transients also.
I just assumed I changed something in my configs to cause this.

  I've just jumped from 2.3.8 snap 19990906 to 2.3.12 snap 19991217, and a
minor buttons buglet seems to have crept in, although it may be a change
that makes my config. out dated. Here's the basics of what I'm doing that
used to work OK:

  (CreateStandardDecor is a function to set up my fav. Decor settings,
stopping at button 4)


CreateStandardDecor "DefaultDecor"

CreateStandardDecor "IconiseAll"
AddToDecor IconiseAll  \
   AddButtonStyle 6  Pixmap FNX-window-iconise-all.xpm

Style "IconiseAll"  \
   UseDecor IconiseAll, Button 6


Style "*"  NoButton 6
Style "Navigator"       UseStyle IconiseAll  # e.g.


  What this does is allow normal windows the standard buttons, and
selected apps. get an extra 'iconise-all-similar' button.

  This worked fine before, but now, although the selected apps. do get
their extra button, with related XPM, *all* windows *also* get the button,
with it's correct functionality, but /without/ the XPM, just the button 3D
outline ("-- Raised" IIRC).

  At a guess, it seems like the NoButton isn't fully doing it's job?

Can you report this to the KDE developers?

The crosshair has nothing to do with this message.  It is
probably caused by something in your config file (it may
still be a bug, though).  Please post your config file and
a description what I have to do to get this behaviour.

Ooops, I meant that these could be implemented as options to the
WindowList command. They would work analogously the the
NoOnTop, OnTop, and OnlyOnTop features mentioned in the fvwm2 man
page. For example the NoOnBottom option would ban StaysOnBottom
windows from the window list.

Best Regards,

Neil

Please don't get this message against a new motif-like shading
calculations, but why exactly we should change the old ones?

I think that the old GTK-like consistent calculations (where hilite color
is always brighter and shadow color is always darker) are good enough
(and IMHO better) and could remain a default.

Here is for example, in attachments, how bad look now my menus and
CompactButtons, which were ok in 2.1 to 2.3. Compare them to ones in
Mikhael-desk-1152x864.gif from fvwm-web. Of course I fixed them by
specifying sh & hi in the colorset. The point is that it could be
probably surprizing for users to get such metamorphose. Just an opinion.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Okay.  Can you add a comment to this Java related bug too?
I don't know what to write in Jitterbug.

Mikhael,

  I assume you made the updates, but I don't remember seeing any
notice that the updates were made on the workers list.

  So, to save everyone else having to look, the fvwm information
at Freshmeat is now current.

Well my config is my Awol desktop theme I posted the site for the other day.
And here again now. But my old HD was pretty stuffed. I just got a new one.
I'm downloading the latest snap right now. I'll try and give you more details 
if I still get these happenings on a brand new install soon.

Thanks.

I've been trying to figure out: how do you bundle all of the
directories modified in a single commit to be listed in a single
message to the mailing list?  When I run CVS locally, if a commit
affects multiple directories, it makes multiple log entries.

I'd be fascinated to know; I'm sure it's just a simple shell/perl
script run from CVSROOT/loginfo or CVSROOT/modules....

Thanks in advance,

   Julian

Can you please try again with 2.3.11?  If that doesn't help,
please post your complete pager config plus the lines you use to
start it.  Furthermore please run 'xwininfo' on the pager window
and post the output too.

Huh? I simply run 'cvs commit' in the top level directory.
Or do you mean the commit messages for multiple modules?

I think what Julian is asking about is the mechanism Jason
put in place to generate mail after CVS updates.

I would guess only Jason would know the answer.

I vaguely remember Jason mentioning that he  did it, but I don't think
we saw any details.

This has the commit_prep and the newlog scripts that are used.  I've been
very thankful that Jason (or whoever) has shared this with others.

Warning:  I don't know exactly how up to date these are.

Since we can now specify exact colors using FvwmTheme, I don't think
2 choices in 3d calculations is warranted.

I don't know that you are implying that,  I'm just suggesting we pick
one or the other.

I could suggest waiting a few years.  Subtleties in shading will become

Yes, that's right.  CVS seems to bundle together all the commits
appertaining to one directory and send them off to the command given
in the CVSROOT/loginfo file, but Jason has managed to get all of the
separate directories affected in one commit to appear in the same
email message.  And I can't figure out how he's done it ;-)  (I'm
jealous; I want one just like it.  Pleeease.  For Christmas. ;-)

Well, OK, it's not urgent, but I'd still love to know.

Thanks!

   Julian

Is it possible to take the server grabs out of update_windows() in
fvwm/update.c? It stops the FvwmScript Colorset from working if you set
auto-apply on because FvwmScript has the mouse grabbed when you are
moving the sliders and so fvwm hangs trying to grab the server until you
let go of the mouse.

Cheers,
Tim.

Thanks!  So I can go and ask the BSD guys if there's a more up-to-date
version, else I'll hack this one.

I'm no longer sure where I got the scripts that I started with.  I made
several changes, though, so if you pull someone else's scripts you'll lose
the FVWM customizations.

Also of note, the CVS server I run is slightly hacked to support one
important feature (proper usernames when using pserver).  I submitted the
patch to the CVS folks but I'm not sure if they did anything with it.  I
can probably dig up the patch if you want it.

I should add a couple of instructions.

Check commit_prep and newlog.pl into your CVS tree under CVSROOT, then add
them to checkoutlist.  (The idea is to get them into CVSROOT in checked-out
form.)  Then put the following in commitinfo:

DEFAULT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commit_prep -r

and something like this in your loginfo:

DEFAULT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/newlog.pl -s -f $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog -m fvwm-workers@fvwm.org %s

Thanks for this too.  Maybe a README saying also where the files
originate?  ;-)

I think I've located the source of the files, after a very round-about
search: they're in the cvs source package in a contrib directory!
(And they're called log_accum and commit_prep).

There's a $USER variable which can be used in CVSROOT/* admin files.
I wonder whether that's what they did with your patch?  I don't know
whether it works for pserver, though.

Thanks for the pointers!

The *FvwmPagerGeometry bug looks like it's finally fixed...

Hello,

I have a virtual desktop with 4x4 = 16 viewports.
I want each viewport to have size 28x19 pixels.  
The pager draws a one pixel wide line between each viewport.
Hence the pager will have length:

length = 28 + 1 + 28 + 1 + 28 + 1 + 28 = 4(28) + 3(1) = 115
width  = 19 + 1 + 19 + 1 + 19 + 1 + 19 = 4(19) + 3(1) = 79 

I also want the upper left hand coordinate of my pager to be (4,4)=(3+1,3+1).

Hence I have the line:

*FvwmPagerGeometry 115x79+3+3

I then measure the size of each individual viewport on my screen.
They are all the correct size.   

I now add a PagerButton. The PagerButton swallows the FvwmPager and 
unswallows
it when the PagerButton is killed.

Since the Buttons' padding is three pixels its size should be:

(3 + 115 + 3)x(3 + 79 + 3) = 121x85

Hence I put the following line in my configuration file:

*PagerButtonGeometry 121x85+0+0

Once again, after restarting everything seems to have the correct geometry.

So as far as my own configuration goes it looks like the *FvwmPagerGeometry 
bug is fixed in Fvwm 2.3.11.

Best Regards,

Neil

This is (or used to be, at least) $USER in the traditional shell sense.
With pserver, everything's running as user "cvs", so it's useless.

My patch puts a CVSUSER variable in the environment.

Hope this doesn't break anything, if it does put the grabs back in.

I'm off to the bunker until 5th Jan 1900.

Hello,

It would be nice if cutting and pasting were available
with FvwmForm lines of text.

Hello,

It seems like *FvwmPagerGeometry is still broken. For example the command

*FvwmPagerGeometry 115x79+3+3

gives me a pager size that is larger than the one I specify.

Thanks,

Neil

There has been a bug in the dashed separators of
FvwmPager for quite a while now. The bug is that
when the viewport is moved with the middle mouse
button the separators change shape, turn into
solid lines in some places, the dashes rearrange
themselves etc... I don't see why these lines
should move. Is anyone else seeing this?

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

Here is another bug in FvwmPager I have been noticing
for quite a while now. I have a sticky xclock which is
placed on the upper right hand corner of my desktop.
When I move the viewport the sticky xclock appears as
being located just to its right, outside of the
viewport. It seems to me that sticky applications are
incorrectly drawn within the pager.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice to see an implementation of the
TitleWarpOff feature that worked with arrow keys.
For example,

Style "*" KeyTitleWorpOff

would prevent the pointer from being worped when
a submenu is selected with the right arrow key.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

It would be nice if the FvwmPager had an *FvwmPagerHide
command. After all there is not much point for FvwmPager
to show windows of type StaysOnTop, FixedPosition, etc...

Thanks a lot,

Best Regards,

Neil

        * subr.c (getcaller): Return CVS_Username if it is set.

This effectively means that $USER in the *info files is expanded to
the username that they logged in as, not the effective username, if
pserver is being used.

Even so, I really liked your patches to the upstream scripts; they
worked wonderfully (after a little more personalised tweaking).

I do hope to catch up with FVWM stuff sometime soonish....

Have a good break everyone!

The  last time  you  filed this, (#492),   you noted that  pasting was
already available.  I'm moved this into the duplicate folder.

I put in the pasting, but I don't yet understand how to accomplish the
cutting part.  (I don't do X programming for a living.)

Since I have little  need for the ability  to cut from  FvwmForm, I've
given this low priority.

I don't know if this is related, but there are a few places where the
BUSY cursor is set uncondifionally, e.g. when updating styles (update.c)
or in strokeFunct() (builtins.c).

Funny, there no usleep() call anywhere near line 897.  In fact none
of the code anywhere near this line should trigger usleep().
I've got no idea what's happening.  Perhaps some unfortunate
interaction with a call of DispatchEvent()?  We need a way to
reproduce this.

Since this problem seems to occur quite frequently I think you
should make the fix now.

A screen shot of my viewport can be found at 
http://www.cs.mun.ca/~nzanella/tmp/pagerandxclock.gif

whereas my full configuration file can be found at:
http://www.math.mun.ca/~nzanella/links/computing/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc

I have seen the funny xclock thing happen on different screen sizes.

Best Regards,

And thanks for all your help,

I had the same problem with FvwmButtons when it was being drawn in the
upper-right corner of my screen (-0+0), but I assumed I was insane or I had
set something up wrong, so I just dismissed it.

Your version of Netscape is not working correctly.

A bus error indicates that Netscape is performing an incorrect program
instruction.  You might try installing a different version of Netscape.

This is not a bug in fvwm.

The busy cursor patch was made before the dynamic style stuff. It will be

I think it is conditionnal here, the busy cursor appear only if you

Well I get the same kde errors on this install on a new drive.
Netscape still produces the crosshair select cursor too. Every time
a transient is created. Even without a config at all. Is it a bug? kmail does too.
This is on a SuSe 6.2 install. In the next couple of days I'll hopefully
have a Free-BSD and a Redhat to check this out on also.
I'll try out if using different configs also produces these strange effects.
Will let you know.

I would like to finish this. It seems that my previous message was
not clear. I try an other method:

from sample/system.fvwm2rc-sample-95:

#!!!use configure here
ImagePath /usr/local/lib/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/lib/X11/mini-icons:/home/avatar/src/fvwm/icons:/home/avatar/src/fvwm95-2.0.43b/pixmaps:/home/avatar/src/fvwm/icons

How can we use configure here if the fvwm icons are not installed in a
standard place ? A proposed solution was that sample-95 came with its
own icons. But, I think it is reasonable to use the fvwm icons dist.

#!!!use configure here
DestroyMenu Documents
AddToMenu Documents \
  FVWM%mini.win95.xpm%		Exec netscape \
					/usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm95/index.html

A proposed solution was to use http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/ this is ok only for
machines with a permanent connection. Moreover, the doc depends on the
fvwm version, so it seems that fvwm-web is not the solution (note that in
fvwm-web we have the 2.2 man page but the 2.4 FAQ).

#!!!use configure here
*FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/bin/play
*FvwmAudioDir    /usr/local/lib/sounds
*FvwmAudioDelay 1
*FvwmAudio destroy_window crash.au
*FvwmAudio add_window  whip.au

Do we need to add sound stuff some where ?

#!!!use configure here
*FvwmScriptPath /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2/scripts

Problem: the Scripts are not installed and do not really works.


What are the solutions to all this problems ???
Here some solutions:

1. Users/Distribution have to solve all this problems itself.
Bad solution IMHO: the fvwm-wokers are the only guys that really
know FVWM.
 
2. a. Put back the icons in the fvwm dist and add --enable-icons
      options to ./configure
   b. Copy  the doc stuff of fvwm-web/generated in fvwm dist and
      add --enable-doc to ./configure
   c. add a directory Windoze95 to fvwm/sample and put the needed stuff
      in this directory (.fvwm2rc, Scripts/, (Sounds/)). 
      Add --enable-win95 to ./configure
Note: i. Most window managers work like this (with the options 
        enable by default)
      ii. Olivier why you want to die ?

3. Create packages in fvwm-web: 
fvwm-sample-win95-{2.4,2.5}, fvwm-docs-{2.4,2.5}
Reasonable IMHO, but since these stuff is version dependent this cause
some problems. Moreover:
  a. where we develop fvwm-sample-win95 ?
  b. How to solve the icons and docs path problems ?

4. Create a source tree fvwm-misc with:
  a. icons/, 
  b. the doc of fvwm-web/generated
  c. Windoze95/
  d. sounds/
Note: This is note an replacement of an eventual fvwm-themes source
      tree.

Sorry, for this to long message (I'm ready to get no answer). But I would
like to finish with a story:

 16 months ago I have installed Linux (RH 5.1) in my machine. The guys that
 install Linux for me put AfterStep as the default wm. Because of a bad config
 file (the winlist was StayOnTop with a geometry of 1024x(1line)+0+10 so some
 times it was impossible to move a window !) I tried fvwm2 (not anotherlevel)
 with the fvwm95 config file ... and now I a humble fvwm-worker.

 FVWM is surely one of the best window manager, however, there is an enormous
 gap between what it can do and the config file provided. sample-95 is not
 the definitive solution, IMHO a fvwm-themes source tree is the solution but
 this is an enormous work. So, for me "an automatic well installed sample-95" 
 is a reasonable temporary solution.

Ah, but the icons are installed by the same person that installed fvwm.
Since ImagePath is built in it should now either not be in the config
file at all, or look like this:

ImagePath $HOME/icons:+

(Thats my current Imagepath.)

I don't see much of an issue here, if we wanted to have a built in
documents menu leading to the fvwm documentation, using "www.fvwm.org"
would be "close enough" (in my opinion.)

"www.fvwm.org"  leads to  the man  pages for 2.2.3  (or  what ever the
latest non-beta release is.)  That should be correct for the majority
of users.

Most of us agree, there is no problem that the FAQ  is always from the
latest beta.    (Answers that rely on  beta  features are  supposed to
mention the beta release.)

My W98 Documents menu doesn't do this anyway.  (It doesn't lead to W98
documentation.)

If we wanted to make sounds available, I think they should be in
fvwm-web, along with the icons.

On my system, the PlayCmd is "audioplay", and setting "AudioDir" is a
problem.  configure aleady knows a little about rplay.

I think FvwmScript has to be changed to read from the same place
FvwmForm reads from.  Having the path in the .fvwm2rc is broken.

I guess you weren't on the list  when we took  the icons out.  Some of
the reasons:

Make install would take forever.

You'd be installing the same thing (the icons) over and over.
They never change.

2 downloads is no big deal.

Adding "--enable-icons" sounds, OK, but I think  we should just assume
that the icons are installed, and create menus and configs that assume
they  are there.   If  they  are not  there,   fvwm would  still  work
reasonably well.

2.5 would be a beta.  Beta users are supposed to be able to deal
with these issues.  I still think we only need themes and docs for
one release.

I think we can  get a w95 theme  from fvwm-themes in a reasonable time
frame.

Until then, I have a story of my own.  One of my users asked for a w95
theme a  few  years  back.   I pulled   the  stuff out of  the  sample
directory and created a reasonable facsimile in less than 1 hour.

I still think fvwm-themes is not that far away from completion if some
of us could pitch in.

Right  now,  we   have a   setup   form  that  creates  a    "working"
configuration.  Have  you considered adding   a button that says  "W95
appearance"?  I think you would find, that it would  be pretty easy to
make that change.

Thanks for bringing up these issues.  I agree we need more work
in the configurability area.  We have plenty of features, we need to
do more work bringing them within reach of the average user.

   When ClickToFocus is the focus setting, we created options menu using
Motif 2.1 libraries. When we select the options menu for the first time the
focus behaviour becomes "focusfollowsmouse" and when we operate on the
option menu the second time the window completely loses focus. The window
or any text control in it does not get focus when we click on it. The
clickToFocus behaviour is restored only when we click on the title bar.
    NOTE: This behaviour is not present in twm and mwm. Also,it is not 
there if the focus "follows mouse" option in .fvwmrc is enabled. 

I am enclosing an example program herewith.

Subject: PipeRead description too terse for inexperienced users

Full_Name: Joe Mooney
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux (Redhat)
X_Server: XFree83 3.3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (204.179.92.80)


PipeRead man page description is minimal and therefore, hard to
understand.  Also, my version (2.2.2) is inconsistent with the
example given in the FAQ (section 7).  The form of the command as
shown in the man page on my version is "PipeRead cmd option".  It
appears that the example in the FAQ is just "PipeRead cmd".

Specifically, one thing I am trying to do is have a button that
swallows the xclock and reports the output of "date +%b\ %d\ %Y"
as its title.  Clicking on the date will then open ical.  I've
acutally done that once before without using PipeRead (or SetEnv)
but I can't figure out how and I lost my old .fvwm2rc.

But that's another issue I guess.  I see a lot of potential for
PipeRead if I can figure it out.  I am aware that the pipe command
in Unix is pretty fundamental and maybe thats why the man page
explanation is so minimal.  Unfortuneatly, I am self taught on
Linux so some basic stuff like that may be as obvious to people 
like myself.

Anyway, I think that the raw configurability of FVWM2 makes it the
best window manger for Linux.  I'm hoping that mastering commands
like PipeRead will make it possible to develop a form customizeable
interface for my wife.

When I used the fvwm2 , I pressed the icon about Netscape. It run well.
When I start up an xterm and type the command¡ª¡®netscape¡¯, the netscape
begin to run. But after a while(sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes 1 minutes)
, the netscape disappear suddenly.. The xterm told the error¡ªBus error. I
didn¡¯t understand the mean of ¡°Bus error¡±. In addition I found that the
netscape run well if the configfile(system.fvwmrc) was preprocessed by M4
command, but the problem come up if the configfile wasn¡¯t preprocessed by
M4 command.  I want to know how to solve the problem. The version of the
netscape was 4.05.

Hello,

I would like to be able to perform operations on the focused window
by means of a key binding. The manual page says:

Current (conditions) command
Performs command on the current window if it satifies  all conditions.

I am assuming that current window here means focused window. In that
case I trY:

Key S A M Current WindowShade

but after restarting the focused window does not shade unless the pointer
is on top of the window.

Thanks,

Happy Holidays,

Neil Zanella

The 'option' is the same as for 'Read' and is optional.  I've
fixed the man page.

Just write a shell script that prints a line like

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow xclock 'Exec exec xclock', Title "whatever you want")

E.g.:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo "*FvwmButtons(Swallow xclock 'Exec exec xclock', Title \"`date +%b\ %d\ %Y`\""

and then use

  PipeRead my_xclock_buttton_script

But as far as I know you can't bind actions to button presses over
a swallowed applications.  Of course you could use a second button
for this.

You can use it directly without an additional script:

PipeRead `date '+*FvwmButton(Title "%b %d %Y", Action "ical")'`

And of course, if the computer is always off at night, this is enough,
otherwise this will not work, since a dynamical update of button title
is not implemented (and probably can't be implemented).

I suggest to use another clock application, displaying date, like asclock.

I want to inform that me and Olivier are working on creating fvwm-themes
framework (started some days ago).

The framework should allow both a great configurability and ease to use.

Due to enormous work to be done to standardize this framework and provide
working themes, the discussion will unlikely be on this mailing list.
I will post initial drafts and results from time to time though.
Anyone wishing to help (this includes at least converting own .fvwm2rc
to the continually updated new scheme) is welcome to email me.

Let's have something which works (and works well) and then decide where
it belongs. My opinion is that fvwm-themes is different. I prefer to have
it live (not static) or not to have it at all. Once the framework is more
or less done, it could be maintained by a fvwm lover outside fvwm-workers.

fvwm.themes.org (currently dead) may be a perfect candidate for the main
fvwm-themes repository. It should be up, otherwise we are just loosing
a user base.

Mikhael.

Great !
But, what do you think about reading the script in FVWM_CONFIGDIR/Scripts
(in the place of FVWM_CONFIGDIR) and install the example scripts in
this directory ? Of course I can do that if you are agree.

I think we should use the same rules for everything we install.
We are currently installing config files and forms.

The config files are named:

ConfigFvwmSetup
ConfigFvwmBanner

The forms are named:

FormFvwmTalk.
FormFvwmSetup.

For scriptts we don't need the trailing dot, so scripts would be:

ScriptFvwmFileBrowser
ScriptFvwmFind

I think we should be using names like this so we don't conflict with
scripts a user is likely to write.

If you agree, I don't think the directory name helps, we would end up
with:

Script/ScriptFvwmFind

Yes, it is the good idea, I think I do not have it because it needs
more work :) I will do the change (and review the scripts).

I tried to run this sample program, but all I get is this error
message:

  Error: attempt to add non-widget child "DropSiteManager" to parent "motiftest" which supports only widgets


caused by the statement

  top = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("MainWin", xmMainWindowWidgetClass, topShell, NULL);

(with lesstif 0.88.9)

Subject: bug: FvwmTaskBar switches page during auto hide
Message-ID: <19991221150319.V13111@agilent.com>
Mail-Followup-To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

There is a new(?) auto hide bug in task bar:

 - Start taskbar non-sticky and with auto hide configured.
 - Move the mouse over the taskbar so that it unhides.
 - Move the mouse out of the taskbar.
 - Before the taskbar starts to auto hide, switch to
   a different page.  Because the task bar is not sticky it
   is no longer vilible.

==> after the auto hide timeout interval has passed, the taskbar
    switches to the current page and starts to hide there.

Fix: The Alarm timer has to be switched off when fvwm switches
     the page.  The X server has to be grabbed during the hide/
     unhide animation to prevent fvwm from switching pages.

Olivier, can you look into this?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Because they don't work.  E.g. the shadow and hilight colours
of black are black using the GTK code.

No, the GTK code only guarantees that the hilight colour is never
darker and the shadow colour never brighter than the source colour.

Such changes will never go unnoticed.  When Dan rewrote the colour
code last time there was a lot of wailing too.

Another taskbar bug:

 - Start taskbar non-sticky, autohiding on page 0 0.
 - Hide the taskbar.
 - Switch to page 0 1. The taskbar is visible on the top
   border of the screen.  Although this looks funny it is
   not really a bug.
 - Move the mouse over the taskbar.

==> The taskbar jumps to the bottom border of the screen
    and unhides there. The taskbar is now located on page
    0 1.  You can't see it on 0 0 anymore.

Fix: ?

Bye

I can confirm that key bindings and input focus are broken with
shaded windows.  I even found the instruction that breaks it,
but I don't understand why.

>From builtins.c:

    /* All this stuff is necessary to prevent flickering */
    set_decor_gravity(tmp_win, grav, UnmapGravity, client_grav);
    XMoveResizeWindow(
      dpy, tmp_win->frame, small_g.x, small_g.y, small_g.width,
      small_g.height);
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent, cw, 1);
    XMoveWindow(dpy, tmp_win->decor_w, 0, 0);
    XRaiseWindow(dpy, tmp_win->decor_w);
    XMapWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent);

Comment out the underlined statement and it works.  If I replace
that statement with 

    XMoveWindow(dpy, tmp_win->frame, small_g.x, small_g.y);
    XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->frame, small_g.width, small_g.height);

The XResizeWindow() call causes the bug.  Furthermore, 'small_g.height'
can be replaced with any number and it's still broken.  But if I replace
it with the current height of the window (frame_g.height) it works.

Oh, and BTW, the problem seems to be that no key events are reported
at all, i.e. fvwm has no chance to do something.  The client window
doesn't get keyboard input either.  Any ideas what's wrong?

Bye

Uh, can you please strip it down to a single file that shows the bug,

Keeping the GTK stuff exclusively is no option.  It fails to calculate
different colours e.g. if the original colour is black or white.  You
end up with all three colours black or white.  Perhaps we can tune the
'brightness' calculation in the new code so that colours aren't
considered 'bright' not as easily.

Yes, I will look at this and the other "non-sticky autohide taskbar
bug". However, do you see any reason to use a non-sticky TaskBar (and
moreover autohide) ?

I do not think that I will try to fix this one ...

I've made an exception from the new way for two-pixel borders.
That should save us a new global option.

This means that you should should update your config file:

  Module FvwmAuto 200 Raise Nop

is not the correct way to start FvwmAuto.  Shortly
after the transient menu is opened, FvwmAuto sends the 'Raise'
command for this window to fvwm.  Before fvwm receives the
request, the application (e.g. kfm) grabs the X server so
that fvwm freezes.  When you select something from the menu,
the menu is unmapped.  Since fvwm handles pending X events
always before pending module input, the window is unmapped
first.  Now fvwm reads the module packet, but since the window
therein has already died, fvwm asks the user for a window to
raise.  It was pure luck that this didn't happen before.

Solution: Use the 'silent' prefix as recommended in the man page.

  Module FvwmAuto 200 "Silent Raise" Nop

or even better:

  Module FvwmAuto 200

I have made a patch to prepend 'Silent' automatically when FvwmAuto
sends its commands to prevent this, but I still recommend to
fix your config, especially since it may serve as an example for
new users.  We don't want to teach them deprecated syntax, do we? ;-)

If I don't want it only on certain desks?  I'm aware that the TaskBar
will never work properly if it's not sticky.  Perhaps we should simply
force it to be sticky somehow.  I think we can't do much about autohiding
anyway since the taskbar would have to check for page switches
during the animation.  Only fvwm can handle this properly.

I agree that this would be a nice feature-- it looks like it was even
intended to exist:  The man page calls for a 'MouseClick' function in the
CursorMove documentation, but I can't find any other mention in the
documentation or source.  Additionally, I was playing with some key binding
stuff, and couldn't find a way to have keybindings work in the context of a
modifier being turned *off*  (i.e. this key only works when num-lock is
off).  Perhaps I overlooked the way to do this, so if anyone could tell me
how, I'd appreciate it.  If there isn't currently a way to do this, consider
this my request to add such a feature.

Yup, a bug.  It wasn't intended this way.  I've now thrown the
old way of drawing fvwm borders overboard and tried to rewrite
them with a strong 3d look as possible while still showing one
pixel of the border colour.  In my eyes the newest code looks
better for 3, 5, 6 and more pixels.  2 pixels are unchanged
and 4 look much like motif borders.  I don't know what to do
about this, though.  I could change the bottom/right border
so that the hilight colour is replaced with the shadow colour,
but that won't enhance the 3d look.

BTW, I could also fix the bug that made the bottom left corner
look a bit strange.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Oops.  I forgot to remove this.  There won't be a MouseClick command.
Although it might work, we would run into great trouble regarding
button grabs, double clicks, holding buttons, etc.  The proper way
to do this is to use XKB as hited at in our FAQ.

Er, don't specify num-lock in the modifier list?  Or do you want
to bind something to all modifier combinations with num-lock
not pressed?  In this case you'd have to bind the action to every
possible combination of modifiers.  X wants it this way.  You
don't really want to do this because you would have to bind
hundreds of keys for each window.  Even if fvwm did this
automatically this would slow things down *dramatically*.
You can try this with the 'IgnoreModifiers' command. Say e.g.

  IgnoreModifiers 12345

and start fvwm and pour a hot cup of tea :-)

Please pay close attention to the exact circumstances when this happens.
My guess is that only icons are screwed up during a recapture or
restart.  I'm positive that the new window placement code is bullet
proof (regarding restart and recapture).  I have seen a window shading
or unshading (can't remember which) to page (0, 0) too.  There is
possibly a place where update_absolute_geometry() is not called when
a window is moved over a page boundary.

Hm, yes.  That's because the window is iconified again to apply
the style updates.  Can I disable animation somehow from within
fvwm (not sending the iconify packet is no option).

I found another bug with WindowShade that may or may not have something
to do with it:
Sometimes, when I unshade a window after a while it's been shaded, it
only unshades to some length roughly the size of my titlebar or less.

Hello,

I found another windowshade bug that has to do with bindings:

I launch a window and shade it.
When I try to resize it from the top corners it resizes as it's supposed to.
On the other hand when I try to resize it through the bottom corners the
window is moved instead of resized.

Best Regards,

Neil

Do you have the latest code (i.e. 2.3.11)?  A while ago
a shaded window had no bottom border, so you couldn't resize
it there, only move it.  Newer versions have a full border.
BTW, you may not be able to grab the bottom corners of shaded
windows because they are completely covered by the top corners.
You won't see the corresonding mouse cursors where you expect.
If you don't have the sides of the window bound to resize it
you may not be able to access the resize binding where you expect
to.  There is not much we can do about it, though.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Never write mails before thinking.  Of course I can do
something about it.  Consider it done.

I think I have fixed that on 20th of December, i.e. 3 days

most of the fvwm default styles
* The above scripts are installed in FVWM_CONFIGDIR
* !WARNING! New section EXAMPLES in FvwmScript manual page !WARNING!
* Note: ScriptFvwmDefaultStyle is the only "new" script. This script
is done for styles that can be reasonably applied to all apps, but the
style that I consider to be a "theme style" (as colors or font). If
I forgot a style or put an unuseful one say me.
* Any flame are welcome :o)
* Bonne nouvelle année !

Note that all the error messages you sent us point to errors in
Sun's header files.  Not that I think there's something wrong with
Sun's header files.  More likely theres something wrong with your
gcc installation.

I just  rechecked and I'm not  having any problem building with "gcc".
(Solaris  2.6, gcc  2.8.1.  I don't  know  why, but "configure" picked
"g++", not "c++" in my case.

Unless theres  a specific reason you  want FvwmConfig, you  can bypass
this problem by adding --without-cxx to the "configure" command line.

I will close this problem report, it doesn't look like an fvwm problem.

I've slightly increased the limit before the hilight colour
is darker than the original colour. I think since this only
applies to bright shades of grey or colours with very high
red and green parts this should be okay.  I really don't
want to keep the buggy old code just because people have
gotten used to the bug.

Fixed in 2.3.12.  After some of the AddDecor() rewrite the button
was activated before the NoButton style was evaluated.

I   don't think    this   is      a   flame, but  the    file     name
".fvwmrc-script-setting" is inconsistent  with the names being used in
FvwmAnimate, FvwmForm, and FvwmRlogin.

For those forms, the config files are:

.FvwmAnimate
.FvwmForm
.FvwmRlogin

Hey, some Francais I understand!

Paul (PDS), I've tried to use dmalloc with fvwm but ran
into several problems that make dmalloc useless for us
if they can't be solved:

 1) All modules and fvwm itself dump their log into the
    same file.  The last one to exit wins.  This can be
    circumvented by compiling everything w/o dmalloc,
    then reconfiguring and compiling fvwm or the specific
    module with dmalloc.
    [inconvenient but no show stopper]

 2) modules/FvwmGtk/menu.c can't be compiled with dmalloc
    because the dmalloc header does something bad with a
    macro 'FREE' that seems to be used in g_free.
    [can be circumvented by removing g_free() from the file]

 3) Virtually all memory allocations are reported from
    safemalloc.c :-(  A stack trace is needed to make this
    information usable!
    [very serious problem]

 4) dmalloc reports *thousands* blocks of unfreed memory
    when fvwm exits.  This makes leak detection nigh
    impossible.

Any ideas how to solve these problems (don't care about
1 or 2 unless 3 and 4 are solved)?

Bye

Dominik ^_^
