No, that did not help.  But the pager has recently become wider
again.  The width to height ratio is now 2:1.  I'm not sure if it
was your commit that caused it.

Hi there,

Okay, I have thought in totaly wrong direction ;-)

For each picture one http request and one answer is needed.
This means your computer has to send one IP packet and it
has to receive _at least_ one IP packet for each file. It
will receive propably more than one packet since if your are
on an ethernet the maximum transfer unit (MTU), which is the
maximum size of an IP packet, should be set to 1500
bytes. This is the size which can pass the ethernet
connection directly. If the MTU is set to a larger value the
overhead is even more.
The IP4 header is between 20 (very likely) and 60 Bytes in
size, which gives a relation to the data to transmit of
about data/overhead = 75..25 on large files. The pager icons
are between 200 and 1000 Bytes in size which gives a data
overhead relation of about 50..3 (worst case - 60 Bytes
header and 200 bytes data).   

I think http and lower network layers as ethernet do not
have a big overhead - but I am not that sure :-)

Not really - To check this you can store the pages and its
images with 

wget -r --level=1 --relative --no-parent \
     http://www.fvwm.org/index.php \
     http://www.fvwm.org/pictures/decorations/window_deco_simple_steelblue/

This downloads about 700 kB which includes index.php and all
relative liked pages. The additional window decoration is
needed since wget does not obey to css definitions. 

wget should put it to the local directory ./www.fvwm.org/
from where you can load index.php in your browser. If your
browser does not know what to do with file extension .php
you might need to change is to html.

> Yeah. I would think choosing a clever order of the

Bob made a workaraound which might lessen the problem. But I
don't think much since as he said the problem is that the
pager contains text which size depends on the user's browser
settings.
Another possibility would be to use one ready (generated)
picture for the whole pager. Links could be declared with a
image map. Currently this is not supported by the navgen
concept at all and would make hilighting pages difficult. We
might think about if and how this could be done using the
current concept.

In most cases, the client has the image already cached.
In that case, the client (browser) sends about 550 bytes to
the server.  Those 550 bytes include the timestamp of the image.
The server responds with about 100 bytes indicating that the
timestamp hasn't changed.

Thats about 650 bytes per image regardless of the image size.

The slow part is not in the data itself, but in the delays between
sending and receiving.

I'm not sure what you are recommending.

On my mandrake system I just installed the apache rpm.
It left a "httpd" daemon in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

php was enabled by default.
I could then access the new php pages by using

file:/home/xxxx/index.php

in the broswer.

On my home system I don't want to run httpd by default so I just
moved the httpd script to /usr/sbin.

I'm finding the mis-match between the quick jumps and the pager labels confusing.

For example, there are 4 entries in the pager under screenshots,
but only 2 quick jumps labeled screenshots.

Using the alt tags in the pager, for screenshots, there are the categories:

screenshots
desktop screenshots
window decorations
menu screenshots

Then if I click on screenshots in the pager I get:

desktop screenshots
window decoration screenshots
menu screenshots

It would help if the quickjump was labeled "window decoration screenshots".

Then there would be 3 quick jumps but 4 pager entries.
The extra entry in the pager is for the "desktop sub menu".
It would help if the alt tag reflected this somehow, but that
would still leave desktops inconsistent with the download
pager which doesn't have a sub menu.

Maybe the sub menus should be eliminated.

	Yes, it did. I made it a little too wide, and I'd like to try making it
a little narrower. I'm also going to try specifying the width for the
parent cell in the top-level table, which may help (I just noticed that
it had a width of 1% specified, which could encourage a browser to
indulge in a bit of overly agressive rendering while waiting for another
chunk of HTML to come across a slow line). We may want to back the
change out altogether, but I'm not sure yet.

	I committed this change a few minutes ago, and it has now propagated to
the live Web site, so give it a try.

	Does anyone else see the problem you're having (the resizing, not the
wider pager)? I can't make it happen no matter which browser I use. I
don't have a 1.0 Mozilla, but I do have an old 0.9.8 version lying
around, and that works fine (but that's over my cable connection, I
can't access a slow connection with that machine). The only really slow
connection I have access to is an AOL dial-up, and that doesn't resize.
Of course, AOL uses IE for its browser, so that doesn't tell us much
about the Gecko derivatives on a slow line. But it's slow enough to see
the page rendering begin, the empty pager frame appear at the proper
size, the text in the main "window" frame rendered, and then the images
start appearing in the pager - without the pager resizing. This is
exactly the way it's *supposed* to happen.

	Does anyone else have access to a slow connection and a browser other
than Internet Exploder? If so, would you try out the pages and let us
know if you see the resizing problem Dominik describes?


Cheers,
Bob

I always saw this, even using localhost after a complete reload.
Opera, Konqueror. This happens now too.

I don't call this a problem, it is nice fast browser rendering engines.

As for the pager it is still too wide, the width should be 80, not 100.

Mikhael.

I'm really impressed with the level of response we are getting this
time around.  Would it screw things up too much if I added $100 U.S.
to the prize money?

My opinion.

I don't think it is a good idea to buy a logo.
It adds more greed than a healthy competition.

If already there is a prize, I don't think it is the developers who
should budget it (sponsors, supporters, users).

If already there is a prize, I don't think it should be all to one, none
to others. By submitting the logos every participant gives us nice images
to use even if they are not the winner. Old logos were used everywhere.
Maybe choosing 3 first winners.

Of course I am not going to argue if anyone enjoys getting nice logos and
changes the prize. It is only that I do not participate with money. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

The FPFocusClickModifiers default is "N".
What about using "A"?

I cannot reproduce these 2. I see nothing wrong at first look.

I get the following when I press the title bar and do not release

	I really hate to ask this...but are you absolutely sure the browser
isn't pulling a cached copy? If you view the source you should see 2
occurrences of 'width="100"'. If that's the version you're getting, and
if you see what Dominik described - not just a little resizing, but the
"window" frame rendered to fill the whole window and then resized to
accommodate the "pager" frame - then I don't know what more we can
do to try to prevent it (other than maybe making the whole pager an
image-mapped image, but I agree with Uwe in not liking that idea too
much).

	But I still can't see it happen here with NS 6.2 & 7.0, Opera 6 & 7,
IE6, Mozilla (old)...

> I don't call this a problem, it is nice fast browser rendering
> engines.

	I don't think so. I still say it's over-aggressive if the browser
starts rendering a row of a table without waiting to see if any of the
cells specifies an explicit width. Redrawing the window after it
dicovers its layout assumptions were wrong slows things down, it doesn't
speed them up. Starting to render while images are loading is fine, but
not before at least getting the HTML description of the cells in the
first row. These days more and more HTML authors (and authoring tools)
have caught on to the trick of explicitly specifying image dimensions
(and cell dimensions where they think it matters, often to excess), so I
think that the likelihood of the browser's guessing correctly is
overshadowed by the likelihood that it will receive explicit layout
information in the HTML row and cell description.


> As for the pager it is still too wide, the width should be 80, not
> 100.

	In theory, yes. But here again, we're at the mercy of the individual
user's browser and the fonts that it uses. On my system, 80 will be just
a bit too narrow for the page heading "Documentation"...so the browser
will go ahead and take 100 anyway. On your system, 80 is presumably just
right. That's why I don't like to specify absolute widths (except for
images) unless it's absolutely necessary. As I said, we may want to back
the fix out altogether if it doesn't produce the desired results.


Cheers,
Bob

Hi there,

This concept was not that good. I had set this up on my
computer and had some tries. I realized that it uses even
more cpu load than the class concept which I like more since
it is structured. I made some performance messurements which
showed that the class concept needs about 5 percent more cpu
load on the server than the current function concept. I
think that's resonable - I'd like to go with that.

I have ported the current default layout from May 1. The
last changes Bob made should be included. Currently I have
got the following files:

web-theme/classes/base_class.inc     // base class description
web-theme/classes/default_class.inc  // class for default theme
web-theme/classes/plain_class.inc    // class for plain theme

web-theme/helpers/members2globals.inc // converter definitions

web-theme/themes/default_theme.inc    // theme file
web-theme/themes/plain_theme.inc      // theme file
 
The theme files are almost ready. I think the
conv_link_target function has to be adapted only. 

The new class/theme files will be used if ?theme instead of
?layout is used in the url:

http://www.fvwm.org/?theme=default     // white pager to see the difference
http://www.fvwm.org/?theme=plain       // different navigation style

I commited it today so that changes on the layout files can
be made on the new files as well.

Regards, Uwe

Since it seems you are very interested, here is the story for you.
Just tried in Konqueror 3.1 (slashes help to gets a new html copy).

  http://localhost/////fvwm-web/  # or http://fvwm.org/////

During the first such try the resizing usually does not happen.
Now I add one more slash. The window decorations occupy the whole page,
then are shrunk by a pager. Add additional slash and press Enter,
the same resizing.

With Opera currently I can't reproduce the resizing, it may be because it
is too fast or because you added the width of the parent table in the
last commit. But I can easily reproduce the layout changes. For example,
with some browser size, I see a scrollbar is added at some point and the
whole page is rendered as if there is a scrollbar, but then scrollbar
disappears and the whole page is resized to the right because of this.
Additionally, I see that the margins between the pager and the top-right
page corner are large initially and then they are reduced and the whole
pager is moved and the window decorations are resized. This is probably
because css is now in separate file and Opera starts to render without
loading the css. Anyway, it is all pretty fast and not very disturbing.

Tried several more times with Opera, it returned, I consistently see the
initial window resizing from the whole page in the NEWS page (the tall
window is rendered before the pager cell). Yes, the html has two "100".

I don't think we should do anything about this. Just get used to the idea
that the web page rendering is nowaday less static, more dynamic.
Of course if someone can improve the situation without breaking something
(like changing pager's ratio or making it look better with some fonts,
but worser with others), he is welcome.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi there,

On 01 May 2003 at 13:16:58 +0200, dominik.vogt@gmx.de wrote:

How about the current version? I have "reserved" a width of
80 pixels for the pager which may lessen the prob. 

Regards, Uwe

	I'm starting a new thread on this. There were too many different
subjects under the old one, and it was getting unmanageable (at least
for my feeble brain and eyes). I think that any discussion on the new
class structure should now also migrate to a new thread, and likewise
discussion of page loading speed.

	Dominik - I'm curious whether Uwe's latest changes made any difference
in the pager resizing quirk for you.

	Uwe - If your latest change didn't fix it, the only other thing I can
think of is the old hack of inserting a row with a 1x1 transparent
image in the right-hand cell, having "width="80" (or whatever) specified
in the img tag.

	Mikhael - I have no problem getting used to the way the current
browsers render the pages...but then, I haven't yet seen the extreme
resizing happen. 


Cheers,
Bob

Hi,

I am a final year CS student at the uni of Manch. and I've got to know
fvwm for my final project, I was not acquainted with it previously. I
have created a new module that I called FvwmGamePort designed to handle
I/O from a gamepad and attach some fvwm functionality to it.

I was just wondering if anyone had any comments on a problem that I'm
sure you're all aware of?

I was controling the cursor by calling "CursorMove" but when I call a
menu, the single-threaded design of fvwm will not allow me to continue
manipulating the cursor...

Does anyone have any thoughts on this matter? 
The project is finished, time-wise but I was just thinking that if there
is a way of configuring fvwm to create a new instance of the GamePort
module when a menu is called then maybe my project can be left open for
development using some kind of notion of recursion??? What do you think?

This problem also lead me to abandon dynamic reconfiguration for this
module...

Thanks all,

Sonny

Yes, you can't control cursor when internal menu is open unless you
change the core code. Moreover, the module messages are not processed
until a menu is closed.

So, if you still want to use menus, you should use external menus. For
example create GTK menus using FvwmGtk (I think GTK does not lock cursor
when a menu is open, but you should check this). Or use FvwmButtons to
create something similar to a menu:

  *FvwmButtons-GamePortMenu: (Title "line 1", Action "command 1")
  *FvwmButtons-GamePortMenu: (Title "line 2", Action "command 2")

Of course, I guess the whole idea is to support gamepad controls in the
internal menus... I don't think there is a way currently.

I think this may be solved, but you may need an adequate GUI for this.
Probably you may solve this using dynamical FvwmButtons configuration,
but I can't say anything concrete since I didn't see the requirements.

BTW, any way to read the FvwmGamePort man page?

Regards,
Mikhael.

like to add to the Fvwm/MenuScreenshots web page:

There's only 2 menu screenshots on the Fvwm page, it could do with
a few more - anyone?

I like the highlight & shadow colors (for a selected item) of the
green menus.

  ( What's up w/ vowels in one case & consonants in another BTW?  At
    least be consistent unless you are highlighting your module...
  :)

I think people would appreciate your menus much more if you also
provide the configuration file too.

Just a little idiosyncracy of mine.

Ah yes, quite right - that one must have slipped through somehow.
Fixed now anyhow. (Screenshot updated too.)

Well there's no configuration files associated with the menu screenshots
on the Fvwm web site.

I've added the few config commands necessary to setup the color scheme of
the menus, but I don't think anyone would want the actual menu items,
would they?

SCoTTie! :)

Hi there,

Nice shots.

The screenshots pages are going to be reworked shortly.  The
new  pages  should offer a small menu shot with 4 items only
for the overview page (maybe there will be default entries),
a  more  detailed  shot  with sub menu, a config files which
produces  the  shot  _independent_  from  the  current  fvwm
configuration,  means  colorsets,  fonts,  etc.  have  to be
specified and a set of icons used in this menu. 

I am not that sure about how this will be done in detail but
we will set up a concept shortly. 

For the new page I would like to add  one  or  two  of  your
shots.  So  could  you  please  provide  a config and a icon
package  unless  the  icons  you  use  are  already  in  the
fvwm-icon package available at the download page. 

Regards, Uwe

I can't remember exactly, but if there is any reason it is
backward compatibility.  Changing it may be confusing for people
who define an action, say, with "mouse 1 w s ..." and expect that
it does not raise the window.

In any case, I had to break compatibility for the mousey focus
types since CLickToFocus and SloppyFocus worked differently (I
think, but I'm not exactly sure).

Nobody is expecting that anyone adds to the prize money and you
should not feel obliged to.  I have done a little paid work on
fvwm last year and intend to save the money for various fvwm
related expenses.

OK.

I don't feel obligated but I don't want to make others
feel obligated to chip in either.

Maybe next time.

Yes, it looks better now.  I get the pager immediately, but it
grows a bit later because of my extra font size.  Exactly what you
said would happen.  I think it's good enough now.  We can't
circumvent all possible browser bugs with the design.

Well, I think this functionalaty should not be application or
window manager dependent but in the X server itself.  But I guess
this does not help you much :-)

We have talked about these issues several times.  The menu code is
too interweaved with the rest of the code to be moved to a
separate process easily.  The single threaded design causes big
problems with tear off menus, for example.

Fvwm is already partially recursive ("Wait" command), but all this
does not work well.  The X server has no notion of recursive key
and button grabs, and the individual key and button events can get
lost between the layers of the recursion.

The problem could theoretically be solved if fvwm accepted module
input during manu operation.  But it is already a maintenance
nightmare to keep track of the consistency of the various objects
in memory.  For example, what happens if a module deletes the
window from which the menu was invoked?  It's hard to prevent core
dumps here, even without module input.  And if the invoked
function freezes the pointer, fvwm may hang completely.  And the
module interface lacks the functionality to filter out module
input of various types and allow only input that is harmless at
the time.

	Agreed. I just wanted to eliminate the extreme resizing where the
browser initially allocated *all* the space to the "window".

You are right. I was not that consistent. I have changed it
to "Window Decoration Screenshots".

Or we may add a sub menu for the download section too. I
think that's more consistent regarding to other navigation
possibilities.

Hi there,

Would anyone mind if I change the links in the FAQ file in
fvwm cvs from 

  _+_A HREF="http://fvwm.org/fvwm-cats/"_-_fvwm-cats_+_/A_-_

to 

  http://fvwm.org/fvwm-cats
?

The first is the old syntax probably needed for faq2html
converter. For the new faq2php this is not needed anymore.

No opinion, but we have the same style of links in the NEWS too.

Good hint I didn't notice that - There are only 3 links
like this. The current news2php script filters these lines.
Maybe I will extend the script so that it produces the line:

"Note, the changes for the last STABLE release start with release" 

on the web site as well. But these _+_.._-_ wrappers are not
really needed and do not look that good in a text file
either ;-)

I am going to remove the _+_-wrappers but keep a private
copy the files just in case someone complains ;-)

I noticed that you have changed <pre class="cvs"> to 
<p class="cmdline"> in file dev_cvs.php already. A better
way to achieve linebreaks is using <pre class="cvs"> and
allow line breaking explicitly. With 

pre.cvs {
	white-space:normal;
}

This makes all "command line text" in the same style in the
file and works with all browsers. If browsers don't obey to
style sheet lines are not wrapped put displayed in fixed
font. 

I would like to turn it back to <pre class="cvs">.

So the old browsers show the same original problem this thread is started
from. Also this does not solve the confusion between the continuation
lines and the leading lines. What exactly this would solve?

We don't really should use a monospace font (usually wide) for commands.
<p> or <div> with <br> would look nicer for a visitor, although it needs a
bit more work to write. For me, we should write all commands inside
<p class="cmdline">, but if you see a better solution, do it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi there,

Currently there are two different styles for command line
text on the pages - the <pre> and <p> style. I would like if
we use the same style for all command line text and source
code examples. 

> We don't really should use a monospace font (usually wide)

The monospace font shows that either source code or  command
line  text is shown. But variable font is ok if we signalize
in an other way that this is "special text".

Currently not. Actually the proper way  to  include  command
line  text would be <kbd>... and for source code <code>... I
have played around with this but came not  to  a  satisfying
solution. 

The problem I have with the current solution is that it uses
a  mix  of  different  tags.  Sometimes  <pre>  is  used and
sometimes <p>.  Looking  at  the  plain  layout  you  cannot
distinguish  between  normal  text and the command line text
formated with the <p> tag. That's why I suggested <pre> with
the linebreak option. If stylesheets are used by the browser
and the layout we can allow a line break  within  the  <pre>
tag  by  providing  a css class. If not the user has to life
with a wide page but recognizes command line text and source
code. 

Regards, Uwe

Hello,

A get a core dump with the following function:

AddToFunc CoreDump I Silent Move

Then executing

CoreDump

in a FvwmConsole gives a core dump with the follwing gdb output:

#0  __move_window (cond_rc=0xbfffef84, exc=0x81e93a8, action=0x81e939c "",

CMD_Move is executed with no FvwmWindow as DeferExecution is
"stopped" by silent but with (exec_flags & FUNC_DONT_DEFER)
true. I see various possible fix.

However, Dominik, maybe you will prefer to fix this yourself?

Regards, Olivier

Fixed.

The right fix is to not execute the command at all.  I forgot to
catch that case in __execute_function() when I rewrote the
DeferExectuion() calls.

Por favor leia at ao fim, so apenas 3 ou 4 minutos que podero mudar o
resto da sua vida. Se no tem tempo agora, deixe para mais logo mas leia
com calma. Isto  um assunto muito srio, encare-o como tal.


Factos:
Pode perder seis euros (no mximo dos mximos) o que no  propriamente uma fortuna.
Vai gastar 10 minutos do seu tempo.
Vai precisar duma caixa multibanco.
Pode ganhar muito dinheiro (mas mesmo muito).

Como? Basta ler e perceber as instrues.

Vamos a isto!

INSTRUES

1.  Deposite 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta de cada uma das seis pessoas que
esto indicadas na listagem abaixo. Isto pode ser feito de duas formas:
(1) transferncia bancaria em qualquer caixa multibanco, atravs do NIB indicado ou (2) depsito na conta-corrente, usando o n que est na listagem.

2. Quando depositar Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta-corrente das seis pessoas da lista, envie um e-mail para cada uma delas com o seguinte texto: "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja includo no seu cadastro de correspondncias".
Esta  a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operao bancaria e fica de acordo com a legislao vigente. A legislao diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servio.
Este  o servio! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depsitos na sua conta-corrente faro o mesmo.)

3. Aps ter depositado Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) em cada uma das seis pessoas,
tire o nome da que esta no nmero 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posio acima (o segundo nome passa para o n 1, o
terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em nenhuma hiptese mude a sequncia de nomes. No coloque o seu nome numa posio diferente, porque alm de no ser eticamente correcto, s o vai prejudicar.

4. Coloque no seu "livro de endereos" aproximadamente 250  nomes/e-mails.
Esta  a parte mais complicada da tarefa. Tente consegui-los atravs de alguma empresa que fornea listagens de e-mails, u tente consegui-los de qualquer outra forma (em classificados por exemplo). Quantos mais melhor.

5. Completada a etapa anterior (4), envie esta mensagem para esses e-mails.

6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrues deste programa e dentro de
aproximadamente 90 dias voc poder receber, se as pessoas para quem voc enviou os e-mails entrarem, mais de 100.000,00 Euros (Cem mil Euros). Eu sei,  muito dinheiro....

COMO FUNCIONA
Digamos que voc tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3% dos e-mails enviados, o que  uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas minhas duas tentativas tive mais do que 3% de retorno.
1.	Quando voc manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca de 7 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
2.	Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro
3.	Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
4.	Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
5.	Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 21.937 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
6.	Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 164.527 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.

E segue assim, numa progresso geomtrica. Em algum ponto o seu nome sair da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas. Mas, voce recebeu
aproximadamente Euros 199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso funciona sempre. No exemplo acima, voc ter enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce enviar 1.000 cartas/e-mails, pode chegar a receber Euros 898.072,00 - que foi o que recebi. Fantstico, no e verdade?

Por favor leia at ao fim, so apenas 3 ou 4 minutos que podero mudar o
resto da sua vida. Se no tem tempo agora, deixe para mais logo mas leia
com calma. Isto  um assunto muito srio, encare-o como tal.


Factos:
Pode perder seis euros (no mximo dos mximos) o que no  propriamente uma fortuna.
Vai gastar 10 minutos do seu tempo.
Vai precisar duma caixa multibanco.
Pode ganhar muito dinheiro (mas mesmo muito).

Como? Basta ler e perceber as instrues.

Vamos a isto!

INSTRUES

1.  Deposite 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta de cada uma das seis pessoas que
esto indicadas na listagem abaixo. Isto pode ser feito de duas formas:
(1) transferncia bancaria em qualquer caixa multibanco, atravs do NIB indicado ou (2) depsito na conta-corrente, usando o n que est na listagem.

2. Quando depositar Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta-corrente das seis pessoas da lista, envie um e-mail para cada uma delas com o seguinte texto: "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja includo no seu cadastro de correspondncias".
Esta  a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operao bancaria e fica de acordo com a legislao vigente. A legislao diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servio.
Este  o servio! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depsitos na sua conta-corrente faro o mesmo.)

3. Aps ter depositado Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) em cada uma das seis pessoas,
tire o nome da que esta no nmero 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posio acima (o segundo nome passa para o n 1, o
terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em nenhuma hiptese mude a sequncia de nomes. No coloque o seu nome numa posio diferente, porque alm de no ser eticamente correcto, s o vai prejudicar.

4. Coloque no seu "livro de endereos" aproximadamente 250  nomes/e-mails.
Esta  a parte mais complicada da tarefa. Tente consegui-los atravs de alguma empresa que fornea listagens de e-mails, u tente consegui-los de qualquer outra forma (em classificados por exemplo). Quantos mais melhor.

5. Completada a etapa anterior (4), envie esta mensagem para esses e-mails.

6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrues deste programa e dentro de
aproximadamente 90 dias voc poder receber, se as pessoas para quem voc enviou os e-mails entrarem, mais de 100.000,00 Euros (Cem mil Euros). Eu sei,  muito dinheiro....

COMO FUNCIONA
Digamos que voc tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3% dos e-mails enviados, o que  uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas minhas duas tentativas tive mais do que 3% de retorno.
1.	Quando voc manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca de 7 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
2.	Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro
3.	Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
4.	Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
5.	Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 21.937 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
6.	Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 164.527 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.

E segue assim, numa progresso geomtrica. Em algum ponto o seu nome sair da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas. Mas, voce recebeu
aproximadamente Euros 199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso funciona sempre. No exemplo acima, voc ter enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce enviar 1.000 cartas/e-mails, pode chegar a receber Euros 898.072,00 - que foi o que recebi. Fantstico, no e verdade?

FYI, in the next 36 hours I will give a one hour talk at the Perl
Conference. This is the first one listed at:

  http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/05/06/conferences.html

I will speak about "X Window Managers and Perl" and of course about FVWM
in this context. :) I suppose more than a half of participants will be
Windows users, and probably some Perl programmers that use Unix do not
know a difference between X and KDE. So it will be more an introductory
talk. The slides are at:

  http://migo.sixbit.org/papers/X_WM_and_Perl/

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi there,

Just a note about release information on the web site:

To update the web site to a new release one needs only to
change the variable settings, currently:

$latest_stable_release   = "2.4.15";
$latest_unstable_release = "2.5.6";

in the file definitions.inc (quite on top in the file).

These settings are used in all other php-files included the
links to the ftp-directory like:

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-<?php echo $latest_stable_release; ?>.tar.gz

Regards, Uwe

Subject: FvwmPager looses tracks of window goemetry

Full_Name: Roberto Ugoccioni
Version: 2.4.15
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux RedHat 7.3 and SuSE 8.1
X_Server: XFree 4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (193.205.65.5)


I have FvwmPager swallowed by FvwmButtons. It happens occasionally,
unfortunately in conditions I cannot reproduce consistently,
that the pager suddenly shows the FvwmButtons window not as it is
(stretched across the top of the screen), but shrunk to a 
small rectangle in the top left corner of the screen. FvwmIdent
shows the correct geometry of the FvwmButtons window.
If I run another instance of FvwmPager, all is correct.
This behaviour only started to appear once I moved to 2.4.15;
I was using 2.4.5 before and never happened.

The same thing happens when FvwmPager is swallowed not by FvwmButtons,
but by another toolbar application I have written using tcl/tk with
TkXext extensions. In this case though the bug appears as soon as I
do something involving the window manager, all the time.

Subject: DecorateTransient Bug

Full_Name: Neil Ibey
Version: 2.4.15/2.5.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.4.18
X_Server: XFree86 4.3.0
Submission from: (NULL) (131.137.245.198)


If DecorateTransient is turned on for an app, the transient is shown with
just the iconify button. Should this not be the "close" button? Last known
to work with the fvwm95 derivative of fvwm2.  Also, it is not possible to
have no decorations set for an app's main window, yet still have
DecorateTransient do its thing.

Unless someone wants to do it earlier, I will do it later in May.

I want to backport 2 small things first for 2.4.16.
I want to implement Perl library trackers first for 2.5.7.

Not a bug. See this message that explains how to fix your configuration,
so that it will correctly display only "close" button:

Submission from: (NULL) (198.186.202.146)


When moving windows, as soon as the window starts moving, the position
flips to +32767 in the direction of the move.  Move can be enabled and
disabled, as long as no movement takes place, without any adverse effects.
Windows can be retrieved from the WindowList and end up in the upper
left-hand corner of the right-half of the bottom-right desktop.

My setup is two Matrox G-200 (mga) cards, running side be side, each
configured to 1280x1024.

The mouse moves just fine between the two screens.

Can you please post your .fvwm2rc file and your XFree config file
to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org and tell me what exactly you do to move a
window, including the position and screen of the window?

Again Valgrind help as well as fvwm-themes and purify.fvwm2rc

When an FvwmWindow is destroyed and should be SCHEDULED_FOR_DESTROY,
with the old code, it seems that the associated FvwmWindow structure
is never freed. The reason is that the window is removed from the
list of the fvwm windows before the window is set SCHEDULED_FOR_DESTROY
and the struct is not freed.
What I do: Keep the window in the fvwm windows list until it is really
destroyed. This seems logic for me (regarding the existence of the 
SCHEDULED_FOR_DESTROY bit), but I am just afraid to add bugs to
complex functions. An other possibility is remove from list and
to add a list for the windows which are scheduled for destroy.
Any comments?

> decor style

I _hope_ that I've fixed all the memory leaks in the decoration parsing
code. However, I am maybe a bit naive here as I've just added one line
and removed some comments and unused code.
Dominik any comments?

Ooops, a new feature that appear under my hands during this debugging
session (do not know really why ...).
If someone want I can remove it at once. If not I will document it
(usual file access tests X_OK, R_OK, ... but for x (X_OK) the file
is also searched in $PATH. i is R_OK access in the ImagePath.)

Hello,

Attached to this msg 2 new cmds StyleById and DestroyStyleById.
StyleById applies styles to specific windows:

	Pick Style $[w.id] NoTitle, !Borders

DestroyStyleById can destroy such a style.

The implementation solve the pbs with the patch send by Craig Milo Rogers
a few weeks ago:
- When a window is "destroyed" the associated StyleById is destroyed
too (if not a new window can have the same id and the old style by
id is applied).
- No more ambiguity with the Style cmd as we have a new cmd.

I see no strong reason against this patch, but (as we are under
feature freeze) a vote against it. Any one?

By the way I've noted a problem with the DestroyStyle cmd:

- Start an xterm
- Style * SloppyFocus
- Style XTerm ClickToFocus
- DestroyStyle XTerm

Then, the xterm has ClickToFocus (need a recapture to get SloppyFocus).

Regards, Olivier

Is this a final syntax we want to have? I prefer:

  Pick WindowStyle NoTitle, !Borders

Both StyleById and DestroyById (i.e. WindowStyle and DestroyWindowStyle)
don't make any sense on an unexisting window id, so they may work on the
window context just fine.

I think Tim suggested this syntax some years ago together with
SetupFunction, but I can't verify this right now.

Mikhael.

Use a separate list.  Windows schedules for destruction *must not*
show up in the regular window list.

Yeah, maybe you are a bit naive here ;-)  I have long given up all
hope to ever fix the decor code other than by removing it.  To say
more I need a hint where to look.

Good idea.

What does it do?

In any case, it should have a separate command, not mix with other
non-related commands.

Actually I added the command On exactly for this purpose, to have a non
window related conditions. So this or similar syntax seems ok for me:

  On (Restart) Beep

  On (-x /usr/bin/gdialog) Exec gdialog --msgbox text 100 100
  Cond (NoMatch) On (-x /usr/bin/xmessage) Exec xmessage text

  On (!ReadableImagePath) On (-X xmessage) Exec xmessage "Bad ImagePath"

I think "On (!ReadableImagePath, -X xmessage)" syntax should work too.
BTW, this means I don't think "-i" is a good name, ReadableImagePath is.

Mikhael.

I did, the spec is in WindowStyle_proposal.txt in CVS. I was waiting for 
the feature freeze to be over before starting on it.

I would like to see WindowStyle and DestroyWindowStyle in 2.6.x as
implemented in the patch, it makes many things clean and possible.

Either it is called new or old, it's a good feature. Can you argue that:

  * We all (users/developers) dreamed about window specific Style.

  * The patch in the question is not problematic (you may verify it).

  * We already discussed WindowStyle and decided (including Dominik) that
    this is the right thing to do. It even (together with StyleFunction)
    may eventually replace Style as we know it now. Having WindowStyle
    that works on window context is good regardless of whether we have
    Style or StyleFunction.

  * Style by id (works on one existing window) and Style by name (works
    on many existing and non-existing windows) should not be mixed, i.e.
    it should be 2 different commands with the first having a preference.

  * In the future all individual window states may be mixed with
    individual window styles, i.e. "Stick" is just "WindowStyle Sticky",
    but this is for the future. Currently we just need WindowStyle
    as defined by the posted patch (with the command name changed).

To see WindowStyle is not really a new suggestion, here is a thread:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0112/msg00226.html

(all "WindowId $0" tips should be read as "ThisWindow" in the thread.)
Again, the whole implementation of this is for the future, adding
WindowStyle now is only a small and safe step in this direction.
Even if in the future some internals may be changed the syntax is not.

Regards,
Mikhael.

During 2.3.x we added new features during feature freeze.  Of course
adding a new feature should lead to discussion and voting. But I do
not think that we _must_ not add some.  During development period we
may, for various reasons, postpone/forget/miss certain stuff. Then,
during feature freeze we can "fix" these stuff.

Oh yes. For me, these commands are just _workaround_ commands: This
feature is important and it is easy to get it so why we should live
without it?
Because, we have an ambitious project "the WindowStyle command" which
leads to "Conditional Style"?
Well, with the current FVWM development logic we will have to wait 3
years to get something that can do what StyleById can do now (and I am
optimist ... I do not think that we should start a discussion on FVWM
future now).

2.5.x is in feature freeze.  If you feel the need to add new and
potentially disrupting features now, please split off a new
project and do it in a separate CVS repository.  Full stop.

Of course it is problematic.  Style handling itself is very
delicate and one of the richest sources of bugs.  Just read the
archives to get a feeling for what I mean.

Please speak only for yourself.  I never agreed to a particular
solution and I won't participate in a design discussion at this
point in time.

See my reply to Mikhael's post.  If you prefer a neverending beta

Should the StyleById patch be applied before 2.6?  Please cast
your votes here.

I vote for "no" because

  1. It will even further delay delay the 2.6 release.
  2. It will destabilise the code because of the delicate nature of
     the style to window propagation.
  3. It does not introduce a data type identifying a style, just
     passes lists of arguments to the style functions.
  4. It unnecessarily exports knowledge of style related design
     choices to sub functions that do not need to know about them.
  5. Because id-specific styles are kept in the same list as the
     normal styles, it will cause memory consumption by the style
     list to explode under certain situations.  Clean rules for a
     new style preference order are needed first.
  6. It introduces inacceptably complicated if-conditions and code
     duplication.
  7. We will regret the ad-hoc syntax very soon:
      - It is not flexible (mixing different kinds of style patterns
        is difficult).
      - The syntax does not help with state-specific styles.
      - The syntax does not help with regexp style name matching.
      - It may further complicate abstracting the style parsing
        code to allow all style names in other contexts (e.g.
        conditions).

I vote "yes". But maybe the patch should be applied later.

I recall my intention: style by id is a great feature, with a simple
_hack_ we can get it, so it is difficult to me to do not wrote such
code.  Yes it is a "hack" it is not the new great "WindowStyle"
command we want (which needs more discussion and an enormous code
reworte).  Yes it is just a simple piece of code with some theoretical
problems, but ok I think in practice.

About the code: a style in the style list is identified by its name.
With the StyleById patch a style in the style list is identified with
either by the XID used (generated by the StyleById command) or the name
(generated by the Style command) not both. The only change in the
earth of the style code is the test "these two styles have the same
"identifier"". The rest of the code is basically obvious ("decoration"):
parse and use already written function.

About this two it is difficult to be sure of something. I think that
the patch will cause only very few problems. If we want to do a
"perfect" WindowStyle command, then this surely delay a lot 2.6 and
destabilize the code. But StyleById is not perfect by nature.

Not sure to understand. There is a new element in the window_style
structure xid (!=0 if and only if the window_style was generated
by the StyleById command).

Not sure to understand. As FocusStyle vs Style? Not a big issue
IMHO.

Adding _a_ style by id is the same thing as adding a style with a name
which do not already appear in the list. There is style list
simplification/merging in between style by id. Only UseStyle is not
supported by the patch (not a big issue, this can be documented).

The complicate if-condition is just a visual complication. We can
add a macro STYLES_HAS_THE_SAME_IDENTIFIERS(*style1, *style2) and
maybe a macro which test if a fw window "match" a style "identifier".
I do not see code duplication, but the way to safely do a
strtoul (we can put this in one function somewhere).

As I said It is just a tmp command.

If its just a temporary command, it would make sense to wait until
after 2.6 although I'm not sure why a temporary command
should ever be committed.

I recall my intention: style by id is a great feature, with a simple
_hack_ we can get it, so it is difficult to me to do not wrote such
code.  Yes it is a "hack" it is not the new great "WindowStyle"
command we want (which needs more discussion and an enormous code
reworte).  Yes it is just a simple piece of code with some theoretical
problems, but ok I think in practice.

How exactly "StyleById <id>" is different from "WindowStyle"?
Both implement exactly the same thing: individual window styles.
I see no reason to have a temporary syntax when there is a final syntax
that we like even if the current implementation may be not the best one.

Regarding some Dominik concerns.

First, probably the current Style and DestroyStyle implementation is
delicate and even problematic. But since the new command uses only the
existing implementation, it does not adds problems by itself. It may only
help to find the _existing_ problems faster since it does DestroyStyle
more often than usually.

So, I would say the new command may only help to stabilize Style code if
it is not stable yet (seems pretty stable). The new code is really small
to add any instability by itself, I will test it throughly anyway.

Second, I can understand some Dominik worries regarding the code purity,
but if we are honest, a possibility to have individual window styles in
this year (i.e. 2.6.0) is much more tempting than minor code issues.
It is not that the code is out of control now (I can understand what the
patch adds without looking at the rest of the code).

I thought about weither individual window style entries (one per window)
could be stored in a separate list and never be merged (only deleted),
i.e they always take a precedence. But this seems to be non intuitive,
probably a user wants all terminals to be affected by "Style XTerm
Borders" even the ones that were individually defined to be borderless,
so the logics in the patch (merging both Style types together) is good.

And, BTW, my vote is "yes", but the command name should be "WindowStyle".
And it should work on the window context, a trivial change to the patch.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The patch does look pretty simple.
The patch lacks documentation and test cases.

Maybe I'm missing something.
I never completely understood all the ins and outs of the windowstyle
proposal.  Why isn't this:

Style [ id=$[w.id] ] ....

When style identifiers become more complex than a simple string,
they need to have their own data type, e.g.

  typedef struct
  {
          char *name;
          XID window_id;
          struct
          {
                  has_name;
                  has_window_id;
          } flags;
  } style_id_t;

See above.  Passing all the possible style identifiers through the
function interface to functions parsing some of the styles is not
a good idea.

You need to understand the problem the style list already has.  If
you issue style commands in the wrong order, the list grows ad
infinitum because styles can not be merged or deleted.  Configs
with many style changes (theme switching!) or styles tied to a
window id increase this probability a lot because they add
incompatible style identifiers to the list that prevent merging.

The reson for this is the notion that the last style always wins.
Yes, this is user friendly, but it is difficult to manage in the
code, and introduces a kind of memory leak.  I'd prefer a
hierarchical style preference system

Ack, please no code in macros!  That's what functions were
invented for :-)

Then I agree with Dan:  I see no reason to introduce temporary
commands into stable releases.

This is the syntax I prefered some time ago too, actually:

  Style (Id $[w.id]) ...

But now I think it is relatively bad compared to simply "WindowStyle ...",
because it allows to pass incorrect parameters (unexisting window ids)
and because I think it is ugly and redundant for commands and functions
that by definition should work on the window context to receive window id
as a parameter.

Think about "WindowStyle Sticky" as equivalent of "Stick", both should
work on the window context, it is just intuitive.

Mikhael.

In fact I am not sure. Take this example: a user want a window with
NeverFocus (an xterm as he has executed less -f .xerror and maybe
later he will want to get SloppyFocus again on it if he quit less).
So he set NeverFocus on this window (by id) ... then he reload some themes
component which leads to "Style * SloopyFocus" ... the log xterm
has SloppyFocus. Bad.

The two approach seem reasonable.

I've wrote a "Styles" subject to the PrintInfo cmd which count the
styles in the style list and print the style names (I can commit this
if you want). With fvwm-themes theme switching does not increase the
number of styles! This is probably because fvwm-themes is well written
... and __simplify_style do a very good job!

In fact, it seems to me that you should have to be careful (and do
strange things) for making the style list growing and growing (say
with two style name).

Anyway, maybe style by id should be prioritary vs style by name:
apply style by name and then apply style by id?

If we add this command and in the future re-design the styles cmds,
it will be surely possible to warp style by id to one of the new
command?

Yes the <id> param is not useful. But, I am just afraid that the
future WindowStyle has a syntax which is not compatible.  So, as
WindowStyle is reserved I will prefer an other name as StylePerWindow.

If WindowStyle is reserved, it has exactly the same syntax, just because
it should do exactly the same thing. Otherwise, it is not reserved.

I just like "WindowStyle" name more than StyleById or StylePerWindow. :)

Yes, but then I predict the following scenario may happen too often.
Someone is surprised that some window does not accept focus and Style or
FocusStyle do not work on it, he tries several possibilities with all
names shown by FvwmIdent, then he gives up, asks on the mailing list and
we all debug this situation. At the end it happens that the problematic
window was set NeverFocus individually several months ago and the only
way now to undo this is to execute "WindowStyle SloppyFocus" on it.

Another argument for the "total merging" approach is that "theme
switching" should not be different than Restart, and on Restart
all individual window styles are lost (at least now).

Finally, if in the future all state commands are replaced by WindowStyle,
I would think this implies the first approach, at least by default.

I agree that two approaches seem reasonable, but I think the first is
more intuitive (even if it is bad in some situations).

It is possible to give an argument to note the second approach like:

  WindowStyle Permanent Stick

This may be done in the future (adding a boolean to a style identifier).
For now I would leave the functionality as in the patch.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I guess.

It could also be:

Style [] ...

I think econimizing our commands makes some sense.
Otherwise, explaining the command will be a bit clumsy.

Does this make sense:

WindowStyle:

This is just like the Style command and takes the same options,
except it applies to the "context" window.


On the other hand:

Style [xxxx]

The xxxx matches a window on name,class, or resource.  If omitted,
it matches the "context" window.

So, do you think it makes more sense if the id is omitted?

After actually reading the sources, I see it is more "ReadableImage".

So, I think I prefer these names instead:

  -x, -r, -f   - the same as the equal file flags in test/shell/perl
  -X, -I, -M   - search for the given executable/image/module in its PATH

Goodday!

It is with hope that I write to seek your help in this context.

I am Mrs. Victoria Guei wife of the former Head Of State of Cote'd
Ivoire,Late General Robert Guei who was assassinated on the19th of
September 2002 in a military uprising in my country.

I got your email address from network directory.I apologize if I have
infringed on your privacy.


However,since my husband death, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present administration of
President Laurent Gbagbo. The security agents in the country have subjected
me to physical and psychological torture. Subsequently, events in my
country has now led to the break up of the country with many displaced
individuals including Foreigners. This you would have heard in the news.

Unfortunately, loyalist soldiers of the present leader of the country,
President Laurent Gbagbo have continued to loot and assassinate those
perceived to be against his regime.

In view of these,I secretly left my country Cote'd ivoire for the Accra in
Ghana to seek asylum.
I am using this medium, to humbly approach you for assistance in the
resettlement and relocation of my three children and I out of Accra-Ghana
where we are temporarily seeking Political Asylum.

Besides, I am equally, using this correspondence to seek and request your
assistance and cooperation in a sensitive but highly beneficial financial
arrangement. 

Prior to the death of my husband, he deposited a huge amount of money in a
consignment in a security companys vault overseas. The fact that my
husband is Dead and we continue to accumulate huge debts daily as long as
this consignment remains in the security companys vault, made me decided
to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as possible to receive these
funds.my plan is to invest the money so as to safeguard my future and that
of my children. It is very essential that you understand the kind of trust
and confidence I want to put in you. This is an act of desperation on my
part, in order not to loose this money.

For your reliable assistance, if willing, I will reward you with 25% of the
money.

As soon as you declare your willingness to assist, i shall furnish you with
the details and information you will need to accomplish this task.

For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our
communication very secret. Do not mention my familys name or disclose the
transaction to anybody.

Thank you in anticipation for your assistance in enabling me achieve this
goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest
on your part.


Yours sincerely,

 Mrs Victoria Guei.

If you read the message it says I have added a directory, I didn't do any
commit of files yet.

If you know how to add a directory _and_ display any comment by Jason
scripts, let me know. cvs add -m "added a directory" dir/ does not work.

Mikhael.

Hm, never thought about that.  I don't create new directories
often.

Dot no see why we need a "-". Moreover, if you want a -x (without
path search) give a full path to -X (with your terminolgy).

So I think that  x,r,w,f,i,m are ok.

I didn't feel a need to mix things (-r does not searches in $PATH, so why
should -x), think about non-Unix operating systems with a non slash.
At least tcsh has separate -x and -X tests (the second works on $PATH).
And no other shell I know searches in $PATH. But then fvwm is not shell.

> So I think that  x,r,w,f,i,m are ok.

I really don't know, it is probably just my habit to write "-r file".

Mikhael.

I think "On" is only something programmers understand.  How about
renaming it to "Test" (like the shell command) before 2.6?

No opinion here. You may rename it if you like.

I think it sounds naturally for an English man when used as:

  On (Version 2.6.0) do something
  On (Restart) do something  # this condition is only true in .fvwm2rc

It may be renamed to "If" as well.

Mikhael.

What about "Given"?
("Given" will be introduced in Perl 6 for statement like
  switch ... case.)

Just thought about something new. The current "Cond" and "CondCase"
may probably be mixed into the "On" command.

If we take this "Given" suggestion here goes:

  Next (XTerm) WarpToWindow
  Given (Match) Focus
  Given (!Match) Break

Actually this "Given" syntax is for "Cond".  "CondCase (Match)" may be
replaced with "Given (Match) Continue". Yes I think it is good and useful
to have Continue command (prefix) that just preserves the previous
returning code ignoring a possible returning code of the current command.

Here is an example for a case statement:

  Given (Version < 2.7.2) Echo Please upgrade to at least 2.7.2
  Given (Match)    # do something old
  Given (NoMatch)  # do something new for 2.7.2+

Another examples (probably "-" may be optional):

  Given (-x fvwm-root) Exec fvwm-root bg.xpm
  Given (NoMatch) Exec xmessage "Fix your PATH for fvwm-config & fvwm-root"

  Next (MyConsole) MoveToDesk
  Given (Match) Raise
  Given (!Match) Given (-x rxvt) Exec rxvt -name MyConsole
  Given (NoMatch, -x xterm) Exec xterm -name MyConsole

I think that I like this syntax.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There is something broken in this commit. Please, Mikhael do
not release 2.5.7 before I (or Dominik) fix it.

As requested by Dominik, I've attached my fvwm2rc and X config file.

The Xinerama config is not in the X config file, I'm invoking by hand (with
startx +xinerama).

In further explanantion, anytime I do a move (by clicking on the title
bar), the above occurs.  I can click to move the window by depressing the
mouse and then release the mouse without moving, and nothing happens (other
than the titlebar appearing to depress).  However, the slightest move will
cause the above behavior.

Thanks.

It's buggy. For this to actually work, we should keep separate return
codes for window based conditionals ("Match", "NoMatch", "Error") and non
window conditional, i.e. "Given", the new codes may be "Then" and "Else".

  Given (Version < 2.7.2) Echo Please upgrade to at least 2.7.2
  Given (Then)    # do something old
  Given (Then)    # do something old
  Given (Else)    # do something new for 2.7.2+
  Given (Then)    # do something new for 2.7.2+

And the last example may be:

  Next (MyConsole) MoveToDesk
  Given (Match) Raise
  Given (Match, Xinerama) MoveToScreen  # just an example
  Given (!Match) Break
  Given (-x rxvt) Exec rxvt -name MyConsole
  Given (Else, -x xterm) Exec xterm -name MyConsole
  Given (Else) Echo No good terminal found to run MyConsole

Probably there are more intuitive names than "Then" and "Else", like
"Pass" and "Fail".

Maybe it is not such a perfect idea to combine "Cond" and "On".
But it seems to work ok and separating return codes is good in any case.

What do you think?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Something got broken in fvwm menus.

A config snippet:
#v+
Colorset 4 bg #b4ae9c, fg black, iconalpha 40
MenuStyle LeftMenu Font shadow=3D"2 1":xft:Arial-10:bold, HilightBackOff,=
 \
ActiveFore white, Hilight3dOff, Animation, PopupOffset 0 100, \
TitleWarpOff, TitleUnderlines2, SeparatorsShort, SideColor yellow2, \
AutomaticHotkeys, MenuColorset 4, BorderWidth 1, \
ItemFormat "%s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3>%1|"
#v-

Until now menus with the "LeftMenu" style had black text that turned
white on mouse hover.

This has changed - when I move the mouse over a menu position the text la=
bel
stays black, but the underscore(!) (accel-key marker) turnes white.
Only underscores get the "ActiveFore" option applied.

You may have heard about the incredible "Payback Program" at http://www.tropiconline.net, the most player-friendly casino 
on the Internet. But chances are, if you have heard about it, you probably didn't believe it! Let me tell you, it's absolutely true. Play two days in a row, and on the second day, you get back your entire cash deposit from the day before. 
Let me explain. If you deposit funds in your playing account on one day, then return and make another deposit to play the next day, YOU GET BACK YOUR ENTIRE DEPOSIT FROM THE DAY BEFORE! Whatever the amount, you get it back the next day. No matter if you win or lose on any given day, you can get back your entire deposit when you make another deposit the following day! What other casino gives you all your money back just for returning the next day? I told you it was hard to believe.  And when you combine the "Payback Program" with our other bonuses and incentives - and the fact that you collect your winnings within one hour - you'll see why so many people 
play and win at http://www.tropiconline.net The odds are definitely better here.  Come check it out!

Can you please do two things:

First, there was a patch in 2.4.15 that is supposed to prevent
exactly what you describe.  Could you try out 2.4.14 and see if
the problem shows up there too?

Second, since you say you can reproduce the problem at will with
your tk application, could you please send me all relevant files
so I can try to reproduce the problem here?  I need the fvwm
config file(s) and your toolbar app.  Some instructions how to
reproduce that behaviour would be nice too.

Bye

I would like to have an answer. I get a core dump (stacking ring
corruption?)  or fvwm windows which have lost its client window when I
"run" purify.fvwm2rc.  Here the story.

* Before the 2003-05-18, one logic in destroy_window was to
    - remove the window from the fvwm window list
    - test if the window should be scheduled for destroy
       if yes, return after some job
       if no, really destroy/free the fvwm window
The problem was: when it is the time to really destroy/free the fvwm
windows which are scheduled for destroy (in update.c) as the window
has been removed from the fvwm window list fvwm do not found these
fvwm windows!
  
* On the 2003-05-18 I commit a fix by inverting the logic above:
    - test if the window should be scheduled for destroy
         if yes, return after some job
    - if no remove the window from the fvwm window list
    - really destroy/free the fvwm window
I thought that was not so bad as the scheduled_for_destroy flags is
maybe here to forbid certain operations on the fvwm windows in the
fvwm window list which are scheduled for destroy.  Indeed, I've _no_
problems with this logic (no core dump no fvwm windows which have lost
is client). But, you suggest that this logic is bad (and yes some
"operations" are performed on some fvwm windows which are scheduled
for destroy).

* So, I restored the previous logic (2003-05-20) and add a simple list
of the windows which are scheduled for destroy. This list is used in
update.c to really destroy/free the fvwm window.

I do not know what is the problem ... maybe under certain situation
the window which are scheduled for destroy are put back in the fvwm
window list in a strange way, that I do no understand.

Here the core dump I get when I "run" purify.fvwm2rc. It is not 100%
reproducible (but always happen at the same place during the Iconify
test). I reproduce it more easily if I proceed as follows (need to cvs
update first for my last purify.fvwm2rc commit):

  - install "purify"
  - run fvwm without config
  - Open a FvwmConsole and type:
     Read path_to_fvwm_cvs_tree/tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc
     PurifyInit
  - pop-up the purify menu and select
      "Some Setup" -> "Bloc on Pick after each test"
  - Then, "run all test". You should click and click again to progress
    in the tests 

When I've no core dump I've a "window7" which has lost its
client. The same core dump occur with fvwm version prior to
the 2003-05-18.

The logic that closes STDIN has been eliminated from FVWM.
Instead STDIN is redirected to /dev/null.

Fvwm now seems to work with all the problem applications I'm
aware of including Rox Filer, gmplayer, and rxvt 2.7.9.

Right now the change is in the CVS stable and beta branches.
Providing no additional problems are detected, the change will
make its way into releases.

Several suggestions to the code.

If you move the line "use Tk;" several lines down, then users without
Tk.pm installed will automatically get a nice error window telling them
about this (together with a usual error on the X output).

If you replace the line "use X11::Protocol;" with
"use FVWM::Module::Toolkit 'X11::Protocol';" then the users without
X11::Protocol installed will get the already mentioned error box too.

You may use debug facilities of FVWM::Module[::Tk].

Some trackers are usable now in perllib, should be documented soon.
You asked for ModuleConfig. Please test the cvs version. If you do this
today/tomorrow, I will have a chance to fix it (if needed) before 2.5.7,
otherwise you may just wait for 2.5.7 and hope it will do what you need.

  $configTracker = $module->track('ModuleConfig');
  $configHash = $configTracker->data;
  $font = $configHash->{Font} || 'fixed';

or:

  $configTracker = $module->track(
    'ModuleConfig', DefaultConfig => { Font => 'fixed' });
  $font = $configTracker->data('Font');

Regards,
Mikhael.

Some functions may be executed on it while a complex function is
still running.  For example:

  AddToFunc foo
  + I Destroy
  + I Echo $w $n

  Next (FvwmConsole) foo

This first destroys the window and then prints the window's name
and id.  However, the window must not be found in the window list
anymore so it is not considered in most of the code.

I never saw this core dump, but there were a number of bugs that
were triggered by the Style2-Func in the script.  It boiled down
to something like

  AddToFunc Style2-Func
  + I Exec xterm -geometry 10x5 -T window1 -n window1 -e sleep 1000
  + I Wait window1
  + I All (window*) Close
  + I Exec xterm -geometry 10x5 -T window2 -n window2 -e sleep 1000
  + I Wait window2
  + I All (window*) Close
  + I Exec xterm -geometry 10x5 -T window3 -n window3 -e sleep 1000
  + I Wait window3
  + I All (window*) Close
  + I Exec xterm -geometry 10x5 -T window4 -n window4 -e sleep 1000
  + I Wait window4
  + I All (window*) Close
  + I Exec xterm -geometry 10x5 -T window5 -n window5 -e sleep 1000
  + I Wait window5
  + I All (window*) Close

 1) The next and prev members of the window still pointed to the
    window list (fixed by you in 2.5.7 and by me in 2.4.x).
 2) The code in focus.c ignored the fact that the prev member of
    the window may not have contained anything useful (fixed in
    2.4.x and 2.5.7).
 3) If destroy_window() was called multiple times for a single
    window, it did some of the work twice, e.g. unmapping the icon
    and broadcasting a message (fixed in 2.4.x and 2.5.7).
 4) Once a window was destroyed, X sometimes reuses the same
    window id.  If the timing was right, the code in add_window.c
    called XDeleteContext on that window id and deleted the
    context of the new window assuming it was still swallowed in
    the old frame.  Later, the window got destroyed but fvwm
    ignored the event because it did not find an associated frame.
    (fixed in 2.4.x and 2.5.7).

These patches may or may not have fixed the core dump you got.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi Mikhael,

: Several suggestions to the code.

Excellent! I will address them in the next release. Thanks.

: Some trackers are usable now in perllib, should be documented soon.
: You asked for ModuleConfig. Please test the cvs version.

Awesome! I'll check it out as soon as I can. Thanks.

SCoTTie! :)

I cannot reproduce the core dump anymore. I do not have window7 windows
without clients at the end of the Test too.

We still need to

 - Write at least a minimal birthday announcement and post it
   (volunteers?)
 - Update the web page with an announcement including
     - a BIG birthday statement
     - some information on the IRC chat.  I plan to hang out on
       IRC between about 16:00 and 22:00 GMT on Sunday on both,
       the German and the English channels.
     - Where to send congratulation messages (fvwm mailing list).
 - Some birthday decorations for the web page?

Bye

I made a couple of banners for the web page. Maybe we can
use one of them:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/birthday/

We could include one of these banners on sunday
automatically by the php scripts.

	I would vote for either logo2 or logo4. I think these will stand out
best against the current background. I wonder if we should add an
exclamation mark at the end ("Happy Birthday FVWM!").

> We could include one of these banners on sunday

	Perhaps we should have it (and whatever extra birthday verbiage we
add..."FVWM turns 10 this month, blah, blah, blah") included for all of
the month of June...or do you think it should remain for a longer
period, like, say, till after the close of the logo contest?


Cheers,
Bob

Yes, I can do that. But I need to do that at home since I
don't have the fonts at work :-|

I enhanced the page a bit:

The birthday page got its own class which is derived from
the default class:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/birthday/index.php?body_bg_image=ballons1_bg.jpg
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/birthday/index.php?body_bg_image=ballons2_bg.jpg
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/birthday/index.php?body_bg_image=ballons3_bg.jpg
http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/birthday/index.php?body_bg_image=ballons4_bg.jpg

Suggestions, comments?

Anybody who can write some sentences for this site?

I need also a nice window decoration for the birthday page -
nice window screenshot.

Cheers, Uwe

Hi there,

I have made a suggestion for the web page on:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/

This includes the birthday page as well.

If it is liked I would commit it tommorow morning. Maybe I
remove the link until the birthday page has been finished.

Uwe

I would like to do it on 30 May,. so please spend some time testing it
(2.4.16 is more important).

Dominik, I see 2.4.x contains buggy "the NoWarp position hint option
works with root menus too" patch. If a menu called from a mouse click,
the pointer is always warped to the first non-title item. Please backport
the fix. Alternativelly, I may remove the patch.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I also think that the right syntax is a comma after "Birthday". :)

I like ballons5_bg.gif, but something not too strewn instead of the black
may be ok too.

You may put the following paragraphs into the new birthday page in the
News section:

Read about the FVWM's history.
[incorporate/reformat the text at http://fvwm.sf.net/tmp/fvwm-history.txt]
[probably create a new history page in the Features section]

Join the irc channel #fvwm at irc.freenode.net on 2003-06-01 all the
day and particularly around 17:00 UTC.

Ideas for irc discussions:
  * what is your favorite "F" definition
  * who has bigger monitor, longer uptime, bigger purse
  * who has older fvwm version running
  * favorite pet
  * favorite logo from the submitted ones
  * favorite fvwm feature
  * ...

See the photos of the developers (all happen to be listed in AUTHORS).
[The photos are at http://fvwm.sf.net/tmp/developers.tar.bz2]

[Put some window manager related joke. Anyone?]

> I need also a nice window decoration for the birthday page -
> nice window screenshot.

You may take one of the Dorothy decors. For example
  http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm/starry.jpg
or, if your engine does not support this, any other decor.

Regards,
Mikhael.

About FVWM "recent" history I run a simple perl script around all our
change log (fvwm head and fvwm-web) I get the following:

Is FVWM an active project? Since the 2001-11-01 (2.5.0 fork) we have
(fvwm head) something like:

Number of ChangeLog entries: 1032

Maybe some authors (entries/file) are missing here as sometimes a
fvwm-workers apply a patch from some one else and even if this is
mentioned in the change log my script cannot detect that.
Moreover, there is maybe a few bugs in my script :o

An other statistic. During 2002 the fvwm mailing lists receive
something like 7501 messages (6270 real msg + 1231 cvs commit msg).

Does your script count the time spent preparing these commits? :)

If the script works on ChangeLog I may see some problems, how about file
globing, */*.{in,1}? Another approach is to parse the "cvs log" output.

This may be another statistics/ page in the Features section (together
with scripts to build it). But it is not really essential.

Seems that the current cvs tree has been created on 1998-11-06.

               ^^^^^^
This syntax is now forbiden :o)
About cvs log I found in freashmeat a perl script which produce
stat from cvs log output (cvstat).

>From Juli Mallett (author of cvstat):

"These statistics are provided purely for interested developers, and
are not intended to reflect quality -or- quality of work done by any
given developer in CVS, merely to show activity of operations in the
CVS repository performed by all developers. If you want to use them to
motivate yourself, that's fine, but keep in mind that a bit of useful
work is more meaningful than a lot of useless work."

Subject: Mis-advertised EWMH fullscreen

Full_Name: Ethan Blanton
Version: 2.5.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: XFree86 4.2
Submission from: (NULL) (4.64.26.64)


Fvwm advertises support for the _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN EWMH, but does not
yet provide support.  This causes EWMH-aware full-screen apps (tvtime,
ogle, others) to fail to go full-screen, assuming the window manager should
handle it.  This bug is also present in CVS as of May 4, 2003.

A simple fix (until this hint is implemented, hopefully soon!) seems to be
to comment out the one line in ewmh.c where this hint is registered.

Ethan

I'm currently hacking on the support for combining characters, as
discussed before.
I've written a piece of code to performe combining into precomposed forms
(according to Unicode specifications) that operate on 16-bit values.
Now I wonder how to invoke this from Flocale.c
There's a function to convert between charsets. Can I use this to convert
to 16-bit unicode (UCS-2)?
I'm not sure what arguments to use for this. Or should I use the functions
to convert to UTF-8 first, and then use UTF-8 in my code (add conversion
internally in my function, I know how to do this, but I guess Iconv can do
it directly).

I have a problem with my Xinerama setup , but I do not know how to
resolve it.  I have two screens:  the primary screen uses 24
bitplanes, and, due to lack of memory on the video card, the
second screen has only 16 bitplanes.

I have an FvwmIconMan swallowed in an FvwmButtons on the primary
screen.  The relevant portion of the config is this:

  Colorset 2 fg red, bg green
  *FvwmIconMan*FocusColorset 2

The problem is that the bg colour is completely ignored in the
icon manager.  Even if I change the colour later from an
FvwmConsole, buttons lit in the icon manager always use a gray
background.

I think the problem comes from the fact that my screens have
different depths.  By the way, the same colour set works fine in
all other modules and window decorations.  Any input on this
problem is welcome.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

iconv can surely convert in between UTF-8 and USC-2 and you can
surely use FiconvCharsetToCharset to do the conversion.
FiconvCharsetToCharset is a bit complex because you need to pass
FlocaleCharset and not simple "charset"(the reason is portability,
e.g., some iconv use "USC-2" other (non gnu) "USC2").  Also, note that
for conversion from charset A to charset B, FiconvCharsetToCharset
converts from A to UTF-8 and from UTF-8 to B (gnu iconv do that and
this gives better result with some others iconv).  So, for using
FiconvCharsetToCharset, you should have to "construct"
FLCIconvUsc2Charset exactly the same way FLCIconvUtf8Charset is
constructed in Ficonv.c.  Then, you can write down direct converter
FiconvUsc2ToCharset and FiconvCharsetToUsc2 as FiconvUtf8ToCharset and
FiconvCharsetToUtf8.
Of course, you should also have a FlocaleCharset for the other charset,
but this should happen as the "in" charset is given by the font (see
FlocaleEncodeString).

However, as USC-2 <--> UTF-8 conversions are easy (and fast), I think
the other alternative is ok (maybe faster and with no portability
problem concerning the "USC-2" name). Note that there are already
two functions which perform conversion from UTF-8 to USC-2 (under
certain type) FftUtf8ToFftString16 and FlocaleUtf8ToUnicodeStr2b.

How this is possible? One fvwm run on two screens with different
depth! Outch ... I do not understand. What about running
your two screen with depth 16 (via your X config file) ;o)

(Announcement at end of message)

Mikhael, you mentioned some info on fvwm's history on the sf site.
Can this be merged into the home page before Sunday?  If it's not
ready yet, can someone prepare a dummy page?  In that case I will
try to put up the text before Sunday (but no promises).

What is the status of the page with the pictures of developers and
users?

Who will take care of updating the News Flash section on the home
page with links to the various birthday related sub pages?

Who will take care of distributing the announcement message to the
various places?

          Fvwm - A Window Manager's Tenth Birthday
          ----------------------------------------

On the 1st of June, 1993, the first version of fvwm, venerable
grandfather of many other window managers, first saw the light of
day.  Robert Nation, the original author, bundled the initial
release with rxvt, his still widely used terminal program.  After
all these years, fvwm still stands strong.

We, the developers of fvwm, would like to invite you to the fvwm
birthday party on Sunday, 1st of June, 2003:

 * Visit the brand new fvwm home page at http://fvwm.org.  The
   special birthday layout will be available only for a couple of
   days.

 * Learn more about fvwm's history and its authors and users.

 * Fvwm needs a new, shiny logo.  Participate in the fvwm logo
   competition.  The best logo wins 100 Euro.

 * Chat with developers and users via IRC on

     #fvwm on freenode (English channel)
     +fvwm.de on IRCnet (German channel)

 * Send your congratulations to the fvwm@fvwm.org mailing list.

Please visit the fvwm home page for further details:

Works perfectly well.  By the way, when I move the button bar to
the second screen (the one with depth 16), look like they should.

I would like to get some feedback before I try to resolve these bugs.
These are in both 2.4.x and 2.5.x.

1) 'UnsetEnv VARNAME' does not work, the variable is not unset, instead
   it gets an empty value "". The fix is obvious, putenv should be called
   with "VARNAME" not "VARNAME=".

2) It is documented that 'SetEnv VARNAME' works like 'UnsetEnv VARNAME'.
   I don't very like such (mis)usage of SetEnv, but this is what we have.
   Anyway, this does not work. 'SetEnv VARNAME' is just ignored, because
   I believe the action string is already destroyed when CMD_UnsetEnv is
   called.

3) 'SetEnv VARNAME ""' does not work as expected, it is ignored.
   It seems that GetNextToken is bad at parsing an empty quoted string.

Dominik, any comments?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Have a look at the web page. Maybe you want to put is below
the pictures. If not you can copy the file
birthday/index.php to say birthday/history.php and use this

All pictures are on the site now.

  FVWM BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

  -------------------------

  On the 1st of June, 1993, the first version of fvwm, venerable
  grandfather of many other window managers, first saw the light
  of day.  Robert Nation, the original author, bundled the initial           
  release with rxvt, his still widely used terminal program.
  After all these years, fvwm still stands strong.

  Join the fvwm birthday party!

    * Send your congratulations to the fvwm@fvwm.org mailing list.

      If you are or have been a user of fvwm, please tell us when
      you first used fvwm, how long you have been using it and
      whether you are still using it.

    * Learn more about fvwm's history <link to history page> and its
      authors and users <link to page with photographs>.

    * Fvwm needs a new, shiny logo.  Participate in the fvwm logo
      competition or check out the contributed logos <link to logo
      competition page>.  The best logo wins 100 Euro.

    * Chat with developers and users via IRC on

       English channel: #fvwm on freenode
          See http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml for a list of
          freenode servers.

       German channel:  +fvwm.de on IRCnet
          See http://ircnet.org@irc.tu-ilmenau.de/all_servers/ for
          a list of IRCnet servers.

       A good time to visit the channels is between 16:00 and
       22:00 Grennwich Mean Time

Where do you want to put it? On the birthday site or on the
home page?

Do you want to keep the developers pictures permanently? In
that case I would move it to the authors directory.

I thought the birthday layout would replace the normal layout for
a couple of days.

Have a look at

But where do you want to put the statement you wrote?

Or maybe not.  The behaviour of calling putenv() with just a
variable name is not defined according to the man page on my
Debian system.  The unsetenv() function is designed for that
purpose, but it does not exist on all systems.

I'd say between the "FVWM BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION" logo and the "Quick

suggestions.

Wait for a couple of minutes until the page is updated to
see the new layout (containing a horizontal pager).

Can we do something about the "orange text on bright blue
background"?  It's too hard to read because the text is too
bright.

Yeah I know - Was just a try ;-)

I reduced colors dramatically:

http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/contact/index.php?theme=birthday

If this is still not that good I make this theme
customizeable (which is not much work but I would like if
the birthday colors are fixed) and leave the color
selection to someone else.

What about adding (if 2.5.7 is up)

      * Help the developers to stabilize the 2.5.x developement series
        by testing fvwm-2.5.7 and report bugs.

In fact I will be unable to translate this text in a good way. Here the
text I wrote in french (still one spelling needed).

Un peu d'histoire. Comme dit prcdemment la premire version
(probablement la version 0.5) de FVWM est sortie avec une version de
rxvt le 1er juin 1993.  La version 1.0 est sortie  la fin de cette
mme anne comme un logiciel indpendant. La premire motivation de
Robert Nation tait d'avoir un gestionnaire de fentres plus lger que
twm pour son portable avec un CPU  33 MHZ et 4 MB de RAM. De nos
jours, FVWM signifie F? Virtual Window Manager, libre  chacun de
remplacer le ? (Feline est particulirement  la mode  l'heure
actuelle). En fait,  l'origine le F signifiait "Feeble" (faible).
Mais rapidement, ce prnom est devenu inappropri et un mystre autour
du F a t volontairement instaur (voir la question 1.1 de la FAQ de
FVWM).

En aot 1995 Rob a abandonn FVWM et Charles Hines a repris la flamme
jusqu'au mois de mai 1998. Puis Brady Montz a repris FVWM pour quelques
mois.  Durant cette priode le rle du mainteneur tait principalement
d'appliquer les patches envoys par les utilisateurs et dveloppeurs
et de raliser de nouvelles versions.  Il tait le seul  avoir accs
au code et durant certaines priodes il n'avait pas toujours le temps
ncessaire.  On peut dire que mi 1998 le developpement de FVWM tait
presque mort.

Mais en octobre 1998 sous l'impulsion de quelques personnes (en
particulier Dominik Vogt qui est toujours le mainteneur actuel) FVWM a
chang de mode de devellopement en passant  la mthode du
bazar. Plusieurs dveloppeurs ont eux accs au code via un arbre CVS
(administr par Jason Tibbitts). Le dveloppement n'a jamais t aussi
actif depuis ce changement mme si cela a parfois pos quelques
problmes d'organisation.  Ceci  conduit  la version 2.2.0 en
fvrier 1999. En plus de Dominik Vogt, on peut cit Johan Bengtsson,
Matthias Clasen, Dan Espen, Michael Han, Tomas Ogren, Tim Phipps,
Chris Rankin, Steve Robbins, Paul Smith, Andrew Veliath et Bob
Woodside. Par la suite, certains dveloppeurs sont devenus moins
actifs ou ont abandonns et d'autres sont apparus. Olivier Chapuis
(moi-mme), Brad Giaccio et Mikhael Goikhman durant le developpemnt de
la version 2.4.0 sortie le 3 juillet 2001.  Suzanne Britton, Marcus
Lundblad, Uwe Pross et Jason Weber durant le dveloppemnt de la future
version 2.6.0 prvu pour septembre. Ceci pour citer seulement ceux
ayant un accs directe au code, mais FVWM ne serait pas ce qu'il est
sans les centaines de personnes ayant envoyes des patches (plus de
130 personnes dans le fichier AUTHORS) et les milliers de personnes
qui ont particip ou participe aux listes de discussions de FVWM.

La dernire version stable est la 2.4.16.  La version de dveloppment
est la 2.5.7. Elles sont soties le 31 mai 2003 a l'ocasion du 10me
annivairsaire de FVWM.

Sorry, my mice pasted the wrong url. It is:

  http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm/purpsilver.jpg

You may ignore the LeftOfText, UnderText and RightOfText parts of the
titlebar althought it is not such beautiful without them.

Please no solid red theme for the birthday. :)

Mikhael.

I used this picture but it is pretty poor quality. I also
think the colors do not match that good.

You may try to change the decoration using the script 

pictures/decorations/make_decoration.sh

It prints a short help message. For the birthday decoration
I used in the root of fvwm-web tree:

pictures/decorations/make_decoration.sh purpsilver.jpg 4 birthday/window_decor_birthday 23 -f

4   .. border width of the window
23  .. titlebar height
-f  .. override files in directory birthday/window_decor_birthday

Dorothy, please send us purpsilver.png ASAP. Or something as nice for the
birthday web decorations.

Yes, too much yellow for me. Maybe window colors #fffff8/#283848
and pager bg #f8f8cc?

Also I think that ballons5_bg.gif is too motley and ballons7_bg.gif is
too pale, something in the middle?

Mikhael.

As you said in another message, it's not so easy. Probably we should try
both putenv("VARNAME=") and putenv("VARNAME"). Should wait for now.

Done.

I am more like to fall into the birthday mood instead of starting to fix
such central function like GetNextToken before the release. So it should
wait too. Not critical especially that this maybe currently emulated
by 'UnsetEnv VARNAME', i.e. bug number 1. :)

I'm resending this a second time, as it doesn't seem to have reached the
list. Are 80Kb jpg attachments considered as spam?

It may just be me, but I suspect the background picture for the birthday
pages is doing some really evil and wicked things to my X server. I've
tried to attach a screenshot to give an idea of what I'm seeing (or not
seeing
as the case may be).  :( But since that failed I've put it on my web
server at http://awol.no-ip.org/bad-bleah.jpg

I also had a similar reaction to Uwe's demo pages on his server so it
must be something to do with the code and my choice of browser (Netscape
4.79). Nope! I just tried it with Mozilla too and I get the same thing
happening. 

Maybe it's my X server? Or my xinerama?

I'm using RH9 and XFree86 4.3.0. It would seem to be the code for the
pages window borders at a guess. Dunno.

Anyone else see this?


Alex

P.S. Since I sent this email the first time, many changes have been made
on the web site. All of the birthday decorated pages mess up my X server
very badly indeed. No other web site ever does this to me at all.

I should have asked just what you wanted.  Did you just want the picture in .png format, or are you looking for a bigger screenshot, or ...

A screenshot of one active window without loosing a quality.

The attached png still does not seem to be of 100% quality, see the Eterm

You may place it on the web instead of attachment or send it to Uwe

OK, I think I got it this time.  I made some fresh pngs with no compression.  You should be able to get them at http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm  They're named purple_fullscreen.png, purple_cropped.png, and purple_smaller.png.  Tell me if you need anything else.

A screenshot of one active window without loosing a quality.

The attached png still does not seem to be of 100% quality, see the Eterm
menu for example.

You may place it on the web instead of attachment or send it to Uwe
privatelly. Thanks.

This one is better:

La dernire version de la srie 1.x est la 1.24r qui est sortie le 5
dcembre 1994 (cette version est toujours utilis par certains ...).
En aot 1995 Rob abandonnt FVWM avec pour dernire version la 2.0.33
(la srie 2.0.x a toujours t considre comme des pre-versions) et
Charles Hines reprit la flamme jusqu'au mois de mai 1998.  Mais il eu
de moins en moins de temps pour s'occuper de FVWM et la dernire
version que Charles ralist fut la 2.0.46 le 20 aot 1977.  Brady
Montz reprit FVWM pour quelques mois en 1998 mais on peut dire qu'en
1998 FVWM tait un projet mort en ce qui concerne le dveloppement.

but it seems too early, our web site CVS isn't updated yet.

Can you run news2php.awk?

I didn't see any instructions in the file.

This shot looks strange. Even if the web page is totaly
broken you should not get a screenshot like this.

The actual web page version is tested with 4.79, Opera and
Gecko. I also run html checkers regularly.

Netscape 4.79 has some problems rendering complex tables but
it should still do the current version.

I guess, if you have got the problem with netscape and
mozilla there might be a broken library on your system. 
Maybe libjpeg or something like this.

How about the other themes on the web page? Can you view the
default theme? If so you can replace the "?theme=birthday"
in the url to "?theme=default" or "?theme=plain" which
should always work.

Regards, Uwe

OK, I guess I'm glad it happened over the weekend, but for christ's
sake.  The web server is pumping a gigabyte every ten minutes.  I
would have tuned it for more connections had I known, but it was
already at 255 (any higher and I have to recompile Apache).

Man, I hope that the networking folks don't look at the traffic graphs
until this drops off the front page.  I've joined the few, the proud,
the Slashdotted.

If you don't mind, I'm going to wait until the slashdotting is over.
It's been over two hours and I'm still doing 11Mbps of traffic.

Most of them (99%) will not download the tarballs.

The ones who wants to download the package (the latest) will download
2.5.6. So I don't see any change (to the bad) if you move the 2.5.7
tarballs to replace the 2.5.6 ones. It seems even you may reduce a
trafic, because some will download both 2.5.6 and 2.5.7 later.

Or I don't understand something?

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is probably because of the transparent gif background.
There is no really a reason to have a transparent page background.

To be honest I like the background on the posted bad-bleah.jpg
more than the current one. Pink, orange, violet, brown and lightsalad
are really not my favorite colors. And the page is a bit dark for me.

Uwe, can you please put into cvs transparent ballons.png instead of
ballons.jpg, so I may try to work on it too. :)

I would really like to make the birthday theme more joyful, I prefer
the following color modification to the decorations:

  http://fvwm.sf.net/tmp/purple_smaller-2.png

Can you please adjust the color scheme (including visited links)?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I implemented a first basic version of combining characters.
What it does is "compress" sequences of characters to the
"canonical" pre-composed form.

Additionally a fix for "superimposing" needs to be added.
Ie. combining characters that could not be composed into a pre-composed
form should be drawn superimposed.

Olivier, could you assist me a bit on this?
If I extend my function that does composing to fill in an array mapping
character position in the in-string to their visual position.

For example, let's say there is "o" + "some obscure composing char" + "a",
where there is no pre-composed form for an "o" with "some obscure
composing char", it would give an array: [0,0,1]
That is the first 2 characters should get drawn in first "square", the
last in the second square.

What could perhaps be tricky is to handle BIDI. The mapping array must be
rearranged as characters are reorganised by the BIDI algorithm.

I hope my code is not crashing on anyone. Please test it.
I have tested it, and it seems to work. But maybe I missed something
critical.

Also Nadim, could you test this with Arabic combining characters?

Mikhael,

if you found a color scheme. You may set the birthday theme
as default in file definitions.inc. The lines are already
there they just have to be commented out. I am off for
tonight and may have no time tommorow morning.

Cheers, Uwe
