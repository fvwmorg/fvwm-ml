I carefully began to comment out stuff in my .fvwm2rc to see if
the problem would clear up.  When I commented out the line

Style "*" ClickToFocus

with everything else being the same as before, the bindings began
to work properly.  If you want to reproduce the bug, this minimal
.fvwm2rc works for me.

Style "*" ClickToFocus
Mouse 0  T N Move
Mouse 0  T M WindowShade
Mouse 0 FS A Resize

When you meta-click in the title bar, you'll be put into Resize.
Comment out the Style line and then WindowShade will work.

Subject: StaysOnTop vs. override_redirect
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Hi,

some days ago I have taken a look at the recent version of fvwm
(CVS from 30/12/1998). I noticed that it still has problems with 
the interaction between StaysOnTop and override_redirect windows
(that one is even in your FAQ, Q20).

Examples for the problems are eg FvwmPager when moving a window 
with button 2: The ballon window is unmapped during the drag, and 
when it is mapped again it is obscured by the pager window. 
Another example is Motif menus: Try Style Netscape StaysOnTop and 
open a menu.

I think I have found a solution to this problem, see my patch below.
Basically the idea is to raise windows above all *managed* windows,
not above all windows. I haven't had any problems with this patch
so far, but you may want to check that it doesn't have any bad
consequences (I haven't looked up all places where XRaiseWindow
or RaiseWindow are called).

Matthias

Subject: urgency hint support
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7



The following little patch makes fvwm handle the urgency hint
from ICCCM 2.0 by calling user-definable functions when the
urgency hint changes. It may not be a very important addition
and I don't know if any programs actually use that mechanism, but
it doesn't cost much to add it.

longjmp() is an ANSI/ISO C standard function.  As we've already
discussed WRT stdarg.h, fvwm has firmly moved into the "requires
ANSI/ISO C compiler" camp, so a working longjmp() can be considered a
given.

  dv> So, where don't you agree? We can talk about everything.

I've been away (and technically, still am...) so I've not been following
things closely.  I must say I was surprised to see code the magnitude of
Dominiks menustyle patches go in at this late date, but I don't have the
first idea what they do or what they fix (as I've said before, in many
ways my use of fvwm is quite basic), so I'm satisfied if you-all think
they were necessary.

  dv> Let me explain my motivation behind these:

  dv> Really strange. I don't believe all these people were
  dv> fantasizing. I don't want 2.2 before it is clear what

  dv> One of the top priorities for me.

We need a proper bug report, with someone willing to work with us.  IMHO
some or all of these have been suspicious and I'm not convinced they
weren't all due to configuration/installation/etc. errors.

  dv> 2) the XPM problems (probably in 'configure', bugs #31,
  dv>    #40 and perhaps others)

  dv> Probably the worst problem we have at the moment. There
  dv> have been at least four or five complaints about pixmap
  dv> problems.

I will put something into configure to print out the status of various
optional features like XPM support at the end so people will hopefully
notice if it's not there.

I will try to find a way to get the -R link option set on systems where
that's necessary.

And I will try to incorporate some code to test the XPM version to be
sure it's correct.

Beyond that, there's not much we can do.  People have to know enough to
delete the config.cache file, for example, or read it in the INSTALL
file.  It's not appropriate to remove it automatically every time, for
example: the cache file wouldn't be too useful in that case :)

  dv> 7) install-strip problem (bug #33)

  dv> I think this was an automake bug. I remember some comment
  dv> by Paul (PDS) about this (is that tight, Paul?) and the
  dv> error message from the report seems to confirm this too.

Tom told me he submitted a fix to the CVS tree for automake.  However,
we cannot use that version of automake until we start using the next
version of autoconf, which is also not released and only available
through CVS.  I'm not comfortable with this at all.

I'd much rather leave it as-is and either document it or just live with
it than move to less-tested versions of automake/autoconf.

  dv> I wonder how other autoconf'ed programs do this if they

Most people don't run install-strip.

Ah, thanks. That should suffice to track the problem.

The reason is syntax. There was only one chance to get the syntax straight.
If we'd put the previous syntax into a stable release we had begun regretting
this soon.

Well, I don't know which of these are fvwm problems. And I do agree
the lack of people willing to cooperate is a problem too. I would
have ignored this until someone found a way to reproduce it, but
we had about five independent reports of binding problems. I can't
ignore this.

Great. That's what I was hoping for all the time. Thanks.

OK, I'll not fight for this one. People who make install-strip probably
know how to do it manually. Could you write something about this in the
BUGS and/or INSTALL file?

Can any of my fellow maintainers comment on this? It sounds like
a good thing to fix and I'm willing to put it in 2.2. But I know
nothing about this bug and can't judge if the patch is OK.

Tim, as you know this better than I, could you make the decision
if/how this patch should be committed or if the change you suggested
is more appropriate?

	This looks *almost* ok...the line

      changes.sibling = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev->stack_next->frame;

needs to be changed to

      changes.sibling = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next->frame;

With this change it seems to work ok (i.e., in 5 minutes' worth of
superficial testing I haven't seen any ill effects, and the Netscape
example Matthias gave now has the menus behaving nicely.

	If you like, I'll put the revised patch into CVS later this
evening.

	Matthias: the reason for the change is that you weren't actually
picking up the top of the FVWM-managed window stack, so the patch as
originally written got the stacking order chain out of sync with the
real world and broke some other things, like RaiseLower behavior.

	Hmmm...wonder what the implications of this patch are for the
old "AutoRaise hides my transients under the parent window" bugaboo?
I'll have to do some more testing.

	Well, I spoke too soon. The behavior of the windows does *appear*
to be correct, but I find that I'm getting the following messages on the
console every time I raise a window:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 8, EventType: 4

(This is with my revised version of Matthias' patch.)

	I'll have to look into this a bit further. It's not quite ready
for Prime Time.

Hi Everyone,

	I Just CVSup'ed 2.1.7 and have the following two problems to
report. I'm not sure if they are related to bugs already reported, so I
wanted to bring them up here before I sent in an official bug report.


>From CVS @ Jan  2 13:37

Problem 1:

	SetMenuStyle with a stylename other than "*" core dumps.
	e.g. SetMenuStyle bob mwm 

Problem 2: 

	Menus are not cleaning up after themselves.  I am using a
DGradient menuface.  Occasionally, After dragging down over my menu I wind
up with these 'default-grey' patches on my menu. IE: When I go to a
sub-menu or drag my mouse down along the right side of the menu (over the
triangles) causing the sub-menu's to pop-up and then disappear, sometimes
I wind up with my DGradient menu covered in plain-grey blocks where the
pop-ups overlapped the original menu.  I realize I haven't explained this
very well... so... look at the two jpegs @ http://oneway.com/jay/fvwm/

My SetMenuStyle line:
	SetMenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 64 1 #455561 100 #102020



I can reproduce both of these at will... Should I put these into
jitterbug?  

Jay

I don't see a difference.

Could you use "xmag" on both versions and report the rgb values of the
shadows and highlights in both cases?

Now that you mention it, I have also seen these errors. Request 12
is ConfigureWindow and Error 8 is BadMatch.
Adding some debugging code quickly revealed that these are all caused
my the XConfigureWindow added by my patch which may be called with
window == sibling. It seems that X chokes on that. putting a line
 if (wins[0] != Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next->frame) 
 before that XConfigureWindow call fixes the problem.

I've removed the SetMenuStyle command and merged it with
the old syntax in MenuStyle. This should help cleaning up
this syntax issue a bit.

I've fixed the bug that prevented mouse button bindings with
modifiers on the title bar from working on ClickToFocus
windows. The old code from events.c (GetContext):

  /* Since key presses and button presses are grabbed in the frame
   * when we have re-parented windows, we need to find out the real
   * window where the event occured */
  if((e->type == KeyPress)&&(e->xkey.subwindow != None))
    *w = e->xkey.subwindow;

  if((e->type == ButtonPress)&&(e->xbutton.subwindow != None)&&
     ((e->xbutton.subwindow == t->w)||(e->xbutton.subwindow == t->Parent)))
    *w = e->xbutton.subwindow;

I changed this to

  if(e->xkey.subwindow != None)
    *w = e->xkey.subwindow;

The effect of this was that the frame window swallowed all key
presses with modifiers pressed that should go to the title window
(or the button windows or the side windows etc.).

Any ideas why button presses were treated differently from key
presses here?

Bye

Well, I'm grateful if you take care of this, Bob. These problems
that came up were exactly the reason why I didn't want to touch it.
Feel free to commit the patch when you think it is ready.

That's the problem, there are no shadows on the FvwmForm widgets. I hate to
redirect, but if you could look at http://www.seattleu.edu/~bjk/fvwmprob.jpg it
might explain it better than I can. In 2.0.46 the widgets were raised like a
button, these are flat for me in 2.1.6 (and 2.1.5).

	I tried a slightly different approach, through trial and error
(lots of errors!), which seems to correct the ill-effects of the
original patch and the BadMatch errors introduced by my change. The
thing that bothers me is that I don't understand why.

	Try this, and see if eveything works OK for you. Replace the
line

      changes.sibling = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev->stack_next->frame;

from the original patch with this:

      if (wins[0] == t->frame)
        {
          changes.sibling = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next->frame;
        }
      else
        {
          changes.sibling = 0;
        }

	I know this seems curious, but Scr.FvwmRoot isn't a real FvwmWindow,
and Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_prev->stack_next->frame evaluates to the same thing
as Scr.FvwmRoot->frame, which is always 0. For some reason, in the cases
where the first window in the wins array is *not* the window for which the
raise request was issued, this works. It "works" also, in the sense of not
generating an error, in the case where t->frame is the window for which we
issue the XConfigureWindow, but it fails to raise the window.

	I don't understand the BadMatch errors, since all the frame windows
*should* be siblings. I also don't understand why the XConfigureWindow with
the sibling set to 0 manages to avoid raising the windows above the
override_redirect windows. I'd feel much more comfortable about the whole
thing if I knew why it was so, but this version of the patch does seem to
work. Any ideas?

	The only thing I can think of is that perhaps X whines because the
window in question (it'll be a StaysOnTop or a transient) is *already*
above the top window in the stacking order chain, due to an oversight on
my part. My documentation doesn't show this as a possible cause for the
BadMatch, but I wonder....

	The stacking order chain is only modified for the window for which
the raise request is explicitly issued; it doesn't take into account the
logic that builds the stacking order list for XRestackWindows, with all
the StaysOnTop windows on top. 

	I'll look into this tomorrow.

Things left to do before 2.2 (update/fix/verify):

1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)
   [investigate bug reports]

2) the XPM problems (probably in 'configure', bugs #31,
   #40 and perhaps others)
   [in progress (PDS)]

3) verify the XGetImage problem I encountered
   [pending]

4) apply latest signal handling patches
   [pending]

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix
   [pending]

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)
   [pending]

7) document install-strip problem (bug #33)
   [pending (PDS?)]

8) closing a panel closes FvwmButtons
   [to be verified]

9) FvwmCpp does not know where cpp is (bug #95)
   can you say something about this, Paul (PDS)?
   [investigation pending]

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)
    [investigation pending]

11) hanging up asmodem kills FvwmButtons (perhaps related to 8)
    [investigation pending]

12) this 'serious bug' RedHat found (I'd like to see the patch).
    [investigation in progress]

13) the FvwmCommandS problem discussed recently
    [investigation in progress]

Summary:

6 investigate
1 update patch
1 document bug
1 in progress
4 verify fix

There are five problems left where we don't have an idea
how to fix them (1, 10, 11, 12, 13).

----

stuff done since last update:

 - Fix the remaining memory leaks (95%)
   The remaining leaks won't be done for 2.2

 - snap attraction patch update

Fixed thanks to the signal handling patches.

I've to add another item:

14) Integrate this StaysOnTop related patch by Matthias Clasen

        I get the same problem with 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.
        In 2.1.5, when I click on a button (exclusive choice), it gets
a little cercle in it instead of depressing...

Removed #ifdef defaulting FVWM_CPP to "/usr/lib/cpp", if the symbol

not, an error should be emitted, rather than silently taking a wild

This is in response to Bug #95 (FvwmCpp doesn't know where cpp is),
which is a real bug, not a "feature request".  I can't reproduce the
bug, BTW.

	This one is still broken.  CVSupped 14:13 EST, Jan 3.  Lots of
flicker as well when navigating the menus which you didn't see in 2.1.4.  
I've got them both running, just to verify it...  with 2.1.7 It's like the
menu is drawn in grey and then re-drawn using the gradient?  Is that
indeed what is happenning?  2.1.4 seems to draw initially with the
gradient...  I'm trying to figure out the menuing code, but I must
admit I'm a bit lost right now.

Noticed one difference when using debug-mode on both version 2.1.4 and
2.1.7.  

It seems that when using a dgradient in 2.1.4 the box was initially filled
with the left-most color on the dgradient line, and then covered with the
gradient. (more accurately, the 'background' color specified in the old
setmenustyle command)  

In 2.1.7- the box for the menu is initally filled with the default grey.
If you specify a background color as well then the menus look much
better....

Which leads me to two questions:

	Is it possible to make the default background the first color of
the gradient, if no other is specified?

	Is there some way to 'clear' the default style so that it doesn't
take unspecified options from some previous definition?  (perhaps a 'reset
to default' type thing?)


Also, the flicker is because the DGradient is re-drawn over the initial
menu every time a sub-menu is popped up and then removed (re-exposing the
initial menu).  Forgive me if I am being daft, please, but couldn't we
save the contents of the screen for the menu beneath the popup and restore
it rather than re-drawing the entire gradient(and hence the entire menu) ?

As I mentioned before, I'm still trying to get my fingers around the menu
code... so forgive me if I'm missing something.

Jpg's aren't the best choice for showing color detail, but it looks
like the shadows and highlights both came out black.

I think color allocation is failing.

Are you  using 8 bit  color?  Is it  possible that  you've used up all
your available colors?  Do you see any  error messages on your console
about color allocation failing?

I am using 16bit color. I didnt see anything in my .xsession-errors about
colors failing. It happens on any FvwmForm 'function' that I use (logout
verify for example).

Subject: More ICCCM 2 things
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi again, another day, another patch...

I have expanded my urgencyhint patch to cover all
(I think) missing pieces from ICCCM 2.0. Apart from
UrgencyHint these are a method for client-side 
colormap installation and the "Manager Selection".

While the urgency and colormap stuff is almost trivial,
the selection thing was a bit more difficult and may 
not be 100% correct. It is the first selection owner
code I have written, and I didn't find any examples
to copy (especially for the MULTIPLE target). Right
now the selection is not *very* useful, since you
can only get the icccm compliance level from it. 
But one nice thing which it allows is a secure method
for wm's to take over control from a running wm:
With the patch below, I can simply type 

fvwm2 -replace 

in an xterm and the previous incarnation of fvwm2
goes away to make room for the new one (assuming that
in your X setup, killing the wm doesn't end the session).

Again, the features added by this patch may not be
used by many clients... 

Matthias

I think it is quite understandable that you get a BadMatch if
sibling == window. In my understanding, the sibling relation is
irreflexive, ...doesn't make much sense to place a window above
itself in the stacking order...

Upon reading man XConfigureWindow, I found among the possible errors:

       BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
                 defined Window.

And XConfigureWindow does indeed produce these if sibling is zero. We
did not notice this since FvwmErrorHandler doesn't choke on BadWindow.
Thus using a zero sibling doesn't make XConfigureWindow treat override
redirects in any special way, its just that RaiseWindow works ok
without the XConfigureWindow call 90% of the time. This is not surprising,
if you remember that wins[0], the window being raised will usually
be one of the StaysOnTop windows and thus will already be high in the
stacking order.

The following version is still my favourite:

     if (wins[0] != Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next->frame) {
        XWindowChanges changes;
        changes.sibling = Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next->frame;
        changes.stack_mode = Above;
        XConfigureWindow(dpy, wins[0], (CWSibling|CWStackMode), &changes);
      }

Subject: PRIVATE: Gradient-Menu does not work reliable with XPM enabled

Full_Name: Christian Schlittchen
Version: 2.1.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: 
X_Server: XFree 3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (134.102.20.28)


With xpm enabled, a gradiented menu is only displayed gradiented
as long as no window borders (with pixmaps) have been displayed,
from then on they are only painted in the last gradient color.
Without xpm they work fine.

I'm using a 15bit-depth display, xpm 3.4j and  fvwm 2.1.6.

Note that Randall is on our side here; his statement only expressed his
amusement that someone on the GNOME team would complain about using
"development" versions in a "production" environment, given GNOME's status
as a work in progress with huge piles of bugs.  I don't think Randall has
anything to do with GNOME development.

What do you think is still broken? I don't think you still get

I don't think so.

Yes: 'MenuStyle * fvwm' resets everything to default.

Yes. This is because when a submenu is unmapped the parent menu gets
an expose event to redraw itself. But before it arrives another menu
item is selected. If you have 3d hilighting or background hilighting
on the menu, I'll have to save the new item before hilighting it. But
at this time it contains only the grey blocks you saw. The only way
to get that right is by redrawing the menu right now.

That is a task of the X server (backing storage). Please have a look
at the last wuestion in the FAQ. I added that recently. Apart from
that, how would you know which menus are overlapped? It's easy with
the parent menu, but after that it gets complicated. If you don't
want the flicker the best solution is to make sure the menus don't
overlap. And be sure you have backing store enabled.

Don't try it, it's not worth the effort ;-) I understand quite well
what is happening (I wrote it). If I'd seen a better solution I'd
have done it. German had an idea about converting the gradient
into a pixmap and use it as background. This solution is fast
and without flicker, but I assume it consumes much more memory.

Perhaps we'll do it this way after 2.2.

I've understood that in the meantime. He responded to your mail
and said 'you', so I only could think he was replying to our
list. In any case, I don't think antagonising anyone will
help us the least.

	No Problem.  Adding the 'background #c01010' thing works well
enough.

	Too Late.... I've been playing with Xnest and debugging all day...
I think I almost understand how it works... at least on the visual-side.

	I've been experimenting with exactly that for a few hours now..
and have managed to make it work.  The way I'm doing it is to create a
pixmap, draw the gradient to it and set the background of the menu window
to the pixmap.  Then free the pixmap.  Therefore it doesn't take much
extra memory as we are only allocating it as long as it is needed...  I
imagine that it is a hair slower than the way we are doing it now... but
actually using it I can't tell the difference.  It does reduce the
overhead of redrawing the gradient everytime a submenu is exposed.

Would you like a patch... just to look at perhaps?  It's a change only to
PaintMenu() in menus.c.. (it probably should be more... but for
demonstration purposes...)

Jay

Next time you can as well start with asking me. Rewriting the
menu code was one of the first things I did for fvwm and I do
understand some things quite well.

Go ahead. I don't like the current implementation and if the patch
is simple enough I'll replace it before 2.2.

	Excellent detective work! I had mistakenly thought that this
was happening in a case where sibling != window, but double checking
myself showed this not to be the case.

	Yes, this seems to produce the desired results in all cases.
Unfortunately, I have a little more to do in this area, since, as I
mentioned, the stacking order chain code doesn't keep the StaysOnTop
windows at the top of the chain, so it gets out of sync with reality.

	I have a working version of the correction for this, but I'd
like to test and refine it for a day or two. Then I'll commit that
along with your change.

Well, here it is... I did not do anything except change it so that the
gradients are done into a pixmap rather than the window itself.  
Obviously, if we were to incorporate this approach, we'd want to do less
during expose events, (ie we could avoid re-building the gradient each
time) etc.

If the patch is complete otherwise I will take care of reworking the

No, I'm not claiming the bug is fixed, just that I can't reproduce the
reported behaviour. 

On my system, the correct path for cpp *is* passed at compile time to
FvwmCpp.  It has been like this since the beginning. 

So, either the initial bug report was in error, or there is something very
weird going on with his make or shell that screws up the symbol define.  I
have already emailed the guy who filed the report for clarification.

The change I made yesterday means that someone with a similar situation
will fail to compile FvwmCpp, so we'll see a bug report earlier.

The patch is good but unfortunately it doesn't fix my problem. I think
the problem lies in the configure script.  On my system cpp is not on
$PATH and it's not in /usr/lib or /lib. If I ask gcc where it thinks cpp
is I get the following:

->gcc -print-prog-name=cpp 
/opt/gcc/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-solaris/2.8.1/cpp

The configure script knows that cpp is invoked with "gcc -E" but the
chunk at line 3310 ignores that and tries to set FVWM_CPP by searching
for cpp in a few places.  It fails and then sets FVWM_CPP to /lib/cpp.

I can get things to work if I export FVWM_CPP before running
./configure.

Is the chunk that sets FVWM_CPP in our control?  If it is then getting
it to use the output of "gcc -print-prog-name=cpp" would work.

Failing that I noticed that in the Makefile for FvwmCpp the variable CPP
is set (to "gcc -E" in my case) could $CPP be passed into FvwmCpp.c
rather than $FVWM_CPP?  If it can does $FVWM_CPP have any use?

Cheers,
Tim.

Thank you Jason.

I in no way intended that comment as an insult, but rather (as Jason
correctly interpreted) thought it amusing.

I am fairly sure I was the first one on this list to bring up gnome/gtk
considerations with fvwm. Gnome is currently a mostly a developed on linux
package. However I have built many of the pieces on Solaris so I could get a
personal feel for the project. I believe gnome/gtk will do a number of very
good things for Unix as they develop.

I apologize if any one misinterpreted my statement.

Thanks, that last bit was the final hint I needed.  I've just
commited changes to 2.1.7 to fix that.

By the way, someone looking at the shadow code may see that the logic
is not using the new shadow/hilite logic in the PsuedoColor (8 bit)
color case.  (The logic in that routine is fairly complicated and I
missed it.)  I prefer to just make this minimal change at this time.

For sometime  after 2.2 I  have a  completely new version  of FvwmForm
where all of this stuff is done much more cleanly.  (My opinion.)

That doesn't work very well:

1) The menus are still painted in grey the first time they are mapped.
   This probably is because the background is set after the window
   has been mapped. Is it possible to change that?

2) It still flickers although not as bad as before.

3) If you have large menus it is **slow**. On my machine mapping a
   menu filling 75% of the screen takes several seconds. Using a
   simple but long menu that covers about 5% of the screen is
   still unbearably slow. Perhaps this would be acceptable if this
   delay occured only once per menu. Do we have to redraw the pixmap
   every time the menu is painted? It should be only necessary if the
   gradient or the size of the menu has changed.

I don't understand why these pixmap operations are so slow. I had
the same problem with XGetImage when I used XYPixmap. After changing
to ZPixmap it runs smoothly now. This is probably the same problem.
Redrawing the whole menu is much faster than this. There must be
a way to prevent the delay.

Yes, that's in our control.  I'll see what I can do.

It might be easier to have it use "gcc -E" instead, although we'd need
to make sure the full path is set for that.

This could probably be autoconf'd.  I don't have an HP system to test it

  dv> 2) builtins.c:

This can definitely be tested.  Typically you would include a GNU-ish
version of strtoul() and compile and include it on systems which don't
have it.

Is it really the case that this value can be that large (unsigned long)?
Maybe the thing to do is use strtol() as above, but then check for less
than 0 as an error condition?

I don't see any reasonable way of testing this one.

BTW, Solaris certainly does have a write(2) man page.  Note that on
Solaris some of the programmer-specific man pages, headers, and apps are
in packages which may not be installed on all systems... if you don't
have them you should get out your Solaris CD and install them.

The Solaris write(2) man page says it uses EAGAIN.  So does POSIX.  I
think the above test is OK, although we might want to clean up the
comment.

Note that EWOULDBLOCK might not be defined on all systems, so it should
be tested for existence and set to EAGAIN if it doesn't.

  dv>       tmp1=tolower(tmp1);

ANSI C requires that tolower() return its argument unchanged if it is
not an uppercase letter (if isupper() isn't true).  One school of
thought here is to simply make the change without a test based on our
requirement of an ANSI C compiler/library.

Other than that I can't think of a comprehensive test: we can certainly
try it for some random non-alphabetic chars and see if it works, but I
suppose it could work for some and not others.

Umm, and what would happen if you don't have gcc?

I don't know how likely it would be here, but wouldn't it be good
thing to have such a function stub just in case someone ever uses
strtoul?

I wasn't clear.

What I meant was, it might be simpler to just use whatever configure
finds as the preprocessor, verbatim.  If you have gcc, configure chooses
"gcc -E".  If you don't, it looks elsewhere.  If it can't find one,
configure will fail so that's a pretty good way to avoid this problem
for FvwmCpp in the future :)

The other suggestion was to do something like: if the preprocessor is
gcc -E, then use the "gcc -print-prog-name=cpp" command to find the full
path and use that for FVWM_CPP.  This seems more complicated.  Plus, I'm
not at all sure older versions of GCC support this option.

Over the weekend I compiled FVWM 2.1.5 (beta) with the intention
of upgrading the release which came with RH 51 (2.3.5 kernel).
Unfortunately, the 'make install' command didn't hit any of the
default target directories (usr/X11/bin, usr/lib/fvwm, etc.).

I tried walking through the Makefile script and it was very
uninformative (lots of @references, config.x scripts, small
shell programs, etc.).

Has anyone tried and succeeded in this simple (?) task?
Thanks in advance.

	No we don't... If we cache the pixmaps.  But this brings the bloat
factor into it.  Of course... if we were to start caching the pixmaps...
then _technically_ we could draw the menus onto the pixmaps and never have
to redraw anything unless the menu changed... which could be nice... 
Another option would be to create a temporary window.  Draw into that and
XCopyArea to the pixmap.  If the drawing into a pixmap is
significantly slower than drawing into a window, that could solve the
problem.  

sigh.. What I would give for a nice fast pixmap-scaling routine. Then we
could cache one pixmap and scale it appropriately when necessary.  

I'll think on this...

Looking in on this too.

Not surprising at all.

Note, from the NEWS file:

  Changes in alpha release 2.1.0 (October 1998)

  * basic autoconfiguration support; see INSTALL.fvwm and INSTALL
  * modules installed into ${libexecdir}/fvwm/${VERSION}
    - since the version string is encoded into the module directory, it
      is safer to rely on the compiled-in ModulePath, rather than
      setting it yourself in .fvwm2rc
  * system configure (system.fvwm2rc) searched for in ${sysconfdir}

Essentially, fvwm now uses GNU autoconf to build and install instead of
X's Imake.  That means that the default installation directories are all
based on the GNU standard (/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.) rather
than the X11 standard (/usr/bin/X11, /usr/X11/lib, etc.).

You absolutely will not be able to use older fvwm2 RPM description files
with the newer beta fvwm2's.

I don't know if anyone has created a new set for the new installation or
not, maybe someone else will.

I have been thinking recently that it would be a simpler and more
consistent model to use a layered stacking order instead of the current
staysontop model. The problems with the implementation of staysontop
stem IMO from the fact that it is really an impossible task for the
wm to guarantee that all staysontop windows are fully visible at
all times. 

The alternative would be to assign a layer to each managed window
and guarantee only that a window in a higher layer is above all
lower layers. In this model, raising/lowering a window would only
raise/lower it in its layer and there would be separate operations
for changing the layer. Staysontop would simply be the topmost
layer and staysonbottom would come for free.

I think this would be relatively straightforward to implement if
you put an array of FvwmWindow * pointing to the topmost windows
in each layer. I think such a layered model is also part of the  
(otherwise not so great) Gnome WM Hints proposal.

What do you think ?

	I tried it... I created a function called 'DoMenuBackground' which
basically generates the gradient (or pixmap) and then assigns the window
background to the pixmap.  (or solid color, as neccesary).  I then dropped
this into FPopupMenu Between the XMoveWindow and XMapRaised window.  Thus
setting the background before it maps it.  It works... and avoids the
painted-in-grey first business.

	I also removed the background-building in PaintMenu (as it is all
done in DoMenuBackground in my version)  The flicker is pretty much gone
now.

	Still have this problem.  It is unbearably slow the first time.  
I just realized that if we set the background of a window to a pixmap, the
server caches it anyway, until that window is destroyed (or the background
is changed)  This means that on large menus we will eat up alot of space
on the server as long as we use the background pixmap method.  And it will
stay that way until the menu-window is destroyed or the background is
changed.  I've just tested it and verified.  (2 meg on a full-
screen-height menu.  uggh)

So looks like we are back to painting it each time by hand.  

But Wait!!!

We can take advantage of the fact that the BackgroundPixmap tiles... at
least on horizontal and vertical gradients.  In those cases we can
create a small pixmap (say, 20 pixels high for a Horizontal) and set the
background pixmap to that.  The server will tile it (nice and fast) for us
without holding on to a huge chunk of memory... even on large windows. (an
1152 x 20 pixmap would only use ~90k max (on a 32bpp display))

What do you think of this:

	On HGradients and VGradients we create a small pixmap of
appropriate size and set it to the background.  Once the window has been
created and the background has been set, we don't have to worry about the
background anymore (unless the menu changes).  All it would take to
'redraw' our gradient is 'XClearWindow'  (heck, we could do the
gradient-building / background setting at MakeMenu time if we got really
excited =P )
  	This would speed up the menu drawing significantly (at least for
everything but the diagonal gradients)  In addition, the initial drawing
of the gradient would be faster because of the small size of the pixmap.

I think that the DGradients and BGradients are gonna give us a hard time
no matter what we do.  But we can clean house on the H and VGradients...

Thoughts?

Jay


PS- Please pardon my ranting... It all came together as I wrote.

PPS- it's too bad about the Dgradients though.... I liked those best. =(

did you have a chance to look after this is the last few weeks?
we made some changes to signal handling in general, so this
problem might be gone. Could you check this with the latest
CVS source?

Thank you

I can't verify it on my system. Could you try to create a minimal
.fvwm2rc with this problem and a detailed description what you do?

Thanks

ISTR that one of the first features of Enlightenment was a library to do
pixmap scaling, it might be worth trawling through the sources.

Cheers,

I've committed the patch. You could always lose windows off the top and
left, now you can lose them off the right and bottom. It's very easy to
get them back. Focus will move it back to (0,0) so any method of
focusing on the lost window will get it back (unless it's off screen due
to shading, but I think no-one will complain).

Cheers,
Tim.

  Following on to my hassles with 2.1.5's 'configure' & my local
installations of xpm & readline: I'm attaching the output & log of
configure, and the mini-script I used to run it (with the relevant
parameters.

  Of course, at this stage, there's every chance I'm just being a plonker!
My current build worked after I edited configure to not unset the XPM_
vars. (etc.) if it thought the files weren't there (after the other tests
had passed!).

This can be done.  

However, when gcc is upgraded, and the old version removed, FvwmCpp will
break. 

More importantly, it only helps those with (a very recent?) gcc.  A more
general solution is required.

One way to fix this is to document a requirement that "cpp" be available
on the path, or in one of /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib.  If root is
installing, making a symlink is easy.  If it is a mortal, they may have to
fall back on using the "-cppprog" option with FvwmCpp.

The problem is that "cc -E" expects the input filename on the commandline,
whereas "cpp" will read from standard in.  As currently written, FvwmCpp
writes to stdin of cpp.  Changing it to write to a tempfile to run cpp on
is possible, but it is worth the trouble? 


I'm more inclined to require cpp be on the path (or in some lib
directory).  I'm willing to make the changes in this direction, unless
someone is inspired enough to rewrite FvwmCpp.

Not only that but gcc -E complains if the file name does not have a .c
at the end.  Looks like we need a real cpp.

You don't have to change anything. If cpp is on the path at configure
time it does get into FvwmCpp.  You could change the configure script to
not fall back to /lib/cpp if it can't find cpp, but I don't know if
configure should halt at that point or wait until FvwmCpp is compiled to
give an error.

Cheers,
Tim.

How about:

	./configure --with-cpp=/some/nonstandard/location/cpp

(IN other words, punt to the user)

I have looked through the man pages extensively, and haven't found any
references to being able to stretch pixmaps, like in the titlebar.  Is
there any way to do this?  If not, I think it is a feature that is
really needed.

Bother.  I just spent a half-hour getting configure to find gcc :(

What it does now is (1) look for cpp as it used to (it now also looks in
/usr/ccs/lib, which is where Solaris likes to keep cpp), (2) if it's not
found it looks up the configure CPP contents and uses the complete path
to it.

So, when I fake it out to not find cpp it uses "/usr/local/bin/gcc -E".
As you say, this won't work because it expects a command line filename.

However, I just tried and this: "/usr/local/bin/gcc -E -" does take text
from stdin, and obviously there's no filename problem here (if there
were, you could always use "-x c").

This also avoids the version problem that the complete path to GCC's cpp
gives.  Of course if you move your gcc, that's another problem :).

So, it looks like we have two choices:

  1) Add yet another test to see if FVWM_CPP will actually work as
     found, and try adding the "-" option and retesting if it fails the
     first time.

  2) Forget the gcc -E thing altogether and go back to the "old way",
     but make more noise if cpp can't be found (see below).

I don't use FvwmCpp myself so this is a bit difficult for me to test
robustly.

Configure should halt.

Alternatively, we could have configure print a message and then not
compile FvwmCpp (but do everything else).

But there's no way a successful configure should result in compile
errors during the build if we can help it.

I vote for 2) as it's the least change.  With the "gcc -E" thing you
will have to make sure the makefile puts quotes around the
-DFVWM_CPP=$(FVWM_CPP} bit otherwise the spaces confuse the compiler.

I usually just set the *-library option to the directory, not the full

  --with-xpm-library=/home/nabird/usr/lib

But...

It seems to have worked anyway.

Strange.  What does config.h look like after this?  Is XPM defined?
What about fvwm/Makefile?  What are xpm_CFLAGS and xpm_LIBS set to?

  Sorry for the confusion - yes, I tried both, not being /sure/ and seeing
it not work - the conf I posted just happened to be my last-ditch attempt
at making it work! Neither way cut the mustard.

  Oh dear. Have I posted completely the wrong files?? <looks...> nope,
that's right. I may have managed to make it work by virtue having had it
work before ('cos of my editing configure).

  I've just had a look at the freshly created fvwm/Makefile, and it does
have XPM in it, which means that what I posted was completely useless -
sorry!

  I'll do it all again from a fresh untar in a while.

  I can tell you that - the bit I changed in configure was that bit that
/cleared/ xpm_* ... so they were unset with the normal configure.

  I'll retry & repost if I get something sensible.

  The bl**dy thing seems to be working now :-/

  However, the rplay isn't, and is doing a similar/same thing to what
xpm/rplay did before when it didn't work, so maybe it's of some use.


  The relevant bit out of configure is:

...
checking for rplay_create in -lrplay... no
configure: warning: Requested rplay library not found!
...

  The XPM problem was the same, but it claimed to have found the X11/xpm.h
beforehand, just not the entry on the library.

  I'm now specifiying the --...library= correctly as a directory.

  I wish I'd noticed the config.log stuff before; it looks like the most

I think it's time to have a successor to the flawed 2.1.6.
Too many people are using it.

Enlightenment, I think, put all of its graphics routines into imlib. I
don't know what imlib's dependencies are (maybe gtk+ & glib) but I'm
pretty sure it'd be GPL'd. Just thought I'd mention it in case
anyone's really interested in linking a library for more graphics
capabilities. Personally, I think additional library dependencies
could get kinda irksome. I suppose ImageMagick's also got some
potential there.

Overall though, I'd find it really annoying if one needed, in order to
build fvwm, some graphics lib like imlib or libMagick, which
consequently further require libpng, libgif, libjpeg, etc... Just an
observation.

A number of comments--first, I don't think we should write fvwm docs
while in a fit of pique :)

Second, doesn't this better belong in the docs subdirectory?  I don't
want the top-level to get too cluttered with unnecessary stuff.

Sure we do!  If it isn't, that's a bug.  We care about bugs.

I understand the frustration (I get these things for GNU make all the
time, too) but I think we need to make the official statements a bit
less... ah... confrontational :)

I'd change it to something like:

  Question: Is fvwm "Year 2000" compliant?

  Answer:
    We're not aware of any "Year 2000" issues in fvwm.
    We have done no testing of Fvwm for Year 2000 problems.

    Fvwm doesn't care about time on a macro scale (years, weeks, or even
    days); it uses time only on a micro scale: determining the time
    between clicks of the mouse for double-click detection, for example.

    Fvwm requires that the operating system's clock and time functions
    function correctly.

  Caveats:
    All comments here are based solely on a quick check of the code for
    the use of "time" and "clock".

    Even less examination was made of modules in the "extras" directory.

    All problems and issues discovered in Fvwm, including Year 2000
    problems, should be reported to the fvwm-workers list or via the
    on-line bug tracking system, and will be attended to ASAP.

Imlib is GPL'd and has dependencies neither on gtk+ nor on glib as far as I
can tell.  The gtk-imlib stuff of course has the obvious dependencies, but
that's only useful if you want to use imlib within gtk widgets.

Imlib will use Imagemagik if you have it.  It does also require a ton of
format libraries, like libpng and libjpeg, some of which aren't the
simplest things to build.

It might be nice to use it if it's there, but this is really in the range
of serious bloat.

I stick with my previously stated position...

If you answer the question, you loose!

Paul, I will give you this... I find your last paragraph "All problems..."
to be somewhat acceptable.  I'm not sure promising to "attend to the bug
report" is such a good idea.  Perhaps "treated like any other bug report"
would be suitably vague.

Still, I favor not answering the question at all.

Hm.  I know why _this_ one is broken:

Obviously rplay requires socket, etc. which is probably contained in
-lsocket or -lnsl or similar on your system.  Configure checks for this
but apparently the results of that check aren't being used correctly
when testing rplay (you can see there's nothing like that on the link
line).

I don't have rplay so I can't really test this, but I'll peek into
configure to see if I can see something obvious.

But, my system (Solaris) also requires these and my XPM tests work OK,
so I'm not sure it's the same problem.

I've created a shell script that builds fvwm in 30
different ways:

- with all options disabled
- with one options disabled, all others enabled (14 builds)
- with one options enabled, all others disabled (14 builds)
- with all options enabled (the last one so you don't have
  to rebuild after the test).

This should take about two to five hours.

You need zsh in /bin to run this script.

I've changed configure for more tests, etc.

_PLEASE_ be sure to do a "make distclean" before you build, or otherwise
trash your existing build files.

At the very least, you should absolutely remove the old config.cache
file or you will be very unhappy.

Please test this stuff hard on multiple systems.  I'm absolutely not
proud of much of these configure changes but they seem to work on the
systems I've tried them on.

Also, rumor has it autoconf 2.13 will have a builtin macro for testing
select() arg types, so once that's available we can clean that up, at
least (probably not for 2.2, though).

What do you mean?  Works fine for me.  What problem are you having?  I
just rebuilt every Makefile.in (because I've been mucking with configure
stuff) but they all came out the same as before (CVS considers them
unmodified).

  c> added announcement for 2.1.7, removed announcement for 2.1.6

It's kind of annoying to have these old files disappearing and new ones
appearing with each release.

Can't we just name the file Announcement or something, and update it for
each version?  That is, after all, what a source control system is for:
tracking changes to a file :)

I wasn't. I was only writing what most of us were/are thinking
to be the right thing to say. The answers I give reflect the
fact that there is and will be no official fvwm-workers statement
to Y2K compliance. If I'm forced to make a statement I'll say no,
fvwm is not Y2K compliant.

I do not. If fvwm2 has a Y2K bug and fails running on 1-1-2000
(I leave the likeliness of this uncommented) it will probably be
fixed before you even know it was there (remember year 2000 begins
six hours earlier here :) ).

I'm not a bit frustrated, I just don't want to hear these questions
again. In my opinion not answering these questions is the only
possible approach for a free software project like fvwm.

If you want to take the bite out of my answers, feel free to do so,
but I think we (at least me, Tim and Dan I think) all agree that
we won't promise or state anything on this matter. Maybe I'll search
through the mailing list archives for famous Y2K quotes. Remember
Dan's unforgotten guess about year 2100 compliance :-)

To be honest writing a 'fvwm cats' page has a much higher priority
for me. BTW, you don't happen to have a cat (or more than one)? I
need that information for the cat statistics in the FAQ 8-)

Up until now, I have been running "configure" like this:

./configure \
  --bindir=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.1.7 \
  --libexecdir=/opt/public/src/ \
  --enable-extras \
  --prefix=/opt/public \
  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib\
  --with-xpm-includes=/opt/public/include --with-xpm-library=/opt/public/lib

With the latest download, the second Xpm detection fails:

configure:2969: checking for Xpm 3.4f or better
configure:2986: gcc -o conftest -g  -I/opt/public/include  conftest.c  -L/opt/public/lib -lXpm  -L/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib -R/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/public/lib  -lX11 -lsocket  -lnsl 1>&5
In file included from configure:2979:

/opt/public/include/X11/xpm.h:77: X11/Xutil.h: No such file or directory
configure: failed program was:
#line 2978 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <X11/xpm.h>
   int main(int c, char **v) {
   return c == 1 ? 0 :
     XpmIncludeVersion != XpmLibraryVersion() ? 1 :
     XpmIncludeVersion < 30406 ? 2 : 0 ;}


The problem being, it is not using /usr/openwin/include for the
compile.

It looks to me like the content of $LIBS is being wiped between the
2 different XPM tests.  (But I'm still "configure-challenged".)

When I committed the announcement et.al. I got the list of Makefile.in's
in the CVS comment form again. I can't imagine why since I built the last
version with exactly the same tools.

Of course we can :) As always this has historical reasons. The only
positive thing is that you run in no danger of using an old announcement
when these have the version number in their name.

Ho hum.

Not LIBS, but CPPFLAGS (I think).  You're missing -I options not -L.

The problem is that the X macros in configure don't seem to add to the
default CPPFLAGS and LIBS and LDFLAGS as you go, like other macros which
find libraries, etc. do, but instead put those into separate variables.
So it seems like you always have to reset them before running checks
that require X.

I don't really understand why they're kept separately, but there you go.
I caught the problem of not having the libraries on your link line, but
not the one with missing -I options.

Thx.

Easily debugged: use cvs diff on one of them to find out what changed:

That's not a true statement, though.  I don't think we should tell
people fvwm has y2k issues unless we know that to be the case.

I'd vastly prefer _NO_ comment at all than telling people it definitely
won't work next year.  If we have no statement, then make no statement.

I think this is the wrong answer.

First, _some_ people will hit it.  Second, the likelihood that, if there
is a problem, someone who can fix it will find it at 12:01am (or even in
the first 6 hours :) is extremely low--I don't know about you but I
don't plan on doing much fvwm-ing next New Year's Eve ;).  Third, just
because we have a fix in CVS doesn't help the vast majority of users.
Fourth, even if we created a dist right away with the fix, that still
requires everyone to upgrade--many more people will hit it.  Fifth, the
entire point of Y2K testing is that you find problems and deal with them
_BEFORE_ they happen.

It would be a bug: bugs are important and should be fixed.  If we know
they'll bite people next year, we should fix them before next year.  We
should care about that.

While these kinds of queries by people who don't seem to be familiar
with free software are annoying, testing for Y2K readiness before the
fact, in general, is a _good_ thing.

Again, that's fine.  Then let's not.

Or, if you like, Dan seems amenable to a simple statement like:

  Question: Is fvwm "Year 2000" compliant?

  Answer: All bugs in fvwm should be reported to the fvwm-workers
          mailing list or via the public bug tracking system.

Something like this, though, is probably better placed in the FAQ than
in a whole new file.

Nope, no cats, although there have been many of both cats and dogs in my
family.  My kids, at this age (1 and 2.5), are more than enough of a
handful without pets.  In general, cats I can take or leave.

I'm certainly not fond enough of them to start calling my window manager
"Feline Virtual Window Manager"--YMMV :).

IMO, there's no problem with saying something like:

	We are aware of no Y2K problems, however, we have done no
	systematic testing and fvwm is distributed with ABSOLUTELY NO

Get used to it.  This happens whenever the mtime of a file changes without
its contents changing.  A quick mtime-based scan will show the file as
modified when you're editing the commit message and the file will be sent
down the line for diffing (thus taking time) but no changes will be
recorded.  And this will happen every time you commit (use cvs -t to see
this).

I would suggest that we just get rid of all of the Makefile.in files and
require developers to have autoconf.  That's certainly what other projects
do, and it seems to work well enough.

Ideally the CVS tree would have no automatically generated files in it.

Subject: Patch: Window group support  
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


This patch adds some support for window groups.  

New functions:

  IconifyGroup [ value ]
	       Iconifies a window group if it is not already iconified
	       or de-iconifies it if it is already iconified.  If the 
	       optional argument value is positive only iconification 
	       will be allowed.  It the optional argument is negative only 
	       de-iconification will be allowed.
	       Iconifying a window group means unmapping all windows and 
	       icons of group members and map the group icon, that is the
	       icon of the group leader.  Technically, all group members
	       are iconified and except the group leader have their icon
	       suppressed.
	       De-iconifying a window group means restoring all group
	       members to their state before the group was iconified.
	       There is a technical difficulty here, since clients may
	       create a dedicated group leader, which is not intended
	       to be ever mapped.  In this case, fvwm restores the
	       group leader to iconic state with suppressed icon. To 
	       make sure that dedicated group leaders don't get mapped,
	       the iconify function has been forbidden on them.
	       If a client de-iconifies a window while its group is
	       iconified, fvwm de-iconifies the group first.

  All (conditions) command
	       Performs command on all windows satisfying all
	       conditions.  There are four additional conditions
	       which have to do with window groups. These are
	       "Group", "!Group", "Leader", "!Leader". 
	       "Group" is true if the window being operated on
	       is in the same group as the current window, 
	       "Leader" is true if the window being operated on
	       is the leader of the current window's group. 
	       Examples:
	       
	           # concentrate on one application	           
		   All (!Group) Iconify 1   
		   
		   # Take your 50 Gimp windows with you
		   All (Group) Stick 
		   
		   # This may be useful on a client which has
		   # its main window as group leader.
		   All (Group !Leader) Iconify 1

There are some shortcomings in the window group support implemented
in this patch: 

  * As it is now, dedicated group leaders are decorated with a
    complete FvwmWindow structure and put in the main list of
    windows. They are marked with a flag, so it would be possible
    to skip them if necessary, but it would be better to keep them
    completely separate from the real windows.

  * There is no convenient way to assign icon/icon_name  to a group
    if the client doesn't give its dedicated group leader a recognizable
    name. E.g. the group leader of the gimp has no name or icon_name
    and class Gimp. Maybe we need a GroupStyle command which would 
    be analogous to Style, but apply to the groups of the windows
    matched by the search pattern.

I thought we had a discussion before about keeping down the number of
--with-* options.  

In this case, it is unnecessary, because you can do

	FVWM_CPP=<path> ./configure

just like you do

	CC=blah ./configure

Good idea

> * Die a horrible death in configure if cpp can't be found

Bad idea; FvwmCpp is still useful because you can specify cpp at runtime.

Strange, perhaps, but it works that way by design.  See INSTALL.fvwm: 

If configure doesn't do the right thing, try one or more of the
following flags (examples assume library is named "foo"):

    --without-foo-library    to disable probing for libfoo
    --with-foo-library=FILE  to specify the library name
    --with-foo-library=DIR   to specify directory containing libfoo

Just a quick CVS note:

You don't need to announce "cvs down for tagging".  Just go ahead and tag
it. 

What happens if someone does a commit in the meanwhile?  Nothing!  The
command 'cvs tag' works on the versions IN YOUR CHECKED OUT REPOSITORY. 

So once you are convinced that your sources should form the basis of
2.1.7, say, just do the tag, upload a new tar file, *then* announce it to
the world.

I think #2, since "cc -E -" ain't portable.  ;-(

No.  Configure should complain that it can't find cpp, *but* you can still
compile and use FvwmCpp.  It has a command-line option -cppprog to specify
the cpp program.

Well, you tried it just once, and found it alright for kicks,
Now you found out that it's a habit that sticks,
And you're an orgasm addict.

Perhaps for the case that you're building X and non-X programs in the same
package?  You can link the former with $(LIBS) $(X_LIBS) and the latter
with just $(LIBS).

Not only that, but you have to do weird things like:

	$(X_LIBS) $(X_PRE_LIBS) -lXext -lX11 $(X_EXTRA_LIBS)
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^
and you may need different things here for different X programs ...

Yes, that's the change I meant.  That, and documentation clarification.

These patches are against the latest code from CVS. There is also some
provisional precompiler stuff that will need integrating into the
config. I've tried to accommodate both POSIX.1 and BSD signals depending
on two #defines USE_POSIX and USE_BSD, with USE_POSIX as the default.
The main point is that this #define stuff has to appear somehow before
the line #include <signal.h> in the source file so that it can #define
_BSD_SOURCE.

Chris.

Odd, I don't see this.  However, I always do a "cvs update" right before
the commit to make sure that everything is kosher; maybe that does the
diff and marks the file as unmodified?

This would be OK with me but of course I already have all the tools :)

Possible; I don't recall this.

I do like to keep down the number of --enable-* options, since each one
adds greatly to the complexity of testing the app (witness Dominik's
script to configure all options :-/) but --with-* is different, I feel,
because it works more with how to build than the resulting
functionality.  Maybe too subtle a distinction, I don't know.

Good point.

Ah.  Cool.  I didn't know this (toldja I don't use FvwmCpp for anything :)

OK, I'll have another go.

I know, that's why I said we'd have to test it again after adding that,
to be sure it still worked.

Anyway, I greatly prefer the less difficult way, myself :)

Well, autoconf 2.13 was just released.  I'm not sure what the status of
the next automake is; I'll check with Tom.

Since it's done already we might consider switching over; there are a
few really nice new macros in there.

I'll grab a copy and see how it goes, anyway.

I'm having some serious problems with my key+mouse bindings...

For instance..

Mouse 1 W       M       Move

Meta+mouse1 should be move.. but I only get a changed cursor, but no
movement etc.. Seems like no binding that involves a key + mouse works..
Worked fine cvs -1week...

Keybindings works.. Mousebindings works... but not together..

Anyone..?

On 06 January, 1999 - Tomas Ogren sent me these 0.7K bytes:

> I'm having some serious problems with my key+mouse bindings...

Ok.. nailed it down...

events.c:203
#if 0
  /* domivogt (2-Jan-1999): Why were button presses treated differently here?
   * Causes a bug with ClickToFocus. */
  if((e->type == KeyPress)&&(e->xkey.subwindow != None))
    *w = e->xkey.subwindow;

  if((e->type == ButtonPress)&&(e->xbutton.subwindow != None)&&
     ((e->xbutton.subwindow == t->w)||(e->xbutton.subwindow == t->Parent)))
    *w = e->xbutton.subwindow;
#else
  if(e->xkey.subwindow != None)
    *w = e->xkey.subwindow;
#endif


If I change this to #if 1, the bindings works again...

<wild speculations>
The e->type == ButtonPress must be triggered when it's key + mouse, and
thus applies the op to a different window...
</wild speculations>

But still I'm not safe with my checkout. Of course I fetch the latest
source after this mail and if someone would be checking in while I'm
checking out I have inconsistent code on my disk, correct?

Well, as I said before, feel free to change that text. I don't
really care what people think about the tone of it as long as
they do not bother us with their constant stream of questions.
I never wanted the whole world liking me. BTW did we ever
consider calling the next release 'fvwm millenium' or something
like this?

My comment is that I will make no comment on how likely this is

Me too. I like the idea of leaving the F undefined best.

I wasn't suggesting linking in libraries to get the code, just cut and
paste into fvwm's lib.

Would there be an easy way to get SnapAttraction to also snap to

with the FVWM codebase so I'm not yet at the point where I can
hack it in myself.

Thanks,

Oops, have to use e->xbutton.subwindow for a button press.

I don't understand exactly what you mean, but what happened is:
When you click into the window the subwindow has a completely
weird id that is not related with any visible part of the window.
This has nothing to do with key presses. The difference between
key and button presses is that button presses are bound to
the client window (or its parent) while keystrokes are bound to
the frame window. I've no idea why.

Hi Paul (PDS),

after you changed that hpux dependency in events.c I now get
this warning during compile:

After removing all these bugs from my script I was able                         
to run all the 30 builds without any problems.                                  
                                                                                
I'll try to rewrite it so it runs with plain sh (difficult                      
without a manpage. Any ideas how to make my globally defined                    
variables visible in shell functions?).                                         
                                                                                
And perhaps it would be a good idea to enhance it so it                         
can test any combination of only two options enabled or                         
disabled. That would be 212 builds overall. Estimating                          
about 12 minutes per build (make distclean takes quite a                        
while too) would make it one day and 18 hours to run on a                            
P133. Does anyone have a machine to run this over the weekend?

If you set the second arg to EdgeResistance to the same number as
SnapAttraction you get almost what you want.  It won't pull windows to
the edge but you can line them up.

I don't think it would be easy to hack SnapAttraction to include the
root window because SnapAttraction only operates on outside edges of
windows and what you want is to snap a windows outside edge to the
inside edge of the root window.  Simply including the root window in the
SnapAttraction list of windows would make windows snap neatly off screen
(if you moved them far enough off or set the threshold to be huge).

If you want to pull windows to the root window edge I would suggest
changing the way EdgeResistance works. Maybe a positive second arg to
mean pulling as well as the current behaviour and a negative for just
the current behaviour.

If you're going to do that could you also do the same to SnapAttraction?
I mean a positive value to pull in both directions and a negative to
just snap when windows overlap. That would make SnapAttraction and
EdgeResistance be consistent.

Cheers,
Tim.

Nope.  All CVS operations on the repository are atomic.  If you try to,
say, checkout while someone is committing, you will get a message about
waiting for a lock on the repository.

The key point is: if you want your copy of the sources to end up as
version x.y.z, you can just tag it without worrying about what others are
doing.  Once the tags are in the repository, you or anyone else can
retrieve the identical sources with "cvs checkout -r version-x_y_z",
regardless of what happened to the repository in the meantime.

Another point: if you want to make a tar file for distribution, it is safe
to do so just after your tag, using the copy you just tagged.  You don't
need to fetch "the latest source" or anything like that.

I've applied the patches but have no knowledge about these
portability issues. Steve or Paul (PDS) will have to take
care of these.

If the condition is false it kills your program. This is 
somewhat better than continuing to run with a parameter
that should never occur.

It looks a bit over-the-top to do these tests every time a window is
placed. The first two are redundant and looking at the code
Scr.SmartPlacementIsClever is only ever set to True or False.  It's an
int and maybe it should be a BOOL which would make the third assert
redundant.  Am I right in thinking that these asserts are making sure
that using Scr.SmartPlacementIsClever as a vector into a choice of two
placement functions is in range? If so why not just use:

if (Scr.SmartPlacementIsClever)
  return cleverfunc(...);
else
  return smartfunc(...);

and not have to worry.

Cheers,
Tim.

Perhaps because button presses on the frame have a purpose,
but keypresses while the mouse is on the frame should be passed
to the window.

It's debug-code that disappears unless you #define NDEBUG. Basically,
I'm checking that True and False have the integer values I expect so
that I can use the Boolean SmartPlacementIsClever to index correctly
into my array.

Ideally, SmartPlacementIsClever would be an enumerated type like

typedef enum {
               NORMAL_PLACEMENT=0,
               CLEVER_PLACEMENT
             } SMART_PLACEMENT_MODE;

That way, it would be trivial to add further placement modes in the
future and the index values would be assured.

It's a development-time check. assert() doesn't produce a single byte
of code if NDEBUG isn't #defined. The advantage of using a vector is
that it avoids branching and is therefore faster. It is also more
extensible in the longer term.

Isn't there some kind of snapping to the root window? Although windows
are not attracted by the screen edges they certainly resist being
moved over the edge (about 10 pixels I guess).

Things left to do before 2.2:
-----------------------------

Items marked with a '*' may be skipped if the reporters don't
cooperate.

1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)
*  [investigate bug reports]

9) FvwmCpp does not know where cpp is (bug #95)
   can you say something about this, Paul (PDS)?
   [in progress]

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)
    [investigation in progress]

12) this 'serious bug' RedHat found (I'd like to see the patch).
*   [investigation stalled]

13) the FvwmCommandS problem discussed recently
    [investigation in progress, probably not an fvwm bug]

15) gradient menus lose their colours under obscure
*   circumstances.
    [pending]

Fixed but not verified:
-----------------------

2) the XPM problems (probably in 'configure', bugs #31,
   #40 and perhaps others)
   [in progress]

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix
   [pending]

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)
*  [pending]


Summary of open problems:
-------------------------

5 investigate (3 not mandatory for 2.2)
1 in progress 
3 verify fix  

There are three problems left where we don't have an idea
how to fix (or even reproduce) them (1, 10, 12).

Stuff done since last update:
-----------------------------

3) verify the XGetImage problem I encountered

4) apply latest signal handling patches

7) document install-strip problem (bug #33)

8) closing a panel closes FvwmButtons

11) hanging up asmodem kills FvwmButtons (perhaps related to 8)

14) Integrate this StaysOnTop related patch by Matthias Clasen
    [in progress (Bob W.)]

This looks pretty well, real work has to be done on
1, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 15.

Please, everybody should focus on these six problems left so
we can make 2.2 real soon.

Bye

This doesn't satisfy me a bit. It sounds so complicated for so little
gain. German suggested something about creating and xpm file for the
gradient. But then this would only work if xpm support was compiled
in :( I think we'll leave it as it is for 2.2 and try to find a clean
solution then.

Something in the stacking order is broken now:

I have a tkbiff window partially obscured by one of my
rxvt's. When a mail arrives it raises itself. Clicking
on the title bar of my rxvt doesn't raise it above the
tkbiff window again. I can raise another rxvt over the
first one and vice versa, but that doesn't bring it
above tkbiff again. Only after I clicked on the tkbiff's
title or moved some window around it works as usual
again.

Bye

No, I meant I fetch the latest source before tagging.

Interesting - I also modified a select() on HPUX machines because the
HPUX machine I use at work DOES have fd_set. I don't think it has
sys/select.h though. What exactly is this configuration test doing?

For H/V gradients you could use a one pixel tall/wide pixmap which
should make them tiny (better chance of the server being able to cache
them). For D gradients you can set the menu background pixmap to None to
remove the flicker before painting.

I think its clear that this problem no longer exists.
When it got down to the point that the way to produce
the symptom was to try to run 2 copies of FvwmCommandS,
the person reporting the problem said they re-installed
and no longer had the problem.

Wouldn't this make it harder for casual testers to do CVS downloads?
Perhaps if Linux ships with autoconf and friends pre-installed, this
is less of a problem than I imagine...

You've got this backwards, Chris; assert() will be compiled out only if
NDEBUG _IS_ defined.

A standard build and install will always have the assert() calls
compiled in and utilized.

In general this isn't the way you want to do things with configure.

Instead of generic flags like USE_POSIX and USE_BSD, you test for very
targeted, specific things and use defines for those.  For example, you
would test for sigaction() and put invocations inside a:

  #if HAVE_SIGACTION
    ...
  #endif

Or, if you need a number of things you might test for all of them in
configure and then have some preprocessor magic like:

  #if defined(HAVE_SIGACTION) && defined(HAVE_SIGLONGJMP)
  # define FVWM_USE_POSIXY_SIGNALS
  #endif

The compelling reason for this is many systems implement _some_, but not
all, of some of the standards.  For example, SunOS has memcpy() and
memcmp(), but not memmove().

Also, defining things like _BSD_SOURCE before standard headers is, I
think, not a good idea.  You never really know what that will do on
various systems, it could well screw things up a good bit.  Some
systems, for example, might revert to a 100% BSD implementation and
other POSIX-ish functions the fvwm uses would then be unavailable.

I'll try to find some time to examine the changes you made, but what
would be very useful is if you posted a detailed summary of the two
options, how signal handling is done in each, and what system functions
you're relying on for each one.

The test is supposed to use HAVE_SYS_SELECT to decide whether to include
sys/select.h in the test program, and it works on my Solaris system
(which doesn't have sys/select.h) but apparently not on the HP system.
Odd.

Can you look through config.log and see if there's any problems with the
test for sys/select.h?  Does it succeed or fail?

Note that the new autoconf 2.13 has a builtin test for select() argument
types; it might be best to just use that rather than my lame-o configure
hacks :)

Perhaps, but it's the way most other autoconf and CVS-using projects I know
of work, and they don't seem to have any problems because of it.  The way
we do it now has certainly caused enough headache for us.

Essentially, you have to install CVS anyway, so what's two additional (and
tiny) packages?

With modern Linux packaging it doesn't really matter if it's pre-installed
or not.

	Wouldn't making the H/V gradients one pixel wide increase what the
server has to do to tile it?  I wonder where the break-even point is.

I don't understand what you mean about setting the background pixmap to
None... would that, in effect, make a transparent window until we drew on
it?

	my thought for this is to take a libxpm-ish approach... IE: Build
an XImage of the gradient locally, and then XPutImage it to the window.
This would be much faster than drawing the gradient using X-drawing
routines...  and we wouldn't then be dependant on any external libraries.

Very difficult to work out a break even point as each server may be
different with each graphics card.  Hopefully the graphics card will
have functions to tile and so the XServer won't have more work to do
with one pixel tiles and the hardware will be just as fast since the
total number of bits to set will be the same. (I'm just guessing)

Yes, so you don't get flicker because you can't see the window before it
is drawn.  Well, it's not really transparent, that would imply that a
window underneath it would be visible and any changes in that window
would show. What really happens when a window with background "none" is
mapped is that that area on screen that it takes up is frozen.  What was
underneath is still visible but any changes don't show.  Have a look at
the source to xrefresh, I'm not sure how fvwm does refreshing.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm using autoconf 2.13 and it seems to work well.  It provides a nice
macro for the select() args problem and it has some new nice macros
which we could possibly leverage with or in place of the personal stuff
Steve added in acinclude.m4 (although I haven't tried any of that yet).

What do people think?  Should we go there?  Are those of you who do
autoconfing willing to download and install it if I commit changes that
require it?

	Gotcha... I have a good idea about this... drawing the gradient
locally and then sending the info to the Xserver vi XPutImage.  Doing it
locally would make it much faster than drawing via Xcalls... Then we could
do whatever was deemed appropriate (making them background pixmaps or
simply drawing them, I mean) also we wouldn't then be dependant on any
external libraries.  I still think that the D/B Gradients are going to
give us trouble regardless though..  This is assuming that XPutImage will
outpace the line-drawing method. (which it should)


On an semi-related note, I notice we use XGetImage and XPutImage...
since we are just holding and restoring an image, it would probably be a
good idea to use a Pixmap and XCopyArea instead...  XGetImage and
XPutimage transfer the image from the server to the client and vice-versa
respectively.  We aren't doing anything to them locally, so it would be
more efficient to create a Pixmap and XCopyArea into the pixmap and then
back to the window as all the data transfer stays within the server.  It
should be much faster for that reason alone.

(XGetImage and XPutImage also have the overhead of converting byte and bit
order from client to server during each call)

	Hi,
	I saw that you've applied the patches: that's great. Of course, the
same thing needs doing to all of the other modules and extras, but I'll do
that when the new signal handling is confirmed and working.

	I should really mention the following:
	PRO: the current strategy is *guaranteed* reentrant because all the
handlers do now is set global flags and then return. The main event loop is
now conditional on these flags. Therefore a signal breaks the event loop and
allows the process to exit normally.
	CON: FVWM will not terminate as soon as it recieves a signal, but
will finish handling the event it received last. This isn't so bad in
itself, but does mean that FVWM *must not block* on any system call once the
"quit" order is given. Hopefully, this small race condition won't affect
anyone in the immediate future.

	The main culprits for blocking (that I've seen) are select() and
XNextEvent(). I have written a wrapper around select() called fvwmSelect()
which CANNOT block once the signal handler sets the "quit" flag. This
routine can hopefully go into libfvwm for v2.2.1. I'm not sure about the
XNextEvent() call; most modules call XPending() first which should reduce
the problem, but I can write another wrapper function if necessary.

	Any feedback welcome,
	Cheers,
	Chris.

Yes, it sounds like there are useful things in there.  I'll be downloading

No answer is an answer too. Let's try it another way:
If Red Hat has this fixed it must be visible in the
code. Could anybody with a Red Hat distribution and
fvwm2.0.46 see if there are any patches distributed
with the source (and send it to me)? Or if not, tar
the code in the fvwm/fvwm directory?

Bye

We won't get around XCopyArea anyway in the long run. The menu
might be partially off screen and XGetImage fails miserably
then (I've already seen if).

No problem. If there's no high risk of breaking up our build

The BUGS file seems to mention this with xemacs. Maybe
that's not a new bug.

Basically the script does 'make distclean; configure; make'
for all of the requested combinations of options. I've never
done anything with an SMP machine so I don't know what is
required to get it parallel. I could fiddle with some counters
so you could start multiple scripts in different copies of the
source.

The test failed which is correct since my Linux doesn't have
sys/select.h.

	Hmmm...did this just start happening since last night, or
did you just notice it? Have you got a backup FVWM from sometime
before I committed the stacking order/StaysOnTop/override_redirect
changes Tuesday evening, with which you could confirm whether it's
a new problem? I don't have tkbiff, so I can't quickly test this.
I'll have to go looking for it.

	I don't think Matthias' and my changes should cause this kind
of behavior, but I wouldn't swear that they couldn't.

Subject: Menu Doesn't always catch buttonpress event

Full_Name: David Ronis
Version: 2.1.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.0-pre4/2.0.36
X_Server: XFree86 Version 3.3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (132.206.20.6)


The main utilities menu (the relevant part of my .fvwm2rc file is pasted
below) 
sometimes misses ButtonPress events (especially when the system is more
loaded).  
This happens on both an i486 and an i586.

The problem only seems to happen with the 1st entry (xterm) in the menu
listed below
although, it's probably the most heavily used one.  

If I move the mouse cursor on the menu, and then click on Xterm--it always
seems to 
work.

Two possibilities:

a)  Events are really being dropped.
b)  There is some error in the calculation of where the event is really
happening
     (probably saying that I've clicked on the menu title).

The usual method is 

MAKE='make -j3' make -j3

The setting of MAKE is required to get all of the submakes to go parallel,
too.  Replace '3' with one greater than the number of processors you have.
(The extra process soaks up the time spent in IO which can be significant
if the source is on network disk.)

Just downloaded the SRPM and took a look at the patches.
I think this is it.

	Ok, I found & installed tkbiff, and tried it on my backup system
and the newly-built one. The problem does seem to have been introduced
by last night's changes. I'll have to do some tracing to see what's
going on.

	Er, regarding another thread, please don't suddenly switch over
to requiring developers to install autoconf in order to build the CVS
sources, while I'm in the middle of trying to fix this one. In fact,
couldn't we postpone that till after 2.2 is out?

	Ok... So I've put together a new patch.  This is off of the
original 2.1.7...   This patch does two things:

	Switches to XCopyArea from the XGetImage and XPutImage method of
saving the backdrop.  

	Uses a small Pixmap background for HGradient and VGradient menus.
It also does not need to redraw the gradient (on H/V gradients) unless the
menu has changed.

	I ran across the XGetImage problem you mentioned.  I've checked
and XCopyArea is not susceptable to the same problem.  This patch speeds
up the menu-redraws alot when using HGradients and VGradients with a
minimum of overhead.  (Especially on large menus.  wow.)

	Please check it out and let me know what you think.

Jay

	I'm afraid I'll have to disable or back out Matthias' fix. The
problem is that FVWM doesn't know that the tkbiff window has been raised
to the top, so it doesn't know what sibling to raise it above. This gets
a bit too complicated to try to force in before 2.2.

	I don't know if the problem is peculiar to the way Tk handles
raising windows, but we never see a ConfigureRequest for the tkbiff
window. Instead, what xev shows coming in is a synthetic ConfigureNotify,
and FVWM doesn't even look at ConfigureNotify events, synthetic or
otherwise.

	A further implication, of course, is that the stacking order chain
is still not 100% accurate - it only reflects changes that FVWM knows about
and participates in. It's good enough for its current use, but needs some
more work post-2.2.

I think this is that menu delay that I reported a while back.
Dominik said something about it being there to prevent accidental
selection of menu items.

Where is the code for that Dominik?

Kent already posted what looks very much like the fix in question. I
noticed in the same package though, that there are several patches
that don't look like they were ever submitted back to fvwm-workers. I
extracted all the patches and put them in my anonymous ftp at
ftp://shell7.ba.best.com/pub/mikehan/ if anyone wants to take a look.
I see that they patch 2.0.46 w/ anim-shade and balloons, but I didn't
recognize the other patches.

Well, then it's trivial. You won't get 'configure' and 'make distclean'
parallel this way though.

Hmm, could you hack in a bug report and keep track of that
after 2.2?

Hello!

I just grabbed the RedHat 5.1 CDs from my sideboard, since
I am currently running SuSE... The fvwm2-2.0.46-10.src.rpm
on RedHat 5.1 CD 2 contains the following files:

fvwm-2.0.46-anim_shade.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-balloon.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-bugs.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-fixes.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-form.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-fvwm2rc.sample
fvwm-2.0.46-iconboxes.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-ks.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-misc.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-rh.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-taskbar.patch
fvwm-2.0.46-wharf.patch
fvwm-2.0.46.icons.tar.gz
fvwm-2.0.46.tar.gz
fvwm2-2.0.46.spec

The .spec-File applies these patches in the following order:
%prep
%setup -n fvwm-2.0.46 -a 1
%patch0 -p1 -b .balloon
%patch1 -p1 -b .rh
%patch2 -p1 -b .fixes
%patch3 -p1 -b .taskbar
%patch4 -p1 -b .form
%patch5 -p0 -b .ks
%patch6 -p1 -b .shade
%patch7 -p0 -b .bugs
%patch8 -p0 -b .iconbox
%patch9 -p0 -b .wharf
%patch10 -p1 -b .misc

I could mail the *patch-files and the .spec file to the list or
directly to Dominik or to anyone interested.  But since these
files are also available on the red hat ftp server, this does
not make much sense?  So what should I do?  I've no write access
to the fvwm directory, or have I missed something?

It would be nice if you mailed the patches to my private
mail address: dominik.vogt@planet-interkom.de
That saves me some time.

Thanks

Wow, good question. I think it's been imbedded in the event
handling section of menuInteraction and perhaps the shortcut
function (both menus.c). I don't think you can find it until
you are *very* comfortable with the source. Try starting
with asking me questions. What exactly are you looking for/
trying to do? I think I can answers specific questions from
the code.

This source-RPM is the old one before the 'bad' patch was
applied.  As far as I could tell the most recent source-RPM is

fvwm2-2.0.46-12.src.rpm

which is two versions newer than the one on the CD you have.  It
can be found on updates.redhat.com.

Actually it's (c). No error happening, no events being dropped,
not a bug. You are using the 'Popup' command to open the root menu.
Menu items won't be invoked it the pointer starts on a menu item
and you release the pointer fast. In the latest code there's some
option to tune this delay (duble click time or so, see MenuStyle).
If you absolutely need this action always you can bind a default
action to your Popup menu:

  Popup Utilities Exec xterm

Nice to hear that.

Well, before you continue you should share your code with us
so our portability cracks can have a look at it and see if/how
we could better integrate it with the regular distribution.

Oops, my last reply was a wide shot. The responsible code is
in de_menu:

  if (lastTimestamp-t0 < Scr.menus.DoubleClickTime && !mouse_moved &&           
      (!key_press || dkp_timestamp != 0)) {                                     
    /* dkp_timestamp is non-zero if a double-keypress occured! */               
    fDoubleClick = TRUE;                                                        
  }                                                                             

This works for Popup menus too. In case of a double click the
actual action on the menu item is ignored. Instead the default
action is executed.

Are these extra conditions available to the Next/Prev commands as well?

I'm worried about the code used to do the All command:

What happens if the action manipulates the windowlist (e.g. Focus,
Destroy)? I think this might cause Fvwm to go off into freed memory or
to loop forever.  It might be better to: run down the windowlist and
count the number of windows; malloc an array for the WindowIDs; fill the
array with all the WindowIDs; run through the array testing the
condition; execute the action using the WindowID command with the
WindowID and finally free the array. Something similar to this already
happens in the WindowList command.

Cheers,
Tim.

This is easy to answer: it will coredump (we already have tried this
with the purify script).

I imagine we could do some more enhancements in this direction
that should be coordinated somehow:

1) Have some mechanism to select multiple windows to apply
   functions to, e.g. draw a rectangle on the root window
   that selects all windows/icons at least partially within
   or select a group of windows/icons by clicking on each
   (GroupRectangle / GroupSelect). This group would be used
   to execute the next function/builtin or until deselected.

2) Have a 'Repeat' function that allows you to execute the
   same action multiple times without having to invoke it
   again and again. E.g. 'Repeat Move' would allow you to
   move random windows on the desk until you're satisfied
   (and press escape).

I think in this approach it would make sense to have a
dedicated 'Group' and perhaps a 'GroupLeader' command.

Bye

	Well... I will share it of course, but :
	o I'm not very proud of the form. I'd like to do all the 
stuff in one C source and one H include, and no modification of your code. 
Basically, the only modifications are in fork/execl and select...
	o I can't give you a diff result.
	o I would like to have 2 or 3 modules working so I can get a proof the 
options I choose are good.

	What I propose is to have all it work. Then apply my modifications to 
the 2.1.7 or next, verify, and then we will find a solution to give you the 
changes I made. Does it sound correct to you ?

	I tried a 5-pixel-size window in the patch I submitted yesterday.
It was blazing-fast.  I'm satisfied with that (unless someone tells me
it's different on their machine)

	It seems to be a little different on my machine.  If you set the
background of the window to 'None' it does not redraw in solid color...
but it does not leave the window below it (in my case, the root window)
showing... instead it keeps whatever contents were on the screen (above or
below) until the window is redrawn... A bit faster, but very disturbing to
look at.  (Especially if animation is on) I'd rather see the flicker...
It's too bad, that would have been useful.

Sounds good to me. I still think that talking with Steve R. or Paul (PDS)
might help you with the correct form. If it's generic enough we might
incorporate it in the regular distribution via configure.

	I haven't "configure" and haven't heard of a port. I think I must even not 
rely upon "make" tool, for not all VMS sites has it.
	Well we will see that in a few days :-)

And next you'll tell me you don't have zsh? Or at least bash?
How can you work on such a system ;-)

This sounds weird. Are you saying that if you map a window with a "None"
background the server draws stuff on the screen before giving the expose
event?  If so it sounds like a bug in your server.

Cheers,

	No... Here is an example.  Assuming the backgroundpixmap of all
menus is set to None and Animation is on.  You open your root-menu near
the edge of the screen, go to a menu selection that has a popup menu...
then you select another popup off of that... The menu happily moves over
obscuring your root menu.  Then you decide to go back to your original
menu... the last popup goes away, and the windows where the root and
submenu were are now filled with the contents of the popup that just
closed... (as if that particular portion of the screen was not redrawn,
which is indeed what is happening) then it is refilled with the proper
information. It is even more disturbing if a menu slides completely on and
then off of a menu... you have little chunks-o-menu all over the original
menu.  It is u-u-ugly.

Actually it's (c). No error happening, no events being dropped,
not a bug. You are using the 'Popup' command to open the root menu.
Menu items won't be invoked it the pointer starts on a menu item
and you release the pointer fast. In the latest code there's some
option to tune this delay (duble click time or so, see MenuStyle).
If you absolutely need this action always you can bind a default
action to your Popup menu:

  Popup Utilities Exec xterm

  I don't subscribe [as yet] to the -workers list, so I can't tell if this
has been reported/fixed until I set up CVS - just ignore me if I'm
treading over old ground.

  I've bound one of my menus to <Meta-t>, and with the new-format
MenuStyle I'm using, the menu comes up with the pointer over the top item
when triggered from the key-press (not the title, as it does when brought
up as a sub menu). The item's highlighted correctly, but its background
*remains* at the highlited colour when the pointer moves to other items
(the font/foreground colour reverts to unhighlited).

  If this is new/live, I'll email the relevant parts of my .fvwm2rc.

        Sure,  I  haven't.    I have a kind of shell called  DCL  (Dec
Command Language) which is  in  no  way  POSIX  compliant,  built on a
completly different approch than Unix shells, but powerfull enough for
programming nice things :-)
        BTW, since my last post I found  a  reference of an old try to
port autoconf.  Is configure part of that ?  I will try to contact the
person...

>How can you work on such a system ;-)
        :-)
        Well, I have programs that give me all the functions of zsh or
bash, make, even  CVS.    But  there  are  absolutly  not  compatible.
Configure is on side,  for  there  is no need for it on VMS which is a
proprietary OS.  The C compiler I use is  the  same  (with  some  more
features) as the Digital Unix one...
        And guess :  now,  I  use  Fvwm.  I'm on the right side of the
force :-)
        Fab.

        I have the same  with  my  Linux  box with XFree86.  I haven't
examined the timings of the  expose  event.  It seems the server grabs
whatever is under the "transparent" window  when  first mapping it and
assigns it to the window bacground.  Then, when you obscure the window
with another one, the background of the "transparent" one gets changed
with what ever "pass in" the "transparent" window.   I  haven't  found
what usefull to do with that, so I through away the learning code :-)
        I  found  that  in  writing a Fvwm module that is  an  archaic
alternative  to  FvwmPager.   It draws a shaped window with just  text
saying "Desk n Page nXm".  I use it with a little font, no decorations
at all,  StayOnTop  and  Sticky,  and  it just floats upon whatever is
under it, very  discretly.    With  my old 14" monitor it saves screen
space.

Log message:
* Upgrade to autoconf 2.13
* Fix FvwmCpp yet again: configure warns if it can't find cpp, but doesn't
fail.  FvwmCpp will fail gracefully (well, it writes to stderr :) if
no builtin cpp exists and none was provided on the cmd line.
* Minor update to XPM checks: don't forget to add X_CFLAGS when compiling
the XPM test program.
* The -lsocket test we were doing was inadequate, since some hosts (like
Solaris) require both -lsocket and -lnsl.  Since the X tests already
make this check correctly, just use their results instead.

Yes, I know all the Makefile.in files updated again.  Sigh.

If you do any autoconfing you'll need autoconf 2.13 as of my latest
commit.

If the script will accept command-line args and pass them to the makes
it invokes (which is a good idea), and you're using GNU make, you can
just invoke it with "-j 4" or something.

That's another option: if you use the remote configure stuff you can
build them in separate directories, in parallel (as opposed to, or in
addition to, giving make a parallel build option).

This require GNU make but is a good thing to test, anyway.

Hi all;

I really appreciate the work Chris is doing on signals for fvwm, but
nevertheless I feel I must complain a little :).  And I'm not really
targeting Chris because others have done this, too--it's his misfortune
to be the latest one, is all :)

I think it's _extremely_ important to have accurate ChangeLog entries.
Personally, I would rather see a bug than have a bug fix (*esp* a
complicated one) without proper ChangeLogs.

The ChangeLog entry for the latest round of signals is:

	* fvwm/**: Applied updated signal handler patch by Chris Rankin

IMO this is really not acceptable.  At the very, very, very least there
should be a list of files affected by the changes!  And there _really_
should be a description of each change, too.

I'm not suggesting Dominik should add these, of course, I'm saying Chris
(and others sending patches) really need to provide these ChangeLog
entries when they send the patch.  If you use Emacs it's trivial to
write them once you get into the habit of "C-x 4 a" after each change.
Typically you don't send a diff for the ChangeLog, since it will almost
never apply cleanly anyway; typically you just cut and paste the
vertabim ChangeLog before the patch, like this:

1999-01-06  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Update to autoconf 2.13.
	Use new AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES to get select() argtypes.

--- configure.in.tst    Mon Jan  4 12:14:50 1999

 dnl
-AC_PREREQ(2.12)
+AC_PREREQ(2.13)
 AC_INIT(fvwm/fvwm.c)
    ...

Note I'm not saying every minor one-line patch posted to this list needs
a ChangeLog entry; if it's simple enough or requires more hacking, the
person who commits it to CVS can add the entry themselves.

But I think we should make a firm(-ish :) policy that any larger-scale
patches, esp. those applied verbatim, _must_ have reasonable ChangeLog
entries, or they won't be accepted.

What do folks think of this?

PS. The reason I'm writing now is that fvwm-latest no longer compiles on
    SunOS, because events.c uses sig_atomic_t which isn't defined on
    SunOS.  I haven't heard about the details of how the new patches
    Chris supplied are supposed to work so I'm not sure how to autoconf
    them, although they obviously need some autoconf'ing... ChangeLog
    entries would greatly help me with this.

Neat. It works quite well. And it fixed the bug with hilighting
in menus that are not fully on the screen (or obscured otherwise).
I'll commit that one. There's only a bit flickering left. If we
can avoid that it's perfect. And of course the problem with
B and D gradients :(

Did you clean up my attempts of getting this straight?

You speak aloud what I was thinking. It's so much trouble 
looking through all these patches what all the changes in
all functions do! But don't be too harsh to the people
submitting patches. Most don't even know of the ChangeLog's.
Anyway I do request everybody to add ChangeLog entries.

Doubtful. I might believe you with the functionality of bash, but zsh? ;-)

You can pass make options on the command line now. The first
option not understood by the script itself marks the beginning
of the make options.

Log message:
* configure.in: Add checks for system headers that are required
before using AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES.  Workaround for autoconf
2.13 bug.

I'm only checking in the configure.in and configure script.  When you
build, it will probably rebuild all the Makefiles ...

By the way: I have patched my version of autoconf to fix the bug that
this change works around.  As a result, the checks for some header
files are duplicated.  Nothing to worry about; it will go away as soon
as someone rebuilds configure with an unpatched autoconf 2.13.

Hi,

I have a problem with the InitFunction and RestartFunction. I can't seem
to access them from other than the first commandfile given to fvwm.
I i eg. startup fvwm2 (2.1.5) like:

fvwm2 -f systrem.fvwm2rc -f user.fvwm2rc

There is no way (i found) to set/change/destroy the init/restart functions
from the user.fvwm2rc file? I can destroy and add to menus, but not to
these functions. Anyone have any clues for this problem? I cant for the
world see in the code that there should be any difference in which command
file it is specified in?

Best Regards,
Jesper James

Allo..

To anyone with a reasonable knowledge of X and Fvwm's code:

I'm trying to add a feature to Fvwm, for my own use..  It may be
useful/interesting for other people, but maybe not.  :)  

The feature is one I saw in BlackBox -- updating window contents while
moving the window.  The upshot is, for example, moving a transparent
Eterm and having its contents update constantly (for a better
translucent effect).  Currently, it only updates upon releasing the
mouse button.  This is pretty simple, but I haven't been able to kludge
it into Fvwm.

Anyone know what I should change to accomplish this?  I tried modifying
sources, but don't know enough about X programming to send the window
events as it moves.  "refresh_win_function()" looked promising, but
merely slowed down the interface considerably; and none of the other
things I tried seemed to be a step in the right direction.


Er, if possible, reply to my address (not just the list); I don't think
my subscription to fvwm-workers has taken effect yet.  :)

The reason is that there is a subtle change in the requiremnets in the
.fvwm2rc file that were accepted previously. I think the nuance may
have occurred when I ran the conversion script to go from fvwm1 to fvwm2
but it has been so long that I forget now.

Here is what I had to change in our global fvwm2rc file. It works correctly
with fvwm2*.

I don't catch what this has to do with the BorderStyle/Restart
problem. Please elaborate. Apart from this I think the problem
was solved.

I think 2.1.7 has proven stable enough to be released. If there
are no objections I think Jason should move it to the ftp
directory and post the announcement as soon as possible.

fvwm2 -f system.fvw2rc -f user.fvwm2rc
InitFunction is called after the first Read is executed (by the -f
system.fvwm2rc)
and so the user.fvwm2rc cannot do anything useful with it.

StartupStuff() is called in read.c, it really should be in fvwm.c in
main()
somewhere before the main loop is entered.

I'm putting this in postponed since using FvwmCpp to read muliple files is
an easy
workaround and this stuff is hard to test for side effects.

Sorry, I responded to Dominik personally, when I should have
responded to the list.

I'd like to see the next announced beta be a 2.2 candidate.

Given that the XPM fix is not in 2.1.7,  I don't see the point.

Shouldn't we fix everything that Dominik has identified as needed
for 2.2 and then release the beta?

I've looked through the patches made with an eye towards autoconf'ing
them.

As best as I can tell, the USE_POSIX vs. USE_BSD is used only to choose
between using sigaction() vs signal()?

If so I can add autoconf tests for the sigaction function (and maybe
other things?  Can we assume struct sigaction, sigemptyset(), etc. if we
have sigaction()?), and use that instead.  I think we can assume that
all systems have signal() at least!  so that can be the default if
sigaction() doesn't exist.

Thoughts?

I have the XPM stuff done, now I'm working on the signal handling stuff.
Tom Tromey says he hopes to release a new automake this weekend; if so
we might want to upgrade to get rid of the install-sh bug.

Oh, XPM is done except for one thing: _no_one_ has been able to tell me
how to handle -R options nicely for the extra library dirs.  There
doesn't seem to be any comprehensive test in autoconf for this (and I've
looked in the generated configure shell script--how's _that_ for
dedication :).

I suppose I could test the X_LIBS variable and see if it uses -R, and
add it to the other libraries if so.

The only response I got from the autoconf folks was that this was very
hard, for a variety of reasons ranging from good to (IMO) questionable.

Yes, but I don't see a reason for another beta in between.
So much stuff has been done that at least I want some
chance to verify the fixes before we have everything in place.

Great!! glad to hear it's going in! woo-woo!

 As far as the remaining flicker goes: I don't know what to do to get the
remaining flicker out of there. I don't know if it is just my Xserver, but
I don't seem to get any saveunders at all.  I am not sure if all the menus
have to be set so that backingstore is defined as 'whenmapped' for it to
work... or if my Xservers are just broke.

	I don't understand what you mean... so I guess no. =)

Things left to do before 2.2:
-----------------------------

Items marked with a '*' may be skipped if the reporters don't
cooperate.

1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)
*  [investigation stalled]

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)
    [investigation stalled]

15) gradient menus lose their colours under obscure circumstances.
*   [investigation pending]

Fixed but not verified:
-----------------------

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix (tkbiff may still have
   a problem)
   [pending]

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)
*  [pending]

Stuff done since last update:
-----------------------------

2) the XPM problems

9) FvwmCpp does not know where cpp is (bug #95)
   can you say something about this, Paul (PDS)?

12) this 'serious bug' RedHat found (I'd like to see the patch).

13) the FvwmCommandS problem discussed recently
    [no bug]

14) Backed out and postponed the StaysOnTop related patch

Um, forget my last reply. It says the opposite of what I wanted to
say. My reasons for 2.1.7 are: a lot has been done and this warrants
to make this release another beta. If we keep putting in "just another
fix" before making a beta we won't ever have another beta. After this
I think we take our time to fix the remaining bugs and make 2.1.8 in
the hope it will be the last beta.

I have to agree.  We're not talking ridiculous release intervals here;
2.1.5 was released nearly four weeks ago.

We aren't harmed by quick releases, as long as we aren't making every CVS
commit a new release.

Oops, that was a thinko. It is certainly not a good idea to 
execute functions which may change the window list while looping
over that list. Here is a corrected version of AllFunc. And
yes, the new conditions are available for all functions which
take conditions.

I think the problem observed with tkbiff (and also with Emacs 
raise-frame) is a result of fvwm loosing track of the exact stacking order
when clients restack their own toplevel windows. tkbiff uses (as far as I
could tell from quickly peeking into the tk sources) XReconfigureWMWindow 
for its autoraising which tries to use XConfigureWindow and
(since this fails for reparenting wms) then generates a synthetic 
ConfigureRequest for the toplevel window. fvwm handles this by
issuing a XConfigureWindow on the corresponding frame(s), but it 
doesn't update its own stacking order (in HandleConfigureRequest). 

The patch below inserts a call to a routine there that reconstructs fvwms
stacking order from the result of an XQueryTree. Hopefully clients will only
occasionally restack their own windows, so that this shouldn't be a
performance problem. One could optimize this somewhat and correct the stacking
order directly without XQueryTree for simple cases (Above, Below).

Specifically, sigaction() and BSD-style signal()

I think that having sigaction() implies all of the following are also present:

struct sigaction
sigset_t
sigemptyset()

if only because there is a sigset_t element within struct
sigaction. So autoconfing for HAVE_SIGACTION will work.

Well, yes, sort-of, but SYSV signal() is subtly different from BSD
signal() which is why I tried to enforce BSD semantics. BSD semantics
are also a lot more intuitive and are closer to the way sigaction()
works by default.

	You're absolutely right. Sorry I haven't kept you posted on my
progress the last few days - it's been a very busy week (that pesky day
job and all!)

	My original diagnosis was flawed (not an unusual state of
affairs!) - I was looking at the wrong window. In fact, we get a very
orderly ConfigureRequest when tkbiff does a raise, but as you pointed
out, I overlooked that bit of code in events.c when I added the stacking
order chain.

	I've taken a different approach from your patch, but it works
quite nicely. If the window is one of ours, I simply pluck it from the
chain and reinsert it depending on the sibling position (or lack thereof).

	I'm still testing things, but so far tkbiff is happy, as are a
couple of other apps that do their own raising, and the override_redirect
windows (of course, I re-enabled your original patch). I should be able
to commit the fix sometime this weekend.

I have to agree with Dan that we don't want to announce a lot of betas
to the world, but since we're still announcing them to our lists at the
moment I see no problem. So unless someone else takes Dan's position
or he comes up with really good arguments the decision has been
reached by outvoting Dan. I think this is better than paralysing
ourselves with discussions at this point.

Hi all,

in case this was not obvious from my latest commit session:
I have applied this 'serious bug' fix from Red Hat along
with a myriad of small changes (mostly cosmetic, but some
were real bugs, again mostly uninitialised memory reads
if a X function call fails).

The Red Hat guys have really done a lot. There were even
signal handling patches for some modules.

Bye

Dominik

Nice to hear we will have it fixed for 2.2 after all. I think this
is the same problem as mentioned in the TODO file:

  - If programs raise their own windows (XEmacs 'other-frame', for example)
    new stacking order isn't communicated to fvwm

When you check in the fix, could you remove this from the TODO
then?

I thought from the start that your X server does something wrong.
Have you tried to start the Xserver with '-wm' to force backing
storage on?

Ah, I think I'll look myself. Don't know how to describe what I did
without looking through the code. In particular I coded a lot of
unnecessary PaintMenu calls.

> 1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)

After careful observation of the postings and bug reports
from the last months this is my analysis.

a) Something is broken with modifiers.
   People are complaining that the '1' modifier does not
   worki (but 'M' does), 'A' does not work for num-lock etc.

b) It happens only on a certain class of systems (keyboard,
   Xserver). I guess this is caused by the Xserver doing
   this in a different way than expected. I don't have a
   broken system so I need assistance by somebody who has.

c) The problem is not made easier by a bug in SloppyFocus:
   When the pointer is on the root window but a window is
   still 'sloppyfocus'ed the context of a key press is the
   window, not the root window. So all attempt to reproduce
   any of this should be without SloppyFocus first. This bug
   was in 2.0.46 as well.

d) The bug may be related to any XGrabKey/XGrabButton call
   (presumably in add_windows.c).

In my eyes this is the worst problem left. If we can't find
a way to fix it we should have a detailed description how to
work around it. This implies that we need to reproduce it.
As I said I don't have a broken system and made a number of
futile attempt to reproduce it. Tim and Dan, you often have
a keen eye when it comes down to such a level. Could you have
a try? Everybody else is invited too, of course. We need to
establish a discussion about our guesses and conclusions here.

This was the optimization for Above/Below which  i mentioned. If you 
ever come across a client that uses TopIf, BottomIf or Opposite
to restack its windows, I think you'll have  to use XQueryTree to 
reconstruct the stacking order. Fvwm could of course decide to just
drop these highly unlikely configure requests.

Is it a known problem that the focus handling of the pager isn't
quite icccm compliant ? Clicking with the middle button on  xclock 
in the pager takes the focus away from my xterm although xclock
uses the "No Input" model.

OK, I won't sulk if I'm out-voted.  Just a couple more points:

I think you  fixed the problem with modifiers  not working with button
pushes after you  created the package.  I  think it would be a mistake
to release software with such a serious problem.

With all  the  recent changes,  if  we  did  want  to release  a beta,
shouldn't it include the large number of recent changes?

I don't think I've seen any discussion about whether this patch
is 2.2 material.  My impression is that its a large enough change
that it is definitely not 2.2 material.

So far all my testing shows all the modifiers  working as they should.
Could you refresh my memory on the specific problem report.

I tested with  the Solaris 2.5.1 X Server  and Fvwm CVS as  of Friday,
and MouseFocus.

This would indicate a broken X Server or bad xmodmap more
than a fvwm problem.

	We've been thinking along much the same lines: I started at one
end, you at the other, and we met in the middle. I use the XQueryTree
as a last recourse for the 3 oddball stack modes, though I really
wanted to ignore them (why anyone might think them useful for a top
level window escapes me).

	I committed the fix to CVS a little while ago. This also
includes re-enabling your override_redirect avoidance fix.

Hi,

I am in the process of upgrading my system to libc.so.6 (almost done!) and so
have been reinstalling the X-server, compiler etc. One of the add-ons I
reinstalled was the readline library, and I was surprised to discover that
FVWM's configure script did not recognise it.

A little expedition into the script discovered a few little details:
- at line 4787, the script declares:

char readline();

This should read:

char *readline();

Another point is that I rebuilt my readline library against ncurses and not
against termcap, so I had to change -ltermcap to -lncurses everywhere.

Probably not too serious - I imagine that most sane people have both termcap
and ncurses ...

Chris.

I'm wondering what 2.1.x releases should come before 2.2
(and when).

I could imagine this (contrary to some other posting by me):

 - 2.1.8 soon, perhaps after one week, so the many patches
   since I built 2.1.7 get in.

 - 2.1.9 after the remaining problems are resolved (see
   'Status update' thread). Let a week pass for people to
   test. Only fixes for *new* reports are included now.
   All further testing will be done via CVS.

 - 2.2 a week or two after 2.1.9.

Thoughts?

Bye

Dominik

I don't see anything like this in the TODO/BUGS files. This
might be a limitation of the module interface. I don't think
the pager can tell fvwm to focus the window only if it accepts
input.

In part I created the problem myself after 2.1.7. Looking at the ChangeLog
it seems that only bindings to the client window were broken. Probably
nothing that is used often. But I really can't remember exactly. There
was so much trouble there I don't know what it started with anymore.

Isn't this always the case? If we make a 2.1.8 package now and wait
two days, won't we again have some important fixes that have to be
included immediately? It's common practice in beta tests to have
releases in regular intervals (about one per two weeks) regardless
of what has been fixed or not. The point is that we are talking about
betas. Nobody should be using 2.1.x after 2.2 is out. So, what do we
care if something is broken (as long as it's not so bad that people
do not use the beta)?

Anyway, since Jason has already announced 2.1.7 this is a topic for
future discussion.

I'll continue that in a separate thread.

No, it won't get into 2.2.

First of all, if you could look through the mailing list archives
and summarize what you find I'd be grateful (my connection at home is
so slow that I don't want to browse the archives from here).
Specifically I remember three reports:

A) Someone said that specifying 'A' for modifiers (i.e. any modifier)
   did work for caps-lock but not for num-lock. I can't remember the
   system and if this was already broken in 2.0.46. I tried to
   reproduce this, but if works on my system.

B) Neil Bird reported the '1' modifier did not work with a particular
   mouse binding entry (report attached). A reply suggested to use 'M'
   which worked on a similar system/keyboard.

C) Several people reported they got the escape sequences written
   into their xterm when they bind e.g. 'Key left w c refresh'.
   They said it worked before. One of the people was Tomas Ogren
   if I remember correctly.  We had some discussion about num-lock
   and modifiers in general and I Fixed something in ParseBindEntry().
   Although we had no complaints thereafter I can't believe that this
   has fixed the problem.
   I've been asking people several times if this is fixed, but
   nobody answered.

D) This is probably not related, but pressing certain hotkeys seems
   to disturb the colour gradients for menus (bugs #108 and #112).

I'd say the same if not all of the reports said that the very
same setup worked in some earlier version (2.1.5/2.0.46/2.0.45).
I've spent a few hours viewing diffs between 2.0.46 and some
2.1.x to find changes in key handling. That revealed nothing
though. Perhaps there were changes in add_window.c to the
XGrabKey calls? Can't remember if I verified this.

I asked the reporter (Richard Lister) to verify if this
still happens with the new signal handling, but he told
me he was away until mid January or so. Do you still
think of us, Ric?

Hi, I entered bug #71 in jitterbug. It's got to do with transients and
such. Anyway, I never realized it's just a restatement of the
override-redirect bug explicitly mentioned in the docs. So, since
those are now fixed by Matthias' patch, so too is bug #71. Could
someone with update access refile it out of confirmed and into fixed?

I also added a new bug about 3d effects and offset positioning in
menus.

Finally, does anyone know if cvs has a builtin directive (or
conveniently stores in some file) telling me when I did my last cvs
update?

Submission from: (NULL) (206.86.216.254)


When using mwm menustyle, without any menuface, fvwm seems to sometimes
forget to repaint the 3d effect on a parent, if you've been popping
submenu
children. Specifically, if your menu has submenus as adjacent entries, try
using the mouse to prepop one, then the submenu beneath it in the parent.
Then backtrack out and 3d effects on the parent menu that were obscured by
the second child will have been lost. I guess this is shows up because
mwm-style both uses a 3d effect and uses an offset that results in overlap
of
submenus over the parent. I'll guess that any 3d border effect with an
overlapping submenu will exhibit the problem.

Here's my menustyle:
MenuStyle               *       mwm, \
                                Foreground black, \

I can try to generate my a screengrab with this, if my descriptions
unclear.

I think it's important to get a version with all the configure changes

Unless you've hand-modified it, CVS/Entries gets the timestamp of when you
performed the update.  I've been using that time to label my fvwm versions.

	Done.

	Do I take it that you have updated your system from CVS since
last night, and verified that the problem, as you reported it, is fixed?

Yes, I just managed to catch your update. Your fix definitely covers
#71, as I reported it. Thanks for fixing it.

Incidentally, I figure this will probably come up at some point, so I
may as well ask the question... with StartsOnPage & SkipMapping both
on and doing what they're supposed to, I notice that placement of the
window: 1) doesn't seem to account for sticky windows and 2) doesn't
seem to avoid (with SmartPlacement also enabled) windows properly. I'm
having some trouble verifying 2) because my StartsOnPage + SkipMapping
+ SmartPlacement + SmartPlacementIsReallySmart combo behaves oddly
(seems to reverse the sign on the geometry at times -- thinking it's a
bug in my server). This is something that would be difficult to change
(assuming I'm seeing intended behavior), I take it? If not, I'm sure
it'll become a feature request, from me if from no one else...

Hi Mike,

have you ever considered asking for commit privileges on the CVS tree?

Subject: Border colours "wrong"

Full_Name: Tet
Version: 2.1.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.6 / Sparc
X_Server: Openwindows (8bpp)
Submission from: (NULL) (143.252.80.101)


The borders on windows in FVWM 2.* are more extreme than their
counterparts in FVWM 1.*. The values chosen for light and dark
shading to provide the 3D look are different between the two.

For a MediumSlateBlue border, fvwm-1.2n uses #ac92ff and #3d3477
for shading, while fvwm-2.1.4 uses #e5e0ff and #3d3378.

Of the two, fvwm-1.24n looks the more natural, while the fvwm-2.1.4
colours are harsher on the eye. FVWM 2.* has natural looking shading
for most other colours, it just seems to be this particular shade of
blue and other close colours.

I initially thought it might be an artifact of the 8-bit visual, and
not enough colours being available. However, it's 100% reproducable,
irrespective of what other apps are running. Also, fvwm-1.24 can
correctly display the appropriate shading for the same apps running.
I can switch between the two, quite happily, with fvwm-1.24 getting
the colours right, and 2.1.4 getting them wrong.

Apologies if this has already appeared in a bug report, but the online
search mechanism didn't seem to be working.

I have the following two lines in my .fvwm2rc, and everything 
was perfect in Fvwm 2.0.46.  But after I installed version
2.1.7, the context "W" does not work anymore.  When I press 
Ctrl key or Melt key and click mouse button 1 in an application 
window, nothing happens.

Mouse 1 TSIFW	C	Menu Utilities Nop
Mouse 1 TSIFW	M	RaiseLower

I don't know if it is a new feature or a bug.

I was cruising through Jitterbug, and I see bug #108 has a note that
says "see #112", so I go look at #112, and it has a note that says "see
#108" :)

I think when dup bugs come in the best way to handle this is to pick one
to be the "master" bug, and put all info in that bug.  Track it in the
confirmed folder or wherever you normally would.  Then, change all the
rest to say "see bug #nnn" and put them in the dups folder.  If there is
extra useful info in the new bug that isn't in the original, you might
want to summarize it and add a note to the original.

That way all the details we need are kept in one place, and eventually
(maybe after the release in which the bug is fixed?) we could even trash
the dups.

Note that the color calculations were changed, in order to get more
consistent color schemes across a wider range of colors (the old
algorithm failed _miserably_ for some colors).

However, I think the values that control this have been tweaked a few
different times.  I can't recall whether the last time was before or
after 2.1.4; you might check the ChangeLog.  Please grab the latest beta
(2.1.7) and see if the colors look better there.

It is working, it's just a bit confusing to use at first.

Enter a string to search and use the search button.  You might think
nothing is returned, but look at the categories on the left side and
you'll see that the numbers are different: they're now showing just the
bugs that match your search.  Click on a category to see the bugs in
that category that matched your search.

Err, no. I've never had a patch accepted into the tree, so it hasn't
come up yet. Besides, I don't think you guys want me to have commit
privs... Though write access for jitterbug I could see. I've now got
quite a few in there (four I think).

You're right, I was being lazy at the wrong moment (cut-and-paste
works rather unreliably on my system).

Good advice, there was a change to the calculation after 2.1.4.

I'll grab the latest one at some point, then. However, there's no
mention of the change in the NEWS page on the web site, and I can't
see a way of getting the full changelog without downloading the
new version...

Well, you can see the latest via CVSWeb:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fvwm/ChangeLog?cvsroot=FVWM

Note NEWS is for user-visible changes only; I suppose on some level this
might be argued to be user-visible but I consider it a bug fix instead.
The idea is users should read NEWS and know what's visibly different
about this release from the last, rather than all the nitty developer
details.

Perhaps you just didn't recognize it.  This is from the NEWS file:

* Improved Shadow/Hilite algorithm (from scwm).  Logic moved into
  library and all modules with 3D logic now use this routine.

Dominik, I didn't report the xclock problem. You're probably thinking
of me in connection with the growing tkbiff. I'm hoping to test that
one out today or tomorrow.

Uh oh, sorry! My memory has failed me, it was Philip Hollenback.

Subject: Fvwm needs a shared module lib

Full_Name: Paul D. Smith
Version: 2.1.8
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: X11R6.3
Submission from: (NULL) (192.32.138.39)
Submitted by: psmith


Fvwm should create a library of functions for modules to use, and
should install it when asked.  The library should be created both
as a static and shared library (using the normal autoconf flags
to control this).

Headers should be installed as well.  This leads to a slight problem:
all the modules and headers right now rely on config.h which means
that would have to be installed too.  Obviously you couldn't install it
in /usr/local/include, so it would have to be installed in the FVWM
module directory.  That may or may not be what the user wants!

Or, we could rename config.h to fvwmconfig.h or something and just
install it.

The little patch below seems to do it (but it has been only minimally
tested).

I haven't examined this myself, but it bears mentioning that
the "Lenience" setting is used to bypass the ICCCM focus setting
rules and could have some influence on how this works.

I recently posted a bug(?) to the bugtracking system [#115].  I
checked today and it's been classified as a not-a-bug.  That's great,
but how do I configure things to give me the old behavior back.  There
doesn't seem to be any audit/followup information on the bug.

I thought I'd answered this. Anyway, the reason for this change was
that you could end up un the item of an menu invoked with 'Popup'
and select something you did not want, so I made a change that
the mouse click is ignored if you release it fast without moving
the mouse. Some people seem to use such a click as a fast way
to invoke a default application from a menu without a title.
To get this again you need to define a default action for the
Popup like this:

  DestroyMenu foo
  AddToMenu foo "xterm" Exec xterm
  ...

  Popup foo Exec xterm

Well, this was a bit impulsive on my side, but I won't back
down easily. Perhaps I'm trying to shanghai you ;-) We have
a lot of people on the lists that are enthusiastic but few
show the keen understanding of what goes on in the code and
the same level-headedness as you do. Or as I had had said in
German: who know where the hammer is hanging.

The main criterion for me is that people see the whole picture
before they begin patching. I wouldn't fear you having commit
priviledges. And we need able and enthusiastic folks to help
us. At the moment there are six active persons with commit
priviledges (you can't really count Jason and Brady). Steve
Robbins and Paul Smith do a lot for portability. With Dan
Espen, Bob Woodside, Tim Phipps and me that makes about four
people that are working on new features or enhancement
requests in the near future. Not many if you have seen our
to do list, all the unapplied patches and open bugs.

In the end it's your decision how you want to spend your
spare time, but if you spend some on fvwm you're welcome.
If you feel uncomfortable or think my trust is misplaced
you might als well start with write access to Jitterbug.
I would greatly welcome this. So, why don't you talk about
this with Jason?

And perhaps most important: Five months ago I knew almost
nothing about fvwm (apart from two patches I created). Since
I took up all these responsibilities I've spent nearly as
much time on fvwm as on my job. This won't continue much
longer (to be precise, no longer than until 2.2 as I always
said from the start). I want to lean back comfortably and
watch others doing the dirty work for a while then :)

Think about it.

Bye

Dominik

I think the fvwm list is aware of the difference, the point about
the web pages is well taken.  How about listing 2.1.4 and 2.1.7
with a note next to 2.1.7 indicating that Button Modifiers don't
work in 2.1.7?

I'm working on a patch for fvwm-1.24r that supports the GNOME window
manager hints.  I've completed most of the work, but there's still some
cleanup to do and some intigration with the origional fvwm-1.24 sources.

It currently supports:
  * the GNOME pager
  * GNOME client list
  * proxying of root window mouse clicks for the file manager

I'm wondering how you would feel about releasing a fvwm-1.25 with GNOME
compliance?

Regards,
Jay Painter

hey folks,

I seem to be having a problem with V/HGradients in a MenuFace with the popup
bound to a titlebar button. Here's what I have:


MenuStyle	"*" Background rgb:4d/42/53, Foreground rgb:ac/a4/bf, \
		    ActiveFore rgb:e5/e1/33, Greyed Grey40, mwm, Animation, \
		    MenuFace HGradient 40 rgb:00/00/00 rgb:00/40/50,\
		    HilightBackOff, SeparatorsShort, Hilight3DOff, \
		    Font -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-*-120-120-*-*-iso8859-1

AddToMenu Window-Ops
+	"Move &To"				PopUp	MoveTo
+	"&Move Window"				Move
+	"&Identify"				Module	FvwmIdent
+	"&Close"				Close
+	"De&lete"				Delete
+	"&Destroy"				Destroy
+	"&Refresh Desktop"			Refresh		


AddToMenu MoveTo
+	"&Text Processing"			MoveToPage 0 0
+	"&Internet & Network"			MoveToPage 0 1
+	"&Multimedia"				MoveToPage 1 0
+	"&Development"				MoveToPage 1 1

It works fine on my 'root menu' but not the popup for button 1 on the titlebar.
Whats wierd is that the root menu looks fine after a fresh start or restart,
but after I start a rxvt terminal or an application and click button 1, the
root menu will change to the solid 'Background' with my MiniIcon from button 1
stuck on the upper-left corner of the root menu. Not sure if this is a bug, or
if I am not using the right sequence for MenuStyle attributes or what.

	(Neil, your note wasn't cc'ed to the workers' list. That's why
I've quoted the whole thing, so all the developers are kept up to date.)

	I'm afraid we all misinterpreted your original note as describing
part of a bug in the StartsOnPage code; and since we knew that the fix
for it had just been committed to CVS, we didn't give it much thought.
(Actually, the fix went in before the 2.1.6 tagging.)

	Unfortunately, the problem you're having wasn't related to
StartsOnPage, or to the use of the -iconic flag, which *does* work now.
It isn't even new with the 2.1.x betas - I just verified that it also
happened with 2.0.46 (a little differently, of course, since you didn't
have the StartsOnPage style then).

	Netscape does something that seems to override *both* StartIconic
and SkipMapping (when used together with StartIconic). It does seem to be
peculiar to Netscape. It's not a generic Motif thing: I tried 3 other
Motif apps (and a variety of non- Motif ones) with a style like this:

	Style  "Netscape*"  StartIconic, SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 1 1 1

They all worked flawlessly.

	That's as far as I've gotten so far.


- Bob

	I'm a little confused here. Do you mean window dimension geometry,
or window placement geometry? If you're specifying a placement geometry,
that should override all the FiendishlyCleverPlacement options.

	Ok, I looked at it. CleverPlacement has never quite handled the
SkipMapping case properly, but StartsOnPage reversed the symptom.

	Prior to the 2.1 betas, CleverPlacement didn't avoid windows on
the target page if you had SkipMapping and StartsOnDesk,because it
always calculated interference with windows in the current viewport.
It did, however, avoid sticky windows, quite by accident...becase, of
course, they're always in the current viewport.

	StartsOnPage changed the logic to avoid windows on the target
page, not necessarily the current one. Unfortunately, I overlooked
the case of sticky windows, so now sticky windows aren't avoided but
regular windows are.

	I'll get to work on it as soon as I can.

I may be misunderstanding/misremembering here, but I seem to recall
AddTo* lines that don't actually have anything to add causing trouble
for the rcfile parser. So you may want to try closing up the lines I
left unsnipped, into:

AddToMenu Window-Ops    "Move &To"  PopUp MoveTo
...

AddToMenu MoveTo    "&Text Processing"  MoveToPage 0 0

Or it could be something entirely different.

Okay, lemme try that again. CleverPlacement of StartsOnPage &
SkipMapping windows, being mapped off-Page, doesn't seem to avoid
windows on that page at all. Now I could be imagining things. But when
I say the geometry is getting the sign reversed, I mean that on my
1152x900 display, a startsonpage 0 1 sometimes starts on 0 -1
(geometry 0-900), making it hard to tell if the CleverPlacement is
properly avoiding other windows when placing windows off-Page as
directed by StartOnPage & SkipMapping... I hope this makes sense this
time.

Yes, but especially for reasons like "Lenience" it is the right thing
to let the pager instruct fvwm to change focus and have fvwm deal with
the details. In this way, pager and wm will use the same policy for
focus handling. I'd even say that the pager should handle all manipulations
which are normally the duty of the wm in this way.

  That'd be more my fault in the phrasing I used; I only came across the
problem after using StartsOnPage, so I kind of associated the two.

  That's OK; just so long as you're aware of it. I'm currently happy
enough with my:

AddToFunc Iconify-Netscape  \
   "I" Wait MailThread
+  "I" Next [MailThread] Iconify 1

  ... at startup!

I think the right thing is to NOT install the sample.fvwmrc.

Its hard to imagine that a user would be happy running fvwm2 with the
sample.fvwmrc that we supply.  If this file gets installed and used,
it would have to first be modified by the fvwm2 administrator.

Its seems logical that the fvwm2 administrator would not want new
installations of fvwm2 wiping out his changes to this file.

Wouldn't it be simpler to just deal with the shared library which
has apparent benefits, and forget about the headers.

I don't have any "private" modules that would give me a need for
installing header files, but I don't think its clear that you would
install fvwm2, (including the headers), and then start compiling
your private modules.

Or maybe I'm missing the point?

So... how would you compile private modules?  The other option is to
require a complete build of the fvwm2 tree available when you want to
compile a module.  Also this can get a little trickier if you're using
remote builds, because then some of the source (like config.h) is
available in the remote directory while the rest (fvwmlib.h) is
in the source tree.

I've dealt with a number of packages that require you to have the full
source tree around to compile against the library, and I always think
it's a big pain.  But, esp. given the number of external modules we
currently have :), I wouldn't put this high on anyone's TODO list.  I
just was thinking about it and wanted to get it into the bug database
for future reference.

I think David's point is a good one, though: we shouldn't be moving bugs
into "dead-end" queues like "not a bug", "no fix", and "enh. reject"
(even, IMHO, "postponed") without some kind of note or reply stating the
reason, stored in the bug itself.

If we just email it, people will forget and want to go back and look.
Also, people will be searching the bug DB (we hope! :) and they'd like
to see the answer.

Also, remember you can create a FAQ entry in Jitterbug from any reply to
a bug!  This is cool.  If you type in a response that you feel is
FAQ-worthy, mark it like that in the reply.  Then, if/when the bug
report comes around again you can just send out the old reply (if I
understand this feature correctly).

This one seems a good candidate.

Hmm... Looks like someone's been playing around with the corporate
sendmail configuration.  Ho hum.

This is still really me, and my old address psmith@baynetworks.com will
continue to work for some amount of time, anyway.

Like that new username I didn't get to pick?  Very obvious, ain't it?
Gotta love the corporate mindset :-/.

Please say it isn't so!  FVWM1 is dead, dead, dead.  The sources haven't
been touched in years.  I wouldn't be surprised if nobody here had ever
looked at the source.

With 2.2 this close to reality, I can't imagine it ever happening.

Of course, we really want this functionality in FVWM2, though it is
probably best to save it until after 2.2 is released.  We've just been
looking for someone who is willing to do the work (and trying to get any of
the GNOME folks to respond to some comments on the rather poor quality of
the documentation of the GNOME-specific hints).

Is there anyone here who remembers anything about FVWM1 and who might
comment on how difficult it might be to bring this work into the modern age
so that it's not wasted?

This logic in icons.c:

 if(test_window->Desk == t->Desk) {
   if((test_window->flags&ICONIFIED) &&
       (!test_window->tmpflags.IconifiedByParent) &&     <=======
      (test_window->icon_w||test_window->icon_pixmap_w) &&

causes Netscape 4.5 to iconify to location +20+20 which is definitely
not in my iconbox.

With the line with the arrow commented out, things return to normal.

Try 'make clean; rm config.cache' and rebuild the whole
2.1.7 again. If the problem persists try to fetch us a
stack trace from the coredump with

  # gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

and post your configuration lines for the pager, please.

Great. You're the fourth person to report this and we did not
find a way to reproduce it up to now. You even get two of the
mysterious problems at once (the mini icon and the missing
background). You could do as a *big* favour and try the following:

1) Tell us which version you are using.

2) Rebuild the whole tree in a fresh diretory so we can be sure
   it is a bug in fvwm and not a build problem (that might still
   be an fvwm bug).

3) Mutilate your .fvwm2rc but removing all lines that do not
   influence this bug.

Your help would be appreciated. We can't fix this unless we
know how to reproduce the problem.

Thank you

Dominik

You are right, but I have a problem with Jitterbug. At my job I
can't spend the day hacking bug reports and such and at home
my access to Jitterbug is *extremely* slow (often it takes
several minutes to load a single page and in Germany this
costs real money). Writing a reply to a single bug report
costs me about half a dollar so I try to avoid it at home.
That is one of the reasons I'm quite dissatisfied with
Jitterbug. It has so much overhead for each page. It would
be great if there was a possibility to work offline like
with CVS although in the end I'd like to switch to a better
bug tracker.

I don't understand why this is so.  Jitterbug doesn't have any graphics
or other fancy things in its pages, so there's no reason for it to be
any slower than any other www page.  All the CGI stuff is done on the
server so that shouldn't be a cause for problems on your end.

Are you saying _all_ your www access is that slow, or that Jitterbug
pages are especially slow?

It _doesn't_, though!  I don't understand why you say this.  Jitterbug
is so simple: it uses a few tables and some forms, and that's _it_.
There are no graphics (except the FVWM logo), no Java, no _nothing_.

Use the "View Source" option in your browser and see; I just looked at
the "not a bug" list with 4 bugs, and it was just 203 lines of HTML,
(under 8K) start to end, and nothing else.

I just don't see how you could possibly get any less overhead than this
unless you want to remove all the forms stuff, and then how would you do
any actual handling of bugs?

  dv> It would be great if there was a possibility to work offline like

  dv> tracker.

Well, Jitterbug is largely email-based, underneath.  You should be able
to send emails to it and have them show up associated with the bug as
replies.

I don't think you can create a FAQ entry like that (but maybe you can)
but you can definitely log notes to bugs.

I understand the problem, but I don't know what to do about it.  I've
never heard of a web-based bug tracking system that lets you work
off-line; I don't even know how that would work: you would download
all the bugs you're interested in and modify them offline, then upload
the changes?

I also think Jitterbug has some missing features, but any web-based
tracking system we replace it with will almost certainly have _more_
overhead, not less.  I can't see how it could be otherwise.

Subject: Menus in the Pager

A little extension of the pager. Alt-M2 over a window
in the pager pops up a menu. The menu actions will be 
applied to the window corresponding to the pager window. 
What menu to pop up is determined by the new config command 

FvwmPagerMenu menu

A useful example would be

FvwmPagerMenu Window-Ops

While implementing this, I found that it also needs a
little patch to fvwm/module.c to keep fvwm from dumping
core in ExecuteFunction. (There is code in HandleModuleInput
that pretends to handle Popup commands, but it forgets
to set ButtonWindow).

Shortcomings of this patch:

 *) Since the menu is popped up by fvwm, the actions must
    be fvwm commands. This is not quite appropriate for some
    actions, eg Move. One could probably have the pager do 
    it itself by using SendToModule. This would also need
    the pointer warped back over the (pager) window after
    popping down the menu.

 *) Instead of hard-coding Alt-M2, it might be worth a thought
    to make the bindings of the pager configurable like fvwm's.
    
 *) Maximizing offscreen windows behaves unfriendly. See my 
    next mail.

Subject: Consistency of toggling functions
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


While playing with my window-group stuff, I wanted to have
a non-toggling Stick function. This made me think about
toggling functions in fvwm in general. I came up with the following
list:

Iconify [value]
Maximize [h v]
RaiseLower 
Stick
WindowShade [opt]

Among these five, two (Iconify, WindowShade) offer non-toggling variants 
through optional arguments, but they use different values to fix 
directions (Iconify: > 0 / < 0; WindowShade: = 1 / = 2), 
and one has directional variants (RaiseLower: Raise, Lower).
The remaining two do not offer non-toggling variants.

The following patch attempts to improve the consistency of this 
by adding an optional parameter to Maximize and Stick and change
the semantics of the WindowShade parameter to be like the others. 

For Maximize, this means that it can now be called with 0, 1, 2 or 3
parameters. If the number of parameters is odd, the first one is the
toggling parameter.

For WindowShade, this patch is an incompatible change, but I think
the improved consistency is worth it.

When did windowshade make it into the source?  If it came in as a 2.1
feature then we should be free to change its behavior up until 2.2 (with
good reason, of course, but I think this is a pretty good reason).

That was this binding bug in 2.1.7.

I have applied the patch but had a little problem with it.
It seemed to be strangely formatted and could only be applied
by hand. Could that be some strange setting of your editor?
You should send your patches as attachment so that the mail
program doesn't touch it to break long lines.

Argh, if I hear another word about icon placement/iconification I'll
run amok. This was a fix for this transient iconification bug.
Could you try this:

 if(test_window->Desk == t->Desk) {
   if((test_window->flags&ICONIFIED) &&
       (!(test_window->test_window->flags&TRANSIENT) ||
        !test_window->tmpflags.IconifiedByParent)
      (test_window->icon_w||test_window->icon_pixmap_w) &&

But I'm sure you had. This was already in 2.0.46 and probably a
lot versions before that. The problem is that WindowId needs a
window to operate on and then ignores it completely.

To the folks on the workers list:

The problem lies in parse.h. WindowId is listed in the section with
functions that need a window. As are lots of other functions I don't
believe that should be there:

    F_SEND_STRING,
    F_ADD_MOD,
    F_DESTROY_MOD,
    F_ECHO,
    F_BORDERSTYLE,
    F_WINDOWID,
    F_ADD_BUTTON_STYLE,
    F_ADD_TITLE_STYLE,
    F_ADD_DECOR,
    F_DESTROY_DECOR,
    F_UPDATE_DECOR,
    F_COLOR_LIMIT,

At least these functions have the FUNC_NO_WINDOW attribute set in functions.c.
I think we shouldn't use column 3 in the functions table to check if a
function needs a window at all. Colums four should suffice. The big question
is: will fvwm continue to work if I change that now (complec.c)?

  c> fixed readline prototype in configure

Not necessary.

Note configure is a _generated_ file, created by autoconf out of
configure.in.  You can't (shouldn't) change it; the next time someone
changes configure.in any changes'll just get lost.  Any changes that
need to go into configure must be made in configure.in.

Further, as my reply to the original message said, this definition of
readline is _not_ a bug and is the proper one (we're just testing to see
if the program links, not if it runs, so it doesn't matter if the
prototype is correct or not).

  c> added SideColor and SidePic options to MenuStyle

This kind of thing should be mentioned in NEWS, too, IMO.

Well, if you really meant:

 if(test_window->Desk == t->Desk) {
   if((test_window->flags&ICONIFIED) &&
       (!(test_window->flags&TRANSIENT) ||
        !test_window->tmpflags.IconifiedByParent) &&
      (test_window->icon_w||test_window->icon_pixmap_w) &&

then the  Netscape problem doesn't  occur.  Bear in  mind that I never
saw the problem this patch  was intended to fix,  so I can't say if it
fixes the problem it was intended to fix.

Just to be crystal clear: not only are we only testing linkage but we
don't include the readline.h header, so the real prototype isn't around

Is it absolutely REQUIRED?  ie: can I still use the autoconf 2.12?
I just repulled the 2.1.8 tip and found out that it requires a minimum
of autoconf 2.13.  Will 2.12 suffice?  ie: is anyone using the new
macros?   It's be nice if the minimum was 2.12 -- that way people with
2.13 could get it (and it's bug-fixes) while folks with the old 2.12
could still compile the tip...

You only need autoconf if you're going to be rebuilding configure.  If you
are, then 2.13 is required, but otherwise you don't need it at all.

T> I just repulled the 2.1.8 tip

What's a tip (in this context)?

If you're just pulling sources out of CVS and compiling them, you don't
need autoconf at all.

Yes, it's required.  Yes, we're using new macros in 2.13.  No, 2.12 will
not suffice.

:)

However, you shouldn't need _any_ version of autoconf unless you're
modifying configure.in, etc., since all the necessary files are already
in the tree.

If we change that we should do it right. When I see a call like
'RaiseLower 27', what am I supposed to think what it does? Or
'WindowShade -1'? If we start working on the syntax we should
do something that is easy to understand, e.g. give all of these
builtins an optional (and unique) first argument:

  Iconify [on | off | toggle]
  Stick [on | off | toggle]
  Maximize [on | off | toggle]
  WindowShade [on | off | toggle]

and if it's really needed (I don't think so):

  RaiseLower [raise | lower | toggle]

This can even be merged with the old syntax.

That's a huge memory leak. Every time you call on of these
functions a leak the size of the whole command line will
occur. You have to use 'free(junk);'.

I don't think parsing should be done this way. First we allocate
memory for every token on the line, then throw it away and begin
parsing the whole line again. With explicit non-integer arguments
you can easily avoid this.

This isn't any easier to implement than comparing to strings.
Have a look at the examples in builtins.c that use
GetTokenIndex or preferrably GetNextTokenIndex. Costs only
a few bytes (for the strings) but is much easier to
understand.

Tim,

you've spent quite some time to get this alt-tab stuff
running. I was wondering how people will ever know what
they have to do to get it (I've followed your patches
and I don't know). And it's even in the announcement.
Could you write something in the NEWS or FAQ files or
the manpage?

Bye

Dominik

Ok, I'm a bit over zealous in the last days.

I've seen no discussion on this readline mail at all. Did you
reply to the list? I see that the mail had a peculiar recipient
address: fvwm-workers@WellHouse.fll.bellsouth.net

You should talk with Fred Maciel. We is or was writing a
module that allows exactly this (fred-m@crl.hitachi.co.jp).

Of course. That's why I don't like to apply patches by hand.

I was just lazy there. I can remember I was thinking 'well, that
can never happen, a non-transient window can never be iconified
by its parent'. I don't see any reason why this should break the
fix. That means the odds are 75 to 25 that it breaks the fix ;-)
Anyway, let somebody else verify this, I'm so tired of all these
icons :)

No, its only Jitterbug. Well, my www access is slow (what you would

Well, at work (HP-UX 10.20) is see it flickering and repaining the
pages all the time (and it's similarly slow, but that may be
because of the ancient machine I have).

The problem is that I don't have the bug 'database' on my disk.
If this could be downloaded (or better: updated) in a single
sweep that would help a lot.

Submission from: (NULL) (208.203.104.2)


I have been using FvwmWinList since 2.0.046 and has always worked using my
.fvwm2rc
file.  With 2.1.7, FvwmWinList displays during initial startup, but
disappears
when I attempt to click any of the buttons.  Attempting to restart it
results in
FvwmWinList flashing (displays and immediately disappears).  I tried
different
settings to no avail.  Here are my current settings:

*FvwmWinListBack thistle3
*FvwmWinListFore Black
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Focus, Raise

Hey, I like fvwm-1!  I also GNU Autoconf'ed it so it doesn't use imake
anymore ;)  Anyways, it looks like I'll probably continue to do a little
development on it and check it into GNOME CVS as gnome-example-wm,
somthing to ship with gnome so users trying out gnome don't have to
download and compile a window manager until they decide they like it.
Is everyone okay with this?

I'm sure I can get basic support in very quickly if fvwm-2 is anything
like fvwm-1.  Almost all the changes are isolated in one gnome.c file, and
as a first swing at this we can stick to implimenting the gnome features
that are easy.  The documentation for the GNOME hints isn't the greatest;
I eneded up using it in conjunction with the E source code to figure it
out.

One issue with GNOME compliance is that it proxies root mouse clicks.
This means no WM controlled menus for the left&right buttons; however, I
think we can keep that configurable by having an option to bind those
mouse clicks to the gnome button proxy.

Older versions of Netscape (3.0 at least) have a serious time with forms
with large numbers of buttons and textareas.  Netscape 4 and 4.5, in
contrast, seem really smooth.

I will point out that Lynx seems to handle the Jitterbug pages fine.  Not
terribly pretty, but usable.  It does complain about a bit of bad HTML on
occasion, but I haven't tried to track it down.

I was thinking about this this morning.  We already build (though not
install) libfvwm.  We could just dump the module functions in there, no?
Or is there an advantage to a separate libfvwm_module?  (Most modules
would be linking with libfvwm, anyway)

Yes, 2.13 *is* required.  That's why configure.in is marked as such ;-) 
We're using at least one new macro: AC_FUNC_SELECT, which is rather neat. 

Also: there is a new automake 1.3d, though at present, none of the
Makefile.am's require 1.3d.  Still, there's a slight annoyance in that
1.3d obsoletes "AM_PROG_INSTALL", so I had to change it back to
"AC_PROG_INSTALL" in configure.in.  I don't think it causes any problems
for people using older automakes, but I don't know for sure ...

The problem it causes for me is that when someone with an older automake
checks in a rebuilt "aclocal.m4" file, it includes the "AM_PROG_INSTALL"
macro, and autoconf fails for me.

One easy solution to this latter problem is to just remove all the derived
files from CVS, as advocated last week.  I know that it requires people
using cvs sources to get autoconf & automake, but that's a very easy task
compared to installing cvs!

I included the auto*-built files in CVS initially because it was easier
during the transition to autoconf.  With the transition over, these files
are causing more problems than they solve, it seems to me.  How about we
give all interested parties one week, say, to install the auto* tools, and
then we remove the built files from the repository?

Looks like something has thwarted the expansion of the alias
"fvwm-workers" that I installed. Ugh - that'll teach me to upgrade

Wacky!  I didn't see any message from Paul either.

Sounds to me like you need to upgrade your browser.  I don't see any of
this with Netscape 4.x, what are you using?

You might also want to try lynx or Emacs W3 mode, and see if that's
acceptably faster.  Since Jitterbug doesn't use any images you shouldn't
lose much (as long as they handle the tables and forms mostly
correctly).

For now, perhaps, but bug databases have a habit of getting a lot bigger
than the code they're associated with :)

Hmm.  Maybe that's the problem; I didn't notice.  But, I didn't get any

No, libfvwm is fine and exactly what I was thinking.  Not sure how much
stuff in the current libfvwm is there only for fvwm and not for the
modules; if there's any significant amount we should consider moving it
to some fvwm-only library and out of the common one.

 a) It needs more stuff in it; I'm sure there're are more "common"
    functions we could collect that would make writing modules even
    simpler and more coherent.

 b) It needs to be able to be made shared lib--libtool, I assume, once
    2.2 is gone.

 c) The header file(s) issue needs to be addressed.

This is really what that bug was attempting to lay out, as a placeholder.

Well, you can do what you like, of course, but I personally don't like
it much.

The big problem is that fvwm1 and fvwm2 don't have compatible config
files, so it's a chore (even with the conversion script) to change from
1 to 2.

1 is _really_ obsolete, and we definitely aren't doing any more work on
it including features _or_ bugfixes.  I'd just hate to see something
that comes "standard" with GNOME be something so old and crusty, and at
the same time something with no easy upgrade path to something better.

My $0.02.

Do you mean just unpack everything and recompile?:

./configure ; make ; make install

I didnt use any special options. Not sure what you mean exactly.

I think the problem is with the MiniIcon attribute in 'ButtonStyle' or
the MiniIcon attribute in 'Style'. Heres what I have for a minimal
config file for the bug to 'work':

ModulePath /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.1.7
PixmapPath /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/include/pixmaps
IconPath /usr/X11R6/include/bitmaps
MenuStyle "*" MenuFace HGradient 40 rgb:00/00/00 rgb:00/40/50
ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon
Style "*" MiniIcon mini-question.xpm
Mouse 2 R A Menu Window-Ops
Mouse 0 1 A Menu Window-Ops
AddToMenu Window-Ops
+ "terminal" Exec rxvt

Clicking button 3 will bring up the menu and it looks ok, then clicking
on 'terminal' and then the titlebar button will screw up. The Window-ops
menu retrieved from the root window wont be messed up anymore because the
focus will be out of the terminal. On my original post, the root menu
was messed up because 'SloppyFocus' was set in a 'Style'. But starting a
program that doesnt have a SloppyFocus attribute then moving the pointer
out to the root window, the root menu looks fine. So it must be something
with a screen/window refresh?

Subject: AutoArrange within IconBox

Full_Name: Linus Nilsson
Version: 2.1.7
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux/OpenBSD
X_Server: XFree86
Submission from: (NULL) (194.47.215.50)


      I would like to suggest a new IconBox feature: AutoArrange.

This would work like in e.g. Window Maker. Whenever a window is deiconified
or
destroyed (maybe there are other events that would trigger this?) all icons
in
IconBoxes would rearrange (like they do when a Restart is made) and move to

fill the box from where it "starts". This way icons in the IconBox would
not 
end up scattered all over after a while. (Maybe a [SortIcons boolean] would
be
considered used here to keep track of the order of the icons in the
IconBox.)

I am convinced that this feature would be welcommed by a great deal of
people.

It would be nice if FvwmIconMan*dontshow and ...*show would take 
more complex expressions like [!iconic] and such. What I miss is
also to be able to set the colors of Fields in the IconMan showing
iconfified windows. If that was possible I could do without that 
little box before the name of the window aswell. (;
(sorry for ranting)

	It does now. I was able to reproduce it...and -1 -1, and other
wondrous things. Don't be too quick to scrap your X server: it's most
likely all my doing. StartsOnPage contained a tupo ("-=" instead of "=")
that caused CleverPlacement to go bonkers...sometimes.

	I've added the code to CleverPlacement to avoid sticky windows
properly. I've noticed a couple of other bits of peculiar behavior with
CleverPlacement that I'd like to fix, so it'll probably be a couple of
days before I commit the changes.

It would be enough to get a tarfile of the open bugs.
Jason, could you provide some automatic method for
this (e.g. a tarfile for each of the directories)?

Thanks. Perhaps this will bring us closer to the problem.

I'll take care of removing this bug report. In the future you
should send your comments to bug reports directly to the

your messages appear as new bug reports.

Ick!  That sounds like a bug in the bug tracker: shouldn't replies be
classified as "further notes" or something?

Mmm.  Even if 80% of libfvwm is only used by fvwm proper, I don't think it
is a problem.  

There are two cases.  If the lib is static, then the linker will only pull
out what the module needs, so it makes no difference in module size, etc. 
If the lib is shared, it will be loaded into mem by fvwm anyway, so again
it doesn't impact on performance, right?

Yeah, this project has been at the back of my mind for some time now.
 
>  c) The header file(s) issue needs to be addressed.

I don't think that "config.h" is the problem, actually: that file mostly
contains system-compatibility stuff.  If I were building a module outside
of fvwm, I'd have it autoconf'd, and would have my own config.h. 

The headers that need to be installed would be some or all of libs/*.h and
fvwm/*.h.  It would be best, of course, if the installable ones were all
in libs/ but for some reason "module.h" is in fvwm/.

	Yeah... but I'm not convinced it is doing it.  I use both
AcceleratedX and XFree... and neither of them do it...  I haven't tried
really hard to test it, though.

	I did notice alot of paintmenu calls, but I didn't want to mess
with them as I am not so familiar with the menu system.

You are free to do what you like, but I don't like it at all.

If you only "like" fvwm1, you will "love" fvwm2.

I wouldn't be surprised  to hear that your  gnome patches apply easily
to fvwm2.  Large  parts of fvwm have  changed from fvwm1 to fvwm2, but
some of the more basic stuff is intact.

I think you would be doing a real dis-service  by trying to perpetuate
fvwm1.

Then I suspect that you would be part of a very small minority. The
average user would expect to be able to #include the header file and
go, not have to generate an extra header manually and especially not
have to learn about autoconf.

Is there a way that "make install" could generate a new fvwmlib.h
header using the current config.h and the preprocessor or some other
tool? I've seen a lot of packages that seem to generate header files
out of fragments at configure time. Is this any different?

Chris.

I still don't see the need  to install the  headers, I still think the
timing  is wrong, and  I don't see why  a  private module can't have a
make file that points into the fvwm2 source tree of the day.

However,    if   the   fvwm       headers    were      installed    as
<prefix>/include/fvwm/config.h, etc.    the header name   conflict for
config.h wouldn't be an issue.  We would need  to make a corresponding
change inside  of fvwm2, to match   the new way of  including headers,
Ie. "#include <fvwm/config.h>".

Certainly. That's one of the reasons I don't think

Note I'm not suggesting this be done soon, before 2.2.  This is "future
stuff".

I'd love to see a shared libfvwm.so for 2.3, but anything beyond that I
don't know.  The fact is we don't _have_ tons of extra modules being
developed, so this isn't a critical issue by any stretch.

  de> and I don't see why a private module can't have a make file that

By "private" I mean a module which isn't distributed by fvwm.  It could
well be distributed by someone else and be incredibly popular
(like tkgoodstuff).

The problem with requiring that it use a source tree is that then, to
build and install it, you need the source to fvwm2.  That can be a pain:
maybe you installed fvwm2 last year and the source is long gone: now you
have to grab a new copy and build (or at least configure) that before
you can build the cool new module.

As I said, I've used a number of packages like this and I personally
always find them a pain in the rear, and mumble under my breath about
the folks who don't install the proper files so I don't need to do it
:).

  de> However, if the fvwm headers were installed as

I agree on the first point; that's a possibility.

Not on the second one, though: one of the problems anyone has when doing
this is making sure that the build of the _current_ version never uses
the headers and libraries globally installed for the _previous_ version.
You may recall that fvwm used to have this exact problem, itself, when
it installed libfvwm.a.

One trivial way to ensure this doesn't happen is by keeping the
directory structures different enough that the old stuff just isn't
seen.  For libraries we already win since the pathname to the lib dir
now has the version number in it.

It should use backing storage unless you tell it otherwise (perhaps
you see a difference when you explicitly turn it off wit '-bs'?) or
if it runs out of resources. Since I could reproduce the bugs you
reported only when I switched backing storage off I'm convinced your
X server isn't using it. Do you have a lot of big overlapping
windows perhaps?

Don't worry about that, I've cleaned that up in the meantime.

Well, not really.  Recall that shared libraries incur a performance
penalty over static.  The numbers I've seen vary from 1% to 5% (for
ELF).  The thing is that shared libraries are position-independent (they
have to be, to be shared) so there's an extra bit to calculate offsets
when you reference functions and variables in the shared lib.

You might argue that (a) the amount of code that is used by fvwm2 but
not by any modules isn't much, and (b) the performance hit isn't that
big.  I'd agree with both of these, but I'd also point out that a window
manager is one of those apps where people really care about speed--I
wouldn't lose sleep over it, but all things being equal it'd be nice to
make all fvwm2-only functions statically linked.

First, I don't want to make that requirement.  Sure, maybe we'd autoconf
it but not everyone will.  If it's just a little module with a .c and a
man page, why bother?

Second, autoconf'ing would require that the person doing it have some or
all of the configure.in stuff in fvwm2, since so many of the headers
_assume_ that various things will be included and set by the config.h
file.  I think that's a heavy burden for any given private module to
meet.

I'd much prefer to have fvwm install the header info it requires, then
everyone can use that.  I suppose there's a possible issue if the module
_does_ use autoconf, then there might be conflicts.  Well, we can think
about that.

  sr> The headers that need to be installed would be some or all of
  sr> libs/*.h and fvwm/*.h.  It would be best, of course, if the
  sr> installable ones were all in libs/ but for some reason "module.h"

I would _hope_ that this project could collect the "important" header
info into one file, fvwmlib.h.  Or, maybe two: fvwmlib.h and config.h or
a renaming of that, for config info.

Sure, that's not too hard.  Not sure if it's the best way, but
definitely an option to keep in mind.

Odd.  I use both of these, and 4.5, and never notice any repainting.  I
even use it at home, over a 28.8 modem that never connects at 28.8.

As I said, the HTML is as simple as it can be so I just don't understand

This is in reference to bug report #122 which I submitted a couple of days
ago.  (I couldn't add a note to it as "guest", so that's why I'm putting
this here.)  When FvwmPager was crashing on me, I had just compiled 2.1.7. 
After rebooting, I can't reproduce the problem.  So I'm retracting this bug
report, and chalking it up to circumstances that were independent of fvwm2.

Actually, I can provide one via HTTP rather easily.  The restriction is
that I don't have an FTP server set up on that machine yet.  Since HTTP
seems to be a problem....

1) This question pops up every so often. I wonder if it would not be helpful
to add a README in the sample.fvwmrc/ directory explaining this so people do
not have to pull out their backup tapes to restore their working
system.fvwm2rc files.

2) Along the same topic, are samples for the modules. In this case I think
we could do something different then the system.fvwm2rc file.
Because the modules get installed in their own directory, we could install a
default "Module-Menu" and "Module-Defaults" file with every release.

Each module would have to have its' stub "menu" and "defaults" file to be
concatinated at install time to the correct file in the modules directory.
My assumption is that these defaults would not be too fancy or override the
colors or fonts set by the main fvwm2rc settings. They would however provide
a good starting place for people who wanted to experiment with module
options as well as provide working defaults (which we currently do not
have).

Just like the "Window Ops" menu that is used fairly consistantly by fvwm
users, I think a reasonable "Modules" menu would as well. I believe this
would really help the clients to use and understand the various modules, as
well as help to show off the fvwm feature list.

It's not so bad if I can download a few files. This would help too.

After all the recent mail traffic, and my searching of the mail
archives on "modifier", I am convinced that fvwm2 key and button
binding is working.

Are we past this problem or not?

I don't know. People don't answer to my questions and I could
not find anything myself. Do you have a list of people complaining
about this problem that we said was a num-lock problem? I could
ask them again if it's fixed or not.

Otherwise I would leave this open until all other problems
are resolved somehow and then make 2.2 without further
actions.

IMO the right way to handle this situation (where you submitted a bug
but have more info or want to retract it) is to email fvwm-workers with
the info, and we'll make the change for you... saves having two bug
reports where we don't need any :)

Thanks...

Just found another place where FVWMBorder style windows have a problem
due to having a one pixel border around the frame.  I have a patch,
should I hold off committing it until after 2.2?  I'm really fed up with
the FVWMborder style, would anybody object to me rewriting (post 2.2)
the code so that there is no border around the frame.  Doing so should
kill any lurking off-by-1 errors that we haven't caught yet and should
simplify a lot of code.  I would keep the FVWMBorder style, what I'm
talking about is getting rid of FvwmWindow->bw.

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't quite understand what you're talking about, but if the
patch is small and it fixes the problem I don't object committing
it given you feel configent enough about it.

Date: Wed, 13 Jan 1999 09:45:36 -0800
From: Jonathan Ryshpan <jon@dnai.com>

There are some bugs in the way fvwm2-2.1.7-1 handles FvwmTaskBar:

(1) FvwmTaskBarAutoHide doesn't work.  The task bar is never hidden.

(2) The task bar is updated only when the cursor is on it.  Ie. when you
exit a window, the change only shows up on the task bar when the cursor
is on the task bar.

I am running AnotherLevel-0.7.3-1.  Do I need to upgrade it?

Are these known problems?

Thanks:

If no one has reported a problem,  I would say wait, regardless
of how trivial the patch seems.

Since we don't install this file, I don't understand the comment about
restoring this file from a backup tape.  Please be more specific about
what you think needs explaining.

Well, Tim has ;-) But you're right. The last time we had such
a change windows started creeping over the screen. I'll shut
up now. If it's a problem we need a bug report.

Subject: fvwm2-2.1.7-1 vs FvwmTaskBar

Full_Name: Jonathan Ryshpan
Version: fvwm2-2.1.7-1 
CVS_Date: 
OS: Redhat 5.2
X_Server: XFree86-3.3.2.3-25

Submission from: (NULL) (207.181.237.38)


There are some bugs in the way fvwm2-2.1.7-1 handles FvwmTaskBar:

(1) FvwmTaskBarAutoHide doesn't work.  The task bar is never hidden.

(2) The task bar is updated only when the cursor is on it. Ie. when you
    exit a window, the change only shows up on the task bar when the
cursor
    is on the task bar.

I am running AnotherLevel-0.7.3-1.

Yes, but it used to be installed, unless you changed Fvwm.tmpl as follows;
91c96
< #define InstallSample YES
---
> #define InstallSample NO
(i.e. it was not uncommon to trash the sitewide file)

When a person does a first time install, they may want to (and often will)
use one of the examples from the sample.fvwmrc directory to use as a
starting place for their "system.fvwm2rc" file.

OK, I see that the INSTALL.fvwm has much of what I was suggesting already in
it;

: Configuration File
: ==================
: 
: FVWM configures itself at runtime by reading one or more configuration
: files.  The default location for the system-wide configuration (named
: system.fvwm2rc) is /usr/local/etc; this may be changed by changing the
: prefix or setting sysconfdir explicitly.  This system-wide file is
: read only if the user's ~/.fvwm2rc is not found.
: 
: Sample configuration files may be found in the sample.fvwm2rc
: directory.  To avoid clobbering the current configuration, no
: configuration file is installed by default.  You must copy it manually
: the first time FVWM is installed.

Forget the README suggestion, it is already taken care of.

I (of course) hit the wrong button before reading the ENTIRE message. 
*sigh*

I'm compiling the latest (ie: 2.1.7) fvwm2 program on an SGI running
under System v6.2 and I received quite a few warnings.  So I was
wondering if anyone wanted the output.  I'll keep it for a while.  TIA.

If you really want to avoid the numeric argument, I'd say that
simply splitting these functions into three like
 
   Iconify, DeIconify, ToggleIconify 

would be more natural. Anyway, I haven't done anything except
fix the stupid memory leak in my first version. Also, the argument
parsing code in Maximize now is a bit less wasteful.

I'm wondering why several people are having problems to build
2.1.7 properly. What would happen if they untar the package into
the directory that already holds some previous source and then
don't run 'make clean' before they rebuild or even just 'make'
without running 'configure'?

[after trying just that myself with 2.1.7/2.1.4]

As I suspected the build fails miserably (linkage error). If
this is done between 2.1.5 linking might still work. The code
won't do anything useful though. The sources will not be
rebuilt properly if the object files are still newer than
timestamps of the .c files in the tarball.

Is there anything we can do to detect this condition in the
Makefile? Or in configure? Configure *did* run and generate
new Makefiles. Shouldn't this entail a 'make clean' with
the changed Makefiles?

This is giving us pain enough to warrant some thoughts on
how to avoid that. Perhaps like this:

 - Generate a file 'check_build.c' each time a tarball is
   created. The file contains a single automatically
   generated line:

     char *last_built_package = "last built package: 2.x.y";

 - Give it a timestamp in the computer stoneage:

     touch check_build.c 010101011975

 - When make is called check the check_build.o file for the
   last built version:

     strings check_build.o

   will return the contents of the string

 - If this is not the same version as the current source
   force a 'make clean'. Issuing a warning might not help
   here because we are already building so this will
   most likely be overlooked.

Is this doable with configure and is it worth the effort?
If not, what shall we do then?

Bye

Dominik

Try to answer these questions:

1) Does FvwmWinList coredump?
   If it does, fetch us a stack trace (e.g. with gdb):
   # gdb FvwmWinList core
   (gdb) where

2) Can you try that on a 'real' X server?

3) If you rebuild the 2.1.7 package in a fresh directory,
   does it work then?

Bye

Nope, no chance. Everything works fine for me. My only hope
is that it's a build problem on your system. Have you tried
rebuilding yet? And if this solves your problem:

a) Did you compile the buggy version in a fresh directory
   or did you recycle your previous source tree? (which
   release?)

b) Did you rerun configure?

c) Did you 'make clean'

d) Did you remove config.cache?

Bye

Here is my version of this patch (actually I was thinking about
this the day before you posted your patch). All of the four
functions will accept any of these values: yes/no, true/false,
y/n, t/f, on/off and toggle (effectively doing nothing). The
old syntax still works for backwards compatibility.

Actually tkbiff responds to a ConfigureNotify with a
ConfigureRequest. This seems to ba an ICCCM violation but
may still be a bug in fvwm too.

I'm trying to contact one of the reporters.

No need to switch desks or pages to get this. A move on the current
page will do. Anyway, I have fixed it.

Looking at FvwmPager (x_pager.c) I now understand what this
'rebounding by 16 pixels' was all about: not to prevent
windows in general from being put off the current page but
*sticky* windows. We might want to redo this code but this
time on all sides of the screen and for sticky icons/windows
only. See modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c, lines 1516-1524.

Well, there have been no screams of pain from the Users over the
signal handling, and the internal wailing and gnashing of teeth seems
to have ended too... ;-) Does this mean that it's now safe for me to
start patching the rest of the fvwm modules in the new and agreed
manner?

I disagree.  Distributions created the proper way with "make distcheck"
will untar into directories named with version, like fvwm-2.1.7, etc.

Thus distfiles will never untar into a directory that existed previously
and contained existing source code.

The only potential problems are by people getting CVS versions (which
should handle the timestamps correctly) or non-distributed tar files,
who should know better.

I see.  I was arguing the shared case assuming that fvwm would use a
shared library.  

But these are details.  We can let the installer decide whether to link
statically or not.  And if the library is fvwm-heavy, then it can be
split.

Uh, for portability reasons, perhaps?  

On the other hand, if it's small enough that portability is not a problem,
then config.h shouldn't be missed.

I think this can be changed.  Any installed headers should only provide
the definitions and prototypes for stuff in the library.  Nothing more.

Agreed.  I'm sure it can be collected, with system-dependent stuff
stripped out, into one or two files.


Here's the problem that I forsee with installing anything derived from
config.h.  That file describes the state of the system *at the time that
fvwm was configured*.  It may or may not describe the state of the system
when you want to build the module! 

For example, maybe you didn't have librplay when you built fvwm, but you
do now.  Should you have to edit some installed header to compile a new
module?

That may be trivial, but what if you've changed compilers in the meantime? 
Or upgraded libraries?  Do all the assumptions of linux's libc5 hold in
libc6?  (I don't know)  Maybe you didn't have memcpy(), but now you do. 
Maybe your new compiler has defines for pid_t, off_t, or size_t, where it
didn't before.  Or maybe the locking interface changed from lockf() to
flock() or to some wacky fcntl().  [Yes, I know that there is no locking
used in fvwm ... yet.  I just put this in because it is nearly a real-life
example; linux's kernel changed from having flock & fcntl locks
cooperating, to having them independent.  After such a change, you'd need
to make sure everything used the same locking style.]

You can probably dream up even more outrageous examples: fvwm compiled on
SunOS 4, but now running on solaris, using sunos compatibility libs.  The
config.h is very unlikely to apply to the new situation!  The change from
IRIX 4 to IRIX 5 was nearly as bad.

You might try arguing that these are pathological cases that never happen
in practice.  I dunno.  How do we know what will show up in config.h.in in
the future?  More to the point, why take the risk if we can easily avoid
the issue by not installing configure-derived information?

(I'm resubmitting this one, because it's happening again.)

Usually, but not always, attempting to move a window inside of FvwmPager in
fvwm2-2.1.7 will cause FvwmPager to crash.  You can see the window as you
drag it, but as soon as the mouse button is released, FvwmPager crashes. 
This never happened to me under fvwm2-2.1.5 (fvwm2-2.1.6 was not tested). 
The same results occurred even when using FvwmPager from fvwm2-2.1.5 under
fvwm2-2.1.7, so it probably is not a problemn with FvwmPager (but what
would I know :).

Submission from: (NULL) (206.105.29.149)
Submitted by: drbob


    In 2.1.x betas through 2.1.7, SmartPlacement and CleverPlacement
failed to avoid Sticky windows when placing SkipMapping, StartsOnPage
or StartsOnDesk windows.

    Also, CleverPlacement could sometimes place a window entirely outside
the virtual desktop (with SkipMapping, StartsOnPage).

    The fixes for both were committed to CVS on 01/13/1998.

It was pretty easy to use the fvwm1 patch as a basis for this patch, which
supplies enough hints so the GNOME pager and tasklist work.  I'll work on
root-window mouse bindings next by adding something like:

Mouse 1 R       A       GNOME_Proxy

to indicate a root buttonpress should be proxied to gnome.  To avoid
spamming the mailing list, you can pick up the patch at:

Hi, 
I have added some new options for the FvwmPager module that other
people also might find interesting:

FvwmPagerPixmap 
FvwmPagerDeskPixmap 
  Sets the desk background to a given pixmap. 

FvwmPagerLabelsBelow
FvwmPagerLabelsAbove
  Controls whether the desk labels are drawn above or below the
  corresponding desks.

FvwmPagerShapeLabels
FvwmPagerNoShapeLabels
  Shapes the pager window such that the labels for all desks but the
  current are hidden.

I disagree with Dan.  fvwm 1.24 source is much smaller/simpler than fvwm 2.x.  
If Jay got so far with his effort, I would like to see his results.  

Jay: Please publish your GNOME patches.  

Dan: I think you would be doing a real dis-service by disdaining peoples
     effort to contribute code to the open source software pool.

just my 2 cents.

A nice way to prove that this is the case is to resize the tkbiff 
window and watch it snap back to its old size immediately...not ICCCM
at all.

Yesterday I found a different way to fool shading:

 1) Shade an xterm
 
 2) Select a different font using the menu bound to C-M3 (it is
    a bit difficult to pop it up, as there the window is only
    1 pixel high.
  
 3) The xterm will resize itself, screwing up the geometry.

Actually, I think this should be considered in conjunction with
the problem of font change in a maximized xterm: 

I'd say fvwm should ignore client-side size changes if the 
window is maximized or shaded. 

This won't fix the "maximized xterm" problem, but after thinking
a bit about it, I'd say that it is a shortcoming of the X protocol
or the ICCCM: xterm really thinks of its own size in terms of 
"cell size" 
(ie the (i,j) in 
  width = base_width + i * width_inc
  height = base_height + j * hight_inc
), 
not "pixel size", but there is no way to indicate
in a ConfigureRequest that the client wants the "cell size" to
remain unchanged. A hacky workaround would be to save the "cell size"
when maximizing/shading and recompute the size to restore from
the saved "cell size" and the current size hints. Since this
wouldn't be good for arbitrary clients, it should be per-window
settable.

Hi,

I wrote a little patch that displays the icon name or the window name
inside the balloons of FvwmPager. The patch below is against 2.1.7. It 
already contains changes to the manpage to document the newly created
Pager-command "*FvwmPagerBalloonDisplayType"

Hope this patch finds its way into fvwm before 2.2

Nobody told Jay to go away and come back when he has fvwm2 patches.
I don't know what you are interpreting into this.

Well, of course anybody can do with the sources whatever the
copyrights allow. But don't expect us to support that. fvwm1
development is dead and we have enough to do with fvwm2 without
beginning to maintain several versions. Claiming Dan would
'disdain people' is rather unfair. If you would like to take
the effort of maintaining further fvwm1 development, go ahead and
do it, but don't as *us* to do the work (see above). All Dan and
the others did was asking to do the effort for fvwm2 rather than
the obsolete fvwm1. I don't see why this should discourage Jay.
If facing reality does discourage him that is sad, byt life is
not always fair.

(Sorry Jay, no offense or insults meant in your direction, even
 if what I write may sound like it).

Hey, it's only 7k big. No problem to post this. You should take
into account that more people will test and look at the patch if
you post it directly.

Thanks for the effort

Ok by me. If you keep in mind that no new patches will go in before
2.2. ... But after this I'll happily apply everything you give me.

I have tested this on my system, which is running the current CVS
version, and it all works fine: I can change desktops, change
viewports and move windows around within the Pager and it doesn't
crash. I have tried the Pager both from within the ButtonBar and as a
standalone application.

My system: i586, glibc-2.0.7, linux-2.0.36

How far removed is the current CVS version of FVWM from 2.1.7?

Does this address only the balloon labels? If this is so, could you
enhance your patch that it affects the window labels that are
printed into the mini windows? Have a look at how the syntax of
FvwmIconMan looks. If you could do it the same way that would be
great.

No, no more new patches are accepted into 2.2, only bugfixes. But soon
after I want it in.

I think fvwm should do its best but I don't think we should consider
this enough of a bug to fix before 2.2

The ICCCM is pretty clear that clients should not change their geometry
hints when mapped.  This would make it very difficult to do the (useful)
font changing thing in xterm so I think we should try to get fvwm and
xterm to play nicely together.  Maybe unmaximizing and unshading a
window when the hints change and before recomputing the geometry would
be enough.  Unshading is more likely to succeed, unmaximizing may
require guessing that the client has only  changed its resize increments
and is not trying to grow.

Cheers,
Tim.

  Dominik, thanks  for defending me.  I carefully  choose  my words to
motivate  Jay to  redirect his  efforts to fvwm2.   Since I apparently
succeeded, I'm happy  with the result.  I think  the large majority of
fvwm users will agree.

  Maybe the last sentence wasn't necessary, we will never know.

  On the issue of whether to develop fvwm1 over fvwm2 because fvwm1 is
smaller/simpler...Everyone  is free to do  what they like, but I still
don't like it.

I have never found this statement in ICCCM. To the contrary, I read 
(4.1.2, Client Properties):

   The window manager will examine the contents of these properties when 
   the window makes the transition from the Withdrawn state and will monitor 
   some properties for changes while the window is in the Iconic or Normal
   state. 

Why would the wm monitor some properties if the client wouldn't be allowed
to change them ?

If you save the "cell size" when maximizing/shading, you can use
compute a new cell size based on the requested size in the ConfigureRequest
and the current size hints and compare it to the saved cell size.
If they are the same, one could guess that the client only changed its
resize increments and wants to keep its "cell size".

But I'm not sure that your proposal would work. The problem I see is
that clients might change the geometry first and the hints later. Then
your propsal to unmaximize on property change would come too late.
I haven't exactly studied how xterm does it. I think i noticed

PropertyChangeNotify WM_NORMAL_HINTS
ConfigureRequest
PropertyChangeNotify WM_NORMAL_HINTS
PropertyChangeNotify WM_NORMAL_HINTS

but I didn't try to find out why there are three property changes.

You mean change the FvwmPager code don't you?  I don't think we should
put the magic number 16 back into fvwm itself.  I had a play with moving
sticky windows off screen with the pager and it looks like going down
and right is covered by this bit of code.  Moving up or left off screen
seems to be covered by the fact that the pager calls Focus on the window
after moving it and Focus moves the window back to (0,0) if it's off
screen.  It might be easier to just remove the code from the pager and
let Focus sort it out.

Cheers,
Tim.

Quite far removed, actually.

In fact, I think I recall seeing a commit by Dominik within the last few
days that seemed like it might be a fix to this.

With fvwm version 2.1.7 I can't reproduce either of these.  There may be
a problem with not being able to auto unhidden the task bar due to the
panhandles but it always manages to hide itself.

I have absolutely no idea, better ask the person that you got it from.

Probably someone has turned it into an RPM; that would be version 1 of the
fvwm2-2.1.7 RPM.  The problem is in people thinking that these come from
us.  (It would be nice if they did come from us, but I don't know anything
about making RPMs.)

"prrof", good one.

The text seems clear enough.  I tried all the examples under Alt Tab.
This one doesn't work:

      Key TAB A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry my_dbltab

That has to be "Tab", at least on my system.

I couldn't make the double alt tab thing you describe work.  The pointer
changes to a dot, but then returns to normal.

I can whip up the spec file needed to make it an rpm, but My linux box has much to slow
of a connection to pull in the tarballs and make rpms.

So if someone else has a linux box, and would be willing to create an rpm for each release
I can give directions.

If this would work, certainly. I can't understand why the pager
doesn't handle left and upper borders. The code is definitely there.

And you are free to think and say anything. Apart from this my
opinion is similar. The only thing one could criticise is that
the first reply you made to Jay was a bit unfriendly, but hell,
comparing with what is going on on the web this was still very
civilised. And probably nobody is free of guilt on this list
(or any other). It's unbearable for me to see this unjustified
criticism be loaded onto someone who tries to be calm and
reasonable all the time.

You did? I made no fix for this since it appeared that this was a

Could it be done as a script?

The panhandles are mapped all the time with this in the .fvwm2rc

EdgeThickness 0
DeskTopSize 1x1
EdgeResistance 250 12
EdgeScroll 25000 25000 # quarter of a screen with wrap

Setting the desktop size to 1x1 should prevent the panframes getting
mapped (nowhere to scroll to) but it doesn't and they appear to be two
pixels thick!  Looks like the logic in raisePanFrames() needs fixing,
but not before 2.2 is released

I think you misunderstand: no one is disdaining anything.  The problem
is, to whom would Jay contribute his code?  There is _no_ one.  No one
maintains 1.x.  No one fixes bugs.  No one makes new versions.  No one
is tracking the source.

The thing we were concerned with wasn't so much that Jay is modifying
fvwm1 code, but that he said he'd include that with Gnome.  I worry
about this because:

 a) No one is fixing or maintaing fvwm 1.x; the bugs there will never be
    cleaned up (unless some other group takes over that version).

 b) There is no comprehensive upgrade path from fvwm 1.x to fvwm 2.x, so
    if people start with 1.x and want more (and, after all, people
    running Gnome will almost certainly want fancier WM features--people
    looking for a trivial WM will likely not want to bother with Gnome
    either) they have a hard row to hoe.

 c) Fvwm 1 is still "fvwm", and the more widely distributed it is the
    more questions, requests, bug reports, etc. etc. we will receive on
    these lists regarding it--and hardly anyone here remembers anything
    about fvwm 1.x, or is interested in dealing with it.

Secondary to all that is the fact that effort is going into what is
essentially a dead-end code path--it's like people creating Gnome
patches to Emacs 18.  Yes, Emacs 18 was smaller and simpler, but still...

Of course anyone is free to do what they want, but Jay _did_ ask our
opinion, so we provided it :)

so yes it could easily be scripted

Of course it would be best to do it on the same location as
the ftp server. You don't happen to have a Linux available
there that could do the job automatically, Jason? I'd
volunteer to write scripts for whatever is needed, but
making the rpm at home is no real option for me.

I just want to say I have no problems with what anyone has said on this
list.  I can understand developers not wanting old versions of stuff
distributed after they've put so much effort into it.  That said, I think
I've figured out what I'm going to do.  I'll continue to develop the patch
for fvwm-2.2, and will continue to back-port to the fvwm-1 source.  I've
also been ripping more and more stuff out of the fvwm-1 source tree
(modules, menus (since GNOME handles those), etc...).  IF this is ever
included with gnome, it will be called gnome-demo-wm, and prvided just so
people can try out GNOME with a tree installed to /usr/gnome.  This allows
people who don't like it to nuke it with a single rm -rf, those who do
like it will probably install rpms, debs, etc + a decent wm.  The GNOME
team doesn't want a single window wmanager to be the "GNOME" window
manager.

The other issue here is that I have to patch whatever WM source that
RedHat ships.  I think that's fvwm2 or the fvwm95.  I'm going to figure
that out today.

Regards,
Jay Painter

Submitted by: hippo


The way FvwmBorder style windows are drawn is weird and may be the
cause of meny unknown bugs.  One I just found is with EdgeResistance
when moving off the bottom or right of the screen, patch at the end.
I don't propose to do anything until after 2.2 is released but I'd 
like to remove the border and to change the decoration code to get the
same look.  Then I'd like to remove the ->bw field from the FvwmWindow
structure and fix all the subsequent copile errors.

If someone tells me what to type, I can make the packages on my desktop

Good effort. Dominik and I had a brief discussion about doing something
like this about a month ago. Just to clarify the FvwmIconMan-like
solution, here is how I described the syntax then. I favour using
something like this for consistency between modules:

I've not looked at the relevant part of FvwmIconMan, but I would guess
much of the parsing code could just be lifted from there.

Gack! You mean shaped windows that change their shape in the middle of a
move! I don't know if that will work or not. I tried to get hold of
eterm and xtail to test this but both seem to have disappeared.  If you
can let me have a URL for the source I'll have a play but I'm not
promising anything.

Here's my take on the situation (using Exceed xserver running on NT
which may well do strange things with Num-lock)

I can bind things to Home and hit keypad 7 and it works as long as
num-lock is off.  With num lock on I have to bind to KP_7. 
Interestingly if I bind to KP_7, have num-lock on I can hit shift-kp_7
and xterm prints a 7 and I can bind to unshifted kp_7 and have fvwm grab
it.  Looks like num-lock on this server isn't just holding down the
shift for the keypad keys but actually doing sending different keys. 
It's been this way for ages so it's not a 2.1.7 problem.

I can't help. I'm stuck with NT (actually all I need is a way of editing
Microsoft Excell spread sheets (NT4.0) and I might just stick Linux on
(I've tried StarOffice, it lost stuff when saving))

I don't recall exactly.  I thought I saw something go through for moving
windows in the pager.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Is there a list of the commit comments available anywhere via cvsweb or
anything?

The mysteries of X keyboards...

Key KP_7 R N Exec echo "KP 7, no modifier"
Key KP_7 R 3 Exec echo "KP 7, mod3 (numlock)"
Key KP_7 R S Exec echo "KP 7, shift"
Key KP_7 R S3 Exec echo "KP 7, shift + mod3 (numlock)"

I used the above as test data and it all worked.  Then I decided to
make sure my xmodmap file wasn't confusing the issue and I found
this:

! by default F27 F27 KP_7 Home
keycode 75=KP_7 Home

Plainly, the default keysym "F27" offended me so I nuked it.
So then I added these test cases:

Key F27 R N Exec echo "F27, no modifier"
Key F27 R 3 Exec echo "F27, mod3 (numlock)"
Key F27 R S Exec echo "F27, shift"
Key F27 R S3 Exec echo "F27, shift + mod3 (numlock)"

and removed the keycode 75 line. Numlock wouldn't  even light the led,
let alone let me produce the lines with mod3 in them.

Looking farther in my xmodmap, I found:

clear Mod3

After removing that line, all the F27 bindings started working.

So I still don't see any problem.  (Solaris 2.6).

I think this is a server-related thing. I know my server Accelerated-X
2.1 does some odd things with numeric keypad. I spent a *long* time
trying to figure it out, when I was much more of a newbie on X, and
decided my server just wanted to handle numeric keypad on its own.
I'll try poking around and seeing if I can figure out anything new,
but I wouldn't be surprised if it's related to Exceed. Especially
(warning: don't know much about this) if Windohs handles the keypad
differently than the X server... Basically, if Windohs doesn't treat
NumLock as a full-fledged modifier, then Exceed would have (I imagine)
a hard time doing otherwise. Of course, I don't know a whole lot about
Windohs-related keyboard input...

Of course, our problems with NumLock are, I think, unrelated to the
problem being reported, which doesn't always have to do with NumLock
anyway. Actually, I don't even have a "problem" with numlock, since I
don't really *want* numlock to be a modifier. I'm happy without it.
It's something I use too infrequently to want behaving otherwise than

Have you looked at recent releases of wine? I've heard rumors that
Office97 is starting to work properly (best with a legacy installation
of Win95 somewhere on the hard disk). My old Word 6.0 is pretty
functional too.

Well, yes.  I guess that would be another side-effect.  The main thing
is that the window would get notified of the move upon each frame,
instead of only after the move is completed.

Eterm is supposedly available here:
	ftp://ftp.enlightenment.org/pub/Eterm/
	ftp://ftp.eterm.org/pub/Eterm/
	http://www.eterm.org
But they all seem to be down.

So...

I've put it here:
	http://www.vis.colostate.edu/~scriven/tmp/Eterm-0.8.7.tar.gz

But this really isn't very important..  :)  It's just another fun
amusement.

Oh. That would be "our" meaning Tim and myself. Not "our" meaning
fvwm-workers... Sorry for the ambiguity... I seem to be doing that a
lot with plural pronouns lately.

My message was mostly to say that I thought that NumLock problems are
most likely *not* fvwm-related, IMHO. The confusion surrounding
NumLock's behavior makes bug reports concerning it highly suspect.

Usually my commit comments are a shortened version of the ChangeLog
entries. You are referring to my last entry from 13th of January:

  * fvwm/resize.c (ConstrainSize): fixed bug: moving a shaded window in
  FvwmPager screwed up the window's height

This is in no way related to the crash unfortunately.

Usually my commit comments are a shortened version of the ChangeLog

OK, you're right. I was assuming that because it happens on my
system it might affect anybody else (not that I have a problem with it).

But I think it's a good idea to create some script that gathers
information about the fvwm2 installation as some other free
software projects do. This way we could tell people to run
this script prior to reporting a bug and include the output
in the report. Part of this might be some tests to verify
the installation went OK.

Full_Name: Ric Lister
Version: 2.1.7
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux RedHat 5.1

Submission from: (NULL) (141.161.231.96)


I defined a button as follows

  *FvwmButtons(Action (Mouse 1) 'Nop')

Clicking Mouse 1 produces no effect, as desired. Mouse 2 and Mouse 3
crash FvwmButtons. Defining actions for these clicks makes the problem go
away. The problem seems to be independent of which clicks are/are not
defined.

X errors produced are as follows:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)

I have checked twm and afterstep, and they both show troublesome
behaviour (ie maximizing and font change don't commute). Perhaps
it is not worth doing anything about it.

Furthermore it suggest sendig bug reports to the

The recent changes in the use of environment variables
are not reflected in the manpage. E.g. FVWM_CONFIGDIR
is not mentioned in the ENVIRONMENT section of the manpage
and FVWM_MODULEDIR is not described properly. Perhaps
others too.

Another WindowShade buglet with focus-follows-mouse and shading/unshading
added to the Window-Ops menu: 

1) pop up the Window-Ops menu of a shaded window 
  (the window will have the focus while the menu is open)

2) select "unshade". 

3) The menu pops down and the window is unshaded

4) the focus ends up on the window which was under
   the "unshade" item in the menu.

Subject: Shading as an ICCCM state
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Today I had a look at afterstep and noticed that it handles 
shaded windows different than fvwm2. It subsumes the shaded
state among iconic. This makes a lot of sense. fvwm currently
makes it normal state.

The following patch changes fvwm to do the same, and allow 
all transitions between iconified, normal and shaded.

This even avoids a bug in afterstep: If a client deiconifies
a shaded window, afterstep doesn't unshade it. We do.

But is this the right thing to do? Shouldn't fvwm record the requested
size in the original size variables and enforce it when the window is
unmaximized/unshaded?

Huh? I fixed that one long before 2.1.7 I thought. Are you sure
the FvwmButtons you execute is from 2.1.7? If it is, can you
fetch me a stack trace?

  # gdb FvwmButtons core
  (gdb) where

[ after checking myself ]

Nope. No crash no nothing. Undefined button presses are
simply ignored. Must be some old FvwmButtons you're
running.

Duh ... sorry, that's exactly it. An old FvwmButtons buried down in

This addresses only the Balloon Labels, but I'm working on extending
it to change the labels printed into the mini windows. The next patch 
version should support the syntax known from IconMan for both the
balloons and the mini windows

Could you remove the full phrase instead of 'MFR' in
the FAQ (or at least mention what this means)?
Most recently focussed I assume?

I'm not a fan of shading but I've always thought of shading as NOT
iconifying. Shaded windows look as if they are normal windows that have
been squashed flat so just the borders and title bar are visible and I
thought that was done by manipulating the parent windows of the client,
meaning that the client window was untouched and the client didn't know
anything had happened.

At the moment shading and iconifying are orthogonal.  I don't think we
should link them without good reason.

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes, that would be better. But then one should also resize the title
window to account for the width change. If we do this, we should also
allow transitions between shaded and maximized. This is a bit difficult
though, since both states want to save an "original size".

I'm not a fan of shading either, but since its there, we should try
to make it work in the most natural way.

For me, normal state implies that the client can expect its toplevel window
to be visible to the user (depending on the stacking order of course) and
have a size according to its size hints. This is not the case for shaded 
windows: Even if they are on top of stack, the user sees nothing. In this
respect, they are more like icons. You are right that the title bar and
borders look like those of a normal window, and that is part of why I
dislike shading.

> 

Orthogonal ? I'm not convinced. At the moment, the interaction between
shading and other states is a bit inconsistent, I think. Let me see:

You can shade a normal window and only the title bar appears.
You can shade an icon and the visual appearance is unchanged, but
upon deiconification, only the title bar appears.
You can't shade a maximized window. But there is actually a bug lurking
here: If you try to shade a maximized window, you get the bell, but
the maximized window forgets its original size (you can't unmaximize
it any more)

As far as I know they already use different varaibles to store their
original sizes, right?

Of course you need someone to update it and then have Jason
install it.  Perhaps we are at the point where this could be cron
controlled.

I don't see anything in Q4 about bug reports and don't see why it
should mention the workers list.  Did your recent commit on the FAQ
fix this?

Strangely enough, I have always EXPECTED fvwm to get confused by
doing this.  Perhaps because it is not apparent that a window is
in a maximised state,  I don't really expect fvwm to track it.
I know it attempts to, but when it looses track, for example after
restart, it seems like no big deal.

So I agree, its barely worth doing anything about it.

Since neither of us like it much let's leave it alone until a fan offers
an opinion.

Exactly, it's the title bar and it displays the WM_NAME property, not
the
icon name.  If you made shading be iconic then clients may change the
icon name to grab attention which wouldn't work if they were shaded. 
Another thought: what would happen to windows with active icons if they
were told they were iconified when shaded?

That's because shading works on the window and not the icon so when you
deiconify you see the shaded window.  Maybe shading the icon shouldn't
be allowed but you could say the same about some other commands that
affect the window rather than the icon (Delete, MoveToPage/Desk,
Maximize)

It sounds like there is a bug in shading and maximizing so if we ignore
the maximized state you can have a window in any of the four states:

Normal <-------> Iconified
  ^                  ^
  |                  |
  v                  v
Shaded <-------> Iconified and shaded

You can transition between the left and right states with Iconify,
between top and bottom with WindowShade. I think Maximize should also be
orthogonal to this giving a cube of eight states (no ASCII diagram
included).

Cheers,
Tim.

No, I don't know this organisation related things well enough.
Reading again I don't see it either. I referred to 

 'To report problems, send mail to fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu.'

But of course this was meant for mailing list problems, so
forget my posting.

Changing the icon name isn't an appropriate way to "grab attention". There
is no guarantee that the icon name is visible. ICCCM 2 introduced the 
urgency flag as a way to "grab attention". There is no guarantee either
that the icon window is visible/mapped in the iconic state. Clients that
have such a window will simply not get any expose events on it and thus
will not update its contents.

What I don't like with this square is that there is no visual difference
between the two states on the right. The current fvwm actually has
the same problem with maximized: Maximizing an icon doesn't change its
visual appearance. 

This cube diagram of eight states may be convenient for the programmer
since it directly corresponds to three independent flags, but from
a users perspective, I would expect a window to pop up to screen size 
immediately if I say "maximize" to an icon.

I'd propose to have only four states

normal, maximized, iconified, shaded, of which the first two correspond
to ICCCM NormalState and the last two to IconicState. The commands 
Iconify, Maximize, Shade would go to the corresponding state regardless
of the current state.

You can of course write complex functions to realize this based on
your cube, like

AddToFunc MyMaximize
+ "I" Iconify off
+ "I" WindowShade off
+ "I" Maximize on

AddToFunc MyIconify
+ "I" WindowShade off
+ "I" Maximize off
+ "I" Iconify on

AddToFunc MyShade
+ "I" Maximize off
+ "I" Iconify off
+ "I" WindowShade on

AddToFunc MyNormal
+ "I" Maximize off
+ "I" Iconify off
+ "I" WindowShade off

Thus it is perhaps best to implement the cube.

Matthias

PS I just tested the MyMaximize example above an wondered:
If used from a window menu, it works as expected, but if used
from FvwmTalk, I have to pick the window three times (once for
every function). Is there a way to avoid this ? Ie pick a context
which would then be used for the whole complex function ?

Forgot to mention: I have actually tested this with afterstep and a test
program with an icon window. Btw. The afterstep documentation mentions
that they changed the shading implementation from shaded==normal to
shaded==iconic, because clients had problems with shaded==normal (but
it seems they had a different implementation, resizing the client window
itself, not the frame)

I tried it again and can't reproduce this any more. This was a false
alarm.

WarpToWindow uses the unshaded size of a window to warp the pointer
which doesn't work if the window is shaded.

Minor bug, been there since shading first appeared, don't hold the
presses.

I remember now what Eterm does. It's translucent not transparent (bad
choice of words on the part of Eterms author(s)).  It's rxvt with the
pixmap background hacked to copy the pixmap from the root with the
origin set to coincide with the root pixmap.  It looks like it's
transparent but windows under Eterm don't show through.

Anyway the function to call is SetupFrame() and you could probably just
add the call just after the XMoveWindow() inside the moveloop() loop. 
Just for completeness you should also add it in the loop in
animatedMoveWindow().

SetupFrame() sends the messages but it also does some xmoving and
resizng on it's own (not quite sure what it's doing). This might cause
clients to have a fit so it would be worth testing a fair bit.  It's
probably use a lot more network traffic and CPU cycles but then if you
use opaque or animated moves yo probably have enough bandwidth.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi,

If any of you are considering code hacking this weekend, can I implore you
to watch the signs, please!

Prodded by Mark Manning, I have been running test builds on SGI systems
(5.3 and 6.5) with gcc and with the vendor compilers.

There are *lots* of warnings generated.

One of the biggest classes of warnings are signed/unsigned issues.

(1) signed chars - there are lots of places in the code that use "char"
and "unsigned char" interchangeably.  Bad, bad, bad!  If you find yourself
coding a routine that involves Uchar parameters or return type, take a
minute to think whether it really needs to be unsigned or not.

(2) unsigned int * - lots of the X calls (XGetGeometry, for example) use
	**unsigned** int pointers to return height & width values.  However, lots
of places in the code blithely pass regular ints.  I know, I know, this is
horribly pedantic of me, but I like to see things compile without
warnings.  Can we be a bit more careful of parameter types, please?

Hi,

There are a lot of things accumulating in the top-level directory.  Are
there any objections to me moving the following to docs:

FAQ
BUGS
TODO
Y2K-Compliance
DEVELOPERS

Rationale: toplevel should have the "most important" documentation; if you
are building a package, this would be what you read first: INSTALL*,
README, and NEWS.  The above are documents that you would typically
consult as the package is building, or before installing.  At least,
that's what I do ;-) 



Also, the stuff currently in archive look like good candidates for docs:

announcement-x.y.z (could be renamed docs/ANNOUNCE, as is common practice)
cvs-howto.txt      (maybe should be incorporated into docs/cvs.html, if
                    not already)
automated-tests
purify

These last two look like (I haven't used them) good things to distribute
--- certainly with beta tarfiles, if not with all releases --- because
they encourage testing.  Hopefully, a suitably motivated person would use
them, and generate better-quality bug-reports.


Comments?  Strong objections to the above changes?  If not, I propose to
do them in a couple days.

I don't have an exact description how this happens, but
sometimes when experimenting with styles and general
fvwm configuration suddenly the ClickToFocusClickRaises
global option does not work anymore. Even if I issue
the GlobalOpts command again. Has anyone seen this too?
Sorry, at the moment I can't be more specific. The only
possible hint is that I always had an xemacs visible on
the current page, but this may be pure chance since I
don't need this feature often when I have no xemacs.

I've noticed myself a while ago. A big problem with the
signed/unsigned stuff is that it's everywhere in the code.
Cleaning up the warnings we have will invariably create
lots of other warnings elsewhere. Often you have no chance
tho choose the type of a variable without creating a
warning somewhere and thus you use int as the default most
often. I've no idea how to avoid this.

OK "grab attention" is the wrong phrase, maybe "update status" is
better.
e.g. a CD player, this could conceivable display track time etc in an
icon window when iconified and put the track time in the WM_NAME when
normal.  If shading tells the window it is iconified it may not update
the WM_NAME but draw to the (unmapped) icon window.

Agreed, but then you can change you key bindings so that shading and
maximizing don't happen in icons (use WTSF not A|WTSFI) or make a
different window menu pop up for icons that doesn't include shade/max.

I disagree, from this users perspective: if I have three buttons on the
title bar to control maximize, iconify & shade; they look like binary
pushbuttons and I don't expect them to work like radio buttons i.e. push
one in and the other two pop out. This is my view only, I'm not a GUI
expert. I expect different people would like different things.

Agreed, you can enforce a four state thing from an eight state cube but
you can't do the opposite.

It's a feature of the module interface. It's not just FvwmTalk, it's all
modules that get fvwm to execute functions. When fvwm executes functions
from menus, keys or buttons it sets the target window up for the
function.  When a module sends a message to fvwm to execute a function
fvwm doesn't set the target window.  If you know the window ID you can
use "WindowID xxx MyMax", if it has a unique name you can use "Next
(<name>) MyMax". I can't think of a way of getting fvwm to prompt for a
window only once, it either has a target window or it doesn't and it
doesn't learn, this is probably linked to the reason that two Next's in
a function both select the same target i.e. you can't write a function
to iconify the next four windows on the windowlist.

Cheers,
Tim.

You can remove the cvs-howto from the tree as it is only a template
that has never been filled. The announcements should be removed too
except the most current beta announcement. This one can go to docs
but should be called ANNOUNCEMENT then.

Is docs the right place for such things? I would object putting
the purify stuff into the distribution. It creates huge error
output that we don't want to get as bug reports since it is what
is expected. Furthermore it is not machine dependent so there is
not much gain in having people run it. Nobody not on the workers
list should run this test. Apart from this it's 50k big. The
documentation isn't good enough either and the script does not
supports obsolete syntax (e.g. SetMenuStyle).

I have no problem with the automated tests.

What does the FVWM_CONFIGDIR environment variable?  As far as I can
see by looking for getenv and putenv calls, no env. variable by that
name is handled by fvwm.

There is a C #define constant FVWM_CONFIGDIR, but that's a compile-time
thing not an environment variable (AFAICT).

So, what's the current list of open issues?  And what's the schedule for
betas and release candidates?

Seems to me like we're getting very close... I'm getting excited :)

I'll fix the man page environment variable stuff.

Last I heard they shipped both fvwm2 and fvwm95, and their fvwm2 is
based on 2.0.46, I think, with many changes (Steve just merged a bunch
of their cleanups with our codebase this week).

I hope that once 2.2 is official it will be widely and quickly adopted.

Things left to do before 2.2:
-----------------------------

Items marked with a '*' may be skipped if the reporters don't
cooperate.

1) the key/mouse binding problems (not all in Jitterbug)
*  [investigation in progress]

   --> Nobody is able to find any problem.

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)
*   [investigation stalled]

   --> I've done what I could to get a statement from the
       reporter so this will go to unreproducible when 2.2
       is built.

15) gradient menus lose their colours under obscure circumstances.
*   [investigation in progress]

   --> This too is a 'third party' dependency.

17) find out why FvwmPager crashes
    [in progress]

Fixed but not verified:
-----------------------

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix (tkbiff may still have
*  a problem)
   [pending] 

   --> Most likely a tkbiff bug.  Please Ric, verify this as
       soon as possible

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)
*  [pending]

   --> After asking various people at least three times to
       verify the fix there is still no feedback :(

--------

I wrote emails until I got blisters on my fingertips but to
no avail. Nobody answers and we can't see any problems. So
1, 5, 6, 10 and 15 won't delay 2.2 any longer. I hope we get
the feedback on 5 before 2.2, but since it is most likely
still there and not a fvwm bug it is not all-important.
The only thing I want sorted out is 17 (new). I believe it
is a build problem.

2.1.8 will be built this weekend. Paul (PDS), I'd appreciate
if you would do it today (or Steve or Dan). Otherwise I'll
do it on Saturday.

Then it depends on if we have to implement new fixes. I think
we'll have one new beta per week until we have not changed any
code at all for a full week. This last beta will be repackaged
and called 2.2 (hey, that sounds good :) ) I hope sincerely 2.1.8
will be this last beta.

I'm not aware of any pending changes so I will proclaim the
final code freeze in a follow up.

Tho things have to be done for the 2.2 announcement:

1) Rewrite it for the final release (I can do that and put
   a copy for all to proof read in the docs directory).

2) Figure out the recipient list where we want to post the
   announcement. In general it is at the head of the announcement
   file but I have only the group names. Any help is very
   welcome here (no chance to do that at home, my connection is
   way too slow).

One issue:

Just about 15 minutes ago I got an announcement from Tom Tromey that
automake 1.4 has been officially released.

In addition to resolving the current situation where people have
different versions of automake (causing superfluous Makefile.in
changes), this version supposedly fixes the install-strip problem
currently documented in BUGS.

Are we interested in using this for 2.2, or is it too late?  If we want
it, I'll install it first _then_ make the 2.1.8 release.

Also, if we want it, should I change the .am files to _require_ 1.4, or
not?  I'm not planning on changing the .am files to use any new 1.4
features, so we don't have to change the minimum required version.

If we don't require it, people don't have to upgrade immediately.  On
the other hand, as we've seen, if people with commit access have a
different version of automake we can get "flip-flopping Makefile.in
version" problems in the source tree :(.

Is there any risk that something goes wrong that we don't notice
before 2.2? I don't want a delay because of that since it has
not so much to offer us now. We could live with the install-strip
for 2.2 and two or three more versions of the .am files won't
hurt either.

Please make the decision you feel is right, Paul.

Yeah, that happened last week.  Handy, I think; /pub/gnu was getting

I see no bug. If the shaded window was raised above the other
window it will still be and receive the focus. If it was lowered
below it the other window will get the focus. May be a bit
unintuitive if the window and the shaded window don't overlap
but 100% correct. Surely we don't want to raise a window
because it's being unshaded.

That's one of the things I tried.  All it did was make the the frame
rate drop severely.  (but still no refresh inside the window)  I have no
idea why it didn't work as expected; so I asked you guys..  :)

I'll probably poke around the source for Blackbox to see what it's doing
right.  (but not for a little while... things are a bit busy now)

You are right of course.

To clarify what I saw as the problem, tkbiff would grow horizontally
to just under the desktop width. FvwmIconMan would jump a few pixels
to the SE every time its window changed size (i.e. a new item was
added or removed). These two effects would always occur together.
Restarting tkbiff and fvwm would make the problem go away for a few
hours.

I've been running 2.1.7 and a 2.1.8 CVS from yesterday for about
3 days and have not seen any reoccurrence of the problem. So I'm
reasonably optimistic. I'll let you know immediately if I see the
problem again.

I had an attempt to sort some of the signed/unsigned stuff out in
2.1.4 - the impact was far too great to submit though (>>200 lines!!).
However, you can solve some warnings (but by no means all, admittedly)
by making "height" and "width" fields "unsigned" in various structs,
since height and width arguments to X functions tend to be
"unsigned". Practically everything is declared as "int" at the moment.

OK, so you noticed - sorry to rehash what you just said. This is the
peril of reading your mailbox in reverse chronological order.

Thanks. Although I don't know what I fixed I think we can close the

I already do Freshmeat.  I think Slashdot isn't the proper place.

Hello everyone!

	I noticed recently that fvwm.org had not been registered.  I
thought about it a bit and decided to register it.  I work at an ISP, so
it costs me nothing to DNS host it, and I love fvwm, so I thought it would
be a good thing to do.  Right now, I have pointed www.fvwm.org to
fvwm.math.uh.edu.  I have not set any other info up for the domain.

	I wanted to tell everyone and find out what everyone wants to do
with the domain.  I want everyone to know that I got the domain for the
fvwm team, not for personal use... so I wanted to put it up for you all to
talk about.  I thought this was an appropriate time, with fvwm 2.2 about
to be released.  

	I also wanted to offer up some server-space for fvwm.  I have a
P-Pro 200 web server with a couple web sites on it (not many) and a few
gig of space, if we want to use it to host fvwm, or perhaps mirror the
main site.  (We're connected to MAE East and MAE west, among other
interconnect points, so we have some pretty decent bandwidth)

	On another note related to 2.2 release, I think it would be a good
idea to create a new sample .fvwmrc file, something that demonstrates some
of our newer features... and proves how cool the new stuff is.  I would be
willing to put something together if no-one else would rather do it.

Thoughts?

Jay

Hi,
I have just tried the ncurses support in the ./configure script. The
results are as follows:

Configuration:

  FVWM Version:             2.1.8

  Build extra modules?      yes
  Have ReadLine support?    no
  Have RPlay support?       yes
  Have XPM support?         yes


The output goes like this:
checking for rplay_create in -lrplay... yes
checking for rplay.h... yes
checking for readline in -lreadline... no
checking for readline in -lreadline... (cached) no

The config.log says:
configure:4776: checking for readline in -lreadline
configure:4795: gcc -o conftest -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=pentium   conftest.c -lreadline -lreadline -ltermcap  1>&5
/usr/i586-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot open -ltermcap: No such file or directory
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 4784 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char readline();

int main() {
readline()
; return 0; }
configure:4941: checking for readline in -lreadline
[EOF]

I'm a complete newbie at autoconf etc, but it looks like it didn't
attempt to find ncurses when it couldn't find termcap (cached :-) ?)

Chris.

Uh, nope, not me.  I think Dominik did some of that, though.

It resolves that problem??  Wow.

For me, that's reason enough to switch!  I move that we start using 1.4
now.

The flip-flopping isn't so much a problem *if* the person doing release
builds uses the latest automake/autoconf.

Nor will it be a problem if we REMOVE the auto*-generated files from
CVS...

Is there something wrong with this?
I don't see how there possibly could be:
The waterbed's on fire, 
but everything else is as it should be.

OK, I saw the code freeze but I was in the middle of this module. I
suppose that this patch doesn't have to be applied straight away. I have
tested this FvwmWinList on my system - no visible problems.

Hi,

The "extras"  directory was, historically, a place to dump modules that
didn't configure or build with ease.  The extras now all -- in principle
-- configure and build with ease.  In light of the upcoming 2.2, I'd like
to propose erasing the distinction between TRUE modules and SECOND-CLASS
"extra" modules.

At the same time, we might as well drop a few modules that duplicate
functionality.  I have made an inventory (attached) of all the modules &
extras that are currently distributed with the fvwm 2.1.x betas. 

The proposal for the extras is as follows:

* Promote the following to modules: FvwmCommand, FvwmConsole, FvwmDebug,
  and FvwmScript.

* Drop FvwmConfig because the author's documentation says it is
  "braindead" and he "discourages its use".

* Drop FvwmGoodStuff: obsoleted by FvwmButtons.

* Drop FvwmPipe: similar functionality is obtained using FvwmCommand.

* Possibly promote FvwmTaskBar: this seems to be an Win95'ish version of
  FvwmButtons, and hence superfluous.  However, the overlap isn't exact,
  and it seems to work, so keeping it wouldn't be bad either.  I lean
  towards keeping it. 

* Possibly drop FvwmWharf: the README included suggests it is not at all
  stable, and it hasn't been maintained for a while.  I lean towards
  dropping it.



The proposal for current "modules" is to keep all except for the
following:

* Drop FvwmAudio: it is obsoleted by FvwmEvent.

* Possibly drop FvwmIconBox: it doesn't appear to be actively maintained,
  and it is similar in function to FvwmIconMan (which *is* actively
  maintained).

* Possibly drop FvwmTalk: FvwmCommand offers the same functionality, with
  a superior interface (command history & editing with libreadline).

	Bad news on this one, I'm afraid. What happens is this: FVWM
properly handles your StartIconic, SkipMapping, StartsOnPage style,
and starts Netscape up, iconic, in the right place; then Netscape
sends a second MapRequest, to which we're required to respond by
de-iconifying the window. (If you position yourself on the page where
Netscape is going to appear, you can see the icon window flash
briefly before the Netscape window appears.)

	The de-iconification has the side effect of making SkipMapping
*appear* not to have worked.

	There really isn't anything we can do to prevent this. It seems
that Netscape doesn't like to be started up iconic, unless it requested
it itself (as happens when you use the -iconic flag).

Steve, why did you remove the .indent.pro file? I wanted to use
it after 2.2 to reformat our sources (or perhaps not).

I have no objections especially since we have FvwmWinList
disappearing without a coredump in some report. Since we
still have no 2.1.8 I think it's ok to put it in. Chris,
please double check that there is no hidden bug in the
source. Paul, I think you will switch to automake 1.4
(will you?). Please apply this patch too before 2.1.8 if
we reach consensus on it. Objections by anyone?

Bye

The problem with the most cute explanation I could imagine:
my kittens have stepped on the num lock key. I wonder if
we should have a 'cat safe' mode :)

Hi,
In response to your questions:

1).  I looked, but I cannot locate a core dump.  I tried using FvwmTalk to
see if FvwmWinList would provide any further details, but did not.

2).   Unfortunately, I am not in a position where I can run fvwm anywhere
but my PC.  I am running Win95 with Exceed/W 6.0.  I have fvwm compiled on
Solaris 2.6 using gcc compiled 2.7.2.1.  I've been running fvwm 2.0.46 in
this environment with no problems for at least two years.  fvwm 2.0.46 was
compiled with an older version of gcc (don't remember what release) on a
solaris 2.4 platform.

On a side note, I tried using fvwm 2.1.6 and winlist was working fine.  I
backed off of 2.1.6 because the 'Key' commands did not work for for
scrolling around the desktops.

3).  I will be happy to recompile fvwm, but I cannot do this until the
middle of next week due to business commitments.  I will recompile on
solaris 2.4 to see if it makes a difference.

I'll be happy to try any other suggestions you may have.

Regards,
Joe Prosser

Perhaps it was overzealous on my part, but after moving all the other
stuff, there was only the one file left in archive.  I wanted to remove
'archive', since it seems a bit much to keep a directory for a single
100-byte file.  

I just deleted it because I didn't know where to move it to (I didn't know
what the file was for, actually).

At any rate, the file is still retrievable from CVS.  Do a "cvs checkout
-D yesterday archive", for example.  It's tiny, so I append it here.

No, I guess not.  I created a new directory "tests" for them.

OK, for now, it is NOT distributed.

I guess that it could be distributed with a README describing these
caveats.  This would not cost us so much: the distributed sources are over
4MB, so 50kb more will not be noticed.

Yup!  I checked in a fix for this today.  Please try it when you get a
chance and let us know if it works.

By this I mean, if we require everyone to use 1.4 then everyone will be
using the same version :)

I tried a make distcheck with 1.4 and it failed due to the
AM_PROG_INSTALL vs. AC_PROG_INSTALL error you mentioned a bit ago.  I
wasn't sure exactly how to fix it, so I didn't.

If you fix it (or tell me how) I'll make a 2.1.8 tonight with Chris's
FvwmWinList patch.

Or, I can easily go back to 1.3b, too.

I always found it annoying under RedHat's fvwm setup that
when I move an xclock by selecting Move from the Root menu,
I have to click 2 times on the root window to get rid of 
the extra select cursors (I guess "Move" is a complex function
with three lines in that setup).

This can be avoided with a new command "Pick <command>",
which behaves similarly to "Function <command>", but lets
the user pick a window to operate on instead of having
every single function in the complex function select its
own. 

The implementation is truly trivial.

Following our recent discussion about interaction of maximized,
shaded and iconic states, I have tried to make them as orthogonal
as possible. This patch (against todays CVS) does:

* Treat shaded as NormalState again, unlike my last patch on this 
  topic.

* Prevents client-side resizing of maximized windows. I think it
  is ugly to see a maximized xterm grow beyond the screen when
  I change the font. User-side resizing of maximized windows is
  still allowed. 

* Fix an off-by-one error when shading windows with FvwmBorder. It
  caused one pixel line of the client window to remain visible,
  making it possible to eg pop up the fonts menu on a shaded
  xterm. If you are interested in this as a bugfix for 2.2,
  it is only one line in builtins.c:

  Change the the second-to-last instruction in the WindowShade
  function from

	SetupFrame(tmp_win,
		   tmp_win->frame_x,
		   tmp_win->frame_y,
		   tmp_win->frame_width,
		   tmp_win->title_height + tmp_win->boundary_width, 
		   False);

  to

	SetupFrame(tmp_win,
		   tmp_win->frame_x,
		   tmp_win->frame_y,
		   tmp_win->frame_width,
		   tmp_win->title_height + tmp_win->boundary_width
                     - tmp_win->bw,
		   False);

* Make resize shade-smart, ie you can now resize a shaded window.
  It will remain shaded, but unshade to the new size. 

* Enable transitions between shaded, shaded+maximized and maximized.
  This unfortunately needs another set of "saved geometry" variables in the 
  FvwmWindow struct to make sure that you can unshade a shaded+maximized
  window to its maximized size and then unmaximize it to its original 
  size.

Subject: mouse action on window doesn't work

Full_Name: Roderich Schupp
Version: 2.1.7
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.2.0-pre7
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.3
Submission from: (NULL) (195.138.53.254)


The following entry in my .fvwmrc stopped working in 2.1.7 (was OK in
2.1.5):

Mouse 1         W       M       Function "Move-or-Raise"

All other mouse actions are OK, only the window context seems to be
affected.
Actually, fvwm seems to recognize the binding, as on clicking button 1
whiel holding Meta the cursor changes shape. But nothing else happens.
The following action works

Mouse 1         T       A       Function "Move-or-Raise"

hence I think the problem is not in "Move-or-Raise" (replacing it by the
builtin Raise doesn't work either).

I just got approval to run name servers for external domains on Friday and
have already registered some .cx domains for myself (hey, they're much
cheaper than .org) but wanted to consult the group before blowing $100 on
fvwm.org.  Fortunately I now don't have to.

J> Right now, I have pointed www.fvwm.org to fvwm.math.uh.edu.

You just chained CNAMES; I believe that's illegal.  fvwm.math.uh.edu is a
CNAME for larry.math.uh.edu, which runs Apache with name-based virtual
domains:

XYX:epithumia:~/fvwm> host www.fvwm.org
www.fvwm.org is a nickname for fvwm.math.uh.edu
fvwm.math.uh.edu is a nickname for larry.math.uh.edu
larry.math.uh.edu has address 129.7.128.51

J> I wanted to tell everyone and find out what everyone wants to do with

Cool.  We had talked about it and several folks wanted to chip in for the
fee but at the time I wasn't allowed to do the hosting.

I don't really care who does the DNS, but it might be easier if I'm the
primary because I might need to move things around depending on hardware
issues and other things that nobody should have to worry about but me.
Having a geographically separated secondary or two is always a plus,
though.  (Heck, I'd love to have that for my personal domains.)

J> I also wanted to offer up some server-space for fvwm.

I think we're doing fine by server space at the moment but mirrors never
hurt anyone.  (Unless the group objects; if folks want to move the servers
then I won't fight over it.  I don't have any personal stake in any of
this.)

I updated my installation from CVS and tried again. This time it
recognised my readline library, but still created all the Makefiles in
modules/ so that they linked against libtermcap.

Is that wise? When I ran "make check" on 1.3b, it failed on test
"ansi3". The 1.4 tests all work.

1.3b is the one I've been using ever since 2.1.0; it's worked fine for
me.

OK, so first make sure configure.in has AC_PROG_INSTALL rather than
AM_PROG_INSTALL.  It should, since I think I've checked in versions after
making this change.  Second, nuke aclocal.m4, and run 'aclocal'.  The
issue is that if you have run aclocal in the past with AM_PROG_INSTALL in
configure.in, the macro definition is stuffed into aclocal.m4.  Rebuilding
with a newer aclocal will fix this.

I've been using 1.3d for some time now.  And now one of my machines has
1.4 on it.  With so many automake & autoconf versions floating around, I
think we're asking for trouble by checking in derived files. 

Unless someone comes up with a more serious objection than "I don't feel
like installing the auto* packages", I think we should remove the derived
files next weekend. 

All CVS developers: grab a copy of autoconf and automake this week!

Cool!  There was discussion on the list about this recently and we had

Jason has a lot of stuff on his current site, including the mailing
lists, archives, CVS repository, Jitterbug database, in addition to the
web pages themselves.  I think (myself) it would be best to leave it
where it is since it took some work and seems to be working quite well.
As long as Jason doesn't mind, of course.

I think this would be good, esp. if there were copious comments on what
is being done, and they displayed some of the more interesting things
that are possible.

I built the 2.1.8 tar file and put it into the incoming directory.  It's
built with automake 1.4 but I didn't get Chris's latest patch in; I
lost it :(  Can someone resend?  I can apply it and re-issue 2.1.8, or
do a 2.1.9, whatever you like.

I note that in the docs directory there is an fvwm.lsm for fvwm 1.22
(!) and an fvwm-2.xx.lsm for some older version of 2.0.x.

I think the former should be removed, and the latter needs a lot of
updating of URLs, mailing list info, maintainer info, etc.  I don't
really know much about LSM so I didn't have a go, but I can if no one
else has any experience either.

This file is the options file for GNU indent. I experimented with 
indent a while ago. I still have it here so that is no problem.
The archive directory was meant for 'development only' stuff like
proof reading files or personal files.

Yup, It's a known problem that is already fixed in the development
tree. Will be fixed in the next beta.

Here is a small patch that addresses two menu bugs:

1) AddToMenu cannot be used to insert separators
2) A 'long' separator (MenuStyle * SeparatorsLong)
   reaches one pixel into the border of the menu on
   the right.

None of these is serious enough to make it into 2.2
The fix for (1) is a bit dangerous too (might make
fvwm2 coredump elsewhere, but I don't believe it will).

With this line in my .fvwm2rc I get a coredump:

  AddToFunc MakePaletteMenu "I" ""

I can't tell the exact circumstances (you may not be
able to reproduce this since it seems to depend on the
function name and the entries that are already in there),
but in the end FindBuiltinFunction (functions.c) is
passed a NULL pointer. Since the fix is trivial I'd be
willing to incorporate it without making a new beta (patch
attached). Any objections?

I'd say we skip 2.1.8 as an official beta then, integrate the
patch and publish 2.1.9 as the beta.

	Of course, if the 2.1.8 tarball hasn't been moved out of
incoming yet, it shouldn't be too late to re-cut it, right?

The comment in the code says:
/* domivogt (2-Jan-1999): Why were button presses treated differently here?
   * Causes a bug with ClickToFocus. */

However, removing this code make events headed to the application window
that are intended to be handled my the window manager disappear.  For
example I have in my .fvwm2rc (I use a borderless config to save screen space):

Mouse 1         W       CM      PopUp "Window-Ops"
Mouse 1         W       M       Function "Move-or-Raise"
Mouse 2         W       M       Function "Resize-or-Lower"
Mouse 3         W       M       Iconify

These no longer work.  The events are gone, and the application doesnt even
get them.  Simply changing the code back in events.c fixes both aspects of this
problem.  Hopefully whatever the ClickToFocus bug is can be fixed some other
way.

Well, it is too late, actually.  Once it is "cvs tag"ged as version-x_y_z,
you can't re-tag later revisions with the same label.  Well, maybe you
could force it, or delete the old tag.  But I don't think that is good
practice.  I'd much rather skip it and announce 2.1.9.

Hi,

I hope the guy who registered fvwm.org and Jason T. can get things worked
out.  It would be really nice to have a simple-to-remember web & email
address to put in the docs! 

Since everything is already up and working at the uh.edu site, leaving it
there for now seems the best course of action.  Jason's proposal to
maintain the primary DNS sounded reasonable to me.

There's a slight problem with the way things are now.  The URL
http://www.fvwm.org takes you not to the fvwm homepage, but to one of
those "Index of /" pages.  (You have to go to www.fvwm.org/fvwm)

	I am easily reached to change DNS records... I'm on the machines
every day... but if you prefer I'd be more than happy to have my servers
pull from a primary at your site.  If you really want, I'll add your site
to the NIC records as well.

	That's cool by me.  Just wanted to make the offer...  I'm still
willing to mirror... at least on web pages, I'll do backup-mail-spooling
if you want as well.

	Cool! =)  If no-one objects, I'll start working on this.  I would
like input on what I should put in there.  I'm pretty familiar with
gradients and menus... but I've not played with much else since 2.0.46...
Suggestions anyone?

	It's Jay. ;)  And I'm willing to do whatever everyone wants to do.
I realize that my registration of the domain name could be seen in a bad
light and I want to stress that I got the domain so that the Fvwm
development team could use it.  

	It is my intention to eventually start a themes site for fvwm...
and I would like to be able to use 'themes.fvwm.org' at that point.. but
aside from that, I don't care, It's up to you all what we do with it.

My company (CAIS) is a Tier-1 ISP. we have very good connectivity, so I
think a mirror site here would be great.. but no worries if you don't want
to do that.  =)

Cheers,

Jay

	For openers, the format is years out of date. I'll make a
working draft lsm that I think is in an up to date format, and put it
in docs as fvwm-2.2.lsm. Then feel free to update the url info,
description, tarball name, or whatever.

	When we're ready to go with it, this version should be renamed
to simply fvwm.lsm.

	I don't know how active the LSM is currently. As I recall, Lars
Wirzenius retired from maintaining it 2 or 3 years ago, and I don't
remember who took it over. I'll see if I can find some current info.
My formatting is based on what Sunsite's current tools like to see
(well, I haven't uploaded anything there in about half a year, but I
don't think it's changed).

Actually, moving the label is quite trivial (there's an option to the
tag command to force it, it seems).  This kind of thing happens
occasionally and doesn't really bother me (as long as the tag stays put
once the release is really made)--no one has used this one yet so it's
not a problem, IMO.

But,

I don't really care either way.

Sorry for forgetting that patch; serves me right for playing with this
stuff at 3am :-/.

Whoops; all the makefile.in's are changed back to 1.3d.

Everyone please upgrade to automake 1.4 ASAP, and until you do please
run commit specifying only those files you've changed so you don't flop
the Makefile.in's back again (remember that in 1.3d, etc. the
install-strip is still broken).

I'll commit new 1.4 Makefile.in's again with Chris's patch to
FvwmWinList tomorrow morning (it's building but I need to go to bed :-/)

Err, yes.  I didn't think you could do that.  I remember trying

+ I Next Iconify
+ I Next Iconify

and giving up.

  Can the automake/autoconf generated files be removed from CVS?  It's
a bit of a pain to always have merge conflicts when I update and have to
regenerate my makefiles.  I've attached a one-stop script for running the
appropriate auto* commands after a clean checkout, it's called autogen.sh
and it's what we have in each GNOME module for doing this for us.

I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but I don't understand how people
manage to do this all the time. Just run
cvs commit <the files you modified>
instead of just 'cvs commit' and there will be _no_ problem...

It's worth keep in just so we don't lose the code to do autohiding,
balloons and nice label truncating.

I'd like to keep this, the scrollbars are nice and it does full size
icons, not mini-icons.

FvwmTalk is very light weight and it doesn't depend on xterm.

Yeah, I know.  Some of my machines have 1.3d, some have 1.4.  I'm
installing 1.4 on all of them eventually ...

I don't think it is really a problem EXCEPT that the person who builds the
dist tarball should use 1.4.

What is the benefit of using this as opposed to 'autoreconf' that comes
with autoconf?  (or is it automake?)

It's worth noting that I am not proposing to LOSE any code!  It will
certainly remain available, but perhaps not distributed with the rest of
the fvwm2 core.

The issue is simply deciding what modules should be distributed with 2.2. 
I believe it is a disservice to distribute modules that are unmaintained &
hence likely buggy.  This would reflect poorly on fvwm as a whole.

So the question is: does module X work, and does it have any unique or
useful characteristics for a USER?  I put the question to the list because
probably I don't use module X, and I didn't investigate too hard.  Mostly
I looked at the docs & code comments, and checked if the module would at
least run.

For IconBox and Talk, your comments below indicate that you would answer
YES to the above question.  OK, so let's keep them. 

Is TaskBar also worth keeping from a user's perspective?

For those people determined to emulate that other desktop,
I think so.  I'm not one of them, but I know there are people that
want to do that.

Just got the latest automake and install-strip looks fixed.  It fails on
FvwmTile and FvwmCascade because they are scripts.  The makefile has
INSTALL_SCRIPT = $(INSTALL_PROGRAM} rather than just ${INSTALL}. Worth
fixing before 2.2?

Cheers,
Tim.

Well, it's _something_ of a problem in that the wrong stuff is checked
into the tree, and everyone will get a large update when they cvs update
(perhaps with merges or conflicts), and when I make my commit later
it'll re-checkin all the new versions of files.  Also, I don't think
automake will be forced to run every time, only if there are changes
which require it, so it's possible that the person who builds the dist
might still keep the wrong versions of the files.

I guess it only matters for the rest of the week :).

OK, but that was not the issue.  The 'Function' can be changed to anything and
still not work (I tested that already).  I isolated the problem the the removed
code in events.c.  The events associated with the application window are lost.

Also, this is not a mouse modifier problem (the 'M' could be 'A' or anything
else and the problem is still there).  This is a problem with lost events
using the 'W'.  Events from the 'X Window' within an 'X Window' (to establish
the frames the app is in a nested window) are lost.

Perhaps.  However when I changed the above to:

Mouse 1 W M Exec echo "Mouse 1 W M"

It worked with the current CVS source but not with 2.1.7.
Probably just another manifestation of the problem.

This is a first prototype of a more general reimplementation
of StaysOnTop in the form of layers: 

Every window belongs to a layer. Raise and Lower stay within 
the given layer. There is a new command "Layer rel [abs]" 
for changing layers that parses its arguments like the 
"Desk" command. Initial layers can be assigned via
"Style name Layer n", where n can be any layer index, ie
any nonnegative integer. 

Still to do:
 * special handling of transients in Raise.
 * should transients inherit the layer ?
 * should "Layer" also handle transients specially ?
 * add a condition "Layer n" for selecting only windows
   in a certain layer.
 * get rid of code needed only to maintain StaysOnTop:
    - KeepOnTop can be eliminated
    - the ONTOP and RAISED flags are no longer needed
 * extend GNOME support for layers.

Wonderful!  I'll include this in my next GNOME patch with layers support!
I also want to let everyone know that I've abandoned work on older
versions of fvwm, as I started noticing bugs I didn't want to fix ;)

Please be aware that these changes are not going to be included with
fvwm 2.2; that version is in feature-freeze (in fact, we hope it's damn
near released) and you won't see these kinds of changes in the source
tree until after that (except maybe on a private branch).

People like Matthias are working on extremely cool "future stuff" like
layers but it's not clear what the release schedule beyond 2.2 will be
or what the goals for 2.4 will be--I know one definite feature for 2.4
is the GSFR but we don't know what else might be in there yet.

I'm not sure what your intent is for the GNOME stuff, so just FYI.

Subject: configure with --with-xpm-* flags fails to find matching lib & includes

Full_Name: Justin Rough
Version: CVS tree

CVS_Date: Mon Jan 18 00:57:34 GMT 1999

OS: Solaris 2.6
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (139.132.100.2)


The local system here has XPM v3.4g installed.  I have installed in my
home
directory v3.4k.  The line I used to configure a fresh checkout of the CVS
tree is as follows:

./configure --enable-extras --with-readline-library=/home/ruffy/lib
--with-readline-includes=/home/ruffy/include
--with-xpm-library=/home/ruffy/lib --with-xpm-includes=/home/ruffy/include
--prefix=/home/ruffy/fvwm2-BETA

Even with the two --with-xpm-* flags, configure produces the following
error
in the config summary:

  Have XPM support?         no: Xpm library version and header file version
don't match!

>From config.log:

configure:4422: checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm

 -lS
M -lICE -lX11 -lsocket  -lnsl 1>&5

I am no expert at configure, but it looks as though the problem is that
the
system include dirs (/opt/X11R5/include) are being specified before the
dirs
specified with --with-xpm-includes

This bug appeared around v2.1.7 I think.

If you have autoconf 2.13 installed, can you try changing this line in
configure.in:

  CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $X_CFLAGS $xpm_CFLAGS"

to this:

  CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $xpm_CFLAGS $X_CFLAGS"

and rebuild and see if that works?

You might want to talk to the people already hosting fvwm.themes.org before
you do that.

You seem rather gung-ho in coming in and offering to take everything over.
Please look down occasionally and note the toes you're about to step on.

Sorry  to do this,  but I'm getting a  pretty serious bug out of 2.1.8
and 2.1.10.

I have menus like this:

AddToMenu "aix-systems" "AIX (RS6000) Systems" Title
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%&inferno 4.1" Rloginxvt inferno
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%&peso 4.1"    Rloginxvt peso
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%&cents 4.2"   Rloginxvt cents
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%&broiler 4.3" Rloginxvt broiler

AddToMenu "Systems" "------SYSTEMS Title Menu------" Title
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%AIX systems"        	  Popup aix-systems
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%heater (HPUX10.10)" 	  Rloginxvt heater
+  "%mini.xterm.xpm%h&irise (HPUX10)"   	  Rloginxvt hirise
...

and  keybinding to bring up the "Systems" menu:

Key F24         A N Popup Systems
Key KP_Equal    A N Popup Systems

I can bring up the "Systems" menu, arrow right to get to the
"aix-systems" menu, but then arrow down or the hotkeys
act like I'm still in the "Systems" menu.

Using the mouse, the menus work OK.

I've been getting a warning when I compile on libs/XResource.c,
it's been there since 1.1.5 and I don't know if it has been fixed
(I'm new to the list), but here's a patch to fix it... It was just
a simple cast needed...

I've moved the 2.1.8 and 2.1.9 tarballs into version-2/testing.  Let me
know if we want to announce 2.1.9.  Sorry for taking so long, but I was
pretty out of it yesterday.

Also note that www.fvwm.org should point the the right pages now.

I just noticed the follwoing: the window borders do
not change their appearance upon buttonpress, unless
I disable the MWMButtons style. But I'd like
to have both. Is this a bug or a feature ? The 
relevant code is in borders.c, line 440, but I
didn't have time to figure out how to correct it.

Any submenu will do. If you use key to warp into the submenu
it does not pop up (internally; it's already mapped) until
after your PopupDelay has passed. I have a fix that I will
apply if we think it's serious enough.

Definitely. I believe I've moved this report to duplicate
already and sent a notice to the reporter. Nothing to worry
about unless it fails with 2.1.8 too.

Yes. Matthias, please don't misunderstand me, I don't want to
stop you making enhancements. But at the current time nobody
except yourself will be able to apply them. They overlap each
other more or less and we will need *you* to merge the patches
that will be included into a single patch. Currently I'm
collecting all the patches that don't go into 2.2 and I'm
losing track fast. I Can't possibly remember all the discussions
about the various patches.

The first two things can only be (in my eyes):

1) Incorporate the unapplied patches

2) GSFR

Then we should make a beta 2.3.1 extremely fast so we can
tell people to write patches for this one and not 2.2.

Apart from this I'd love to take up Steve's offer from
October and pass the 'pumpking' to him right after 2.2 (and
let him apply all these patches - about twenty or so :-b ).

I need to know what code you are using. If you are running 2.1.7
the answer is: yes it's buggy and it has been fixed properly
in CVS. If it's current CVS source you are using we'll have to
fix it.

Hi,
Just tried configuring v2.1.10, and this is what happened:

I typed ./configure (with usual options) and watched it do its
"thing". It correctly realised that I had the readline library, and
that it needed to use ncurses. Then I realised that I had forgotten to
prepend configure with the CFLAGS I use, so I reran configure and ...

Termcaps Were Back!

I think what happened is that the test for readline found that
readline was present in the config.cache and blithely assumed that it
had been found by the termcap test rather than the ncurses test. Hence
it went and remade all of my Makefiles. Ooops. :-)

Chris.

docs/ANNOUNCE still says it is 2.1.8. Please remember to change
that to 2.1.9 when you post the announcement.

Eh.  In GNU make I check in files like ANNOUNCE.in which contain things
like @VERSION@ and @DATE@, then these are processed during "make dist"
just like other .in files.

Then I never have to remember to update them :)

After 2.2 maybe I'll take a pass at the fvwm files in a similar way.

The next signal patch ...

I saw some discussion about which modules are IN and which are OUT.
Well, to save myself time and effort I'll only patch the ones which
aren't going to get axed. My next modules will be FvwmForm, FvwmIdent
and FvwmRearrange unless I hear any objections.

When I tried this, everything appeared to work okay, but I noticed
that the problem still carried into the build process.  All the
compilations had the system include directories first (picking up
the XPM 3.4g includes), but linking had the system directories
specified second (so libXpm 3.4k was linked in).

After further checking, it appears as though all occurrences of
$(X_CFLAGS) $(xpm_CFLAGS) in the Makefile.in's need to be switched too.
I have gone through all of mine and reordered the $(<pkg>_CFLAGS) in
$INCLUDES to be the same as the ordering of $(<pkg>_LIBS) in $LDADD.
IMHO this would be expected behaviour, but it is just IMHO :)
Everything worked fine on my machine.

I have attached the patch from a cvs diff -u to save you typing if
you want it.

Thanks,

Justin

I'm fully aware of that. The reason I don't wait till after 2.2
is that I have the energy now, don't know how long that will last...
I don't expect you or any post-2.2 maintainer to sort out all my
patches. I just wanted to demonstrate some possible directions for
post-2.2 work and I think sending working (well if you can get
them to apply) patches seems to be a nicer way to do this than just 
shouting "Fvwm should do this or that". 

After 2.2, I will go over my pending patches and propose them again,
one by one. And I won't send any more till then - I'm out of ideas  :-) 

Matthias

It's a bug.  The border depressing thingy should be controlled by the
Emulate command.

Basically the fix looks like this:

          if (mrPopup == NULL || mrPopup != MrPopupForMi(mi)) {
            fPopup = TRUE;
          } else {
            XRaiseWindow(dpy, mrPopup->w);
            MiWarpPointerToItem(mrPopup->first,TRUE);
          }

has to be changed to

          if (mrPopup == NULL || mrPopup != MrPopupForMi(mi)) {
            fPopup = TRUE;
          } else {
            XRaiseWindow(dpy, mrPopup->w);
            MiWarpPointerToItem(mrPopup->first,TRUE);
            fDoMenu = TRUE;
          }

Bye

Dominik

	I can understand how it might seem that way... I am really just
trying to add what I can to fvwm. I enjoy programming, and I love fvwm.  

I don't want to take over, I don't have the time, even if I did have the
inclination.

I apologize for stepping on your or anybody elses toes.  I wanted to do
something for fvwm... that's all.   Again, I will gladly do whatever
everyone wants to do with the domain, just let me know what that is.

Jay

Well, let's face the facts, with the remaining problems in 2.1.9
we will need another beta:

a) install-strip still not completely clean
b) xpm seems to have a quirk or two
c) bug in keyboard navigation in menus
d) coredump in FindBuiltinFunction
e) bug with separators and 'AddToMenu'

None of these is critical, but still...
Comments?

I'm not so sure, there will always be bugs.  The number of uncommitted
patches for other things is growing.  I think we should declare 2.1.9 =
2.2 ASAP and then get on with fixing stuff.

Cheers,
Tim.

Seems like a "safe" addition.

I must not have been paying attention...

For those few of us that refuse to touch mice,

Your one line fix seems to repair the problem.
I know there will always be one more problem, but this is basic
keyboard operation of menus not working and I can't see
creating a beta or production release without it.

In offline discussions with Vikas, his problem was resolved.
He reported the command table out of sequence, and in another mail
he said it was 2.1.7.

I don't see this is 2.1.7, but I think the important thing is
his problem is resolved, and our current command table is in
sequence.

Hmm.. the commmand list in functions.s was not exactly in sorted
order. The following patch worked for me. I dont get the errors I was
getting earlier.

FWIW, this is a really silly restriction (Sorted list). Many people
hacking on the code would make this easy to break. Why not simply
'qsort' the list before using it in the code? This way, it doesnt
matter what order the 'char *keyword' elements are in. Whatever.

g) fix pan frame visibility. bug #132
h) apply patch to shaded FvwmBorder style windows
i) WarpToWindow & shaded windows. bug #135
j) InitFunctions called too soon. bug #117

I'll do these four but only if we decide to do 2.1.10 and no-one
objects.
Cheers,

Jason,
I didn't forget I just need to remind myself what to type 
what we basically need is to for you to keep the rpm spec file your self or add it to the CVS tree so we can access it from the tar file 

Once we have the spec file which I just pulled out of the rpm from redhat's site you simply move the source to
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
then type rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/fvwm2.spec  # or
rpm -tb fvwm2.spec #if it is in the tar.gz file 
then move /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/fvmw2-* to ftp site

this spec file builds a package for fvwm2 and fvwm2-icons


Now two questions there are two patches that get applied in the rpm the first is 
to adjust the path to perl on redhat systems
the second makes a change to FvwmM4 and FvwmCPP
this second one someone needs to look at to see if it should go into CVS

as for perl is there a way in config to set the path to perl in the scripts?

This shouldn't go into CVS.  I'm fairly sure this is for the
AnotherLevel stuff that RedHat ships.  It's a config manager based on m4
and it probably uses the env variable FVWMDIR.  The man pages for
FvwmCpp/M4 both mention FVWM_MODULEDIR and neither mention FVWMDIR.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'll fix the -I ordering, it's simple.  The other one (link problems) I

I agree this one should be fixed.  The fix is simple and the problem is

Coredumps are bad: is the fix small and obvious?  If not, given that we

Don't recall this one offhand.

  sr>   f) merge extras & modules 

Maybe; we discussed this a good bit early on, too.  At this point I'd
rather see it go out as-is than delay it much.  Also, it might be good
to get a real release out with the current setup, that people expect.

We can document the changes we want to make (what modules will be going
away, which ones are orphaned and need a champion, etc.) and then see
what response we get from the public and make the changes for 2.4.  Just
a thought.

Another thing that needs doing is making a sweep through all the docs
and updating the URLs to use www.fvwm.org, now that we have it working.

Jason, is it possible to reroute the mailing lists through this address?
It would be nice to have "fvwm@fvwm.org", etc.

Whoops; note that the Makefile.in files are actually auto-generated by
automake, and shouldn't be edited.  What needs to be changed is the
Makefile.am files (you didn't think we sat down and wrote those files by
hand, did you? :)

I'll do it; thanks for the info.

This can certainly be done (we can find perl during configure time, then
create these scripts using that pathname), but it's too late for 2.2
(IMO).

I don't think I've seen a fix.  The problem is that Makefile.in has 

INSTALL = @INSTALL@
INSTALL_PROGRAM = @INSTALL_PROGRAM@ $(AM_INSTALL_PROGRAM_FLAGS)
INSTALL_DATA = @INSTALL_DATA@
INSTALL_SCRIPT = @INSTALL_SCRIPT@

It really should have INSTALL_SCRIPT = @INSTALL@ to stop the install.sh
script trying to strip a script.

Cheers,
Tim.

So it sounds like we are saying to leave both patches as patches and not mygrate them in, maybe bringing the perl stuff into config later.

So Jason or whoever is building the rpm needs to 

cp poth patches plus the icons tar ball into
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
then when a new fvwm2 release hits it will need to be placed there as well
then 
rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/fvwm2.spec 
of course the version number in the spec file will be need to be edited as well and an entry put in the changelog at the bottom of the file.

Then you can ftp /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/fvwm2.... to 
our ftp site as well as incoming.redhat.com to publish the rpm to the redhat mirrors .

I can do this if I'm the DNS primary.  Otherwise someone else can set up an
MX host and do the forwarding, but I can't open up my hosts to relay if I
don't serve the domain.  Our permissive security only goes so far.

Ah.  Well, something like that anyway :)

OK, this is a bug in autoconf or automake (depending on how they decide
to fix it), so this can't be fixed.

install-strip works a lot better than it did, but it will fail for those
two programs.  The failure is not a problem, though; we should just
recommend people use the -k option to make when they install-strip, and
expect these errors to be printed.

OK, that sounds reasonable.  Jay, what do you think?  I don't know
what's involved, here, as far as transferring.

If we can't get this changed around quickly don't worry about it; we can
go with what we have now for 2.2 mailing lists and make the changes
later.

	Cool!  Jason, we will be set as soon as you set up an fvwm.org
domain on your system.  I will have my server pull info from yours as
soon as you let me know that it is active.

On the subject of rpms, libraries are generally available as libfoo
and libfoo-devel, libfoo-devel containing headers and other useful
things... Hope you've got xpm-devel if you're RedHat based... the
libfoo libs are useless for compiling your own... All they're good for
is linking when you've got precompiled binaries, as in an rpm.

Do you think we should just use the RedHat-provided spec file? Thing
about it is that ISTR that it does the Imake-style install to
/usr/X11R6 tree. Not only that, fvwm being GNU-style, things would end
up in odd places like /usr/X11R6/libexec/fvwm/... Just an observation.

While we're on the subject of the spec file, IMHO it belongs in the
CVS tree as fvwm.spec.in (there's version-specific stuff in it that
would be nicely handled by auto*. That way the rpm will build an fvwm
the way fvwm-workers expect... Just a thought.

Remember the Emulate command does about nothing despite
the grand name. We could enhance it in the future to

Allright folks, I see we have a big discussion about what is
going into 2.1.10 and I see this solution:

1) 2.1.9 stays in testing

2) 2.1.10 gets exactly two fixes:

   a) The menu navigation fix
   b) The xpm fix

   Nothing else.

3) We create a 2.2 branch off 2.1.10 immediately. If fixes
   are absolutely necessary they go into the branch. The
   branch versions (if any) are labeled 2.1.10.x (ugh).
   Any further bugs will be ignored for 2.2.

4) We begin integration fixes on the main trunk right
   after 2.1.10 is labeled.

5) Within a week after 2.1.10 the branch becomes 2.2.

Paul (PDS), I will be checking in the menu fix right now.
Please make 2.1.10 as soon as you have the xpm fix in.

Bye

Dominik

Seems like CygWin has a different notion about what the proper
character order should be :(

Remember the Emulate command does about nothing despite
the grand name. We could enhance it in the future to
control lots of things (like all the MWM style options).

As i said above I did just pull out the spec file from the current run of rpms that redhat creates for fvwm2, so everything should end up where it is expected to.

I would second this there is only one line that refrences the current version and this could easily be filled in by config.

I guess I didn't look close enough to see that.

Looking even closer, the problem only occurs with underscore,
a really unfortunate character to pick when doing case-less
compares as it sits right between the upper and lower case
characters.  The ascii sequence is A-Z,_,a-z.

We have the table in an  order that would  imply that underscore comes
before uppercase letters but of course it comes after.
We binary search the table using "strcasecmp", I suppose assuming
that strcasecmp treats letters as lowercase.  My Solaris man page
gives no such guarantee.

It looks like every UNIX that fvwm2 runs on implements strcasecmp
in lowercase.  CygWin has taken a different path.

I favor fixing this as follows:

Change the table contents to all upper or lowercase.
Before doing the search, change the input command to the same
case as the table.
During the bsearch do strcmp or strncmp.

I DON'T see this as a 2.2 candidate, but I don't use
CygWin either.

Steve Robbins you are correct!
It did no real harm but I'm glad it's fixed!

Definitely not.

Remember we can always release bugfixes if they're critical (obviously
we should strive to avoid this and only do really important ones) so if
we get a flood of cygwin complaints we could make this change in 2.2.1
or whatever.

I would really rather wait to branch until, for example, the doc fixes
are there.  Remember that once we branch we have to do extra work for
each change to the 2.2 stream: once for the 2.2 branch then merge it
into the mainline.  Might as well wait an extra couple of days.

I don't see any huge rush to start this, myself.  There are some patch
backlogs but nothing like we had before (before 2.1.x); we're very close
and I don't think it'll hurt anyone to wait, as I say, a couple more
days.

The way we originally planned it, IIRC, the 2.2.0 release would actually
be made on the main trunk (that is, the version of configure.in with
VERSION set to 2.2.0 would be on the main trunk), _then_ branched to
create 2.2.1, etc. if needed.  We can certainly change this if we want
to--I'm just not sure there's a compelling reason to do so.

OK, I'm testing it now.

Just one more check for a NULL pointer. Very simple. And the bug
only comes up with a broken config file (I tried to insert a
separator into a function):

  AddToFunc foo
  + "I" "" Nop

You can't add a separator to a menu with 'AddToMenu', only
with '+'. You'll notice when you do that in a function.

Of course, I was talking about sources and configuration only.

OK, that's an option too, but as soon this is ready I'd rather
branch and not wait any longer.

I don't see a rush either, but if we don't make a 2.2 right now (OK,
a few days won't matter) we'll begin patching again not so important
stuff or we will paralyse ourselves.

I don't care at all on which branch 2.2 is labeled.

Why is it more complicated than just putting

    Cwfvwm.org

In the sendmail.cf file on fvwm.math.uh.edu?  Then if the MX record for
fvwm.org points to you, your sendmail will be the one handling it.  You
shouldn't have to open up relaying for this.

Or am I missing something?

Log message:
Fixed configure.in and all Makefile.am's to make sure that xpm_CFLAGS
preceeds X_CFLAGS.  This is so that the include directory for
--with-xpm-includes is searched ahead of the system's X11 include
directory (in case multiple versions of xpm are installed).

acconfig.h: Removed #undefs for VERSION & PACKAGE; autoheader from
autoconf 1.13 now generates them automatically.

And yes, this time I made sure to use automake 1.4 :-)

Yeah, sorry about that.  I *did* know that you were going to be doing
this, but I ran into the same xpm_CFLAGS vs. X_CFLAGS issue myself
tonight!  

I was installing on some systems that had an old buggy xpm in /usr/X11,
and a new one somewhere else.  I had to fix it for myself anyway, so I
checked it in...

Yeah, I kinda got carried away with doc changes tonight ... especially
with cvs.html.

Hi,

I just finished the second version of my patch for pager. This does:
 * Individual formats for balloons and mini labels for the little
   windows of pager.
 * Two new options to control this new stuff:
   *FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat and *FvwmPagerBalloonStringFormat.
   The format is the same as of the IconMan format option.
 * Updates for the manpage.

This patch has been checked with purify (and no problem found).

Andreas

Superb :-D

Right after 2.2 I'll put it in. I'm so tired of all my rxvt's
having labels like 'mc - Thank you for using GNU midnight commander'.

Thanks!

Sorry, this is my doing.  The correct fix, however is to install autoconf
2.13: 

stever@jeff{fvwm}autoheader
configure.in:159: warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow  cross compiling
configure.in:213: warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow cross compiling
stever@jeff{fvwm}grep VERSION config.h.in 
#undef VERSION
stever@jeff{fvwm}autoheader --version
Autoconf version 2.13

[I don't _think_ it also requires automake 1.4 for this to work, but it
might.]

Toker:~/src/fvwm > autoheader --version
Autoconf version 2.13

Toker:~/src/fvwm > automake --version
automake (GNU automake) 1.3b

I'll upgrade automake to 1.4 and see what happens.

My mistake.  You DO need automake 1.4 to correctly build the cvs source
tree now.  You can pick it up from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake/

Well, you tried it just once, and found it alright for kicks,
Now you found out that it's a habit that sticks,
And you're an orgasm addict.

You're missing something; I can't do that if I don't control the domain
because my superiors won't let me.  But that's OK; it's already being taken

they still show the two main servers as being at CAIS.com and those servers

2.1.10 is in testing now (and I'm building it); is it ready to be
announced?

Are you sure you're in the right place?  If you're trying to build the
distribution your directory name should be "fvwm-2.1.10", not "fvwm" (as
is implied by your prompt above).

I just tried ./configure on the 2.1.10 tar file and I get the correct
results.

Cool; let us know when it's all set and what the new mailing list names
are.

It would be _really_ nice if ftp.fvwm.org and cvs.fvwm.org also existed
and mapped to the appropriate places :)

I'm very hopeful that, unless major problems surface soon, 2.1.10 plus
various document cleanups will become 2.2.0.

BTW, Steve, should we hold off whacking all the derived files from the
tree until _after_ 2.2.0 is done and labeled?  I know it _shouldn't_
matter, but why rock the boat?

They have been there for some time now.  The problem is DNS propagation;
NSI still has two cais.com hosts as the servers and these hosts have not

I have no problem creating them, although I would hope that the procedure
would be simpler than copying files all over some directory in /usr.

I don't see the spec file and necessary patches anywhere in CVS.  There
should probably be a redhat (and eventually a debian) directory somewhere
to hold these.

You are right they should go into CVS somewhere but I'm not sure where, nor do I have the permissions to put them there (and for this simple task I probably won;t need commit either).

As for scattering stuff all over /usr it does keep everything under /usr/src/redhat but other than that there isn't much we can do, sorry.

Now if you need the spec and patches I can said them again directlly to you just let me know, although if we take to long in building them whoever it was that was building the other versions will probably beat us to it.

I've never seen mwm, but CDE's dtwm which I assume is mostly like mwm
does not depress borders either. So I wouldn't call this a bug but
a bit of mwm compatibility.

S'okay by me.  

I'll not touch anything but docs until you label 2.2.0.

Hi,

This just flew by in comp.os.linux.announce.  Someone's suggesting
standardising WM shortcuts.  This is news to me; are other people here
aware of this?  [Hmm ... I recognize one of the names `Maciej Stachowiak'
from this list ... ]

Just another thing to consider after 2.2 comes out.

BTW: c.o.l.a is archived at http://www.iki.fi/mjr/linux/cola.html

	I just dropped into mwm to verify this, and mwm definitely
*does not* depress the borders.

	But maybe this is the bug part: what I observe is that setting
MWMButtons has the effect of turning off the border depression, but
setting MWMBorder does not. It seems to me that the border depression
should be a function of the MWMBorder/FvwmBorder setting, and not the
MWMButtons/FvwmButtons setting.

This is what I would expect, too. It is nice to have a good mwm 
emulation, but it is even nicer if I can just pick the parts of
it I like (like MWMbuttons) and still have other things come from
fvwm. A global "Emulate MWM" cannot give me that flexibility.

I promised not to send any more patches before 2.2, but
here is an idea which i had some days ago. I just wasn't
courageous enough to try to implement it...

The idea is to move the whole menu code to a module. The
impetus for doing so would be not so much memory consumption
(exept for the few people who never use menus), but rather
to allow alternate implementation. I was thinking of an
implementation using gtk-menus; to improve fvwms integration
in a certain gtk-based desktop.

Has this idea been considered and rejected ? Would it be possible
at all ?

I just thought that MWMButtons was the wrong thing to use to get MWM
compatibility and that Emulate MWM would be better. MWMbuttons make the
buttons reflect the state (e.g. Maximized stays in on maximized
windows).

Cheers,
Tim.

Considered yes, but not seriously. A *very* big problem is that
menus and functions share the same code. There is no difference
between a function and a menu at least as is how they are
stored internally. I'd love to reimplement this bit as it wastes
a lot of RAM for function entries (e.g. why should a function
item have a font or a menu style?).

Another thing to consider is that this would force *every* single
fvwm user to rewrite his config file.

Any ideas?

The Emulate command is a bit of a hack anyway. When I rewrote the
MenuStyle code there were bits in the code not related with menus
but controlled by the menu style. These are now handled by emulate.
Most things hardly justify a separate configuration option.

I wonder if we should carry the mwm vs. fvwm configurability this
far. You can have Motif look and feel without copying each and
every minor feature. The SerparatorsShort vs. SeparatorsLong
MenuStyle options are a good example. Nobody would consider fvwm
as mwm incompatible if the menu separators are a pixel or two
longer or shorter than mwm's. We could try to clean up such minute
details and leave only the noticable options in.

Why don't we do it like with autoconf? All these options have a name
hinting on some window manager most of use have never seen. When I
see 'MWMButtons' I have no idea what this controls. I have to look it
up in the manpage. I think it is better to have options like
'DepressButtons' instead. The Emulate mwm/fvwm command could take
care of seting everything and there would be a single place in the
manpage describing all the differences between various window
manager modes. The new MenuStyle syntax is a good example.

This sounds good, I also think the depressing borders isn't worth a
config option at all, it should be on all the time, the only complaint
we have had is when some option has turned it off.

>> The idea is to move the whole menu code to a module.

A big bridge to burn. I don't have a problem with a module that does
menus but I wouldn't like to have to rely on a module for menus. What if
fvwm can't find the module? What if you run out of process space and
can't fork? How would fvwm behave if it tried to do something while the
module had the server grabbed?

By all means do a module but what are the advantages of having menus
from a module rather than just a straight X program? You can get input
to the program from Exec and you can communicate with fvwm using
FvwmCommand, FvwmPipe etc.

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes, the problem of config file syntax was one I had already
considered. Perhaps one would have to make the menu-modules 
"special", you could start at most one of them and would
have to register them in a special way (MenuModule FvwmDefaultMenu ???)
Then Fvwm could treat the config lines dealing with menus 
specially and send them to the menu-module. Just an idea.

I had a look and their choices are dreadful. I suggest we knock up a
file that matches those keybindings and stick it in the distribution
with and entry in the man page saying to read the file.

Well, you can already get problems like that: try 

fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.m4' 

with FvwmM4 in some place different from the hardcoded default.

If you go that route, you have to invent new syntax for defining
menus for the external program. I had the vision of transparently
replacing the builtin menus by gtk menus without rewriting config
files.

I've just read the proposal from 17th of January and must say
the shortcuts are rather unintuitive, depending heavily on
non standard keys like Pause, Scroll lock and Print screen.
Another set of shortcuts uses things like alt-t or ctrl-w. I
wonder in what situation this should do anything. When I'm on
my shell window I expect all but the most exotic key
combinations to be handled by the shell. Certainly I want to 
have ctrl-w work like in xemacs and not close my window.

Does anybody volunteer to follow this discussion representing
the opinions on our list? I certainly have no time (and disk space)
to read another news group but would like to know what the outcome
of the discussion is and give them some things to consider.

Hum.  Re-reading this file, it occurs that we might want to reinstate
"tortuous".  As in: "The authors of FVWM disclaim all liability arising
from mental anguish or damage to common sense due to reading the tortuous
language, logic, and syntax used in this file." 


More seriously, I noticed an inconsistency as I was reading the file. 
After the first four paragraphs, there is suddenly list of modules, with
no connecting phrase.  I couldn't make out the intent, so I will leave it
for someone else to correct.  Could someone who was following the
copyright issues (Dominik?) fix this up appropriately? 

Are the modules listed EXCEPTIONS from paragraph 4?  Or, to the contrary,
are they the only ones that p4 applies to --- the rest being GPLed?  Or is
the list an anachronism that ought to be removed? 

P.S. Whoever fixes this might as well remove the section at the end
entitled "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs", as we presumably
already know how to apply these terms :-)

P.P.S.  There is no module "extras/FvwmPerl".  There used to be
"extras/fvwmperl" (lowercase 'p') but it hasn't been distributed for a
long time now.

I'll take care of this. Might have done a bit too much cut-and-paste.

It's just the complete GPL. This paragraph is in the original GPL
file.

Really? Since when? When I wrote that it was still in.

I gave quite a lot of thought to this idea quite some time ago. I wanted
to make some menu code improvements and decided the way to go was to
write a module. Then I decided to use an existing toolkit. I tried
several things. If I remember correctly (this was quite a long time
ago) I tried a Tcl/Tk menu using FvwmPipe (trivial implementation),
a TkPerl/FvwmPerl module, and a gtk module. It was all pretty easy
to code, but the problem was speed. Running on a P200/64Mb it was
just annoyingly slow popping up a menu on a mouse click. Part of this
is the wait to load a whole toolkit, part is the overhead of starting
a new process. I decided to try ripping the Xlib menu code out of
fvwm and wrapping it in a module. Then I took a look at the menu code
and abandoned the idea :-)

So my conclusion is that if people want to write a range of modules
to implement different kinds of menus, then cool, go ahead. I may even
try the gtk module again myself sometime. But we should leave in the
fast builtin menu code for people without supercomputers :-)

Ugh! You're right. A paragraph is missing. I'll try to fill that
in from some older release when I'm back home.

I know this has come up several times before, but it's always struck me
that the right way to do this sort of thing when speed is critical is as a
shared object.

The concensus in the past about shared libraries has generally been, `Yeah,
that may be the right way to do it, but it would limit the number of
platforms we can run on, and none of us really knows how to do it,' etc.

Zsh does a pretty good job of accommodating both sides of the fence.  If
you can use shared objects, it's configure script figures that out and does
it.  Otherwise, it just loads in all the modules statically.  Sure, it
increases the size of the binary, but in the case of standard menus
(probably the only menu system that *must* be included statically, and
possibly the only menu system that actually ships with fvwm), it's there
now anyway.

If someone were to get this working, it could probably also be used for
modular decorations, as has also been suggested before.

Anyway, since fvwm is now in pretty active development again, it wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing if someone wanted to try it, starting out with
the easy case -- anything that supports dlopen() and friends (Linux,
Solaris, others?) and expanding it as time goes by.  An experimental option
that you have to explicitly turn on if you want to use.

If no one else wants to try, this may be the impetus I actually need to
start coding for fvwm.  Work should calm down somewhat in a week or two,
and I might actually have time.  (He he.  I shouldn't make jokes so early
in the morning. ;-)

Dominik has done a lot of work with menus, so it's probably better.

Anyway, I think a module for popping menus should be written to be
invoked at init time and constantly running (at least as an option).  It
could then get requests from fvwm2 at runtime and avoid the overhead of
starting a process for each menu popup.

Or even those of us who don't want the fancy stuff (why not use
Enlightenment if that's what you want)?

I agree 100%.  I still use the builtin windowlist (I remember when it
got removed briefly, and I yelled along with others) even on my new
P450 (well, actually, I just got it Tuesday and I haven't gotten Linux
installed on it yet, but when I do I'm still going to use the builtin
windowlist :).

This kind of brings up an issue. Would it be appropriate to request
that distributors who change the documented behavior of fvwm (no
longer honors .fvwm2rc or [ETCDIR]/system.fvwm2rc) patch the manpage
to reflect their changes? The amount of traffic in the fvwm list
revolving around this point (almost always with RedHat Linux) seems to
warrant it. Heck, even a "see also" entry in the manpage pointing to a
readme for AnotherLevel (the system-wide m4 thingie) would suffice.
While we're at it, perhaps I could write an FAQ entry.

Hrmm, how about something like this?

A: RedHat Linux as of version 4.1 ships with the AnotherLevel package,
   which handles your configuration files for any and all of the
   window manager packages you install. See its documentation in [I'll
   have to figure this out at home where I can poke around in the

Yes, I thought about that as well. A little menu daemon that
sits there and fields requests to pop up menus. I can't remember
if I attempted an implementation ... I'll have a dig around my
vast repository of old abandoned code :-)

So this synchronicity of threads in the fvwm list and here about popup
menus got me thinking... It'd be pretty nice to be able to popup a
menu with dynamic contents and have it act as a proper popup with the
menu tree and all that.

Now I haven't had more than one coffee yet today, and I'm at work so
I can't really spend a lot of time looking at sources, so bear with
me, but maybe we could add a menu builtin called PopUpExec or
somesuch. PopUpExec would expect to be given a Function, and the
Function would be expected to issue a PopUp, preferably one whose
contents had been dynamically negotiated. fvwm could run the function
and then watch for the popup request, which it could reparent to the
appropriate place? Sound feasible, and if so, like a good way to do
this? Or should I go drink some more coffee?

It seems stable and I haven't seen any problems reported so I'm going to go

After that I'll play with RPMS.

I certainly don't like Windows as an OS, but they have a couple of good
UI ideas: I think the alt-tab behavior of Windows is pretty nice
(although for me, the fact that it operates regardless of which window
has focus is a problem).

I checked out the alt-tab question in the FAQ, and it gives a good
approximation but it just isn't the same.  I wonder about creating an
"alt-tab" module.  Not that I'm in any way thinking of doing it myself,
I'm just musing out-loud :).

Is it even possible to make something like that under X?  I was trying
to think of ways it could be that fast (even on my old 486/66, alt-tab
brings up a window list almost instantaneously).  If the window were
created at all times but just not mapped, it seems like having it mapped
when a key was pressed would be fast enough.

Then the only problem would be emulating the way the alt key controls
what window you choose (when it's released, that window is chosen and
the selector disappears).  Can this be done with existing X events?  Can
you get an event when a modifier like that is lifted?  What about
non-modifier keys (maybe you could pick a "normal" key instead of ALT)?

And, of course, I'm not sure if the interaction between fvwm and modules
could encompass this as-is.

Just random thoughts...

All I see at the archive is the one proposal.  They refer to previous
discussions, but I'm not sure where.  Is this related to other
mails we've seem about X standards?  Where is the discussion
taking place?

Some of the keys do seem strangly defined.

* Scroll lock : remapped to Break : lock focus to focused window
 * Pause : start some kind of pause screen (or screen saver if it isn't
available)
 * Print : "stick" focused window to current screen, or "tab to next
window"

Scroll lock is obviously intended to Lock the workstation.
Pause is obviously intended to toggle CD playing (a little mod
I made to Workman).
Print Screen is obviously intended to invoke FvwmForms, and then
after setting some parameters and hittine return,
PRINT the window you select.

(I'm not completly serious, just identifying the way I use these keys.)

I don't see much discussion about context, or buttons, or window
decorations, or those really cool keys on Sun Keyboards, (Open, Front,
Stop, Again, Help, etc.)

You know, I'm not sure what my point is, and it is NOT my intent to
move the discussion to the fvwm-workers list, but I would like to
know a little more.  I have been trying to figure out what fvwm2 should
be doing with default bindings, especially on the root.

It  seems to me that the  biggest way fvwm2  is inferior on this issue
is, we didn't take  the last step and  bind alt-tab by default.   (I'd
rather make this a post 2.2 change.)

I think you are referring to showing one entry  at a time, rather than
showing them all?  When I watch Windows users take 2 or 3 trips around
the list of windows, it makes  me laugh.  On  the other hand, it would
probably be a good  idea if alt-tab could  shuffle the list of windows
up by one, or cursor down, in the window list so  you wouldn't have to
move your fingers much.

I've already done that, but I did it as a module within tkgoodstuff
(it's called "switcher" and it works almost EXACTLY like the Windoze
Alt-TAB behavior).

I've gotten permission from Mark Crimmins to take over development of
tkGoodstuff, which is a scriptable tcl/tk "button bar" (on steroids!). 
I've been waiting for Fvwm 2.2 to be announced so that I can announce
the next version of tkGoodstuff (version 8.1).

This new version includes a new Switcher module puts up a centered
window with a group of mini-icons representing each running
application, with the window title on the next line.  By continually
pressing TAB (keeping the ALT key down), you can cycle through the
applications.  Letting go of the ALT key selects the highlighted window
(a focus and warp).  Pressing the ESCAPE key removes the window from
the screen.  This follows current Win95 and NT4 behavior.  As usual for
tkGoodstuff, the keys and modifiers can be specified by the user.

I've made a number of changes in tkGoodstuff, including REAL support
for Fvwm2's new mini-icons, some autoconf stuff, bug fixes, and various
other enhancements.  I'm just waiting for Fvwm 2.2 so I have a non-beta
Fvwm that I can specify for the program's requirements (it doesn't
really REQUIRE fvwm, but some features like the Switcher only work if
the program is invoked as an fvwm module).

Please do not take this as a message of "Hurry Up Guys" -- the time
that you spend fixing bugs and doing stuff to the 2.1.x tree is time
that I'm spending making tweaks to tkGoodstuff.

<b>Linux on the desktop</b></center><p>

<p>The variety and maturity of Linux applications and desktop environments has never been greater -- and more are in the pipeline for 1999.  However, for those who are not comfortable at a command line, Linux can be inscrutable to install and configure.  The result is that Linux is not yet a viable alternative for corporate desktops.  Working within Linux nearly equals the Windows 98 experience, but working with Linux is more difficult than using Windows 3.1.<p>

<b>Pros: </b>Growing number of free or inexpensive, full-featured productivity applications; sophisticated, attractive desktop environments.<p>

<b>Cons: </b>Command line required to make system changes; hardware incompatibilities; no versions of many corporate applications.<p>

<i>By Chip Brookshaw</i><p>

<p><b>At issue: </b> <i>Linux on the desktop - The open-source operating system has been so wildly popular on many types of servers that some think it could be a credible alternative to Microsoft Windows on the desktop.</i><p><br>


<font size=+3><b>A</b></font>s the Linux phenomenon has spread, visions of its success have grown as well, fed by a perennial desire for an alternative to Windows.  Several platforms, including OS/2 and the Macintosh, have already battled Windows for the desktop, and in 1998 Linux was enlisted for the same campaign.  One year ago, few outside the Linux developer community had even heard of the upstart OS, and longtime users can claim that this Unix variant for inexpensive PC hardware was neither intended nor engineered to be a desktop Windows-killer.  Regardless, there is a growing view that if Linux can take share on the server (as it has), it could take seats on the desktop.<p>

There are a number of perceived benefits to Linux becoming a desktop alternative to Windows.  Linux is free to use and distribute, which could save companies a bundle in licensing fees.  Several Linux productivity applications are also free or inexpensive, potentially saving even more money.  Many also feel that Linux is a far more stable platform than Windows' shaky tower of DLLs and registry settings.  And because the Linux kernel is not proprietary, the playing field for application vendors is level.  No vendor controls the source code, so no vendor can leverage Linux to its benefit.<p>

Linux has a powerful Unix-like command line, and many Linux pros have no need or desire for a GUI.  But if Linux is to become a giant-killer on the desktop, it must be judged against Windows by mainstream users.  Given the state of Linux development though, the experience of such users fluent with WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer), but not with text prompts, is likely to be a mixed one.<p>

On one hand, several popular window managers provide Linux with WIMP interfaces and file managers that echo many Windows conventions.  There are also numerous productivity applications, such as browsers and office suites, available for Linux.  For the most part, these applications have a Windows look and feel and offer functionality that is comparable to their Windows counterparts.<p>

Despite the slew of impressive applications and interfaces though, Linux will not be an acceptable corporate alternative to Windows until hardware-compatibility issues are resolved and all aspects of installation and configuration are achievable in the desktop environment.  For most users, the learning curve required to transform a Linux box into a "personal" computer is too steep.<p><br>

<center>
<img src="/pageone/gif/990118linux.gif" width="539" height="353" border="0"></center><p><br>

<b>HOW IT WORKS. </b> Those interested in using Linux as a desktop OS should acquire one of the prepackaged distributions, which typically comprise a stable kernel and a set of tools and applications that make Linux easier and more worthwhile to use.  Depending on the distribution, these sets of extras vary widely.  Differences include processor support, installation and configuration utilities, window managers, and bundled applications.  There are at least a dozen distributions, but Red Hat Software and Caldera supply two of the most popular.  Red Hat Linux 5.2 and Caldera OpenLinux 1.3, respectively, are their most recent versions.<p>

To create a graphical desktop for Linux, a window manager (also called a desktop environment) must be installed atop the kernel.  There are scores of window managers.  Some are little more than garage hacks; others are the result of large collaborative efforts.  Many window managers are further customizable with a vast number of plug-in themes, ranging from functional (a Mac OS look) to whimsical (a carnival motif).  Generally, any window manager can be used with any distribution, although there may be installation issues or other incompatibilities.<p>

Red Hat's latest distribution includes three window managers; the default is FVWM2 with a Windows 95 look-alike interface.  FVWM2 is functional, but it is only a crude approximation of Windows 95.  Although it uses a start button and taskbar along the lower edge of the display, FVWM2 has so many oddities that migrating Windows 95 users to it would be disastrous.<p>

For instance, menus that cascade off the start button often overlap each other, obscuring navigation.  Using the scroll bars is frustrating as well.  The left mouse button scrolls down, but the right mouse button is required to scroll up.  Also, selecting a window's close box briefly turns the cursor into a skull and crossbones -- not very reassuring for a new user.<p>

The K Desktop Environment (KDE), on the other hand, is much more inviting.  KDE is the handiwork of the KDE project, a collection of software developers using the open-source model, and Caldera has integrated the software into its OpenLinux distribution.  (KDE can also run on Red Hat Linux 5.2.)  The Common Desktop Interface (CDE), a window manager that has been available for years on Unix, is another widely used GUI, but KDE has won over many in the Linux community.<p>

With minor differences, KDE follows most standard Windows conventions.  For instance, the two-paned file manager has icon and tree views and can be used to browse the Web just like Windows Explorer.  Drag-and-drop functionality is available for moving and copying files, and there is a trash can for deleting them.  KDE does not have the zooming, sliding menus of Windows 98, but it keeps many other touches, including subtly shaded title bars and tool tips that pop up when the cursor lingers over an icon.<p>

There are two major interface differences between Windows and KDE.  By default, KDE uses two taskbars along the display edges: One is a dynamic list of open windows, and one acts as a dedicated application and utility launcher.  Although it takes up more screen real estate, KDE's design is more logical.  Also, it is easier to customize the launcher taskbar than it is to configure the Programs menu that drops from Windows' start button.<p>

The other important difference, virtual desktops, is something all Linux window managers/desktop environments -- not just KDE -- offer to some degree.  FVWM2 and KDE come with as many as eight virtual desktops by default, accessible via buttons on a taskbar.  Part of the X Window graphical subsystem, Linux's virtual desktops are a descendant of the days when scarce Unix workstations had to be shared, but they can help individual users organize their work as well.  As the name implies, virtual desktops offer separate workspaces that can include any combination of open files, folders, and applications.  For instance, you could have a calculator and spreadsheet open in one, a browser open in another, and a command line and file manager open in a third.<p><br>


<b>THE ENTERPRISE ROLE. </b> Linux desktop environments are relatively mature, but without applications all of those pretty faces are not much use in a corporate setting.  Fortunately, several vendors have developed free, or relatively inexpensive, Linux versions of their software.  They are the reason that Linux can even be considered a desktop alternative to Windows.<p>

Most Linux distributions include Netscape Communicator, with its standard package of browser, e-mail, discussion group, and HTML editor clients.  The browser matches the features of the Windows version, including Java and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support, and provides an easy way for users to download the productivity applications that many vendors have made available.<p>

The first program some will want to grab off the Web is Corel's WordPerfect 8 for Linux, Personal Edition.  The downloadable version is free, although it is limited to personal use and does not include documentation or charting/drawing functions.  Still, the Personal Edition is a powerful word processor that can translate Microsoft Word documents.  For business customers, a full-featured, shrink-wrapped version will soon be available priced at about $50 retail.<p>

Another useful download is Star Division's new StarOffice 5.0, Personal Edition, a productivity package that mimics the look and feel of Windows 98 so closely that it could be one's primary desktop interface for most situations.  It is a little confusing at first, but StarOffice puts its Windows 98-like shell over your Linux window manager of choice.  StarOffice employs a browserlike file manager, similar to KDE and Windows Explorer, that can be used to navigate both local and Internet content.<p>

StarOffice also includes Microsoft Officelike and Outlook-like applications: word processor, spreadsheet, presentation graphics program, e-mail package, calendar, and so on.  It is an impressive bundle, and it is free for personal use.  (Star Division is also selling a version for corporate customers priced at $169.)  Our preliminary tests on StarOffice revealed some bugs, but it is worth a trial.<p>

Another popular Linux office suite is Applix's Applixware, which includes a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation graphics application, paint program, and other tools.  Red Hat Linux comes with a demo version of Applixware; the fully functional edition is bundled with S.u.S.E.'s Linux distribution, or it can be purchased from Applix's Web site for $99.<p><br>


<b>TECHNOLOGY TIME LINE. </b> Two important desktop-related releases are expected this year from leading Linux developers, but other vendors remain uncommitted to the platform.  This could change if Linux grows as exponentially in 1999 as it did in 1998, but for now many of the applications that corporate users rely on are not available for Linux.<p>

The lack of a Linux version of Lotus Notes is particularly glaring, given that product's large share of the corporate desktop messaging market.  Lotus offers a version of Notes for Solaris but will say only that it is considering a Linux port.  Also, despite a Linux image-editing tool called GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), graphics professionals have little choice but to stick with Macintosh or Windows machines.  Adobe and Quark officials said they have no plans to offer Linux versions of Photoshop and Quark, respectively.  (Even if they did, substandard font support makes Linux an unattractive graphics platform.)<p>

Not surprisingly, Microsoft has no plans to port its applications, including Internet Explorer, to a potential rival.  On the bright side, Netscape said it will keep the Linux version of Communicator up to date, despite the company's acquisition by America Online.<p>

One important software release scheduled for 1999 is the KDE project's KOffice, currently in alpha stage.  KOffice includes familiar productivity applications (a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation graphics program, and so on) and may turn out to be a better alternative for KDE users than StarOffice or Applixware because of its integration with that desktop environment.<p>

The most anticipated development, however, is Red Hat's next Linux distribution, due in the first half of the year.  The new Red Hat release will use GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) instead of FVWM2 as its default desktop environment.  GNOME is not tied to any one window manager, but it is most often used with Enlightenment, a slick KDE-like interface.  Although Red Hat has not officially committed to using Enlightenment, a GNOME/Enlightenment combination would be a huge improvement over FVWM2, both in looks and brains.<p>

Still, regardless of the variety and sophistication of its desktop environments and applications, Linux will not be a credible desktop alternative for corporate users until configuration and hardware-compatibility issues are greatly improved.  It is a lot to expect so soon -- especially considering Microsoft, Apple, and others have been working on similar issues since the mid-1980s.  But given the success thus far of the open-source model, and the size and enthusiasm of the developer community, nothing that happens surrounding Linux should be a surprise.  Just look how far things came in 1998.<p>

I'd looked into this... I had thought that for a tentative proof of
concept I could have the window list be displayed in FvwmIconMan.
Basically, I had an event loop waiting on Alt/Meta KeyPress which
would XGrabKey Tab or Shit+Tab. Then it'd wait ClickTime for
KeyRelease Tab. If it didn't, it would "Module FvwmIconMan transient"
and that's as far as I got. My prototype always dumped core, but I
suck at writing Xlib... Then I got distracted. Anyway, I *thought* my
theory was okay. And event looping on a KeyRelease seems workable.

This may be a misunderstanding of what I meant.  I can
well imagine speed problems if a module is started every time
I popup a menu. My idea was to have the menu-drawing-module
hang around all the time, having pre-built the menus from
the configuration info, and just send an "Pop up menu blah"
command from fvwm to the module if a menu is to be popped up.
The module would then do its thing and send the selected item 
back for execution to fvwm. I would expect such a setup to
be somewhat slower than builtin menus, but not terribly slow.

Of course, comparing fvwm2 (a window manager) to KDE (a desktop

Oh, just another journalist who hasn't done his research properly and
has no idea what he's talking about. For example:

  "GNOME is not tied to any one window manager, but it is most often
   used with Enlightenment, a slick KDE-like interface."

Hmmmm. My advice: ignore it.

Oh sorry, I thought I had told you: if FvwmWinList has exited because
of a signal it received it does not necessarily need to leave a core.
In the meantime signal handling has been enhanced in this module.
Please try if you get the same bug with 2.1.10 (should be out today).

Hmm, if 2.1.10 does not work also I'll have a look at the changes.

Hi Mr. Vogt,
I tried your suggestions to no avail.  I recompiled on a Solaris 2.4 system
using a gcc 2.7.0 compiler.
I still have the problem with WinList disappearing just a few seconds after
start up on Solaris 2.4 and
2.6 machines.

I still cannot locate a core dump.  I issued a find command in my fvwm
library, looking for 'core' and I
searched the directory tree manually looking for any strange files.

I performed a clean reconfigure as follows:

make clean
make distclean
configure --prefix=<my_path>
make
make install

One thing I tried that works fine is that I copied the FvwmWinList
executable from fvwm 2.0.046 to
the fvwm 2.1.7 library.  WinList stayed up for my entire session of about 4
hours.

I will be happy to try any other suggestions you have in order to assist you
in pinpointing the problem.

Regards,
Joe Prosser

Actually, it's the example COPYING file from automake, I think.

It is the text of the GPL *plus* a bit about how to apply the GPL to your
programs.  It says things like "put a copyright notice in each file, blah
blah blah".  

Well, we've already applied GPL to (bits of) fvwm.  All we need in COPYING
is a copy of the GPL.  That is: the contents of COPYING minus "How to
Apply these Terms..."

Since about two months:

Mon Nov  9 18:56:50 1998  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

        * Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed fvwmperl, since this version is
        known to be obsolete.  Removed fvwmpython on suspicion of being
        obsolete.

Hi,
I have isolated that reappearing "-lreadline -ltermcap" problem: if
the config.cache file says that FVWM uses libreadline.a then configure
assumes that it's because of -ltermcap. Hence only "make distclean;
./configure" use -lncurses, and every other time configure gets it wrong.

BTW I have perl, automake-1.4 and autoconf-2.13 and I find that "make
clean" doesn't clean out all .o files any more... Weird.

Chris.

Hi,

I just created the new version of my FvwmPager-Patch. This one applies 
to fvwm 2.1.10. No other changes.

This patch can be found at http://degnet.de/~awd/pager-patch-2.1.10

I just had a play with FvwmWinList and versions from 2.1.9 onward seem to be
broken.  Symptoms are:
Doesn't follow focus (use mousefocus and go onto the root); Hangs the server when
windows are added or removed; crashes.

I got a core but infortunatley gdb core dumped on me when I tried to get a stack
trace!

The only changes appear to be the signal handler patches and a different select
call.
This is on SunOS 5.6.

Cheers,
Tim.

Can you post the config.log? SunOS 5.6 is "Solaris 2.??", so it must
support sigaction(). Does FvwmIconMan work under SunOS 5.6? What about
FvwmPager? The only difference I can think of between SunOS and Linux
is the sigact.sa_flags argument - I think that SunOS defines
SA_INTERRUPT. Is SA_INTERRUPT defined?

Cheers,
Chris.

Correct.  I'm reasonably sure that this can be fixed by adding these two
lines:

  unset ac_cv_header_readline_readline
  unset ac_cv_lib_readline_readline

to configure.in just before the line that reads:

smr_CHECK_LIB(readline, , , readline, readline/readline.h, -ltermcap)

However, the whole business about probing for readline using termcap, then
re-probing using ncurses seems like a gross hack to me.  It seems to me
like it bears careful thinking about.  Due to the code freeze for 2.2,
however, I didn't patch it.  Instead, there is an oblique note in BUGS
about it: 

======================================================================

Configure remembers too many things, particularly with respect to the
optional libraries.  If you ever need to re-run configure, using
different --with options, please remove "config.cache" file first.

Very weird.  I can't reproduce this.

Just narowed it down a bit more. The problem following focus is fixed by putting the
previous version of MainEventLoop back in.  I think it something arund the new select
code that is causing events from fvwm to get missed.

Old code:

  while( !isTerminated ) {
    FD_ZERO(&readset);
    FD_SET(Fvwm_fd[1],&readset);
    FD_SET(x_fd,&readset);
    tv.tv_sec=0;
    tv.tv_usec=0;

    if (!select(fd_width,SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &readset,NULL,NULL,&tv)) {
      XPending(dpy);
      FD_ZERO(&readset);
      FD_SET(Fvwm_fd[1],&readset);
      FD_SET(x_fd,&readset);
      select(fd_width,SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &readset,NULL,NULL,NULL);
    }

    if (FD_ISSET(x_fd,&readset)) LoopOnEvents();
    if (!FD_ISSET(Fvwm_fd[1],&readset)) continue;
    ReadFvwmPipe();

    }

New code:

while( !isTerminated ) {
    FD_ZERO(&readset);
    FD_SET(Fvwm_fd[1],&readset);
    FD_SET(x_fd,&readset);

    /* This code restyled after FvwmIconMan, which is simpler.
     * The biggest advantage over the original approach is
     * having one fewer select statements
     */
    if (select(fd_width,SELECT_TYPE_ARG234 &readset,NULL,NULL,NULL) > 0) {

      if (FD_ISSET(x_fd,&readset) || XPending(dpy)) LoopOnEvents();
      if (FD_ISSET(Fvwm_fd[1],&readset)) ReadFvwmPipe();

    }

  } /* while */

Hope this helps,
Tim.

Hangs the server?  Ouch.

Do you have a reproducable problem you can provide a small, detailed
test case for (the follow focus thing, for example)?

Hmm.  System config error?  Do you have the latest gdb?  Did you compile

Can you try attaching to the running FvwmWinList process, then using it

Does replacing that code solve the server hangs (I could see it; maybe
the server thinks FvwmWinList has a grab but FvwmWinList lost an event?)
and/or the core dumps?

My mistake. It was fvwm that was hanging. An XFlush() just before the select
nicely fixes my problems.

It seems that select() is only setting one bit in &readset.  I put a load of
printf's in and only one of ReadFvwmPipe() and LopOnEvents() is called per select.
Without  the XFlush() the event loop doesn't keep up and eventually fvwm stalls
waiting for it's pipe to FvwmWinList to get emptied.

Cheers,
Tim.

Another update:

The addition of the XFlush fixes the fvwm hanging problem.
I'm getting a crash in ReadFvwmPipe when I pop up a transient.

# This file is a shell script that caches the results of configure

# scripts and configure runs.  It is not useful on other systems.
# If it contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
#
# By default, configure uses ./config.cache as the cache file,
# creating it if it does not exist already.  You can give configure
# the --cache-file=FILE option to use a different cache file; that is
# what configure does when it calls configure scripts in
# subdirectories, so they share the cache.
# Giving --cache-file=/dev/null disables caching, for debugging configure.
# config.status only pays attention to the cache file if you give it the
# --recheck option to rerun configure.

He might not have a core file because he's set his core file limit to zero
(I do, when I'm not doing a lot of debugging, as I tend not to want to
leave twenty meg netscape cores lying around ... ).

Unless his sysadmin has set a hard limit for core files (and few do), then
temporarily putting

    unlimit core

in some shell file that gets sourced before exec'ing fvwm (.xsession,
.cshrc, .zshenv, wherever), should allow the core to happen.

Alternately, trussing or attaching a debugger to the process once it's
started (like Paul suggested) will give you some idea of where it dies.

Hi,
In regards to WinList disappearing, I installed fvwm 2.1.10 in an attempt
to resolve the problem.  WinList now stays up, but the buttons
don't react properly.  When I press a button, the window comes to the
front, but the button does no stay depressed.  Pressing it a second
does cause the button to stay depressed.

Another problem I experienced is that 'xpmroot' did not compile, therefore,
I've lost my pictured icons.  During configure, I received message:
     Xpm library version is too old!

'xpmroot' compiled for fvwm 2.0.046 and 2.1.7.  I am compiling on Solaris
2.6 with gcc 2.7.2.1.

Regards,
Joe Prosser

Oh sorry, I thought I had told you: if FvwmWinList has exited because
of a signal it received it does not necessarily need to leave a core.
In the meantime signal handling has been enhanced in this module.
Please try if you get the same bug with 2.1.10 (should be out today).

Hmm, if 2.1.10 does not work also I'll have a look at the changes.

Thanks

Some notes from the Apache folks about the issues and
gotchas with DSOs (i.e. - gmodules!), going into some
specifics - quite useful/interesting, and of increasing
relevance as we add more gimp functionality courtesy of
gmodules rather than the old traditional plugins.

Now I'm reaaly confused. The crash happens in malloc()! specifically
malloc() thats called to make space for the read of a message from fvwm,
from safemalloc(), from ReadFvwmPacket().

I'm off for the weekend so nothing more from me 'til Monday.
Cheers,

Probably your Xpm library is too old.  This check was just added in
2.1.8 or so.

You need at least Xpm 3.4f in order to have fvwm run correctly.  If you
think you do have that or better, examine your xpm.h file and make sure
it has the right version info in it (maybe you installed a new Xpm
library but forgot to install the new header or something?)

If you need a newer version of Xpm you can find them under
ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/ somewhere.

How much space is it trying to alloc?

DOH!!!!

Change this line:

 Mallocs.c:54:  *string = saferealloc(*string,strlen(value+1));
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^

to this:

 Mallocs.c:54:  *string = saferealloc(*string,strlen(value)+1);
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^

*sigh*.

Hmm.  I wouldn't say that's the biggest issue at all!  Maybe I'm
misreading the FAQ entry and what it gives you.

Using ALT-TAB to select the third window in Windows:

  * press ALT with thumb
  * press TAB 3 times with middle finger (that's what I use)
  * release ALT

Typically less than a second.

Using the FAQ method in FVWM:

  * press ALT-TAB
  * move hand to arrow keys, press down arrow twice
  * move hand to ENTER key, press ENTER

Significantly longer!  And it only gets worse the further down your
window is.

The advantage to the windows method is you're only using two keys
(really, only one since ALT is just held down) and one hand.  In FVWM
you're scootching your hand all over, or else using both.  Quite a bit
inferior, IMO.

Not quite sure what you mean here.  I'm talking about selecting other
windows, as quickly and efficiently (fewest keystrokes/hand
motions/mouse motions/etc.) as possible.

Even taking an extra trip around the window list is, to me, faster or at
least simpler than moving my hand between various sets of keys like
that.  Besides, I've played so many video games in my life that I rarely
miss the first time, even going at full speed :)

I'm not sure if you missed my point or not.  Just to be sure...

WinXX implements Alt Tab right out of the box.

We want a user to notice the missing behavior, figure out they have
to read the FAQ, decide which of 3 different choices are the correct one,
read the fvwm2 man page to find out which file to edit, figure out where
in the file the command belongs...

All because we didn't add a line or 2 to the fvwm2 startup logic.

        I was reading the fvwm manpage, specifically the section
titles "THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP", and ran across what I think is outdated information.

It says:

     There is currently no way to cause a window to  map  onto  a
     desktop other than the currently active desk, or is there...
 
     A geometry specified as something like:
 
          xterm -geometry -5-5
 
     will generally place the window's lower right hand corner  5
     pixels from the lower right corner of the visible portion of
     the screen. Not all applications support  window  geometries
     with negative offsets.
 

Shouldn't this be removed, or replaced with a reference to
StartsOnDesk?  Or is this just talking about using -geometry to place
windows.  If that is the case, I would make that explicit and add a
reference to StartsOnPage and StartsOnDesk.  

Maybe add something like:

        fvwm itself can influence the starting positions of some or all
        windows, through the StartsOnPage and StartsOnDesk Style
        options.

Yes, that's a bummer.

But I maintain the _larger_ bummer is that, no matter what obscure
contortions the user goes through, he/she cannot get the functionality
in the end anyway.

That's my point :).

I think this bit is almost always attached to the GPL since most
folks don't care about removing it. Anyway, I don't care either.
I've removed it and corrected the other problem.

I know it's a drag, but these winlist problems are too severe to let out
IMO.

I don't want to make another beta until the rest of the issues are
resolved.  I don't use fvwmwinlist so I'm hoping Chris R (who made the
signal changes) or someone else is going to look into this ASAP...

OK, so the unresolved issues with FvwmWinList are? From what I've
seen, I made a small typo in the Mallocs.c file for FvwmWinList and
that has been found and fixed. The other issue revolved around the
event loop, which I'm not sure I follow - the loop logic is identical
to the logic in FvwmIconMan, which I use constantly without trouble.

Can someone post a quick summary and I'll look into it,
Cheers,
Chris.

But doesn't this mean that it's still FvwmWinList's fault for not
emptying its input queue? fvwm seems to be the innocent victim.

This is my output from "make clean" - why is target "clean-am" being
executed? The only dependency that "clean" has is "clean-recursive",
and that doesn't depend on "clean-am" either.

I am using make 3.77

It woule be nice to be able to have some different color, font, or
something to denote windows that have a geometry in the current viewport
(that is, are visible).  Somewhat like FvwmWinListFocus... but for all
of the windows on the current desk/page/viewport.

thanks

Unfortunately I don't follow it and I don't use this module either, but
both Tim and Dan see it so I don't think it should be too difficult to
reproduce.

Hi,
I have examined the select() in FvwmWinList and have created the
following diff. Can anyone who has trouble with FvwmWinList test this
patch out, please? For extra credit, can you try it both with and
without the new XFlush() calls in fvwm2 as well? The calls to XFlush
worry me because I think this would allow a slow module to miss
events.

Cheers,
Chris.

	Wow! This section is definitely out of date. I'll have a go
at it.

If the changes from the 2.1.10 beta are small enough,
and well understood,
couldn't we skip another beta?

Of course we don't know how many bugs will surface yet or
how likely the fixes are to create new problems.

The fix to FvwmWinList/Mallocs.c was really trivial.
I don't see why another beta would be needed for that
one.

I'll try to do some FvwmWinList testing this weekend.
The hangs I got were NOT consistent.

Well, I  have to start by saying,  my bug report was  pretty bad  so I
want to clear it up.

For some reason, I start FvwmWinList like this:

AddToFunc ConfigWinList "I" module FvwmWinList
+                       "I" Recapture

AddToMenu "Modules" "%mini.window.xpm%&WinList"	ConfigWinList

So something  hangs, but I can't say  if its FvwmWinList or Recapture,
or the  combination of both.    What I see  when it  does  hang is  an
incomplete Recapture and FvwmWinList hasn't appeared yet.

I was able  to  get  the FvwmWinList  plus  Recapture to  hang   after
applying the  FvwmWinList  patch  from Chris.   A number  of  attempts
failed  until I created about  10 windows.   Even  then it wasn't very
consistent.  (Once out of 5 tries so far.)

So  far, I  haven't  seen any  hang  trying  just FvwmWinList  or just
Recapture.

I haven't tried the extra credit XFlush() yet.

I'm pretty sure I've seen this symptom in releases long before 2.0.46.
I've always started FvwmIconBox like this:

AddToFunc ConfigIconBox "I" module FvwmIconBox
+                       "I" Style     "*"  NoIcon
+                       "I" Recapture

In this case, the Recapture makes sense, and I'm pretty sure it hung
on occasion, although right now it won't.  So I think this may not
be a new problem.

when i change the values of "#define DARKNESS_FACTOR" and "#define

the XORed "boxes" draws themselves _very_ odd..

What platform are you using? CPU type and speed? libc.so.? OS? I have
created a ConfigWinList function of my own and haven't been able to
reproduce the hang yet. The intermittent nature of the problem
suggests a race condition of some sort.

This doesn't look like it has anything to do with FvwmWinList.

I got a stack trace while fvwm2 was hung:

Its interesting to note that both Recapture() builtins.c:4656 and
CaptureAllWindows() fvwm.c:676 call MyGrabServer.  It looks like
the server is grabbed by fvwm2 for the duration of a recapture.

During  recapture processing,   windows  get iconified.   If you  have
FvwmAnimate running,    like  I    do,   fvwm2  attempts   synchronous
communications   with   FvwmAnimate.  When    FvwmAnimate gets Iconify
messages, it attempts to grab the server.

It seems to me like thats enough to explain the hang.

I'm not sure why  recapture needs a  server grab, why it  doesn't hang
every  time, why windows  are   iconified during recapture  (they  are
already iconified).

Back to the code.  Oh, its midnight.  How am I going to sleep with
this one still unresolved?  Not well.

	Ouch!

	Well, it's reparenting all the windows back to root, and then
reparenting them all back to itself again.

	Is a puzzlement....

	This may be an artifact from a time before there was a Re-
capture, when this code was only used at startup and restart. When
we reparent back to root, we deiconify iconified windows. Hmm...
you're right, it's too late to follow this train of thought too far
right now.

These kinds of problems are definitely too involved to resolve before
2.2 goes out.

What we need to decide is if there are issues with the new signal
handling of FvwmWinList such that we would be better off with the old
code.  The core dump problem has been resolved.  What about the other
problems Tim et. al. were seeing?  Are these "known" problems, or new
(Tim seemed to think they were new)?  Are they fixed (insofar as they
worked before) by Chris's suggested changes?

What's the best way to move forward to releasing 2.2 ASAP?

    According to the man page for FvwmPager:

      "Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window
      will cause that window to be move to the location where
      you release the mouse button, but your viewport will not
      change."

    This behavior is broken in the recent 2.1.x betas. When the
button is released at the end of the drag, FVWM switches the
viewport to the page where the dragged window is located, as
though the window had just been clicked, not dragged. (This is
trivial to fix - 2 spots in x_pager.c need the Focus call
bracketed with "if (! moved) {...}".)

    The button 2 click action in the Pager has changed: whether
this is broken or not is open to debate. In 2.0.46, simply clicking,
not dragging, would transfer focus to the clicked window (if it was
on the current desk, but a different page), but would not move the
viewport. Now the viewport is moved.

    I don't consider it reasonable for this behavior to be
unconditional: it should be an option. I rarely use this feature,
but if I do, I'm more likely to want to give the focus to a window
that is off-screen, while keeping the viewport where it is, than
to want to change pages. (There's nothing wrong with giving an off-
screen window the focus, as long as it's a deliberate user action -
there are times when it can be quite useful.)

    I think a post-2.2 enhancement is in order, to allow the user
to choose viewport warping or not.

Well, from my perspective, the signal handling strategy is the same
across all the modules I've tinkered with - it "bugs" me to hear
reports of problems in just one module. Not that I'm eager to hear of
core-dumps in everything else either ... :-)

However, there's another (unrelated) tweak I'd like to make to both
FvwmWinList and FvwnIconMan, but I can't post the patch until this
matter is satisfactorily resolved. Which reminds me, the "experimental
fix" for FvwmWinList needs applying to FvwmIconMan too.

On an (apparently? ;-)) unrelated note, is there a standard MAX(a,b)
macro already provided by FVWM? I know it's totally trivial to write,
but why duplicate code?

Cheers,
Chris.

After sleeping on it, the fix I've come up with is,

1. Change the grab count in libs/Grab.c to an extern.
2. In modules.c, if broadcasting M_ICONIFY to a lockonsend
module and the grabcount is not zero, don't send anything.

It seems to  me like a fairly  safe change.  Since its  for lockonsend
modules only, it could  only break FvwmAnimate,  and then, only if the
grabcount is off.

I won't commit anything without agreement.

Anyone else see this:

I have a keybinding for creating iconfied rxvts.

Key s R C Exec exec rxvt -iconic

I use this placment style:

Style "*" ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement

When there isn't   room  to place  the  full size   window, I  get   a
rubberband  and have to hit  return for the  icon to be created.  Even
worse, the  icon  is often placed  offscreen, depending  on  where the
rubberband is.

This  doesn't happen with  2.0.46.  I'm  not sure  when it surfaced in
2.1.x.  I think its pretty bad.

	Mea culpa. I broke this when I "fixed" the "StartsOnPage doesn't
work with -iconic" problem. Obviously, the non-StartsOnPage + -iconic
cases need to follow the old code path.

	I'll be happy to commit the fix if we have a consensus that this
should override the code freeze. (I vote yes.)

	I'd like to test it a bit more while waiting for the votes to
come in.

	This sounds good to me. Nobody really needs to know about the
Iconify, because we aren't actually changing the position or iconic state
of the windows during a Recapture - they're going to end up just like
they were. But, just to be safe, limiting this to lockonsend modules
sounds like a good idea.

	By the way, in order to try to satisfy both your case and
the "I want StartsOnPage to work with -iconic" case, a compromise
has to be made. To insure that the old handling obtains (don't
get fancy with placement if the window is starting iconic) *and*
you have a StartsOnPage + -iconic window that falls back to
ActivePlacement  --  got all that?  --  you'll need to add
GlobalOpts ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage to your .fvwm2rc.

I think   so.  I currently only   plan to use  starts  on page for non
iconic windows.  I take it that

 "GlobalOpts ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage"

would also cause the undesirable behavior I observed?

I  would, of  course, vote  for  inclusion of the fix,  since starting
windows iconic is something I do frequently.  I think I mentioned that
the rubberband outline  had a penchant for  appearing near the edge of
the screen, so that when I hit  return, the icon  and its window ended
up on the wrong page.  (I find the bug really bad.)

Fvwm2 should have a way to bind movements of the mouse pointer to the
keyboard.
That way Fvwm2 users could work without a mouse.

Theoretically, achieving this configuration should be possible since with
menus that stick to to the root window one can move the pointer to
anywhere
within the viewable area. Hence there must be a way to implement a similar
mechanism
in a more general setting.

	No, prevent it under certain cirsumstances. I made
ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage the default (maybe it should be
the other way around) so that StartsOnDesk + SkipMapping would continue
to interact with ActivePlacement the way it always used to: you would
place on the current desk with the rubber band, release it, and poof! -
the window would be whisked off to the desk you specified in StartsOnDesk,
possibly leaving you scratching your head wondering what happened.

	This feechur, in combination with the fix for StartsOnPage
windows to start iconic on the desired page, would cause the undesirable
behavior you observed with a StartsOnPage window, even with my fix in
place. That's why you'd need ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage (or
we'd need to change the default - any votes on that one?).

	If I can get it working cleanly in time...it's still doing a
couple of flaky things that I have to track down.

	This is a bug, in the sense that the change unintentionally broke
the way FVWM used to handle starting a window iconic - and also in the
sense that I doubt that anybody in his right mind would really want it
to operate this way. But, technically, the behavior is not a bug: it's the
logical result of all the options you have coming together at the same
time.

	- ActivePlacement implies that you're expected to take some action
to determine where the window will be placed, not just hit enter.

	- The upper left hand corner of the rubber band will appear
wherever your mouse cursor happens to be. Hitting enter (or Button1
clicking) says "this position's just fine with me" - even if the window
is mostly off the screen (I sometimes deliberately position a window this
way).

	- Since the window is mostly off the screen, it is viewed as more
*on* a different page than the one you're viewing, and that's the one
where the icon is getting placed.

	Now I rather doubt that anyone's ever really wanted things to
happen this way. I imagine that's why (or at least one of the reasons why)
FVWM adopted the policy of bypassing all of the fancy placement stuff for
a window that starts iconic, and just dumping the icon on the current
desk/page. Unfortunately, I broke that.

	Now, if I can only figure out what my fix to the fix just
unfixed...

	OK, the fix looks good now. It didn't break something else,
but in testing I stumbled over a condition where StartsOnPage in
conjunction with Dan's setup, would place the window improperly
(usually off the desktop altogether) because of double incrementing
for the page offset.

	So, the proposed code change does the following:

	1. Fixes Dan's problem.
	2. Fixes the double increment bug in StartsOnPage.
	3. Changes the default from ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
	   to ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage. I don't think anyone
	   will much like the old behavior if they happen across it.

	If the vote is yea, I'll commit the changes tomorrow evening
(I can't do CVS from the office).

Yes.  It is called "max" ("min" also exists).  Look in acconfig.h; this
code ends up in config.h, so you have max, min, and abs as long as you
#include "config.h".

Hi,
This patch is basically a rehash of the one I posted earlier, except
that it has one extra feature: it doesn't use GetFdWidth().

The reason for not using GetFdWidth() is that this function is written
to return the MAXIMUM number of open descriptors for a process. For
Linux 2.2.0, this is 1024. However, all we really need is "1 + highest
descriptor number", and for FvwmWinList we only have two descriptors
to choose from.

>From an aesthetic point of view, this also removes a global variable.

I see this patch as a "potentially minor efficiency improvement" - it
can probably wait for 2.2 but I would recommend it. (Similarly for
FvwmIconMan.) It successfully compiles and runs on my system (for what
it's worth)

Cheers,
Chris.

  Just thought I'd better mention this before fvwm2 fully stabalises - I
compile up on Sparc/Solaris 2.4 which doesn't have a strings.h (only
string.h). However, FvwmAnimate.c & FvwmConfig's WinBase.C try to use it &
fail compilation as a result.

  Minor, I know, but ISTRT configure checks for strings.h so it ought to
be possibly to let it fix these files too.

	Hello all.

	Finally I got it all work but I had to rewrite the select() code to have
it work nearly as expected by the various uses in fvwm. 
	As stated earlier, I did all the tricks with version 2.1.4 and then 
reported them on 2.1.7, and it did it.
	So here it the quick list of modifications :
		config.h : from config.h.in, specific to VMS port.
		vms.c/vms.h : new sources for VMS port (VMS_msg(), 
VMS_select_pipes(), VMS_SplitCommand())
		fvwm.c : comment fcntl() call on x_fd.
		module.c : comment the closepipes of child process
		           comment the exit() call when exec fails
		misc.c : comment the fvwm_msg function.
		picture.c : add some code to manage the image names.
		fvwmpager.c : new VMS_select_pipes() function create some false 
lost X events. Comment the miss-counter usage.
		fvwmwinlist.c : add an XFlush() call after in the 
RedrawWindows() function.

	Fab.

This fixes my problems with FvwmWinlist not following focus changes.
This is without the extra Xflush calls in fvwm2.

Great! Just as a matter of interest, though: did you ever see a
similar problem with FvwmIconMan? Because that's where the broken
event-loop code was lifted from. (I'll create a patch for FvwmIconMan
too)

Cheers,
Chris.

FvwmIconMan, FvwmWinList and FvwmButtons also call XGrabserver, the
first two do it as part of the growing upwards stuff.  They both go wild
during a recapture and so there probably is a danger of one of them
stalling and causing fvwm to lock up.  Is there a way of getting
XGrabServer to fail if the server is already grabbed? Maybe the
MyXGrabserver() for fvwm should broadcast a message when grabbing and
the modules MyXGrabServer()'s should not do the grab.

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't see anything in the man pages about having XGrabServer fail if
its already grabbed.

I'm not sure  if  its necessary for  the  modules to know  about fvwm2
doing a grab.  It would seem to me like a case by case thing.

I don't think the  grabs have anything to   do with the  modules going
wild during recapture.  If they were doing a grab, they would just sit
there until the recapture was done, and then go wild.  I think its the
flood of  messages   into the module  that  causes  them to  go  wild.
Perhaps the messages shouldn't   be  sent during recapture,  (to   any
module), but that  sounds to me like something  we would want to think
about after 2.2.

The lockonsend thing is the key  part, fvwm2 tries to tell FvwmAnimate
that it iconified something, then waits for FvwmAnimate to say that it
got  the iconify  message.  FvwmAnimate won't  acknowledge the message
until it can grab the server and do the animation.

I've never seen this problem with FvwmIconMan and I run it all the
time.  The event loop might be the same but there must be some
difference elsewhere that prevents the problem in FvwmIconMan.  I
wouldn't just create a patch unless you figure out what the difference
is and FvwmIconMan has a real bug lurking.

Your best bet is to get your XServer to do this for you. Although fvwm
could have a command to move the mouse based on key presses it would be
next to useless for mouseless operations because it will never be able
to send mouse button presses reliably.

I vote for:

Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry
Key Tab A C WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

to be added to the startup defaults. No need for a beta for this just
stick it in before 2.2.

The right answer is for these .c files to not include any of those
standard headers.

The config.h file includes the proper ones for you; just put it at the
top.  It will include stdlib.h, string{,s}.h, memory.h/malloc.h,
sys/types.h, unistd.h, and allow the use of memcpy and memmove on all
systems.

I think it's up to Dominik to decide how to proceed.  I changed the heap
corruption bug because it was a completely trivial fix to a serious bug
and I didn't think it would absolutely require another beta (or, perhaps
just a very, very short one).

I agree that these other problems that are coming to light are also
serious (to those using FvwmWinList and recapture, at least) but the
fixes aren't as obvious and trivial.  My opinion is they would require
another beta, if anyone is asking.

So, this is where the pumpking comes in: how do we move forward?

You forgot about the hot keys (it's the last sentence in the paragraph
that describes the method above). To get the third window

Press Alt-tab
Press 2 (very close to Tab)

It gets better the further down your window is: 3 keys to get to any of
the first 36 windows.

You can get a 33% reduction in keypresses by binding KP_Enter or KP_Tab
to the windowlist command and using the keypad numbers to get to the hot
keys (you may need Num Lock on depending on your server). 2 keys to get
to the first ten, 4cm maximum spacing on my keyboard and right handed
too!  Obviously it's not Alt-tab but I don't think anyone could not
learn the new location.

Problems I have with the windows style are:
1) You can't let go of ALT without something happening.
2) Going back is hard to type (I mean alt-shift-tab when your thumb is
on alt)
3) When you have more than one Nestcape page open you have to tab over
them to
   see which one is which.
4) It doesn't handle multiple desktops.
5) It doesn't indicate iconified windows.
6) No hot keys.

Nice things:
1) It handles modal transients nicely.

Cheers,
Tim.

True.  Maybe it's just me, but I find it much quicker to have TAB moving
the cursor and drawing my eye along until it hits the window I want,
than having to look down the list on my own, note the hotkey associated
with it, then find it on the keyboard and hit it.

I can tap that ALT key pretty durn fast :).

As Dan noted, I just circle around.  It's simpler.  Of course, on a
Winblows system I rarely have more than 6-8 apps running: maybe now that
I just got a new system I'll have more and be more frustrated by this.

However, I rarely miss ;).

  tp> 6) No hot keys.

All true, but of lesser importance to me.

I'm not saying Windows ALT-TAB can't be improved on, I'm just saying
that at the moment what we have for fvwm isn't good enough (IMHO, of
course :).

Cool.  I'm glad someone took over tkgoodstuff.  I used it for a while
until the bugs just bugged me too much (and FvwmButtons got some
enhancements).

I'll have to give it a whirl again.

Perhaps you are referring to the change I just committed?
I'll remove it if I get enough negative feedback.  It really does
seem safe to me.

I took  Bob's comment "This  sounds good to  me." as  approval for the
change in the release.

Me neither. I think it just waits until it can get the grab. It's this
that I was worried about.

This is exactly what happens.  The recapture completes (the window
frames get redrawn) and the FvwmWinList processes the flood of
messages.  It probably got the first message, decided to resize itself,
called XGrab, (which waits for fvwm to ungrab), does the XMoveResize,
then it can do the rest of the messages.

I'm happy with your fix for this but I was a bit concerned that fvwm
might hang in recapture due to FvwmWinList not emptying its read pipe. I
haven't seen it hang so maybe it's not a problem.

The messages from fvwm to the modules happen while fvwm has the server
grabbed. Is it possible that a pausing FvwmWinlist might cause fvwm to
hang or can the message queuing stuff handle large message queues? If
the latter then I'm happy but when FvwmWinList was broken (the select
stuff) I had fvwm hangs. At least I'm fairly sure I did (focus didn't
change, couldn't pop up fvwm menus, pointer moved and cursor changed (so
it wasn't a server hang) and it only got going when I managed to get a
refresh event to FvwmWinList).

Cheers,
Tim.

I just haven't heard much from Dominik lately and I'm not sure what we
should be doing to push 2.2 out at this point :)

I hope Dominik is taking a well earned break.

If questions come up about what goes in or doesn't go in,
lets let fvwm-workers resolve it.

I think we need 2.1.10 to get a week or more of testing before
we decide on a beta or 2.2 as our next release.

I am running fvwm-2.1.10 on Solaris 2.5.1.

The problem I am seeing is this:  If I move the focus to an icon it pops to the
top as expected (I use FvwmAuto), but if I then move the focus to let's say a
xterm window behind this icon, the icon does not drop behind.  I can manually
"lower" the icon but should it not drop behind a newly focused window it self?

I looked through the man page for any "Style" changes that might have an effect
on this, but have found nothing.

Is anyone else have this problem.

On a side note.  Who, if anyone, is maintaining FvwmWharf?  I've been trying to
merge the newer AfterStep "Wharf" for use in fvwm2, but I am having a ton of
problems.  This version Wharf has some nice features including a "balloon"
option.

Thank you for any and all help.

I think its safe to say, FvwmWharf is in  our source tree, but none of
the current developers has taken a special interest in it.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.83.240.12)


Using the line :
Style "*" IconBox -130 0 -1 -65, IconFill b l
in my ~/.fvwm2rc file, I cannot, whatever combination and ordering of l, r,
t & b, 
(I have tried them all) make FVWM fill the iconbox from bottom to top or
from the
right hand edge of the screen.

Bottom to top plain does not work, and right to left sort of 0.25 works, in
that
l and r determine which order the icons are placed (they seem to have some
kind
of persistent ordering), but they still flush against the left edge of the
icon
box.

Subject: builds on IRIX 5.3, but fails to run on IRIX 6.2

Full_Name: Hvard Fosseng
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: IRIX 6.2
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.92.80)


My local machine, running IRIX 6.2, is not set up to build 
software. I do that on another computer running IRIX 5.3.

When building 2.1.10, "configure", "make" and "make install"
all had exit status 0. The only thing that on the face of it
seemed suspicious was the following output from "configure":

checking for Xpm 3.4f or better...  9814:./conftest: rld: Fatal Error:
cannot map soname 'libXpm.so.4.11' using any of the filenames
/usr/lib/libXpm.so.4.11:/lib/libXpm.so.4.11:/lib/cmplrs/cc/libXpm.so.4.11:/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/libXpm.so.4.11:
-- either the file does not exist or the file is not mappable (with reason
indicated in previous msg)
no

(Note, however, that configure continued running and finished
with exit status 0.)

When trying to run what I had built (on IRIX 6.2), I got the
following message:

22704:/usit/sauron/u4/havardf/bin/fvwm2: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot
Successfully Map soname 'libSM.so.6.0' under any of the filenames
/usr/lib/libSM.so.6.0:/usr/lib/internal/libSM.so.6.0:/lib/libSM.so.6.0:/lib/cmplrs/cc/libSM.so.6.0:/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/libSM

Both the computer where I built 2.1.10 and the computer where
I tried to run them had files named "/usr/lib/libSM.so".

On the 5.3 computer:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       823380 May 21  1995 /usr/lib/libSM.so

On the 6.2 computer:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       798544 May  9  1998 /usr/lib/libSM.so


I successfully built and ran 2.1.7 on the same combination of computers.
I guess you will need more information, but short of including the entire 
ouput from "configure", "make" and "make install" I don't know what
will be helpful.

I already closed this problem report with a note as to why.
I expected it to send mail...There must have been something I forgot
to click on.

As it should, although you won't be happy with the result.
It couldn't "map?" the Xpm library so you won't be able to display
Xpms.  Make sure the XPM library is installed and executable by
you.  You may have to make configure look for it in a special place.
Try "./configure --help" for more information.

Its looking for libSM.so.6.0, you don't say anything about its presence.

I'd like to discuss if we should split off the modules from the
fvwm2 distribution. It seems this large package causes unnecessary
trouble.

pros:

 - smaller package (well, not really)
 - no need to create fvwm2 packages if a module is buggy and vice
   versa

cons:

 - people will possibly use incompatible versions. This can in
   part be prevented by checking if the module package has a
   compatible version info when compiling
 - we'd have to be careful not to make disruptive changes
   without updating the version info for the modules/fvwm2

I don't generally pass on notices of bug manipulation to the list, just the

It has. Try the CursorMove command:

  Key Left  A S CursorMove -1 0
  Key Right A S CursorMove +1 0
  Key Up    A S CursorMove +0 -1
  Key Down  A S CursorMove +0 +1

Something to consider for the future, perhaps.  Probably our
oft-expressed desire to remove some of the modules is A Good Thing, and
a good start.

However, I think some belong with the core Fvwm.  Should we make
FvwmPager separate?  Or FvwmAuto?  Or FvwmWinList or FvwmButtons?  I
think those modules are so often used they should come with the core.
Ditto for other things in "modules".

And remember that some modules, and more in the future, require others
to work (right now FvwmAnimate requires FvwmForm).

In general, I'd only think a split a good idea if it was to remove
things that we really think hardly anyone uses.  If it's just to avoid
more frequent releases or decrease download time, then personally I
think the hassle of always having to get (and create, etc.) two packages
instead of one outweighs the problems, so far.

But should this "only" mean that fvwm will be built without XPM support?

On the computer where I built it:

$ /local/gnu/bin/find /lib /usr/lib -follow  -iname \*libsm\* 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/libSM.so
/usr/lib/libSM.a

On the computer where I tried to run it:

$ /local/gnu/bin/find /lib /usr/lib -follow  -iname \*libsm\* 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/libSM.so


Is the non-presence of /usr/lib/libSM.a on my desktop computer likely to
be the culprit?

Please use "ls -l /usr/lib/libSM.so".  Is this really a symlink to some

Do the same on the system where it doesn't work; is it a different

Not likely, no.

I vaguely remember some discussion about that. Perhaps the default
behaviour has been changed? Can anyone refresh my memory on this?

I just noticed that the mails I send from work don't get
through to the list. There seems to be some trouble with
our network.

> I hope Dominik is taking a well earned break.

I am. At the moment I feel very tired. And my kittens have a way
of letting me know they don't like it whe I spend my evenings before
the machine. Seeing this amount of bugs coming up when we thought
it would be only a week or so to 2.2 makes me scream. Seems we're
close to going back into development mode. 

I have completely lost track of open problems, but I am
aware of two things that should be done:

1) Apply the same fix to FvwmIconMan that repaired FvwmWinList.
   If I'm talking rubbish just tell me, I didn't the discussion
   about FvwmWinList thoroughly.

2) Remove that code that changed mouse button 2 for FvwmPager.
   I remember vaguely I worked on mouse buttons in the pager,
   but the ChangeLog says it was button 3. One thing I could
   imagine is that this slipped in when I applied the Red Hat
   patches (I checked the ones I still have on my disk but
   found nothing). There's a suspicious amount of patches
   between 2.1.4 and 2.1.7.

> If questions come up about what goes in or doesn't go in,

Yes. One thing I have learned on my way from a green fvwm2
development newbie (is it really just three month?) to the
battle scarred bug hunting veteran is that things are still
happening even if I am away for a while. I think I will
relax another week (at least until I'm through the Protoss
campaign in Star Craft ;-) ) and come back with renewed
energy then. I.e. I won't write a lot of mails or fix bugs.

We should not forget we already did it before, and get back again.

People tends to say "yeah, why this package doesn't have module XXX ?"
IMHO, it's not a smart way, if it is just for "small tarball" and/or
"avoid to bundle buggy module".

Yes, splitting the fvwm-core version and fvwm-modules version is maybe 
a better way, however, I believe we must say "hey, which version of
fvwm-modules should I fetch, for fvwm-core version 2.X.X ?"

Again, we should not forget we already did it before. I'm afraid that
easy package spliting brings us an unwanted confusion.

Thanks,

That works...

Now, I have a standard 104-key keyboard.
I would like to be able to use the keypad on the right exclusively for 
this purpose. My keypad looks like this:

Num /   *   -

7   8   9   +
            +
4   5   6   +

1   2   3   E
            n
zero  .     t

I would like the buttons to do the following:

/*8 up
9 up-right
6 right
3 down-right
2 down
1 down-left
4 left
7 up-left

5 mouse 1
Zero mouse 2
. mouse 3

Is this possible?

These keypad bindings must however not affect the behavior of parts of 
the keyboard out of the keypad.

Is this possible?

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

... and what about mouse clicks. Can I bind them to the 
keys F1, F2, and F3?

It looks like it will soon be time to get rid of this mouse ;-)

	I think it should. Can you tell us what was the last release you used
that didn't exhibit this behavior? It would be a great help if we can get an
idea when it crept in.

	Without any further investigation, I would suspect that Matthias and
I introduced this, um, feechur, with the "don't raise above override-redirect
windows" fix. It's the only recent change I'm familiar with that might have
caused this, but I'm not sure how.

	I'll look into it.

Hi,
There seems to be some debate about whether FvwmIconMan needs
patching; anyway, here is the patch (in clear-text so that more people
have a chance to spot any silly typos). Your call, Dominik ;-) .

CHANGES:
* Move XPending() in the main event loop so that it always gets
called. This keeps X-events flowing through the pipes.
* Don't use GetFdWidth() because it potentially adds a lot of overhead
to the select() call. This change requires a max(a,b) macro.
* Add siginterrupt() calls to signal code (if we're not using
sigaction())

I have tested this module by creating > 10 windows, and fvwm2 didn't
coredump or hang or anything. (However, it DID fail to completely
erase an odd button when I had so many windows that the icon-manager
switched to 2-column mode.)

Cheers,
Chris.

	Well, out of a total of 2 precincts reporting (mine and
Dan's), the vote is 100% in favor of committing the fix.

	I'd feel a little more comfortable about it if we had a
couple more votes, though. What do you think, Dan - should we assume
qui tacet consentire? Silence gives consent?

	In case anyone would like to look it over, I'm attaching the

	If this is in reference to bug reports 140 & 141, I'll
have a go at it. I'm not sure this was all caused by one simple
set of changes to Pager. I think there may have been a series of
changes, and not all to the Pager, that brought this on.

	The button2-drag-warps problem is easy to fix. I can commit
this right away, if you like. The button2-click-warps looks a
little more involved, and I'm not sure it's confined to the code
in Pager. I'll look into it, though.

	The other button2 issue mentioned recently - Pager tries to
give focus to a no-input window - isn't really a Pager issue. Depend-
ing on the Lenience setting, the focus code shouln't try to give
such a window the focus. I'm not sure whether that one was answered
satisfactorily - I don't recall any follow-up.

	Yup, that was the culprit! The new raise code didn't recognize
the case when the top of the stack was an icon window instead of the
app window frame.

	Attached is the diff to fix this. In case you haven't been
following the workers list too closely, 2.2 is under a code freeze,
meaning that only bug fix changes are allowed, and then by consensus
of the workers.

	So, cast your votes, folks. I vote for inclusion.

	Well, that one would fix the observable problem, but it wan't
quite the whole story. I didn't diff events.c, where the stacking
order chain rebuilder needed similar modification. Here's the full
fix...in-line this time. I'm not sure I trust what this funky mailer

Right.  I've got this patched on my sources now.  

As it passes criterion (1) of my previous message --- and it is a tiny
fix --- I'll argue that it merits inclusion before 2.2.  ;-)

The same goes for a small change I mentioned a while back that ought to
fix up the termcap/ncurses problem --with-libreadline.

I haven't been following the discussion of the last 2-3 days closely, and
I certainly don't know the code being discussed, so I'll defer to Bob and
Dan's judgement on this matter. 

But I have to say that all the code proposals being floated / committed
make me nervous.  Non-local changes, in particular, make me very nervous.

As for me, at this point, I'd include only fixes for bugs that: 

  1) cause a build failure,
  2) cause a coredump, or
  3) render the default setup unusable.

As I say, I haven't been following the grabbing and the
iconic/starts-on-window discussions closely enough to know whether they
pass test (3) or not.  If it causes a problem only to specialised setups,
maybe it can just be documented to be fixed in 2.0.1?

There has already been non-trivial changes to 2.1.10, with the grab stuff. 
I reckon we'd better have another beta -- particularly if the
iconic/starts-on-window stuff or any signal stuff goes in.

I've been using 2.1.10 for a while now and I think I've found an
(aesthetic) bug in the menu code. English is not my native language,
so I hope I can describe it accurately enough.

The bug appears when you have a gradiented menu with a (large enough)
submenu. Pop up the menu near the bottom of the screen, then go to the
submenu. This will display the submenu shifted upwards so that it fits
completly on the screen. So far so good.

Now, without going into the submenu, move your mouse up again (in the
parent menu) so that the submenu disappears again.

The parent menu will be redrawn, except for the part that was covered
because the submenu was moved upwards.

For the record: I'm using fvwm2.1.10 on an SGI O2 running IRIX6.3. My
.fvwm2rc file is attached to this mail.

Cheers,
-Ives

Only in part. The keys are called KP_n where n is the number.
However there's no command to bind mouse clicks and there is
no way to write one that really works: If fvwm2 creates its
own mouse events they are 'synthetic'. Many badly written
applications ignore synthetic events completely :(

I think it was me who reported this. I proposed to fix it by
changing the pager to send a "Focus" to fvwm instead of trying to
set the focus directly. That seemed to work nicely. I even sent
a patch for that.

The button2-drag-warps should definitely be fixed. I wonder how
this came in. The button2-click-warps problem is another
story however. As a developer I in fact use it most of the
time to give the focus to a window on another page (for testing).
But I think the average user has no need of focussing windows
off screen. This seems like an improvement to me (but it has to
be documented if we keep it this way). Matthias' reasoning that
sending fvwm2 a Focus command looks more logical seems right
to me too.

4) change behaviour that would be changed back after 2.2

I assisted a friend of mine to migrate from 1.24 to 2.1.7 and
he tried it. He was shocked by the colour choice (as I am) and
threw it away without having another look.

Put it in. It makes no sense to introduce new bugs/'features' that
get changed immediately after 2.2. This will only create confusion.

I can't reproduce this with 2.1.10. Are you sure this is the only
IconBox line in your .fvwm2rc.  If you are trying this interactively you
have to do a Recapture as it is a Style attribute.

Cheers,

	Great! Now I know where to look to fix bug # 141 (I think it
is), and we'll have all three squashed. I'll get to it this evening.

	I know it's disappointing, because we all want to get this
release out, but there's a lot of stuff that's just not quite right.
I agree with Dominik - let's not succumb to buck fever (fire - ready -
aim!), but take a few more days to fix these things we know will have
to be done right away.

Could we have FlipFocus instead of Focus?

I get this in 2.1.11 as well as 2.1.10.  (I've just gone to TrueColor so
it's only recently that I could try Gradients, even though they look
awful since I've only got 8 bits). It looks like the area to be redrawn
is not being calculated correctly when a popup isn't placed where
expected but moved onscreen.  I get problems with the menu items above
and below the popup item. They areas are drawn with a plain background
(probably by the server) and extend horizontally from the right hand
edge of the parent menu to the point where the submenu overlap stops
(PopupOffset controls this). This doesn't happen with plain menu
backgrounds and pixmaps, I haven't tried V/HGradients.

Another feature I found when messing with PopupOffset is that it is
ignored if the popup causes the parent menu to animate to make room for
the popup. Instead the default PopupOffset is applied. I have Emulate
MWM before the Menustyle options:

MenuStyle * Foreground Black, BackGround LightGrey, Greyed Grey,
ActiveFore Navy
MenuStyle * Hilight3DThick, Animation On, MenuFace TiledPixmap
PT_003.xpm
MenuStyle * PopupOffset -2 100, TitleWarp, TitleUnderlines1,
SeparatorsShort

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes from me, not being able to raise windows above icons is bad.

Can you hack in a bug report for the latter problem? I'll take
care of it.

I'm all for the fix just please remove the comment marks from the XRaiseWindow Line, if you leave it as is the eye tells me it is commented when it fact it isn't.

The grab stuff is  in category 2  or  3, any FvwmAnimate user  doing a
recapture would get a lockup.  A lockup is just as bad as a core dump.

If you do  diffs on the grab  changes, libs/Grab.c, fvwm/modules.c,  I
think you  will see that they  are  trivial.  I'm  less sure about the
iconic stuff.   I  am  aware  that changes  to   code  I don't   fully
understand seem more complex.

In the next few days, I'm starting a new project at work.
This may impact the time I can devote to fvwm2.

Yes, it's easier to split some stuff off (FvwmIconMan and FvwmCommand
were both being actively maintained outside the fvwm tree at one point
in the not so distant past).  Somebody can take over the development of
the individual modules, and they won't get bogged down by somebody
else's schedule.

The down side to this is that for each "package" that is maintained, the
user will have to download the distribution, configure it, and build it.
Now, for your average software hacker, this isn't a big deal, but as
more and more people start using Linux and other workstation and
server level machines, they are going to want distributions to be EASIER
to install, not more complicated.  Think how easy it is to install
software for those toy operating systems put out by a company in
Redmond.

Further, if you are going to split off just SOME of the modules, which
ones?  Here's the current (2.1.10) listing of the entries in the modules
directory:

FvwmAnimate    FvwmBanner     FvwmForm       FvwmM4         FvwmSaveDesk
FvwmAudio      FvwmButtons    FvwmIconBox    FvwmPager      FvwmScroll
FvwmAuto       FvwmCpp        FvwmIconMan    FvwmRearrange  FvwmTalk
FvwmBacker     FvwmEvent      FvwmIdent      FvwmSave       FvwmWinList

Which of these are you going to remove?  I personally use FvwmButtons,
FvwmPager, FvwmForm, FvwmIdent, FvwmM4, and FvwmTalk.  I doubt that my
particular choices, or anybody else's, could be considered universal.


Anyway, if there is a consensus to release the modules as a separate
distribution, then libfvwm.a in fvwm-2.2 should be renamed to
libfvwm-2.2.a, so that the modules can search for it at configure time
(or we might need to generate a ./fvwm-config script that will allow
the modules to test which version of fvwm is currently installed).

If we don't do this in 2.2, then I anticipate a possible versioning
problem in the future if you split out the modules.

My own opinion is, if the package is under 1.4M, (diskette sized),
the package isn't too big.

I know we are doing inadequate testing on some of the modules,
but putting them in a separate package will just make it worse.

I haven't had a chance to test any of the changes posted, but there is
an easy way to see an icon problem:

Create 2 XEmacs frames, iconify one, full screen the other.

The XEmacs icon will refuse to move under the full screen window.

It's a pain in the ass. You don't have under control what happens
and usually the software overwrites some dlls with other version
numbers that are already in use by other applications. The average
user won't compile fvwm2 himself anyway.

No, you misunderstand what I mean. I'd move *all* modules and extras
into the same new package. THis additional package would be an add on
to the core and not able to build anything. You'd have to untar it into
the same directory to build it at all. And we could easily check
consistency by giving the modules the same version number as the core.
Like this:

fvwm-2.2 and fvwmmodules-2.2 given

Then fvwm-2.w gets a bugfix and is called 2.2.0.1. The first three
digits are the same, so you can use both packages together.
The you have a fix in some modules and make fvwmmodules-2.2.0.1.
Still no probelm. Now we make some disruptive fixes in the core
and call it fvwm-2.2.1. Now the versions don't match anymore
and a fvwmmodules-2.2.1 will be created.

The version numbers look a bit odd, but IBM does this with
AIX and it works well.

All the user has to do in addition is to download and untar
another package. Anything else can be handle by automake (at
least I hope so).

No need to do this since the modules won't even compile separately.

Try doing "ls /usr/lib/libSM*".  You should see libSM.so.6 somewhere in
the output.  Here is a Solaris 2.6 example:

fork> ls -al /usr/lib/libSM*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root  12 Jul 07  1998 /usr/lib/libSM.so@ -> ./libSM.so.6
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root  25 Jul 07  1998 /usr/lib/libSM.so.6@ -> ../openwin/lib/libSM.so.6

    Probably just getting in a hurry at the last minute. It's an easy
fix - don't issue the Focus if moved - and I'll put this in this
evening.

    That's why I suggested that it be an option: FVWM needs to
keep both the power users and the average users happy. I'd like
to look at this this evening, but I think for 2.2 I'd be happy enough
with documenting the change. I'm not sure average users will
be using the Pager to set focus on windows, anyway, but you never
know...till you change something.

    I agree.

I don't know what to say, except rebuild it on the second and hopefully
it will work.

I don't understand why the loader is looking for libSM.so.6.0 if only
libSM.so exists, and why it finds it on one system but not the other.

But, anyway, this definitely seems to be an "interesting" quirk of your
operating system and not anything to do with fvwm (that I can see).

Perhaps there's a USENET group or something where you could ask this of
people familiar with your OS?

I've been using 2.1.10 for a while now and I think I've found an
(aesthetic) bug in the menu code. English is not my native language,
so I hope I can describe it accurately enough.

The bug appears when you have a gradiented menu with a (large enough)
submenu. Pop up the menu near the bottom of the screen, then go to the
submenu. This will display the submenu shifted upwards so that it fits
completly on the screen. So far so good.

Now, without going into the submenu, move your mouse up again (in the
parent menu) so that the submenu disappears again.

The parent menu will be redrawn, except for the part that was covered
because the submenu was moved upwards.

For the record: I'm using fvwm2.1.10 on an SGI O2 running IRIX6.3. My
.fvwm2rc file is attached to this mail.

MenuStyle * PopupOffset -40 100

If you pop up a menu at the right hand edge of the screen and then move
to an item with a popup submenu the parent will animate back too far and
the submenu will have used the default PopupOffset. Going off the item
and back will pop the submenu in the right position.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.202.174.12)
Submitted by: hippo


The WindowList menu has separators between desks. They are confusing when
the NoGeometry option is used as you can't see the reason for them.

Having NoGeometry ought to remove the separators, it would be nice if
NoGeometry DeskSort could put the desk titles between the different desk
lists

Sorry, I didn't mention I had already hacked in a bug
report for this one. I'll move it to duplicates.

No, that's what I want to avoid. There is no need to break the old
behaviour which may upset some people and then give it back with
a patch in a later version. It's better to do it in one step to
avoid confusion. I'd like to remove this fix for focussing no-focus
icons and do it right immediately after 2.2.

I sent this to the list yesterday but I don't think it made it, so I am sending
it again.  Sorry if it is duplicated.


I am running fvwm-2.1.10 on Solaris 2.5.1.

The problem I am seeing is this:  If I move the focus to an icon it pops to the
top as expected (I use FvwmAuto), but if I then move the focus to let's say a
xterm window behind this icon, the icon does not drop behind but stays on top. 
I can manually "lower" the icon but should it not drop behind a newly focused
window it self?

I looked through the man page for any "Style" changes that might have an effect
on this, but have found nothing.

Is anyone else have this problem.

On a side note.  Who, if anyone, is maintaining FvwmWharf?  I've been trying to
merge the newer AfterStep "Wharf" for use in fvwm2, but I am having a ton of
problems.  This version Wharf has some nice features including a "balloon"
option.

Thank you for any and all help.

This is a bug, and we're going to fix this and release a new beta before
2.2 (I think that's the decision) because of this and other more serious
problems in FvwmWinList.

No one is maintaining it.  If anyone wants to volunteer, please do so.
We're fixing it enough to build correctly, but no one (that I know of)
on the fvwm-workers list actually uses it so there're no enhancements
planned.

Note that the mail at att.com/lucent.com is incredibly screwed up.  It
drops a large portion of the mail on the floor; I have the bounces
killfiled now to avoid drowning in them.  I know the addresses really do
exist and get at least some of the mail, so I haven't removed them from the
list.

I wouldn't want to distribute the modules independently, only
separate from the fvwm2 core.

I was referring to this trouble with FvwmWinList: one obscure module
shows up a bug and we have to make a new beta for the complete
package. The decision about 2.2 would be much easier if we could
fix this in a separate package.

If my windows NT 4.0 workstation is set to more than 256 colors, very
often, when
clicked on one of the buttons of FvwmButtons, process crashes. Following is
what
appears on STDERR

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window

fvwm continues to run, however.
When ?I change colors back to 256, problem disappears.

With CVS sources of about five hours ago, I'm having a severe problem with
DGradient on a Solaris 2.7 box.  I'm not sure how to explain it ... if
anyone can tell me how to take a snapshot of a menu, I'd be grateful.
Basically, though, it's coming across in what looks like two colors, with
lines drawn in one color rather haphazardly across the menu.  This happens
for linear as well as nonlinear gradients.  Changing the number of steps
doesn't seem to help.  Horizontal and Vertical gradients are perfectly
smooth.

The line I'm using is

MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 2 grey50 50 grey70 50 grey60

I tried the examples in the manpage, but they had the same problem.

When I get home, I'll try to reproduce it on my Linux box.

Sorry for throwing this in so late; I haven't been keeping up with the code
base.

	Actually, it really *is* supposed to be commented out. I got in
a hurry trying to make the diff before I was really quite through. And
yes, it really does work correctly without the XRaiseWindow, which is
what we were trying to eliminate in the first place!

Try

sleep 5 ; xwd -root > snapshot.xwd

then popup the menu and wait.  You'll get a snapshot of your
whole screen with the menu included.

I noticed this while building the code I checked out on 23-Jan
(from scratch):

 # ./configure

runs as usual

 # make

produces this output:

cd . && aclocal
cd . && automake --gnu Makefile
cd . && autoconf
configure.in:159: warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow cross compiling

Configuration:

  FVWM Version:             2.1.11

  Build extra modules?      no
  Have ReadLine support?    yes
  Have RPlay support?       yes
  Have XPM support?         yes

cd . \

Seems like configure is unnecessarily called again from make.
Not very nice and a complete waste of time.

I've fixed the several bugs is menus (drawing gradient
menus and popup offset with animated menus). While doing
that I noticed the code was badly broken and I don't think
we can leave it this way in 2.2:

 - diagonal gradients with overlapping menus don't redraw
   correctly if you have backing store disabled

 - the logic for avoiding overlapping menus was complete
   trash (because I did not update it after the menu style
   changes).

I've attached a patch that I will commit on Wednesday night
if no objections arise (but I don't think so since these bugs
are really bad). The patch is against the CVS code I checked out
on 23-Jan, but I don't think that matters since the menu
code didn't change.

Bye

Let me make a guess: You have submenus that overlap the parent menu
and when you move the pointer up and down the menu you may end up
with some portions that were overlapped by the submenu coloured
plain gray (the colour that the menus would have without the gradient).

Correct?

If yes I fixed this one a couple of minutes ago and I think it
will go into 2.2

Sorry, not quite correct but sti probably doesn't matter:

I started patching against said CVS code, but the diff
is against the 2.1.10 file (forgot to backup the original
file).

If only it were that easy!  <grin>  No, I checked to make sure that wasn't
the problem.  It doesn't have anything to do with submenus or repainting.
Just plop a menu up on the screen, and it's colored all funny.  (I actually
don't see this bug at all.)

I'll try the new code tomorrow, though, just in case it happens to also fix
my bug.

Yup, I see this too - but it's not quite such a major pain in the butt
now that configure ignores the config.cache file when determining
whether or not to use ncurses. Previously it was creating correct
Makefiles for the first configure and then replacing them with
"termcap" ones: VERY frustrating.

Good.  At least we've established that it isn't just something growing on
my contacts.  Now if someone else can reproduce the problem I'll feel
better.

This only happens if make thinks your setup is out of date for some
reason.  It won't happen again after the first time (unless you changed
configure.in or something).

Once we remove the derived files like configure, etc. from the source
tree this should go away.

This is actually a feature: it's the thing that ensures all the derived
files are properly updated when you change something.  But, if the
timstamps on the derived files are out of whack, then it rebuilds.
Can't have one without the other, ya know! :)

	OK. Could you or Matthias lend a hand on this one, then?
I have no idea what the code looked like before the change.

Well, it seems to work just fine at home on my Linux box.  I'll try to
compile and run it on a Solaris 2.6 machine, and see if that makes any
difference.  If anyone else has a 2.7 box, though confirmation would be
nice.

Thanks,

Furthermore, it only happens with CVS sources.  If you unpack a tarball,
the timestamps are correct.

I didn't succeed. Some debugging showed that using gtk_menu_popup
in response to a packet sent from fvwm falls over when it tries
to grab the pointer... XGrabPointer returns AlreadyGrabbed. This
means that fvwm for some reason has the pointer grabbed while
it does SendStrToModule. Adding a call to UngrabEm at the
beginning of that function allows my module to pop up menus
as expected, but I wonder what is going on. 

Is fvwm expected to grab the pointer while communicating with
modules ?

I'm using LOCKONSEND to have the menu pop up immediately (as opposed to at the
next queue flush), if that matters.

This fixes the popupoffset/anim problem (bug 147) but something is very
wrong with the menu painting of D/BGradient, symptoms: Dgradients are
not painted at all; I get a mini-icon that belongs to the focussed
window in the top left of the window (not the actual pixmap but the
shape of it drawn in the first colour of the DGradient or the last
colour of the BGradient).

I had to apply the patch by hand as my patch program complained so maybe
I've missed something.  If you can't figure out what's going wrong with
me could you post your complete menus.c (or email it to me).

Anyway, nice work on the overlap stuff.
Cheers,
Tim.

    Depends on where you're invoking your code from. If you put
the hook in menus.c, popping up a menu is bracketed with a
grab and ungrab - it has nothing to do with modules. I would say
that if you're using module-menus rather than the built-ins, then
you want to bypass the grab & ungrab in do_menu.

    No; in fact, Dan has discovered that this can be hazardous to your
health.

    That's the condition that can be hazardous. (It's not the mere fact
of locking, per se, but the potential for setting up the classic
deadlock
condition that Dan uncovered, that is dangerous.)

I just tried it on my Solaris 2.5 machine and have the same problem,
or at least similar.  My menus appear horizontally stripped rather
than vertical, but it looks like the same problem.  I have the latest
CVS sources, compiled with Sun's acc compiler.  Not having looked at
the code at all, and given that it works on other systems, my first
thought is a missing prototype for some math function.

Hmm.  Maybe this is a stupid question, but are you sure it's not a
colormap issue?

Most of the Solaris systems I've seen have only an 8-bit videocard; it's
almost impossible to get decent gradients with only 256 colors, of which
many are taken up by pixmaps, etc.

Are you running at more than 8 bpp?  Are you getting any messages about
"can't alloc color" or similar from fvwm (or other apps you start)?

No, that isn't it.  I'm running on a machine with a 24-bit display.
Also horizontal and vertical gradients work fine, its just the
diagonal ones that have the problem.

this happen even if you run configure immediately before the

Configure only builds config.h from config.h.in and Makefiles from
Makefile.in's.

The remake you're talking about happens because the timestamps for
configure.in, or one of the Makefile.am's, or something is out of date;
thus make decides it needs to rebuild configure itself (which then
re-runs the configure script, too, to be safe), config.h.in, or
Makefile.in.

I'm not sure exactly which one, but configure doesn't build the .in
files so running configure won't effect them.

I don't know offhand all the timestamp rules, but basically configure
must be newer than configure.in and aclocal.m4, which must be newer than
acconfig.h.  There's some dependency on acinclude.m4 and config.h.in in
there, too.

Also, all the Makefile.in files depend on Makefile.am and configure.in,
of course.

I have the same problem using 16bpp in HP-UX 10.01. Works correctly in 
8bpp.

	Thanks, Dominik. I'll put the un-patch in later this evening.
I still hate to do it, but I think you're probably right: it's a
little too late in the game to try to figure out how to do this one
right before 2.2. We have enough bug-squashing to do without possibly
introducing more of the little critters.

I have looked at man page and mail archive and have not found the answer
on this question: Can I define pointer color (inner and outer) other
then black/white? If not currently, is this supposed to be added?

BTW, the similar question has been asked on fvwm mailing list in 1995
with negative answer. :) This seems not very hard to implement.

Log message:
Backed out the Pager focus change that prevented FVWM from sending focus to
a No Input window. The change caused unwanted viewport changes. After 2.2
we'll revisit the issue. I think the proper fix will involve expanding the
message protocol to include sending the wmhints, so that the module can
decide whether the window should get focus.

The menu arrows are a nasty ugly shape for those of us using relatively
low-res monitors, because of the effects of rounding errors. You get used
to it after a while, but I noticed it today because I was fiddling with
my menus and thinking about what would make them look better. These sort
of few-misplaced-pixels errors add up to make a system look
unprofessional.
One of the ways in which qvwm kicks fvwm95's butt is getting everything
right down to the pixel level, and it just looks better.

Anyway, I digress. I've made a small patch for my own use that reduces the
size of the triangle so that it is vertically symmetrical and the
"jaggies"
are minimised. I don't think it breaks anything, but it could be
considered
"bloat" as it adds an extra bit of maths to each triangle draw. A more
general approach would be to allow the window button drawing code to be
used
for menu triangles, giving all the flexibility that allows. Then I could
have
anti-aliased arrows, and would be happy happy happy.

Patch follows.

ActiveFore highlights menu titles when the mouse is over them, even though
none
of the other highlight effects are applied to them. This looks bad.

Patch follows (works for me, YMMV)

I would like to have the option of having normal window TitleStyles applied
to menu
titles. This would give a more consistent look. I'd also like to have the
option
of totally flat menus (which can be partially achieved now by doing

MenuStyle * Background black, MenuFace Solid <whatever>

but that's an accidental feature, and not much good if you don't want big
black
borders drawn round everything)

No, I'm simply using SendToModule and I didn't see any obvious place
in the code path where a grab is established. Thus I was surprised
that putting a call to UngrabEm() in SendStrToModule did improve
the situation.

I need to use LOCKONSEND for two reasons:

1) If I don't use it, fvwm just queues the SentToModule call and
   won't send it until the ButtonRelease event - but I want to use
   that event to select from my menu.
   Using LOCKONSEND makes fvwm empty the queue immediately.

2) I want to prevent fvwm from taking any further action until I
   have popped up my menu and established a pointer grab. I send
   the UNLOCK immediately after popping up the menu, so a deadlock
   seems unlikely to me. Too bad that fvwm won't let me grab 
   the pointer :-( 

Matthias

PS I have a simple prototype of a gtkmenus module running nicely now.
One more patch to SendStrToModule turned out to be necessary:

I really need fvwm to send the window identification information
(tmp_win->w, tmp_win->frame, tmp_win) instead of just zeros for
M_STRING type packets. This is needed to be able to invoke fvwm
functions needing a window context from gtk menus. Changing
this shouldn't cause any problems.

No need to make a copy, it happening with today's CVS.  I though the
problem had been seen and fixed. I haven't been paying attention to
gradient stuff as I'm stuck with an 8 bit card and was running
PseudoColor while the Gradients were being developed.  It's only in the
last fortnight that I figured out how to get my apps to work with
TrueColor. I'll try to find out the problem. It smells like the
D/BGradient is being drawn into a pixmap that has accidentally got a
shape from the last mini-icon to be drawn. DGradient 100 black white =
black mini-icon, BGradient 100 black white = grey mini-icon.

Cheers,
Tim.

This looks a likely suspect. Line 2054 of menus.c

        else if ( type == DGradMenu )
        {
	  register int i = 0, dc;
	  float ds;
	  int cindex = 0;

	  if( mr->width > mr->height )
          {
	    ds = (float) mr->height / mr->width;
	    dc = mr->width * 2 / ms->look.face.u.grad.npixels + 1;
	    for(i = 0; i < mr->width; i++)
	    {
	      if( i % dc == 0 )
		XSetForeground(dpy, Scr.TransMaskGC,
			       ms->look.face.u.grad.pixels[cindex++]);
	      XDrawLine(dpy, mr->w, Scr.TransMaskGC, 0, i*ds, i, 0);
	    }

What is TransMaskGC?

I've been looking at the drawing code in menus.c and I'm confused.
What's the consensus for how lines are drawn?  Does XDrawLine(x,y1,x,y2)
draw the pixels at (x,y1) and (x,y2)?  My server doesn't unless I turn
on draft mode. Without draft mode the last pixel in the line is not
drawn.

I've looked at the man page for XCreateGC and I can't work out what it's
supposed to be.  We don't ever specify the CapStyle in a GC so I assume
it defaults to CapNotLast (defined as 0 in X.h). We also use zero width
lines. If so then this bit of the man page looks like it specifies it.

     The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:

     CapNotLast: This is equivalent CapButt except that for a
     line-width of zero the final endpoint is not drawn.

If this is true then I think we have some missing pixel in the menu 3d
code.  I also notice that the Motif widgets are drawn wrong. You'd they
Motif would get it right so maybe my Xserver setting is screwed.

Cheers,
Tim.

OK, I saw some bug fixes go through.  What's the status of bugs
targetted at 2.2.0?  What's left from the flurry of problems reported
earlier this week?  Are we going to try to fix the menu gradient
problem, or just investigate (or decide after we investigate)?  Any
others on the horizon?

I Have a fix but I won't commit 'til I get a go-ahead from Dominik. I've
based it on his menus.c so it would include the fix for overlapped
animated menus and the repainting problems.

I've also got fixes for some missing pixel bugs but I need to find out
if it's my XServer that's at fault.

Cheers,
Tim.

Looking through the MenuStyle code, there are some really cool things in
there.

But, I see this:

          PrepopMenus and PrepopMenusOff turn prepop menus on and off  (see
          PopupDelay)

What is a "prepop menu"?

I actually see this a lot in the fvwm and modules man pages: these new
(to me, anyway) terms are used and not really well-defined.  It'd be
nice if some kind of basic description was provided, even of things like
gradients, etc.

Maybe a glossary section, or some kind of "Features" section at the
beginning of the man page that describes stuff like this.  I dunno.

On another note, why do we have:

    TitleUnderlines0, TitleUnderlines1 and  TitleUnderlines2

instead of:

    TitleUnderlines [n]

where "n" is 1, 2, or 3?  Just curious...

And I would like clarification of how PopupOffset works with two args:
the first moves the menu by pixels, and the second by percentage of the
parent menu's width: what happens if I use both, like "50 50"?  Do I get
it shifted 50% + 50 pixels to the right?

I'm finding it very difficult to keep my root popup menus posted these
days:

  # Root window mouse bindings (any modifier):
  Mouse 1		R   	A       Menu Utilities
  Mouse 2		R    	A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
  Mouse 3		R    	A      	WindowList

The problem, I think, is when I click the mouse button the mouse moves
ever-so-slightly, like 1 pixel, and that causes the menu to go away
again instead of posting.

I find I sometimes have to click 3 or 4 times to get it to stay put.  I
wonder if there's any kind of threshold or something I could set that
would allow a 1 or 2 pixel move to be still considered a post action?

I couldn't find anything; maybe I'll just have to get used to it.

I recently got a new system at work with a different kind of mouse, so I
don't know if it's a change in how picky fvwm2 is about this or whether
my new mouse is just more sensitive to jiggles.

It seems that everyone is being seriously cautious.  This is a good thing,
but it's going to lead to some serious bottlenecks in these last days of
2.1.

I propose that patches should be posted here and reviewed for scope
(i.e. no extraneous changes) and impact (could it possible blow something
else up).  Those who can duplicate the problem should test the patch.
Those who are experts on some section of the code should make sure that the
patch doesn't effect them.  Everyone who can should test to make sure
that their pet feature isn't hosed by the patch.

Doing it via CVS commit and listening for wails of pain isn't a bad idea in
the heat of development, but there needs to be a bit more rigor in the
process now.  I'll leave it up to Dominik to say whether or not he wants to
do the commits himself, give the word that it's OK to do a commit, or just
stay out of the critical path.

When the time comes to release, we should put out 2.1.N, tell the world
it's a release candidate, and simply rename it to 2.2.0 (changing no code,
only docs) if it's OK.  Realistically, we have only a small number of
patches left; the finish line is near.

Plan on having to do 2.2.1 within a week, though and perhaps even a 2.2.2
after that.  At least one more big bug _will_ be found.  Then you'll want
to branch the stable and development releases.  (Someone who wants to get
to work immediately can always make a personal branch and merge back into
the mainline later.)

I second this.  We won't don't want to rely on a leader, we have to do
this as  a team.  However,  I think Tim is referring  to a menu patch.
It should be  put on the list,  but the best  one to review it must be
Dominik.

I have some stuff  pending.  I've held  it out since  I don't  want to
distract testers  from the 2.2 branch.  If  anyone does start a branch
please consider  that  it may   impact the  testing effort  which   is
currently focused on 2.2.

To me that looks as if X was trying to display the pixmap
in a different resolution/depth than it was originally
drawn. I can't imagine anything else that could cause this
many lines.

With xmag I saw at least four different colours.

Damn, you're right. I have a trivial fix ready that I will commit
now with all the other menu fixes.

Sorry, I have not written the part that Tim patched and I didn't
really understand the problem. But the solution sounds sensible to
me. I'll commit my patch right now along with the (corrected) fix
for report #152 (menu titles are hilighted with ActiveFore).

Er, umm, I think this was the first thing I tried. Or is it
important to start above the local tree and specify the module?

The changes to menu.c that Dominik just made don't fix the Gradient
bug.  It turns out that a float (ds) was being passed as a point to
XDrawLine() in PaintMenu().  I'm not sure why this was working for
anybody.  The fix seems just to be to cast the float to an int in the
XDrawLine() call.  A patch to the latest menu.c is attached below.

The patch is reversed, but it works very nicely.  Thanks!

(I was almost getting used to that ... thing.  <grin>)

Yes.

Or you can be *IN* the tree and use "update" instead:

	(from "module" directory)
	cvs update the/file/you/want

This way has the advantage that you don't need to specify the cvs root
directory (via CVSROOT or '-d').

By the way: "cvs checkout --help" will tell you all sorts of amazing
things.

Maybe the person who wrote this code has a prototype for XDrawLine() in
their X11 includes and you don't.  I think a prototype causes the argument
to be automatically converted.

This error can be detected by "gcc -Wconversion", by the way:

../../fvwm/menus.c:2069: warning: passing arg 5 of `XDrawLine' as integer
rather than floating due to prototype
../../fvwm/menus.c:2077: warning: passing arg 7 of `XDrawLine' as integer

../../fvwm/menus.c:2146: warning: passing arg 4 of `XDrawLine' as integer
rather than floating due to prototype

I'm sure there are zillions of other bugs like this waiting to happen....

I don't have my standard handy, but I don't think it does.

Automatic conversion will occur between ints and longs, unsigned and
signed, etc., but I don't think it will automatically cast between
completely different types, like float to int or similar.

Well, maybe I'm wrong: certainly you'd expect that if such a cast was
illegal GCC would complain about it even without specifying
-Wconversion...

Subject: FvwmWinList disappears randomly

Full_Name: Damon Harper
Version: 2.1.10
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux 2.0.36
X_Server: XFree86 3.3 (i think)
Submission from: (NULL) (142.103.38.187)


Never had this problem until this version - but with 2.1.10, FvwmWinList
disappears at seemingly random intervals.  I'm not entirely certain, but it
usually seems to be when I run or close another program.  For a while I
thought it was when i closed XOSView by pressing 'q', but I checked the
FvwmWinList code and commented out its behaviour when it gets sent a q
keypress - no effect.

The FvwmWinList process does actually exit; it's not just the window that
disappears.

Done, I applied the cast to int patch too as it's in the same area and
at least one person reports it fixing their problem.  It's the only
place in fvwm that a float is implicitly cast to an int, I didn't check
the modules.  The other conversion warnings are double -> float,
unsigned <-> signed and some different widths.

Cheers,
Tim.

I had sent a patch for taskbar, which raises a window as soon
as mouse moves to that icon in taskbar. This patch saves me
enornormous time by not ever having to click or keypress to
move between windows.

Subject: Two minor bugs
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Hi, two minor bugs surfaced while I continued to play with external
menus:

1) The function GetArgument in libs/ModParse.c doesn't handle quoted
arguments properly; it doesn't update the "rest" pointer to the correct
position. This has probably gone unnoticed till now since the only 
modules using GetArgument are FvwmAnimate and FvwmEvent and the bug
is only visible for commands with more than one argument. Try the
following:

*FvwmEventCmd Echo
*FvwmEvent "add_window" "A window was added..."
FvwmEvent

and be surprised by the echo: w" at the next add_window event. 

2) When the Move command is sent from a module, it behaves differently
depending on wether it is sent in root or window context. Try sending

WindowId <some window id> Move

from FvwmTalk and compare to just sending Move and picking a window.
In the first case, the window origin jumps at the first pointer motion.
I think the jump distance is determined by the distance origin-pointer,
but I'm not sure.

I don't have a standard handy either, but I checked B. Stroustrup's C++
book, on the assumption that the rules for type conversions are the same. 

The code in question goes like this:

	int i;
	float ds;

	XDrawLine( ..., i*ds, ... );

Stroustrup says that for arithmetic expressions, "if either is a float,
the result is a float" (section 4.5, Arithmetic Conversions).  In the
absence of a prototype for XDrawLine(), what is the compiler going to do? 
In fact, it will pass floats as doubles, but that is beside the point. 
The point is that XDrawLine() was expecting an int, not a float (nor a
double). 

In the presence of a prototype for XDrawLine(), the compiler will do the
right thing, and convert the result of "i*ds" to int.  Section r.5.5.2
(Function Call) suggests that the "Standard Conversions" are done when
formal arguments are available, and float to int conversions are listed in
section r.4.4 ("Standard Conversions").

The diff was backwards, by the way.  The problem reported was not REMOVING
the cast, but ADDING it. 

What I showed was the output of "gcc -Wconversion" on the code WITHOUT the
cast.  My system happens to have prototypes for all X11 headers.  Hence
gcc is warning that *the same code* --- on a system WITHOUT prototypes ---
will compile differently. 

Here's what the GCC docs say about -Wconversion:

     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
     from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
     of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default
     promotion.

     Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
     converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the
     assignment `x = -1' if `x' is unsigned.  But do not warn about
     explicit casts like `(unsigned) -1'.

Now, I suspect that lots of old X11 installations will lack prototypes for
their header files.  (Is it true?  I didn't research this.) 

*If* that is the case, then there are likely to be lots of bugs waiting to
happen.

Occasionally, when I have time on my hands, I compile fvwm with lots of
warnings enabled, and then start fixing code.  This is quite a tedious
process, I can assure you.  It would be a great help if others would do
the same (or use lint), especially on files they just modified.

Yep, you're right; I was wrong: these conversions do happen

Understood.

What I meant was, if there was no implicit cast, so the types were
indeed incompatible and the compiler couldn't resolve it, then GCC would
be expected to complain even _without_ a special extra flag like
-Wconversion.

It sounds like a feature.  We're not adding new features, being so close to
a release.  You may wish to keep your patch up to date with CVS and
resubmit it later when we're accepting things other than bug fixes again.

It's queued up along with about twenty other patches that
arrived after we had some kind of 'feature freeze'. Sorry
that I didn't respond to your original mail but I had too
much to do back then. It will not be forgotten and probably
go in right after 2.2 is released.

No, it doesn't depend on it, but it invokes a submake to run it for the
current directory.  clean-recursive runs submakes to build "clean" in
each subdirectory, then it invokes a submake to run clean-am in the
current directory:

  cr> Making clean in extras

  cr> make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/Chris/Programs/fvwm/extras'

clean-am is _supposed_ to depend on various rules that clean the .o's,
etc.; my fvwm/Makefile, for example, has:

  clean-am:  clean-binPROGRAMS clean-compile clean-tags clean-depend \
                clean-generic mostlyclean-am

The "mostlyclean-am" target is the one that should be removing the .o's,
etc.; it depends on mostlyclean-compile which says:

  mostlyclean-compile:
          -rm -f *.o core *.core

It still works for me and I'm still not sure why it doesn't work for you
:(  You don't, by any odd chance, have files named "clean-am" lying
around do you?  Maybe you can cd to fvwm, then run:

  $ make -d clean-am

and examine the debugging output to see why it doesn't do anything?

Yes, I want that too. I might be off line for a few days anytime (or even

stalled because of something like this.

Things left to do before 2.2:
-----------------------------

2) still trouble with XPM

Stuff done since last update:
-----------------------------

5) verify the 'growing windows' bugfix

6) verify the num-lock/key binding bugfix (bug #54)
   [no way to verify it]

15) gradient menus lose their colours under obscure circumstances.

Stuff that will not be done:
----------------------------

1) the key/mouse binding problems

10) crash with xclock (bug #56)

So it seems we will have 2.1.11 as soon as this recent problem with
xpm's has been resolved. Then following the original plan we'll wait
a week and call it 2.2.

The user should never encounter this term. A prepop menu is a submenu
that is popped up without the pointer in it. The menu code draws the
menu but remains in the code handling the parent (i.e. the menu is
'prepopped'). With fvwm menus you do not need to 'prepop' because
the pointer is in the menu immediately. This was needed once because if
you called MenuInteraction to handle the submenu but the pointer
was not inside the new menu, it would have re-entered the parent as soon
as you moved the mouse. However this is an obsolete term since there
is no difference between prepop and non-prepop anymore.

Oops, I see that this term slipped into the manpage. I will rename
it to 'PopupImmediately' with my next commit.

A relic of the old menu code. The menu style (mwm/fvwm/win) used to
determine of 0, 1 or 2 lines were drawn under a title entry. Not
wanting to change anything I made that an option when I removed the
three menu styles (same with 'SeparatorsLong' and 'SeparatorsShort').

Yes. I'll update the manpage.

Could you try that again with one of the recent betas?
2.1.10 is the current one and 2.1.11 will follow in a few
days.

Which trouble exactly are we talking about :)?

Do you mean the problem Andrew Laden is having over on the fvwm list
where it doesn't configure xpm correctly?

That's the only xpm problem I'm aware of at the moment, and it seems
_really_ strange to me.  I feel pretty certain it's some kind of
configuration or environment issue--no one else seems to be having these
troubles.

Of course, it's certainly possible there's something we can do to make
whatever problem he's having less likely, once we figure out what it is
:)

Or do you mean something else?

Hi,
My work is relocating me for 12 months, so my "rankinc@bellsouth.net"
account is now cancelled (one day early!! Grrr!!). If there is a problem
with my signal-handling changes then I should still be reachable at
rankinc@logica.com

Hopefully I'll have a new email address within the month.

Cheers,
Chris.

I think something is weird with his setup.

We exchanged emails and he sent me the config.log & etc.  The upshot of it
was: configure did not detect XPM.  The Makefiles were correctly generated
WITHOUT XPM.  The program was NOT linked with XPM. 

There is no reason fvwm should fail to run because of XPM.  Yet it did
fail.  In the end, he got it working by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
running fvwm, and he was happy.

I must confess that I delete any mail as soon as I see the term
XPM in it :) So I can't tell is this is the thing we're talking
about. Wasn't there a problem with one C program tested by
configure not issuing an error message?

Whatever you (Steve + Paul) decide has to be done, just tell the
list the outcome and I'll be happy.

	I have to confess I've not been following the menu bug threads
very closely, but since the known problems seem to be resolved, I
thought I'd try to do a little testing. Here's one that doesn't seem
to have been reported before (though I have noticed it before - I just
thought it was probably related to the other bugs).

	It's difficult to describe, so I put a screen shot at

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/Screen.jpg

since it's a little large to spam the whole mailing list with.

	First, here are the pertinent definitions from my .fvwm2rc:

MenuStyle "*" FVWM, Hilight3DThick, Foreground black, Background Red4
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 2 RoyalBlue 50 LightSkyBlue 50 MidnightBlue

	This is based on the setup Danek Duvall originally reported a
problem with, just not so grey. The first MenuStyle line is there to lay
in a strongly contrasting background so the problem shows up more clearly.

	It looks like a rounding error creeps in somewhere in the calc-
ulations for where a line should be drawn. The result is a diagonal line
of missed pixels where the background shows through, and a spurious ver-
tical line on the right side of the menu where the line drawing overshoots
the edge of the menu. Worse, when the menu pops down, these artifacts are
left on the screen.

	This only occurs on some menus. The screen shot shows one of the
menus that behaves this way, plus the artifacts from a couple of previous
poppings-up of that same menu.

Submission from: (NULL) (205.219.233.149)


The title bar buttons stop working occasionally, they no longer press in
and do
not perform their defined function. The only way to get the buttons to
respond
again is to log off and log back on, just restarting FVWM does not help.
Unfortunately I have not been able to pinpoint any particular thing that
is
causing it. I am using a highly modified version of the AnotherLevel
configuration.
Below is the decors part of the script. The configuration is in several
files and
they are quite long. If you would like the other files please e-mail me.

Does someone want to look at this before I spin 2.1.11?  Or should we
just go ahead?

Submission from: (NULL) (129.118.11.25)


I've always had this problem with FvwmAudio (when I was using RedHat 5.0)
and now with FvwmEvent:  Any time I enable sounds ``+ "I" Module
FvwmEvent''
I get a core dump when a sound is supposed to play.  My sounds directory
is
valid, as is the play command for FvwmAudio/Event.  I've tried other WMs
(like AfterStep) and the sound works, but I much prefer fvwm2 to others.
If it matters, I've always used the RPMs for fvwm so I assumed (perhaps
erringly)
that all the binaries worked somewhere on someone's machine.

Thanks for any help with this.

Hi all,

I know of no impediment to a 2.1.11 beta release.  Shall we generate one
today?


1. The Xpm problem reported recently appears to be the result of a strange
setup, not the fault of configure.  Whoever is in charge of the bug
tracker could close this one.

2. My previous pessimism w.r.t. parameter types in X11 calls seems to be
overstated. 

I updated my sources with the float/int fix, and compiled with 'gcc
-Wconversion'.  The warnings I got (with prototyped X11 headers)  were all
signed/unsigned conversions. 

While I think it is reasonable to want to fix these, I don't believe they
will cause any crashes.  The bit-pattern for a particular number is the
same, after all, independent of whether it is interpreted as signed or
unsigned.

Could you send us a stack trace, and the "*FvwmEvent" config lines.

  I wish I hadn't looked at your screen shots.  I simply must get a 24
bit color system.

  I'm not sure if this is the last menu diagonal gradient problem, but
it looks bad to me. I vote for holding the presses to  see if there is
a simple fix...not that I'm volunteering.

When I started discussing external menus on this lists,
someone said: By all means, write such a module...

I did. It is available at 

ftp://peano.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/pub/fvwm/GtkMenus.tgz

Simply untar it in the toplevel directory of a recent fvwm 2.1.
This will create a subdirectoy modules/GtkMenus containing further advice.
I would be very interested in  comments.  

Matthias

PS One thing I forgot im my last bug-report: For the M_STRING packets
to be useful, I needed to change fvwm to send the window-specific information
(tmp_win->w, tmp_win->frame, tmp_win) instead of three zeros. This shouldn't
cause problems, since existing modules don't use M_STRING as far as I could
see.

Before we roll, I think I lost track.
I know there was a problem report on FvwmWinList hanging the X server and I just noticed I can reproduce this with the current CVS source (as of friday 1/29).  I see it on the standard solaris Xsun server for 2.6 and 2.5.1

	I'd second that vote.

	I did a little playing around with the menu code, where I'm
definitely as rank a novice as they come. The only menus that exhibit
strange behavior are DGradient, and taller than they are wide, so I
tried arbitrarily adjusting the x values for the XDrawLine that's
done in this case one to the left, just to see what it would look
like, and the behavior went away. I expected to see something else
wrong happen, presumably on the other side, but it didn't.

	Now, I don't claim to understand why this works, because I
don't really understand why it was misbehaving before; I haven't had
time to understand the menu code properly. I'd appreciate it if some-
one who's familiar with it would take a look at it. I'm sure the fix
is this simple, but I'm not sure that this is necessarily it.

	This is what I did:

	I noticed this behavior when I was playing with the gradients.  I
assumed that it was something that I caused in my test code... but
apparantly not.  I was able to get rid of the 'missed pixels' on the
menu by setting the 'line-width' of the GC to more than 1 (I think I had
it set to 3)  I don't know about the stuff left over though..
