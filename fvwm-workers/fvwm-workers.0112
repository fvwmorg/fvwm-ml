I do not think this one is a good idea (others are in my opinion).
That we need is a centralized way to define the desktop names.
If there is no objection I will implement the following command

DesktopName desk name

this way WindowList as well as the FvwmPager will use the same
desktop names. Moreover, with this we will be able to implement
the ewmh desktop names.

I will apply the patch (if there are no objections) if you provide
a patch to the fvwm2 man page too.

This should be configurable as for example:

Hello,

Is it possible to know which window send an Event?

More precisely, when we get an XClientEvent ev with
ev->xany.send_event = True can we know which window
send this event. Unfortunately, in the case I am
interest in, ev->xany.window and ev->xclient.window
are not the window id of the sender but the window id
on which the sender want to act.

Hello,

First, I am an fvwm developers. The main developer, Dominik Vogt
is on the wm-spec list I think. Moreover, Matthias Clasen which
is (was?) a fvwm workers (but not fvwm code active at the present
time) is on the list too.

For the fvwm workers:
I try to convince the wm-spec list to add a new ewmh state 
(already proposed by Havoc Pennington) to solve the problem
in virtual.c (see the mail by Dominik with the subject
"HAVE_EWMH in virtual.c").

OK, sorry - from your mail I got the impression important developers
weren't on there. I know Dominik and Matthias are on the list.

Dominik, reading:
 http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0111/msg00266.html

We can't just ignore EWMH; stuff won't work. Window managers MUST be
consistent on the meaning of IconicState. So please argue with Sasha
and Raster on wm-spec-list. ;-) The whole point of EWMH is to clarify
issues like this so that desktops and apps can get predictable
behavior from window managers.

I think being inconsistent between window managers is worse than
either of the possible decisions we could make. Apps can work with
either decision, but they can't work if some window managers do it one
way and others do it a different way.

We haven't actually released an EWMH spec with a clear answer on this
topic, so we can still get it right.

Windows can't send events at all, only applications can do so.
You could only place that in the ClientEvent itself.

I use Meta-Tab to select another window on the WindowList. But 
the focus stays with the window under the mouse pointer.

I use SloppyFocus

(Initially .fvwm2rc warped the pointer to the window. I have turned that
 off.)

It looks as if the new window gets focus, but looses it immediately as the
pointer's position is restored (from the menu- to its pre-position).

Submission from: (NULL) (192.91.75.30)



For the past few months I've been having the problem that xemacs comes up
as 79x40 instead of 80x40 like it is supposed to.

I sat down today to figure this out because I finally got raelly really
annoyed.  First I thought it might be an xemacs thing.  I tried older
versions, but they gave me the same problem.

So I tried a different window manager and it came up 80x40.  next I tried
an older version of fvwm2 (2.2.4-2) and now the window is coming up 80x40
like it supposed to.

I'm not sure where the porblem is.  If it's in xemacs, fvwm2, or both
talking to each other.

I have already tried to debug this problem.  My conclusion was
that - under certain circumstances - xemacs totally freaks out
during startup.  It repeatedly asks for different sizes (which
fvwm grants), finally loses track of its own size and comes up
with a more or less random geometry.  I have already reported this
to the xemacs developers more than a year ago, but was ignored
completely.  Please try reporting this problem there again,
perhaps they will finally do something about it.

Recently, I noticed that it depends on the xemacs configuration.
Without a $HOME/.emacs file, everything works fine.  I suspect
that this does not happen if you just use the default fonts
(changing the font resizes the window).

Bye

That's how SloppyFocus is intended to work: the window under the
pointer has the focus.  There is not much you can do about this.
When the menu closes, the pointer enters the window below it,
generating an EnterNotify event.  There is no way fvwm can know
why this event was generated and if it should ignore the event or
transfer focus.  The only reliable way to get the focus where you
want with SloppyFocus is to warp the pointer.

That matches with what I noticed.  Changing the font size changes the
geometry it starts up with.  A really really small font gives 78x40,
where as a bigger font gives you 80x40.  I will ping the xemacs guys
with this.

Hi,

anybody found the problem with gimp (1.2.2) and fvwm (2.4.3).

I reproduced this bug when:
	
1. fvwm was configured to manual window placement:
I had next lines in system.fvwm2rc:
	Style   "*"     SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement, ActivePlacement
	Style   "*"     NoPPosition
With this configuration is important that actual desctop is full
and new window will be placed manually.

2. The action with gimp (1.2.2):
If I used the "Color picker" and clicked on a pixel, the new color
appeared
immediately in the foreground area of GIMP's main window, but the 
additional window to display the RGB components of the color took several 
seconds to appear.

	  
The reason of the problem:
When anybody push the left mouse button in gimp and the tool
"Color Picker" is selected then the gimp grab the mouse pointer 
and in the same time it wants to open additional window to
display RGB components. The problem is when fvwm wants to 
place this window manually because fvwm tries to grab the mouse
pointer also. 

Solution:
Fvwm tries to grab the mouse pointer several seconds. I think that
this time should be several miliseconds (50ms). 

My opinion:
Fvwm is "dead" when it tries to grab the mouse pointer. Only one
window has focus and other windows are cramped. In this situation 
is deadlock very probable. I think that 50ms for dead lock 
is good acceptable for user and it is also safe for slower applications
and computers.

Hello,

I've added two new styles (which have nothing to do with
the EWMH spec.). Here the doc:

The ExtendedWindowName style cause fvwm to use as window title
name a string of the form: name (i)
where name is the exact window name and i is an integer which
intends to represent the ith window with name as window name.
SimpleWindowName restore the default which is to use the exact
window name. ExtendedIconName and SimpleIconName work exactly
as the ExtendedIconName and SimpleIconName styles but for the
icons titles.

These styles are somewhere in the bug tracking system as a
feature request and I remember that we have found that this
request was a good idea. I do not know if I choose good names
for these styles if one want others name I will do all the
appropriate change.

The module part of the implementation (as some fixes) is on
the road.

Olivier

Full_Name: Marc-Jano Knopp
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: GNU/Linux 2.4.13
X_Server: XFree86 4.0.x
Submission from: (NULL) (130.83.244.129)


I have functions for resizing my windows without
mouse. There seems to be a bug in Resize:

  + I Resize br w-10p keep    - works like a charm
  + I Resize br w+10p keep    - works like a charm
  + I Resize br keep w-10p    - works like a charm
  + I Resize br keep w+10p    - does nothing!

I then tried
 
  + I Resize br keep 10p+w
 
instead, but obviously, '+' is not commutative, as it reduces the
height of my xterm always to one line.
 
Using a percent-of-screen value works, though:
 
  + I Resize br keep w+10     - works like a charm

This is not a bug.  Applications can tell fvwm a step width for
resizing.  Most of the time, this is the font width/height.  Now
assume the font is 8 pixels wide and 12 pixels high.  If you make
the window 10 pixels shorter, fvwm rounds down and shrinks the
window by 12 pixels.  But if you add 10 pixels, fvwm again rounds
down to 0 pixels.  This is why the window does not grow.

You can use w+1c and w-1c instead.  The 'c' stands for the step
width the 'c'lient application requested.  But that does not work
very well for applications that do not define a step width.

Bye

The default setup mentions the "Help" key.
On my PC this generates a warning message: "No such key".

Hello,

In the todo-3.0 we have the following plan:

 16) Expand Style command to support name=pattern syntax.
     Style (Name "File *", Class XPaint, Resource *browser) NoIcon
 17) Add id-pattern to Style command.
 18) Split style lists into 5 (resource, class, icon, name, id).
 19) Styles get applied in the above order.

Dominik, do you have any plan about these? I may try to implement
these new feature if there is no objection (Note: I am not sure that
18) is a good idea maybe it is simpler to add to the window_style
structure char *class, char *resource, unsigned long id. Also
in 16) there is no Icon match as there is one in 18); it seems
reasonable to me to follow 16) here).

But, my concern is "conditional styles":

Style (Condition Sticky, *) StippledTitleOff, UseDecor MyStickyDecor
Style (Condition EWMHDocType, *) Layer 0 6, NoTitle, NeverFocus
Style (Condition Desk 3, *) UseDecor MyDesk3Decor
Style (Condition Sticky, Name Fvwm*) UseDecor, StippledTitleOn

It seems that conditions in style has been already planed as
we can see in the window_style structure definition (fvwm.h):

#if 0
  WindowConditionMask *condition_mask;
#endif

but, I am not sure that the conditions for the Style cmd should
be only a strict subset of the condition of the conditional
command.

I am award that adding conditional styles is not an easy
task, but we may begin smoothly by adding the Sticky condition
and the ewmh window type conditions. Also, this may lead to
some simplifications to get new feature: ConfigFvwmDefault
can contain
  Style (Condition Sticky, *) StippledTitleOn
and we can remove Sticky tests in borders.c.

This is already fixed in the development sources.  You can safely
ignore this message for the time being.

  I decided that I didn't like the choice of shading in some of the buttons
listed at 

http://www.fvwm.org/vector-buttons/vector-buttons.html

  I felt the sun was inconsistent (when compared to the lightning bolts), so I
changed them:


ButtonStyle 1 Vector 11 50x10@1 25x35@1 40x35@0 40x60@1 25x60@1 50x85@1 75x60@0 60x60@1 60x35@0 75x35@0 50x10@0
ButtonStyle 3 Vector 11 10x50@1 35x25@1 35x40@0 65x40@1 65x25@1 90x50@0 65x75@0 65x60@1 35x60@0 35x75@0 10x50@1

Mouse 0		1	A	Maximize 0 100
Mouse 0		3	A	Maximize 100 0

  See if you think it is an improvement, or merely a worthy alternative.

Subject: Patch to allow titlebar buttons to be drawn depressed based on layer

I've got titlebar buttons set up to force windows to the top or bottom
of the stacking order, or to let them 'float' again, like this:

Mouse 0 3    A Function "Put-on-top"
Mouse 0 5    A Function "Put-on-bottom"
Mouse 0 7    A Function "Put-at-default"

with the functions defined thus:

AddToFunc "Put-on-top" "I" Layer 0 6
+               "I" RefreshWindow
AddToFunc "Put-on-bottom" "I" Layer 0 2
+               "I" RefreshWindow
AddToFunc "Put-at-default" "I" Layer 0 4
+               "I" RefreshWindow

I wanted to make one of the buttons be drawn 'pressed in', depending on
the window's current layer (similar to MWMDecorStick and friends).  I've
attached my patch to version 2.4.3 to achieve this.  I'm not sure if
it's the best way to do it, but it seemed quite convenient.  I have the
buttons defined this way to use the new 'Layer' option to ButtonStyle
that the patch adds:

ButtonStyle 3 15 10x5@1 90x5@1 90x20@0 50x20@0 50x25@0 80x55@0 60x55@0 60x90@0 40x90@0 40x55@1 20x55@1 50x25@1 50x20@0 10x20@0 10x5@1 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown 15 10x5@0 90x5@0 90x20@1 50x20@1 50x25@1 80x55@1 60x55@1 60x90@1 40x90@1 40x55@0 20x55@0 50x25@0 50x20@1 10x20@1 10x5@0 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 3 - Layer 6

ButtonStyle 5 13 10x80@1 10x95@1 90x95@0 90x80@0 50x80@1 80x50@0 60x50@1 60x5@0 40x5@1 40x50@1 20x50@1 50x80@0 10x80@1 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 5 ActiveDown 13 10x80@0 10x95@0 90x95@1 90x80@1 50x80@0 80x50@1 60x50@0 60x5@1 40x5@0 40x50@0 20x50@0 50x80@1 10x80@0 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 5 - Layer 2

ButtonStyle 7 21 40x0@0 40x12@1 20x12@1 50x42@0 10x42@1 10x58@1 50x58@0 20x88@1 40x88@0 40x100@1 60x100@0 60x88@0 80x88@0 50x58@0 90x58@0 90x42@0 50x42@1 80x12@0 60x12@1 60x0@0 40x0@1 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 7 ActiveDown 21 40x0@1 40x12@0 20x12@0 50x42@1 10x42@0 10x58@0 50x58@1 20x88@0 40x88@1 40x100@0 60x100@1 60x88@1 80x88@1 50x58@1 90x58@1 90x42@1 50x42@0 80x12@1 60x12@0 60x0@1 40x0@0 -- Flat
ButtonStyle 7 - Layer 4

I've also attached a small PNG showing the effect.

Enjoy!

Hello,

I've added the new command:

DesktopName desk name
Defines the name of the desktop number desk to name.
This name is used in the WindowList command and in the
FvwmPager where it override the Label configuration option.
Moreover, if consecutive names starting from desktop 0 are
defined, then these names can be used by any EWMH compliant
application (as a pager).

The problem/advantage is that this cmd override the
FvwmPager Label (it is also dynamic) in the case it is
used. Maybe some users will want different desktop names
in the FvwmPager (or in some FvwmPager's). So, do I've
to add FvwmPager: OverrideFvwmDesktopName ??

Regards, Olivier

Ok,

I have added some different options to the current CVS (seems more
logic for me). Your "IndicateIconic,ForceDeskSep,NoGeometry" is now
equivalent to "NoGeometryWithInfo,NoDeskNum". For desktop name there
is a new command:

DesktopName 0 Admin
DesktopName 1 Project
DesktopName 2 Thesis

The advantage is that these names are also automatically used
in the FvwmPager (and in any ewmh compliant pager).

You may also like the new NoDeskNum, NoCurrentDeskTitle,
TitleForAllDesks window list options.

Regards, Olivier

I don't care.  Do the modules reflect configuration changes
without restarting?

Before we start anything about it I'd like to give that issue much
more thought.  I don't have the time right now, but I hope I'll
get to it in the next few days.

If that happens, probably fvwm has crashed.  Maybe the menu that
is opened with the start button does not exist (although this
should never crash fvwm).  Try setting this resource to a valid
menu name:

  *FvwmTaskBarStartMenu <menuname>

If that does not help the only thing I can think of is to upgrade
to 2.4.3.  We made a myriad of bug fixes since 2.2.x.  I'm
positive that the bug is gone in 2.4.x.  Upgrading fvwm isn't as
difficult as you might think.  Usually, you just have to download
the latest release, run "./configure", "make" and "make install"
and everything runs fine (don't forget to set the PATH so that the
shell starts the correct fvwm2 executable).  As a SuSE user you
should *not* deinstall the old fvwm2 package or yast will start
whining about unfulfilled dependencies.

I think you must have made more changes so these line numbers aren't
accurate any more.  I need help finding your changes.

Ok, lines are not good info.
- pargraph which document the IndexedWindowName style
  (begin at line 4879 at present time)
- last sentence of the paragraph which document MinOverlapPlacement
  (lines 5263-5265 apt)
- last sentence of the paragraph which document MinOverlapPercentPlacement
  (lines 5274-5276 apt)
- The two paragraphs which document PlacementOverlapPenalities and
  PlacementOverlapPercentPenalities (lines 5278-5323 apt)
- The consecutive paragraphs which document the ewmh styles
	EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea / EWMHMaximizeUseWorkingArea /
	EWMHMaximizeUseDynamicWorkingArea,
	EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea / EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
	EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea,
	EWMHUseStackingOrderHints / EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints,
	EWMHIgnoreStateHints / EWMHUseStateHints,
	EWMHIgnoreStrutHints / EWMHUseStrutHints
  (lines 5701-5743 apt)

It is not easy to write doc ... specially for me in English
(get always problems with ending "s"). Thanks again for the
reviews, but some times as I know this, I do not rerecheck it ...

Hello,
It seems to me that there a problem here. Say that
we have a *shaped* application that you sallow in a
FvwmButtons and that app needs buttons click (as a
mini cd player). With the old code, as the application
is shaped you can define FvwmButtons Actions that are
executed when you click on the FvwmButtons button
that swallow the app but "out of the mask" and the
click on the swallowed app is still passed to the
app.
With the new code this does not work any more, as
the mouse buttons are grabbed, a mouse click never
goes to the swallowed app and the FvwmButtons Actions
is always executed.
I see two solutions:
1) do not grab the mouse buttons in the case of
the swallowed app is shaped.
2) add a new action command: GrabedAction which do
what the new code do and keep the old code for the
Action.

3) Pass the click to the application despite of the click.

I'll try that first.

We have an application that appears to break fvwm. The problem is caused by
this application calling XtPopup(), XtPopdown(), XtPopup() on one window in
quick succession. This results in a window without any decorations and is
absent from the window list. This scenario appears to work correctly with
other window managers, such as mwm (open motif), twm and WindowMaker. Below
is a program that reproduces this problem:

#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/Shell.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) 
{   
    XtAppContext appContext;
    Display *display;
    Widget shell;
    Arg al[2];
    short ac = 0;

    XtToolkitInitialize();
    appContext = XtCreateApplicationContext();
    display = XtOpenDisplay(appContext, 0, argv[0], argv[0], 0, 0, &argc,
argv);
    XtSetArg(al[ac], XtNheight, 500); ac++;
    XtSetArg(al[ac], XtNwidth, 500); ac++;
    shell = XtAppCreateShell(0, "shell", applicationShellWidgetClass,
display, al, ac);
    XtPopup(shell, XtGrabNone);
    XtPopdown(shell);
    XtPopup(shell, XtGrabNone);
    XtAppMainLoop(appContext);
    return 0;
}   

This problem is reproducible with the system .fvwmrc file.

I'm updating fvwmpy module (it allows to write Fvwm modules in Python) and
it seems that recent changes to Fvwm-to-Module interface aren't reflected
in the documentation. It doesn't say, for example, what's the difference
between M_OLD_ADD_WINDOW and M_ADD_WINDOW. Without such information it is
extremely hard to fix the module. Please, let me know where to find
information about recent changes in the module interface or put updated
documentation on the web site. I just can't force myself to write modules
in C.

This is now (or will be soon) fixed in fvwm2, there is a new state
_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN in the ewmh spec which allows the fix.
We can thanks Matthias Clasen and Havoc Pennington for this.

You have my sympathy.  English seems pretty random to me too.

I had a question about your latest change.
I put in comments framing the area I didn't understand, like this:

.\"needswork
...
.\"end needswork

If you can mark areas of the man page you would like reviewed,
that would get rid of the line number problem.

may be it is not a bug but anyway:

i'm a russian user. i use true type fonts everywhere
so when for example i view a russian site then in the title of the window
there symbols which must not be there
same thing in icon descriptions, winlist etc

for example when you visit the site www.rambler.ru (russian search)
in the title you will see some thing like (* - undisplayable symbol here):

*/%1**koi8-r* russian word /%1**koi8-r* russian word /%1**koi8-r* etc

the font I have for titles is (from my config file):
-microsoft-tahoma-medium-r-normal--*-110-75-75-p-*-koi8-r

As far as I understand the code in ewmh.c, the ewmh state hints
modify the style used by a window.  Now, if the user uses the
"EWMHUseStateHints" or "EWMHIgnoreStateHints", do windows reflect
that change without a recapture as with all other styles?  I can
remember that this was far from being trivial for the GNOME hints.
The main problem was, that the code in update.c only handles
styles that have the 'changed' flag set (with one of the SCSET_...
macros).  But this is only the case for the 'IGNORE_STATE_HINTS'
style, not the ones controlled by it like 'sticky'.

Olivier, can you define a set of tests to verify the ewmh
functionality?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Non Latin character set support has to be compiled into fvwm.  Use
the --enable-multibyte option to the configure script before
compiling:

  $ ./configure --enable-multibyte
  $ make

Well, the documentation is there, but you can only access it via
cvs.  You have to check out an older version of the fvwm-web
module to get the description of the old packets.

There is a lot of stuff in the "incoming" directory in Jitterbug
right now.  I didn't get to checking most of these reports since
2.4 was released.  I'd appreciate any help in getting this
situation under control.  I handled the reports I could, but I
guess most of what is left has to be fixed in fvwm.

Help!

Bye

What about a freshmeat announce? I think that any new
stable release should be announced at freshmeat.
IMHO it will be also good to do a freeshmeat announce
for any new alpha/beta release.

In fact EWMHUseStateHints and EWMHIgnoreStateHints are only
used at window mapping: if a new window come with some
_NET_WM_STATE states with EWMHIgnoreStateHints these states
are ignored; that's all so it does not seem that there are
problems with style update here. However, after the window has
been initialized it is fvwm2 which sets and maintains the
_NET_WM_STATE states. So if we want to be dynamic here we
must store the initial _NET_WM_STATE states in the FvwmWindow
structure to be able to restore/erase these states. This
seems not reasonable for me. No??
Moreover, any applications can send a message to change
the state of a window (and other things as the Current
desktop, the current view port, the active window ..etc.).
The problem here is that any application can send a message
and it is impossible to know which app send the message.
So, at present time all the messages are accepted because I
think that for 99% of the cases such messages are sent by the
users (via an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar). Of course we
can add a style as:
   Style "match" EWMHIgnoreClientMessage
that causes fvwm2 to ignore ewmh client messages which concerns
windows which match "match". I can do that if you think that
this may be useful (no dynamic update problem here I think).
In fact, the good behavior of the previous style is to
cause fvwm2 to ignore client messages send by an app whose
main window match "match". This is not possible ...
Finally, some problems similar to those you mention may arise
with the _NET_WINDOW_TYPE types, but at present time nothing
here is configurable as I we need some discussions on styles
(conditional styles) which are postponed.

What do you mean exactly? Here some possible answer.

I've written a file a la tests/purify/purify.fvwm2rc for all the
new commands and styles I've introduced recently I will merge it
one days.
I can write a test program but there are already some: just install
kde version 2 or 3 and run fvwm2 with any kde app, kicker, kpager
and/or kdesktop or even run ksmserver with fvwm2 as window manager.
I can give some tips to do so. Everything seem to work fine but a
few problems (as menu in kde app with no focus, saving/starting a
session on a "right" page (as for GNOME1)).
Also last week I have compiled GNOME2 (from the glib2 to gnome-core
+ nautilus "2" and it ewmh desktop). It is not usable but it seems
that fvwm is GNOME2 compliant. Also, gtk+-2 is usable and there is
a library "libwnck" (the gnome library for writing pager and
taskbar) which has some tests programs.
So, what we may need is a FvwmScript or a menu that allows to easily
test all the possibility. But the fvwm2 man page plus a FvwmConsole
is not so bad.

Full_Name: Thomas Glanzmann
Version: >2.4.0
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS && Linux
X_Server: XFree86 and Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (131.188.30.92)


I am using the following .fvwm2rc
http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sithglan/fvwm2rc
I have defined a keyboard short cut to move a window (ctrl + alt + m) when
I
try to move a window out of a screen it won't work. I can only move the
window
until my mouse pointer hits the border of my current virtual screen.

I also have a menu entry for move Left button in root -> Fvwm Window Ops ->
Move
If I use this one ... it works ...

While I was searching for a working version i discovered the following:

2.4.0: moving windows with and without short cuts are working
2.4.1: my keyboard shortcuts are not working
2.4.2: my keyboard shortcuts are not working
2.4.3: shortcuts working but moving out of a virtual screen not
2.4.4: shortcuts working but moving out of a virtual screen not

If you have any further quersions do not hesitate to connect me.

Thank you incredable much for your effot,

Greetings from Erlangen, Germany

I agree that _NET_WM_STATE is used only at map time, but
EWMHIgnoreStateHints is a normal style and should be treated as
such, i.e. honoured immediately when the style line is issued.

I wouldn't update the _NET_WM_STATE at all if EWMHIgnoreStateHints
is used.  But let's have a look at the styles that are set in
ewmh.c:

  Layer
  Sticky
  FixedPosition
  WindowListSkip
  CirculateSkip
  NoTitle
  (focus policy)
  GrabFocus
  ClickToFocusPassesClick
  ClickToFocusRaises
  BorderWidth
  HandleWidth

This depends entirely on the window type, so as long as fvwm
remembers the window type, it can always restore the proper styles
when EWMHUseStateHints is issued again.  All styles except Layer
and Sticky (which are states after the window is mapped) should
really be ignored when EWMHIgnoreStateHints is used at run time.

This is *not* about states but about styles.

  Style * Sticky

issued at run time does not affect any already mapped windows.

As far as I can see, styles are only modified in response to the
value of _NET_WINDOW_TYPE.  To make this clear: I'm only concerned
about styles not being applied immediately, nothing else.

The error message mean that iconv is unable to convert a string
encoded using the ANSI_X3.4-1968 charset to a string encoded in UTF8.
However, your iconv support such conversions.
So maybe the error message come from the fact that some of your
window/icon/desktop titles are encoded using a different charset
than ANSI_X3.4-1968. It seems that ASCII = ANSI_X3.4-1968, do the
error happen only with window which contains no ASCII characters?
I am surprised that your charset is ANSI_X3.4-1968 and not ISO-8859-1.
This charset is computed from your LC_TYPE (=de ??) variable. You can
override it by using the env variable CHARSET:

	env CHARSET=ISO-8859-1 fvwm2

All the code about these can be found in ewmh_names.c.
The errors messages are in fact only warnings. The problem with
these warnings is that if you get one then you probably get
a lot.
May be what I can do is to limit the number of such warning
to 10 (with a special string for the last one)?
I can also add a compile time option or a fvwm2 command to
disable any UTF8 conversion.

Regards, Olivier.

I couldn't narrow it down to a specific window title yet.  It may
well be caused by titles in netscape or mozilla.

Recently, I noticed an error message about LC_CTYPE or LANG not
being set correctly.  I don't have the message handy right now.

  $ echo $LC_CTYPE 
  de_DE
  $ echo $LANG
  en_US

The message obviously comes from one of the setlocale() calls in
ewmh_names.c and fvwm.c (with multibyte support).  I tried all the
spellings "de_De", "De_De" and "De_DE", but the message does not
go away.  The only way to get rid of it was to set LANG=C (without
modifying LC_CTYPE).  Of course this is no solution for people who
set LANG any other language than English.

Exactly.

Lets see what can be done about my warnings before deciding what
to do.

In my eyes, implementing contitional styles breaks up into three
things: features, performance and design of the code.  Here are my
thoughts.

 1) Possible features

     - Regular expression matching in styles.
     - Tell fvwm to only match by name or by icon name or by
       resource or by class.
     - Styles tied to window ids (some kind of enhanced window
       state); destroy when the window dies.
     - Styles depending on window state, e.g. styles that are
       applied to maximized or sicky windows.  This offers much
       more flexibility for individual windows.
     - ...

 2) Performance

     - State dependent styles may cause serious performance
       problems since the window's style has to be checked
       whenever its state changes.  Perhaps it's possible to give
       each window a flags structure that marks which states do
       not use the default style?

 3) Design of the code

     - Clean and easy to understand.  I'd prefer to keep only a
       single list of styles.
     - There must be some way to find out which parts of the
       window style have to be changed when the window state
       changes.  Otherwise, state changes would become visually
       unpleasant (the whole window is redecorated).

Any comments, more features, states, etc.?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I made a stab at some sort of syntactical suggestion for this kind of
feature right after 2.4 was released (ie, when fvwm2 was no longer in
"feature freeze").  In fact, I had started writing some code to
implement it.

I received zero responses from my message (sent on 7-Aug-2001), so I
figured that there was no interest in this at the current time, so I
abandoned the work that I had started.

I hope Dominick fares better.

In case you were wondering, I include my original message below.

Is it time for a rethink of the style system? It seems that the style
command and a few builtin commands manipulate a windows appearance and
behaviour but they don't do a complete job. We could generalize them and
provide a means to do more selective control with some additional commands.

Commands like Stick alter the windows sticky behaviour. Style <pattern>
Sticky does the same thing for a set of windows and also maintains a
list of patterns to apply to newly created windows.

A lot of style types do not have matching builtin commands.

How about a new command: WindowStyle? It would apply to the current
window or could be used as part of a selective command e.g.
WindowStyle Sticky
All (*Buttons*) WindowStyle Layer 5
WindowId ??? WindowStyle Iconic

The simple built-ins like Stick could be aliases e.g.
Stick On = WindowStyle Sticky
Stick Off = WindowStyle Slippery

The Style command could be aliased also e.g.
Style <pattern> ResizeOpaque = All (<pattern>) WindowStyle ResizeOpaque
Style <pattern> <style-args> = All (<pattern>) WindowStyle <style-args>

plus the pattern to apply to new windows could be written as a function
AddToFunc StyleFunction I WindowId $0 (<pattern>) WindowStyle ResizeOpaque

The StyleFunction function would be called with the newly-created
window's id as the first parameter.

Additional style commands would just add to StyleFunction in
a similar way to the way the style list build up. I think we may be able
to remove the style list altogether with this. The only problem being
the DestroyStyle command which would have to selectively remove parts of
StyleFunction! DestroyStyle * would be the same a
DestroyFunc StyleFunction.

Doing this would require moving most of the style parsing code from the
Style command to the new WindowStyle command and rewriting the simple
commands like Stick.

Benefits:
* possible to control every style on a per window basis
* extending the conditions for Next/All also extends the ability to set
   styles e.g.
   `All (class=*Fvwm*) WindowStyle Sticky' is better than `style *Fvwm* 
Sticky'
* possible to obsolete commands like Stick in the future
* Larrys suggestion for conditions would work with this e.g.
   `Style (Condition=Terminal) Colorset 2' is aliased to
   `All (Condition=Terminal) WindowStyle Colorset 2'

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't understand the motivation for some of the more elaborate
solutions.

Starting with a simple:

Style [Class=XTerm,Name=dumbo*] ...

would handle 99% of the need.

I don't see how the performance would be any different than
the current wildcard matching to 3 possible names.  I know theres
additional logic, I just don't think it amounts to anything we have
to worry about.  In some cases, there is less matching, I know thats
the way I intend to use it,  Ie. just supply the class as a backup
for my xterms that I don't match by name.

One of the most requested features is to be able to control the
looks of sticky windows.  This could easily be done with something
like this:

  Style [State=Sticky] ...

It's performance critical because the style of a window might
change every time it changes its state.

I like that idea.  The only thing I can't imagine is:  how can we
begin to implement such a monster of a feature?  Yes, it would
simplify a *lot* of code.  But to me it looks like a much greater
challenge than the infamous GSFR (Great Style Flag Rewrite)
several years ago.

Is that a real or a theoretical problem?  I can't find any shaped
application I might want to swallow in FvwmButtons that does
something with mouse clicks.

It is now really broken. Try to swallow xterm, with Action defined.
xterm gets focus, but not mouse presses, Action is always executed.

For a transparent example, you may try "xdaliclock -transparent".

It is a real problem: I discover this because I used such app
(with action defined when I click on the shapped part):
There are a lot of Window Maker and AfterStep applet which needs
mouse click and which have shape.

I do not think it is difficult to add a GrabedAction command.
I can add it if you want.

I want to paraphrase myself. I prefer the previous Action behaviour,
even I myself only swallow applications without mouse press handling.
The Olivier's suggestion about 2 types of Action makes sence.

I am a bit lost. I try to restart the discussion.

There is two ewmh hints that affect the style of a window at
mapping: (1) _NET_WM_STATE and (2) _NET_WINDOW_TYPE
a window map with these hints set or not.

(1) _NET_WM_STATE

the possible state are: hidden (iconified), shaded, maximized
(vertically or/and horizontally), modal, sticky, in pager skip list,
in taskbar skip list, stay on top.

(a) window mapping
At present time fvwm ignore shaded and maximize states (as 
for gnome hints, because there is no such style); the pager
skip list and the task bar skip list are considered as the
same hint (= fvwm skip list); modal is ignored (this should
be configured by the user: Style (Condition=modal, ...) styles-arg,
but if someone has some idea for some default styles-arg we can
do something) and the other states are respected using styles
(overriding the "default" style).

So here I think that, hidden == start iconic, sticky = start sticky,
...etc and that EWMH{Use,Ignore}State should do nothing for already
mapped window. Moreover stay on top have a special style (as it is
not standard: EWMH{Use,Ignore}StackingOrder).

(b) window life
After window mapping _NET_WM_STATE take an other signification:
it set and maintained by fvwm2 to the *real* state. I see no
reason why we should not maintain this.

(c) client message
Finally any application can use the _NET_WM_STATE to send
client messages to fvwm2. Here it will be good to be able to
reject some of the client message, but there is no way
to do this in a good way (by selecting the sender).

So (a), (b) and (c) are really different things. EWMHIgnoreState
concern only (a) (_NET_WM_STATE hints are ignored) and I do not
think that it should concern (b) and (c). But, I can add a
EWMHIgnoreClientMsg style for (c) which will cause fvwm2 to
ignore others messages (as current desktop change).
Now about (b). One may want that _NET_WM_STATE not to be maintained
by fvwm2, because this not useful: no ewmh application around
(this is the only reason I see). In this case what I can do
is a global command (or a style ??) EWMHSupport On/Off that
will disable all the ewmh patch at run time.

So, here 3 questions as an answer:

  i. are you finally agree with my interpretation of the
  _NET_WM_STATE hints as starting style?

  ii. Do someone want an EWMHIgnoreClientMsg style?

  iii. Do someone want an EWMHSupport On/Off cmd?

Note: there is also _NET_WM_DESKTOP which works as _NET_WM_STATE
for the desktop number of the window. In the discussion I consider
this hint as a _NET_WM_STATE hint (and need to fix one or two things
about this in the code!).

(2) _NET_WINDOW_TYPE:

This is work in progress! At present time nothing is configurable
here. As for _NET_WM_STATE styles are used (in ewmh.c, as fvwm2
handle _NET_WM_STATE hints in ewmh_events.c) and every thing
is hard coded (so that fvwm2 works with KDE version >= 2 as it is
the only working set of apps which use the ewmh spec.).

A _NET_WINDOW_TYPE type is only a conceptual description of
the application it is set by the app before mapping and never
change. As it is a conceptual description nothing is really
clear of what to do for a given type (and I am sure that
it will have some conflicts between KDE and GNOME about the
meaning of some types). So here we need conditional style:

Style (Condition=A_Window_Type, ...) args

or

AddToFunc StyleFunction
+ I All (Condition=A_Window_Type, ...) WindowStyle args

if I well understand Tim. Moreover, ConfigFvwmDefaults will
contains our interpretation of the various types. So,
for _NET_WINDOW_TYPE everything will be totally dynamic :o)

I make some test with an ASCII charset I get error messages
whenever a window title have non ascii char as é è à ...etc.

I am sure that starting fvwm2 as
	 env CHARSET=ISO-8859-1 fvwm2
will remove most(all?) of your warnings.

What you can do is to do so that your C lib consider that
your charset is not ASCII (this charset is not useful at
all, I think it is better to use a super set of ASCII in
any case). I do not now how to do this. To overcome this
we can add a fvwm2 command as "Charset charset" or even a
style which will allow to get window title in Japanese,
Russian, French, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese ...etc on the
same desktop (with mulibyte enabled).

This is not the only problem. Here are related ones.

Currently Style list is always optimized. It is not obvious how to do this
with this new StyleFunction. The function functionality just does not
allow to do everything we may want to do with StyleFunction.

Examples. I want a solution for these two problems.

1) Being able to switch normal icons on and off. Currently the only
solution is to issue "Style * NoIcon" to switch it off and hundreds of
"Style pattern Icon image" to switch them on again. Of course, the
solution to this is to add aditional Style flag HasIcon/NoIcon, so Icon is
stored for a window even it has NoIcon. But you may get the point. If
currently switching icons on and off two times is the same as doing this
10 times (because there is merging), with StyleFunction thousand of
new lines would be added, unless there is a way to optimize a function.
In this case it will not be a function in a normal sence.

2) It would be nice to have a way to do and undo style changes. This may
be useful for Style GUIs with ability to try/cancel style options. Or if
someone wants to enter to some temporary mode, i.e. to remember the way a
window (or windows) start now, apply some changes (say, iconify all new
windows) and then return to the previous state (with only some windows
started iconified). I see two possible solutions to this. First:
StartStyleGroup, EndStyleGroup, DeleteStyleGroup commands and disable
merging with styles inside the group. Second: DumpStyle / RestoreStyle.
In any case, to implement this, more operations over StyleFunction needed.

Just my thoughts.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Submission from: (NULL) (63.124.250.99)


(Somewhat similar to bug 679.)

Upgraded from fvwm2.2.4 and this problem just started happening.  When I
deiconify a window (OK, it's only happening with Netscape that I know of,
and I'm running 4.75) and the mouse is inside the Netscape window as it
appears, SOMETIMES the window gets focus, and sometimes it doesn't.  At
this point I have to move the mouse outside the window and back in to get
focus.

I use FvwmIconMan to do the deiconifying (config below) and the problem
only seems to happen if there are multiple Netscape windows in existence.

(Note: the config below makes two iconmans, one for xterms and the other
for everything else including Netscape; it may be out of date for 2.4.3):

*FvwmIconMan*numManagers 2

No.  For example, you mentioned the skip list hints and the
'modal' hint.  EWMHIgnoreStateHints/EWMHUseStateHints should
definitely turn these on and off.  The rule of thumb is:  if you
need to restart fvwm or recapture the window to get the desired
effect, then you're doing something wrong.  This is not critical
for the sticky and staysontop hints because there are commands in
to switch the state without modifying the style.

>   ii. Do someone want an EWMHIgnoreClientMsg style?

Yes and no: yes, the user needs control over what the application
can and can not do.  No, this doesn't need to be EWMH specific.
There are already styles like FixedPPosition and FixedPSize.  I
guess the user won't care if the application moves its own windows
with GNOME hints, EWMH hints or X calls.  If there is something
that an application can request of its own (shade, maximize,
stick, etc.) there should be a way for the user to forbid this
state transition - and only this.  So I guess we need a number of
new styles controlling every single of these state stransitions,
but they do not need an "EWMH" in their name.

Yes.  Just don't forget that the user must be able to switch on
and off the window type handling at any time without restarting.

Oh sorry, Netscape uses the default which is never set, so is probably
MouseFocus (focused only when mouse inside) and IconMan uses NeverFocus.

I do not understand your sentence:  "if you need to restart fvwm or
recapture the window to get the desired effect, then you're doing
something wrong". If we interpret the _NET_WM_STATE states as
starting state, a recapture (or a restart) should do nothing
on the window regarding the initial _NET_WM_STATE states of the window
and the EWMHIgnoreStateHints/EWMHUseStateHints styles (used before or
after window mapping). For a pure fvwm example: with
Style xcalc StartIconic, start an xcalc, it is iconified. If you type
Style xcalc StartNormale (~ ignore StartIconic) your xcalc is still
iconified. Or if you uniconify the window, a recapture or a restart
does not iconify the xcalc.
 
So I do not thing that the EWMHIgnoreStateHints/EWMHUseStateHints
styles are wrong at present time this is a pb. of interpretation
of the initial _NET_WM_STATE states. But I am agree that some
states (maybe all) can be interpreted as non only starting state.
In fact I don't care, it leads to complicated codes and new entries
in the FvwmWindow structure for almost nothing (and I am afraid to
lost my time in the place of doing more interesting things as completing
the EWMH support, help with conditional style, added gettext support,
...etc).
Moreover, I've interpreted the _NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP this
way (I am bit paranoid with stays on top hints) EWMHIgnoreStackingHints /
EWMHUseStackingHints update the layer of the window if a window map
with _NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP (and no layer styles are applied to
the window).

So Let says that:

_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN = StartIconic
_NET_WM_STATE_STICKY = StartSticky
_NET_WM_STATE_SHADED = StartShaded         <-- not implemented
_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ = StartMaximized on 100 0 <-- ""
_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT = StartMaximized on 0 100  <-- ""
_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ + _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT = 
	StartMaximized on 100 100           <-- ""
_NET_WM_DESKTOP d = StartsOnDesk d          <-- implemented in my machine

states are applied only at window mapping (if EWMHUseStateHints)
and these state are ignored during a recapture or a restart and are
not affected by EWMHIgnoreStateHints/EWMHUseStateHints switching.

And the windows with

_NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP = StaysOnTop (style)
_NET_WM_STATE_MODALE = ???
_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER = _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR =
	WindowSkipList

initial hints should be affected by  EWMHIgnoreStateHints / 
EWMHUseStateHints switching. But what to do in the following
situation:
a window start with _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR and EWMHUseStateHints
so it is in the fvwm windowskiplist, now by a style cmd
it is removed from the windowskiplist, after the user apply
EWMHIgnoreStateHints, and after EWMHUseStateHints. Do the
window has to be in the fvwm windowskiplist? More generally,
if a window has an initial _NET state and if the user interactes
with this _NET state with a fvwm command or a style does the
_NET state should be erased for ever?

In the opposed direction, if have

Style <pattern> WindowListHit
Style <pattern> EWMHUseStateHints

and after that a window which match <pattern> map with
_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR, do we have to put it in the
fvwm  windowskiplist? I would say no, but this is not done
in the current code for simplicity ... Do we have to do
things like this???

Yes, of course *if* you interpret everything as a starting state,
then its perfectly okay.  But one major idea behind fvwm is that
everything is configurable at run time, not at start time.  I am
still determined to remove the Recapture command one day.
Introducing new features that are not configurable at run time
works against this greater goal.

Well, I find this argument rather unfair.  I have spent a *lot* of
time cleaning up fvwm's code over the past few years.  I do likely
90% of the debugging, not because I'm fond of debugging, but
because nobody else does it.  Of course I'd rather write fancy
features, myself.

No problem here.  These can easily be changed without fiddling
with styles.

If you interpret "EWMHUseStateHints" as "EWMH state hints override
other user preferences" the question is easy to answer:

 a) With EWMHUseStateHints set, the states specified in the hint
    override any other style commands.
 b) To be able to do the switching properly and maintain the
    state atom on the window at the same time, fvwm must not
    operate directly on the atom but keep a local copy of the
    current states and of the original states.

Well, the GSFR was a great success! maybe a trial is on order:

* Write a WindowStyle command that just understands Sticky/Slippery,
   copy/paste from the Style command.
* Write a NewStyle command that manipulates the StyleFunction function,
   don't worry about DestroyStyle and optimizing the function yet.
* Write a wrapper for Style that strips out any Sticky/Slippery options
   and passes them to a NewStyle command, Pass the other options to the
   old style command (this may be quite hard and will be thrown away
   later so maybe just a really simple version would be OK e.g. only pass
   to NewStyle if the command is just "Style <pattern> Sticky")
* Add the dynamic update of Sticky/Slipppery to the NewStyle command.

This should result in the Style commands with Sticky/Slippery bahaving
exactly as the old way. If nothing unexpected turns up then we can
proceed as follows:

* Add all the other style flags to the WindowStyle command.
* Add multiple comma-seperated options to the WindowStyle command.
* Remove the old Style command.
* Remove the Style wrapper and rename NewStyle to Style.
* Work out a method for DestroyStyle.
* Use the above method to optimize the StyleFunction.
* Test it to bits.

I'm sure I've missed out something important, hopefully doing a simple
trial will make it obvious.

Cheers,
Tim.

I just replied to Dominik with an idea for implementing this. Optimizing
the StyleFucntion would be part of the plan and would require some
way of deleting lines from a function.  Is this optimization sufficient?

For each style flag given to the Style command {
   For each line of StyleFunction {
     Delete any line with a matching pattern that sets/clears that flag
   }
   Add the pattern and style flags to the end of the StyleFunction
}

This would result in the StyleFunction being quite simple e.g.

Style Fvwm* Sticky, Layer 4

gives a StyleFunctions that looks like

+ I WindowId $0 (Fvwm*) WindowStyle Sticky
+ I WindowId $0 (Fvwm*) WindowStyle Layer 4

Maybe it could use a simplified version of WindowStyle that only works
on one style flag and doesn't actually do any visual updates until the end
( like the style function does ).

The matching patterns to delete is not just a straight string match but 
a match
of any subset e.g. F* would delete any Fvwm* patterns. I don't know how
hard that would be.

You're right, it would not be a normal function. There may be no point 
in exposing
it to users so maybe a hidden one would be better. But it would use the same
function creation routines we already have plus a special line-deletion 
routine.
Line deletion from functions may be useful anyway so maybe

DeleteFromFunction StyleFunction "I WindowId \$0 (Fvwm*) Sticky"
DeleteFromFunction StyleFunction "I WIndowId \$0 (Fvwm*) Slippery"

would be the way to go.

A really nice way to do this would be for the GUI to embed an XNest 
window and have it
run a captive fvwm inside with a couple of example windows (term, 
mozilla, transients etc.)

Dumping any function contents would be useful for debug anyway and 
dumping StyleFunction
would give the equivalent of DumpStyle, Restore Style would be a read of 
the file.

Cheers,
Tim.

Full_Name: Terry Gliedt
Version: 2.4.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris or Linux
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (141.211.50.134)


I run with 'DeskTopSize 3 2'. Sometimes nedit will open a window that is
three screens wide (apparently not properly figuring out how wide my
viewing area is).  This does not happen with other window managers (CDE,
MWM, gnome, kde etc) which makes me suspect that FVWM is doing something
unexpected.

This does not happen all the time, only for large files (may have
something
to do with the length of the first few records or the like). Have you
ever had something like this reported for nedit or other apps?

Once I encounter a file which nedit misbehaves with, it is 100
reproducible.

I'm also reporting this on nedit.org, but since I only observe it with
FVWM,
I am focusing here.

This occurs on Solaris 5 and 7 and Linux (Slackware 7 or 8, both the more
recent XFree release and the one just before that, sorry I can't check
releases at the moment).

TIA for any insight you can offer.

Hi,

I was writing a module to focus windows the way I want them to. (yes, I
know that fvwm-2.4.4 does all that for me, I just wanted to learn)
I guess you guys don't want anybody else to write any modules, huh?
I searched and searched and found NO docs about writing a module. For
example, what commands can I send using SendText? Can anybody help me?

Arvind

Did you go to http://www.fvwm.org,
select "Developer Info (CVS, Modules)",
then select "Module Developer Information"?

In the past we've seen problems with applications setting incorrect
window size hints.  The output from "xwininfo -all" might help.

The release of nedit you are using might help.

I tried a file with 1 4000 character wide record and couldn't reproduce
the problem.  Do you have any more ideas about the file needed to
create the problem?

Hello,
when I invoke "kcalc", I get the following message:

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> KCalc window 0x3000009 has broken (max_height) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

fvwm2 -version:
FVWM version 2.4.0 compiled on Sep 24 2001 at 02:41:34

Another little problem:
when using latin9, for example
*FvwmPagerSmallFont	-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--7-70-75-75-c-50-iso8859-15
the font is not displayed.

Cheers and thanks for this very great windowmanager!

What version of kcalc is this?  The version I have (1.2.7), doesn't
have this problem.

If your version is later, consider notifying the kcalc developer.
Kcalc is setting window size hints that are contradictory.
They don't need Fvwm to see this, they can run "xwininfo -size".

The "smallFont" is used to label windows  in the pager.  You will only
see the smallFont when you don't use miniIcons in the pager.

I tried the above font and it seemed to work for me.
If you are still having a problem, send us the complete FvwmPager
configuration you are using.

Here the complete configuration:
Style	"FvwmPager"	NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip
*FvwmPagerRows	1
*FvwmPagerColumns	1
*FvwmPagerGeometry	-0+0
*FvwmPagerFore	Black
*FvwmPagerBack	grey67
*FvwmPagerHilight	grey50
*FvwmPagerFont	none
*FvwmPagerSmallFont	-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--7-70-75-75-c-50-iso8859-15

When I replace the last line with
*FvwmPagerSmallFont	-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--7-70-75-75-c-50-iso8859-1
it works.

Cheers, Peter

Well, I'm mystified.  If I send you a source file for part of
FvwmPager with some additional error tracing, would you compile
it and try it out?

Yes, no problem! But you've noted, that my fvwm version is not the newest?
It's 2.4.0.
Also, I've just noticed, that it works, when I set the environment variable
LC_CTYPE=fr_FR@euro. But then, the following warning appears:
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset fixed, trying 'fixed'

<p>1. Search Engine News Flash
<p>1). Both Yahoo and LookSmart have recently increased the price of their
<br>Express submission service to $299 last month.
<br>AltaVista followed Inktomi's lead in offering a paid inclusion program.
<br>FAST is expected to bring out its own program shortly. (More details:
<br>http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/express_incl)
<p>2)<a href="http://www.eif.net">Eif.net and Rapid-Traffic.com</a> are
the best search engine ranking

<br>Specialist: an&nbsp; NTA report says they have increased the traffic
of 25%.
<p>3). LookSmart Adds Paid Listings Option For Small Businesses. A new
program
<br>called "Site Promote" from LookSmart has made it possible for small
<br>businesses and others with low publicity budgets to get listed within
the
<br>paid placement area of its search results. The new program allows site
<br>owners pay a monthly fee of $20 or $30 to appear within the "Featured
<br>Listings"
<br>area of the LookSmart search results page. These are paid listings
that
<br>appear above LookSmart's editorial results. (More details at
<br>http://listings.looksmart.com)
<p>4). Overture(the former Goto.com) has signed an agreement to provide
search
<br>results to Yahoo!'s millions of users last month. Users who conduct
searches
<br>at www.yahoo.com will see search results that include Overture's top
three
<br>search listings in a section called "Sponsor Matches." Two additional
<br>Overture listings will be featured at the bottom of the page in a
section
<br>called "More Sponsor Matches." When users click on the "Next 20" link,
they
<br>will also see five additional Overture listings in the same
configuration.
<br>All listings displayed in the Yahoo! implementation will feature a
one line
<br>description and URL with full title mouse-over as a part of the search
<br>results.

<p>=================================================================
<p>4. Three Steps To Overture(former Goto.com) Successs
<p>Following a mention in my free newsletter 'Success Lines'
<br>that I was having some success generating traffic from the
<br>pay-per-click search engine Goto.com, I received an email
<br>from a subscriber asking for a blow by blow account of how I
<br>did it. So, for the benefit of a wider audience here's my
<br>response.
<p>I should first point out that I like to keep things as
<br>simple as possible, so I'll limit this to three
<br>straightforward steps.
<p>Step 1 - Find your keywords
<p>Goto provide a useful tool for identifying the most commonly
<br>searched keywords for the previous month. There's no guess
<br>work here. If a search term has received hundreds of hits in
<br>a month, it's safe to assume that it'll continue to do so in
<br>the future.
<p>First you need to visit the page where Goto provides its
<br>advertising tools. This is:
<p>https://secure.goto.com/s/dtc/center/
<p>Then click on "Search Term Suggestion Tool". This will bring
<br>up a search box in which you type your main keyword. In this
<br>example I'll use the keyword "ebook". The result is a list
<br>of search terms from "free ebook" at 13944 hits to "ebook
<br>publish" at 49 hits.
<p>Step 2 - Find the cost to bid
<p>Having selected your search terms from the list, you need to
<br>determine whether you can afford to bid for them. You're
<br>aiming to get in the top 3 slots, as this means you will be
<br>featured on many other search engines rather than just Goto.
<p>Using the same URL as above click on "Get Current Bid Tool".
<br>This will open a search box in which you type your selected
<br>search term. I'm going to use "free ebook downloads" which
<br>appeared towards the middle of the previous list with around
<br>900 hits.
<p>The results tell me there are only 3 competitors bidding on
<br>this term at $0.06, $0.05, $0.05. So, to get a top 3 place
<br>as cheap as possible I need to bid $0.06 to get 2nd place,
<br>as a $0.05 bid would place me 4th.
<p>Do this for all your search times, listing the ones you can
<br>get cheaply. You'll find some will be very expensive. The
<br>price you bid is what you pay for every click through, so
<br>don't get carried away. The minimum bid is $0.05.
<p>Step 3 - Make your bids
<p>First visit the account set-up page at:
<p>https://signup.goto.com/s/dtc/signup/
<p>Complete a separate section of the form for every search
<br>term you're bidding for. You'll need to list search term,
<br>title of entry, description of entry, page URL, and bid.
<p>Try to include the search term in both the title and
<br>description and you'll get a much better response. There are
<br>full instructions on the page.
<p>You pay a minimum monthly fee of $20, whether you receive
<br>$20 of clickthroughs or not. So make sure you bid on enough
<br>terms. You'll hear back from Goto.com in about 5 days
<br>whether or not each bid has been accepted.
<p>You need to check back from time to time to make sure no one
<br>has outbid you, in which case you need to decide whether to
<br>up the bid. You also receive a monthly traffic report by
<br>email listing the hits on each keyword.
<p>That's basically all there is to it. Remember to be creative
<br>with your search terms. For example, a term containing
<br>"online" may be out of your price bracket, but one
<br>containing "on line" may not.
<p>Be successful!

<p>1. Search Engine News Flash
<p>1). Both Yahoo and LookSmart have recently increased the price of their
<br>Express submission service to $299 last month.
<br>AltaVista followed Inktomi's lead in offering a paid inclusion program.
<br>FAST is expected to bring out its own program shortly. (More details:
<br>http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/express_incl)
<p>2)<a href="http://www.eif.net">Eif.net and Rapid-Traffic.com</a> are
the best search engine ranking

<br>Specialist: an&nbsp; NTA report says they have increased the traffic
of 25%.
<p>3). LookSmart Adds Paid Listings Option For Small Businesses. A new
program
<br>called "Site Promote" from LookSmart has made it possible for small
<br>businesses and others with low publicity budgets to get listed within
the
<br>paid placement area of its search results. The new program allows site
<br>owners pay a monthly fee of $20 or $30 to appear within the "Featured
<br>Listings"
<br>area of the LookSmart search results page. These are paid listings
that
<br>appear above LookSmart's editorial results. (More details at
<br>http://listings.looksmart.com)
<p>4). Overture(the former Goto.com) has signed an agreement to provide
search
<br>results to Yahoo!'s millions of users last month. Users who conduct
searches
<br>at www.yahoo.com will see search results that include Overture's top
three
<br>search listings in a section called "Sponsor Matches." Two additional
<br>Overture listings will be featured at the bottom of the page in a
section
<br>called "More Sponsor Matches." When users click on the "Next 20" link,
they
<br>will also see five additional Overture listings in the same
configuration.
<br>All listings displayed in the Yahoo! implementation will feature a
one line
<br>description and URL with full title mouse-over as a part of the search
<br>results.

<p>=================================================================
<p>4. Three Steps To Overture(former Goto.com) Successs
<p>Following a mention in my free newsletter 'Success Lines'
<br>that I was having some success generating traffic from the
<br>pay-per-click search engine Goto.com, I received an email
<br>from a subscriber asking for a blow by blow account of how I
<br>did it. So, for the benefit of a wider audience here's my
<br>response.
<p>I should first point out that I like to keep things as
<br>simple as possible, so I'll limit this to three
<br>straightforward steps.
<p>Step 1 - Find your keywords
<p>Goto provide a useful tool for identifying the most commonly
<br>searched keywords for the previous month. There's no guess
<br>work here. If a search term has received hundreds of hits in
<br>a month, it's safe to assume that it'll continue to do so in
<br>the future.
<p>First you need to visit the page where Goto provides its
<br>advertising tools. This is:
<p>https://secure.goto.com/s/dtc/center/
<p>Then click on "Search Term Suggestion Tool". This will bring
<br>up a search box in which you type your main keyword. In this
<br>example I'll use the keyword "ebook". The result is a list
<br>of search terms from "free ebook" at 13944 hits to "ebook
<br>publish" at 49 hits.
<p>Step 2 - Find the cost to bid
<p>Having selected your search terms from the list, you need to
<br>determine whether you can afford to bid for them. You're
<br>aiming to get in the top 3 slots, as this means you will be
<br>featured on many other search engines rather than just Goto.
<p>Using the same URL as above click on "Get Current Bid Tool".
<br>This will open a search box in which you type your selected
<br>search term. I'm going to use "free ebook downloads" which
<br>appeared towards the middle of the previous list with around
<br>900 hits.
<p>The results tell me there are only 3 competitors bidding on
<br>this term at $0.06, $0.05, $0.05. So, to get a top 3 place
<br>as cheap as possible I need to bid $0.06 to get 2nd place,
<br>as a $0.05 bid would place me 4th.
<p>Do this for all your search times, listing the ones you can
<br>get cheaply. You'll find some will be very expensive. The
<br>price you bid is what you pay for every click through, so
<br>don't get carried away. The minimum bid is $0.05.
<p>Step 3 - Make your bids
<p>First visit the account set-up page at:
<p>https://signup.goto.com/s/dtc/signup/
<p>Complete a separate section of the form for every search
<br>term you're bidding for. You'll need to list search term,
<br>title of entry, description of entry, page URL, and bid.
<p>Try to include the search term in both the title and
<br>description and you'll get a much better response. There are
<br>full instructions on the page.
<p>You pay a minimum monthly fee of $20, whether you receive
<br>$20 of clickthroughs or not. So make sure you bid on enough
<br>terms. You'll hear back from Goto.com in about 5 days
<br>whether or not each bid has been accepted.
<p>You need to check back from time to time to make sure no one
<br>has outbid you, in which case you need to decide whether to
<br>up the bid. You also receive a monthly traffic report by
<br>email listing the hits on each keyword.
<p>That's basically all there is to it. Remember to be creative
<br>with your search terms. For example, a term containing
<br>"online" may be out of your price bracket, but one
<br>containing "on line" may not.
<p>Be successful!

If you have your stuff working, I think I'll skip having you do testing.

I just commited a bunch of fixes in the 2.5.0 branch that should clean
up some of the issues you encountered, like that message above where
if warns about not getting "fixed" but then implies that its going to
try "fixed".  (It actually tries a different font.)

I also made the pager use the same font logic that other parts of FVWM
use, so there should be less problems in the future.

Thank you for your patience.

It looks like we have a stray file libs/GetFontSet.c in CVS.
Was anyone holding on to that for some reason?

I was just wondering if it is possible to disable the text labels shown

I think there is a report in Jitterbug for that warning (trying
'fixed').  Could wou please take a look and close that report if
it's fixed?

Searching using the keyword "fixed" the only candidate I see is #790:

It mentions the message but doesn't point out the fix I made.
I didn't remember a problem report for the specific fix I made.

One thing comes to my mind.  The current style code is optimized
not to do everything at once but to wait until no other input is
pending.  It may be difficult to do the same with commands that
manipulate window state directly.  This might lead to a lot of
unpleasant viasual effects like multiple redraws, resizing etc.

I suggest we put a draft for this into CVS where everyone can add
comments so that we don't have to dig through a dozen email
threads each time.  Tim, can you put together an initial draft
with your ideas?

Bye

The transparency in colour sets is a hack and does not work
properly in many other places too (e.g. FvwmPager background).
It can't be fixed without rewriting the transparency parts of
FvwmTheme, fvwm and the other modules completely.  This is
because it relies on some kind of transparency feature in X that
simply does not work properly.  To get transparency in titles, one
would have to take a completely different approach, probably using
shaped windows.

Maybe, maybe not.  It's rather difficult to do with the existing
window layout.

I don't know what to say.  There is no real show stopper here, but
it is maybe the most complicated piece of code in fvwm to touch.
I can't really recommend to do this.  It may be better to either
use a window manager that supports shaped/transparent titles or to
just live without that feature.
