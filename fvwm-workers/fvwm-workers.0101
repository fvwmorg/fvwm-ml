Hello !

Acroread-4 crashes Fvwm 2.3.26 (downloaded 27.12) immediately if run 
as a normal user. If starting as Root, acroread starts as usual, but 
when trying to open a menu window (e.g.,general options), fvwm crashes 
again.

Happy new Year to all Bug - Hunters at fvwm.org and best wishes !

I'm not sure if this is the same segfault as before or not, and I'm 
also not sure if that loop should check for NULL pointers as an end (or 
error) condition and produce an error if it finds one.

This crash occurred when opening acrobat plain and simple.  The version 
is vanilla .26

Nils.

That bug was fixed in CVS and current snapshots.
It should be checking for NULL.

Are the snapshots generated automatically?  They seem to stop on the 
26th, and that was when the 2.3.26 release was made...

Subject: Strange window/icon behavior

There's a strange window/icon behavior that started happening around 
.22.  I'm currently running vanilla .26

I have a window on a desktop that, whenever I switch desktops, gets 
iconified (I see it iconify in the pager) and when I go back to that 
page (or that desk) I see the icon and it uniconifies itself.  It's 
always the same window and completely reproducable.

Is this normal, or should I (and how) investigate it?

Nils.

I have:

Key F7		A	M	Move
EdgeResistance 500 1
EdgeScroll 100 100

When I move a  window using the keyboard to  the point where the mouse
cursor would cross  the screen edge, the  window starts to bounce back
and forth.  If I'm  lucky   and leave the  window   alone, for a   few
seconds, it will sometimes cross the page.

If I set the EdgeResistance to "0 0"  the window moves smoothly across
the screen edge.

I  don't think EdgeResistance   should have any  effect  on a keyboard
controlled move.

Jason,

  It looks like we haven't built a snap since this attempt on 12/27.
This problem was fixed.

Interesting.  I'll see why the crontab isn't firing.  The entry is
certainly there.

I'm building a snapshot manually now.

This is okay.  The ICCCM2 demands that a window is always unmapped
when it's frame window is unmapped which excplicitly implies that
the window appears iconified to the applications.  Some silly
applications react to this situation by requesting to be
iconified and "deiconify" themselves when mapped again.  It's not
nice, but I hope it's not too disturbing either.

BTW, which app does this?

Thanks for the clarification.

Safe yes, but difficult to do.  If we simply free the whole

Um, I really can't remember removing that stuff.  Not to speak of
a reason why (other than that I sometimes remove commented code
that was in for years).

The fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts() function generated a MotionNotify
when you hit the screen edge, although the pointer was not moved
at all.  Suppressing these superflous events prevents this window
bouncing effect.  Furthermore, if you moved the pointer to the
edge (keyboard), then back one step (bigger than the pan frame
thickness) then back to the border again, paging was disabled
completely, which may explain that old outstanding bug report with
netscape windows refusing to move over the edge.  This was because
the code checked if the pointer was in the pan frame before paging
but left the LeaveNotify for the pan frame in the queue.  This was
read in the next pass through HandlePaging() and messed up the
static state of this function.

But is must have an effect.  At least it must honour if paging
is possible at all.  Anyway, removing the delay for keyboard
driven motion is too complex to do this right now.

Despite the comment  in  the code, I  didn't think  there was anything
important in Keyboard_shortcuts() and hadn't looked there yet.

Its better but not good yet.

I  don't see any bouncing,  but there are  times when  the window just
won't cross the screen edge.   It seems to   have something to do with
windows covering the  panframes.  Or maybe its  crossing  the edge and
coming back again.  It seems more common moving up than down.

I see your point, if there is going to be a page flip, I guess it
should resist.

I don't know what causes it yet, but twice since I've started using this,
I've looked over at my XEmacs live-icon and it turned solid gray.

Its not Medusa's gaze that turns you to stone, its looking at Medusa.

Do you think this could be fixed with an Amulet of Reflection?

Our development envionment here at work has an editor window (textedit 
derived- YUCK^3!!!) that does this.  I can live with it no problem,

not good with names so others suggestions are welcome. Also I think
that we need a vote (with name sugestion for e) and f) :o)

Maybe the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE can be used: for placement a DOCK
window may be considered differently than a NORMAL one. But, the
wm-spec is not really the point here, we may imagine that in the future
the avoidance factor can be defined by FVWM commands and also we can
imagine that FVWM can define some window type:

Style "app_name" A_TYPE
Style "app_name2" A_OTHER_TYPE

where the "TYPE" are some meta description of the type of an applications
(the _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE types can be a subset of these FVWM Types).

Then, we can have some commands of the form:

Style (A_TYPE) some style commands, AvoidFactor 6, DoNotMaximizeOnThisWindow, ...

Any way forget all the above discution on the wm-spec ...

Ooops, I does not understand, any way I will do the code
before the 15/01/2001.

I don't see this, but I found another bug in CreateIconWindow().
The ICON_OVERRIDE stuff was not handled properly there.  I'm not
sure it fixes your problem, so I left my debug fprintfs in the
code.  Hopefully this helps identifying the problem.

Yes.  A while before the motif sources were opened, we ported the
algorithm used in lesstif with some small adaptions to fvwm.  This
should be quite similar to the motif method.  You should take a
look at the current beta versions.

Can you pin that down?  Just by playing with the keyboard
shortcuts I found one of these problems, but fixed it in my last
commit.  I grepped through the code for XRaiseWindow() and
XRestackWindows() calls but could not find any place where a
window might be raised over the pan frames where the pan frames
are not raised to the top soon after.

If you mean your most recent commit, I didn't see any of the relevant
files change.

I tried, but couldn't find a consistent action that caused the problem.
I'm at home now, until Monday.

I just  tried  to reproduce  this  at home  with  my Exceed setup  and
current CVS.    I still had problems moving   windows over  the screen
edges...

Oh, maybe I've got it.

When I move a window with the keyboard, the pointer  can move ahead of
the window.  If I hold down the arrow  key, the pointer will move more
than the window.  When I release the key, the window catches up.

It looks like the window gets hung up when I  use the keyboard to move
the mouse pointer  into the screen edge.  After  I do  that, no matter
how many times I hit the arrow key the paging  won't take place.  If I
move backward and then  toward the screen edge  again, the paging will
take place.  If  I  use the  arrow  keys  to move  90 degrees  to  the
original direction, it will also page.

To reproduce this it might help to use a big window so that the repeat
rate on your keys will out pace the window redraws.

I think you're mixing up my mails.  The debug fprintfs in
events.c, icons.c and add_window.c are related to the xemacs live
icon problem.

Try as I might, I can't reproduce this.  I slowed down my machine
until X dumped core, but I can still cross page boundaries
(although sometimes I see the moved window flipping between the
positions on the old page and the new page a few times).  To debug
this you should put an fprintf before each 'return' in the
HandlePaging() function.  Then look at the output when paging is
disabled.  It should be easy from there to identify the reason why
paging does not take place.

Can you get the mouse pointer to move faster than the window itself?

I did what you suggested.

Most normal moving is associated with the fprintf I added around
line 447 where it gets the pointer location.

When it won't move anymore, it executes the first return
statement around line 379.

The logic around line 464 never gets executed.
This is the code with the comment, "the pointer is moving too fast".
That looks suspicious, since the pointer is not moving, except that
fvwm moves it in response to keyboard events.

Its strange that fvwm moves the pointer before it moves the window.
I guess the idea is to move the pointer, and from then on make the
rest of the logic only worry about the pointer.  If thats the case,
it doesn't seem to be able to get into the "too fast" logic
from the keyboard.

I did make it go into the "too fast" logic using the mouse.

In fact the current possible combinations are:

    Dumb + Random + Clever      =   Cascade 
    Dumb + Random + CleverOff   =   Cascade
    Dumb + Active + Clever      =   Manual
    Dumb + Active + CleverOff   =   Manual
    Smart + Random + CleverOff  =   TileCascade
    Smart + Active + CleverOff  =   TileManual
    Smart + Random + Clever     =   MinOverlap
    Smart + Active + Clever     =   MinOverlap

So I really think that:

Yes, I've done the main part of this changes (need to update the manual
and other little things as some Config). Moreover, we can really have
backward compatibility, with doing nothing the new code gives:

    Dumb + Random + Clever      =   Cascade 
    Dumb + Random + CleverOff   =   Cascade
    Dumb + Active + Clever      =   Cascade   <--- Not real b.c.
    Dumb + Active + CleverOff   =   Manual
    Smart + Random + CleverOff  =   TileCascade
    Smart + Active + CleverOff  =   TileManual
    Smart + Random + Clever     =   MinOverlap
    Smart + Active + Clever     =   MinOverlapPercent  <--- Not real b.c.

Do we have to do so that Dumb + Active + Clever = Manual ?
Also, do we allow this backward compatibility without any warning
or we must warn the user if Dumb, Smart, Active, Random or Clever(Off)
is used?

Thanks for any suggestions, Olivier

It's very difficult on a local X server, but I could by mapping
55 rxvts with a pixmap background.

Hm, line 379 belongs to the second return, but I think you are
talking about this code:

  /* Only continue to count the time, but do not start counting from
   * scratch. */
  if (!is_timestamp_valid && do_continue_previous)
  {
    /* Free some CPU */
    usleep(10000);
    return False;
  }

The is_timestamp_valid flag is basically set when the pointer
enters a pan frame and reset when the pointer leaves the pan
frames.  The do_continue_previous parameter tells HandlePaging to
continue counting time as long as the pointer is over the pan
frames.  Obviously this only makey sense if the pointer is already
there.
In moveLoop(), HandlePaging() is called twice.  Once while waiting
for events with do_continue_previous set.  This takes care of
paging while the pointer does not move.  When a motion is
started, the is_timestamp_valid is not set, so the HandlePaging()
calls will do nothing at first.  The second call is down in the
MotionNotify code and has the do_continue_previous flag unset.  So
this code can start paging by setting the is_timestamp_valid flag
(i.e. paging can only take place after at least one MotionNotify
event).
Now, I think somehow is_timestamp_valid is unset when the pointer
hits the screen edge.  Because of my change in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts() no MotionNotify event will be
generated anymore if the pointer does not move.  Hence
HandlePaging() will always be called with do_continue_previous set
and is_timestamp_valid unset, so it will always bag out at the
first return.
I think the fix is to generate even +/- 0 motion events.  Although
that appears to negate the benefit of my last changes in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts(), there is a difference: in the past,
when the pointer was at (1, y) and you hit shift-left, the pointer
would travel 100 pixels to the left.  The generated event
contained the new position (-99, y) which is nonsense.  With my
latest patch it will have (0, y), even if it started at (0, y).

Before you test that patch, can you please try out and see where
the is_timestamp_valid flag is unset right before you get stuck on
the page, Dan?  I suspect there is another hidden bug.  There are
four places where the flag could be reset:

(I)
  if (Scr.ScrollResistance >= 10000 || (HorWarpSize == 0 && VertWarpSize==0))
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

It can't be here because this condition is only true if paging is
completely disabled.

(II)
  if (Scr.VxMax == 0 && Scr.VyMax == 0)
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

But in this case you would have a 1x1 desktop and paging would
never take place.

(III)

    if (XPending(dpy) > 0 &&
       (XCheckWindowEvent(
     dpy, Scr.PanFrameTop.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameBottom.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameLeft.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameRight.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event)))
    {
      ...
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

This contition should only be true if the pointer leaves the pan
frames.

(IV)
    if (x >= edge_thickness && x < Scr.MyDisplayWidth-edge_thickness &&
        y >= edge_thickness && y < Scr.MyDisplayHeight-edge_thickness)
    {
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

Same as III.

The fifth possibility is that paging is triggered on a desktop edge.  
I don't understand how any of these conditions can kick off.

This code prevents paging while you move the pointer along a
screen edge.  For example, if you grab a window title near the
page top and move it horizontally, you will often touch the page
top for a moment during the motion.  This code prevents that
paging takes place in this situation if the pointer still moves
fast enough (6 pixels or more per event).  Otherwise you may flip
pages a few times with a low edge resistance.  This would only
delay paging, but not disable it (it does not reset said flag).
Basically, this code is meant to trigger when you move *along* the
edge, not when you *hit* the edge (although this will still happen
once if you hit it too fast).

The keyboard shortcut code tries to emulate real pointer motion.
If you move the pointer with the mouse, the window will also lag
behind the pointer since you can't move the window before you know
where the pointer travels.  This is exactly what keyboard
shortcuts do: move the pointer, then overwrite the KeyPress event
with a proper MotionNotify event.

> I did make it go into the "too fast" logic using the mouse.

This code will be executed most of the time if you use the shift
key during motion (100 pixels per keystroke), but it does not
really matter.  The default motion step size is the width_inc or
height_inc of the window or 5, whichever is greater.  So, you will
often move 5 pixels per keystroke which is just one pixel smaller
than the distance needed to trigger this code.  Even if you move
windows with ..._inc > 5, it will only be called if the last step
of the motion when hitting the edge was really 6 pixels or more.

In fact the current possible combinations are:

    Dumb + Random + Clever      =   Cascade 
    Dumb + Random + CleverOff   =   Cascade
    Dumb + Active + Clever      =   Manual
    Dumb + Active + CleverOff   =   Manual
    Smart + Random + CleverOff  =   TileCascade
    Smart + Active + CleverOff  =   TileManual
    Smart + Random + Clever     =   MinOverlap
    Smart + Active + Clever     =   MinOverlap

So I really think that:

Yes, I've done the main part of this changes (need to update the manual
and other little things as some Config). Moreover, we can really have
backward compatibility, with doing nothing the new code gives:

    Dumb + Random + Clever      =   Cascade 
    Dumb + Random + CleverOff   =   Cascade
    Dumb + Active + Clever      =   Cascade   <--- Not real b.c.
    Dumb + Active + CleverOff   =   Manual
    Smart + Random + CleverOff  =   TileCascade
    Smart + Active + CleverOff  =   TileManual
    Smart + Random + Clever     =   MinOverlap
    Smart + Active + Clever     =   MinOverlapPercent  <--- Not real b.c.

Do we have to do so that Dumb + Active + Clever = Manual ?
Also, do we allow this backward compatibility without any warning
or we must warn the user if Dumb, Smart, Active, Random or Clever(Off)
is used?

Thanks for any suggestions, Olivier

It's very difficult on a local X server, but I could by mapping
55 rxvts with a pixmap background.

Hm, line 379 belongs to the second return, but I think you are
talking about this code:

  /* Only continue to count the time, but do not start counting from
   * scratch. */
  if (!is_timestamp_valid && do_continue_previous)
  {
    /* Free some CPU */
    usleep(10000);
    return False;
  }

The is_timestamp_valid flag is basically set when the pointer
enters a pan frame and reset when the pointer leaves the pan
frames.  The do_continue_previous parameter tells HandlePaging to
continue counting time as long as the pointer is over the pan
frames.  Obviously this only makey sense if the pointer is already
there.
In moveLoop(), HandlePaging() is called twice.  Once while waiting
for events with do_continue_previous set.  This takes care of
paging while the pointer does not move.  When a motion is
started, the is_timestamp_valid is not set, so the HandlePaging()
calls will do nothing at first.  The second call is down in the
MotionNotify code and has the do_continue_previous flag unset.  So
this code can start paging by setting the is_timestamp_valid flag
(i.e. paging can only take place after at least one MotionNotify
event).
Now, I think somehow is_timestamp_valid is unset when the pointer
hits the screen edge.  Because of my change in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts() no MotionNotify event will be
generated anymore if the pointer does not move.  Hence
HandlePaging() will always be called with do_continue_previous set
and is_timestamp_valid unset, so it will always bag out at the
first return.
I think the fix is to generate even +/- 0 motion events.  Although
that appears to negate the benefit of my last changes in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts(), there is a difference: in the past,
when the pointer was at (1, y) and you hit shift-left, the pointer
would travel 100 pixels to the left.  The generated event
contained the new position (-99, y) which is nonsense.  With my
latest patch it will have (0, y), even if it started at (0, y).

Before you test that patch, can you please try out and see where
the is_timestamp_valid flag is unset right before you get stuck on
the page, Dan?  I suspect there is another hidden bug.  There are
four places where the flag could be reset:

(I)
  if (Scr.ScrollResistance >= 10000 || (HorWarpSize == 0 && VertWarpSize==0))
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

It can't be here because this condition is only true if paging is
completely disabled.

(II)
  if (Scr.VxMax == 0 && Scr.VyMax == 0)
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

But in this case you would have a 1x1 desktop and paging would
never take place.

(III)

    if (XPending(dpy) > 0 &&
       (XCheckWindowEvent(
     dpy, Scr.PanFrameTop.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameBottom.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameLeft.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameRight.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event)))
    {
      ...
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

This contition should only be true if the pointer leaves the pan
frames.

(IV)
    if (x >= edge_thickness && x < Scr.MyDisplayWidth-edge_thickness &&
        y >= edge_thickness && y < Scr.MyDisplayHeight-edge_thickness)
    {
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

Same as III.

The fifth possibility is that paging is triggered on a desktop edge.  
I don't understand how any of these conditions can kick off.

This code prevents paging while you move the pointer along a
screen edge.  For example, if you grab a window title near the
page top and move it horizontally, you will often touch the page
top for a moment during the motion.  This code prevents that
paging takes place in this situation if the pointer still moves
fast enough (6 pixels or more per event).  Otherwise you may flip
pages a few times with a low edge resistance.  This would only
delay paging, but not disable it (it does not reset said flag).
Basically, this code is meant to trigger when you move *along* the
edge, not when you *hit* the edge (although this will still happen
once if you hit it too fast).

The keyboard shortcut code tries to emulate real pointer motion.
If you move the pointer with the mouse, the window will also lag
behind the pointer since you can't move the window before you know
where the pointer travels.  This is exactly what keyboard
shortcuts do: move the pointer, then overwrite the KeyPress event
with a proper MotionNotify event.

> I did make it go into the "too fast" logic using the mouse.

This code will be executed most of the time if you use the shift
key during motion (100 pixels per keystroke), but it does not
really matter.  The default motion step size is the width_inc or
height_inc of the window or 5, whichever is greater.  So, you will
often move 5 pixels per keystroke which is just one pixel smaller
than the distance needed to trigger this code.  Even if you move
windows with ..._inc > 5, it will only be called if the last step
of the motion when hitting the edge was really 6 pixels or more.

Using current CVS, the problem remains.

Recapture changes the icon into an active icon, but
the icon still doesn't update on iconify.

Jason, this appears to be a problem on your end.

Looking at the snapshot download area, it looks like January 6th
was skipped, and there is a pretty interesting day of week being
shown for January 8:

  fvwm-snap-20010105.tar.gz 1552 Kb Fri Jan  5 12:32:00 2001 Unix Tape Archive

What am I doing at work on a Saturday?

There was some network trouble on the 6th; the problem report made it out
only now because I flushed a stuck queue.

The 6th was skipped due to the problem.  The date is correct on the file in
the repository; it seems that some FTP clients are having delayed Y2K
problems.  (Mine has problems with the date as well, showing it as "Jan  8
2001".)  A plain FTP session shows:

Sorry, I only read this closely after I did a CVS update, I can
update back to a few days ago, but I think I have what you want.

Looking back thru my debug output, I only saw 2 different returns being
activated, the first one:

  if (!is_timestamp_valid && do_continue_previous)
  {
    /* Free some CPU */
    usleep(10000);
    fprintf(stderr,"timestamp %d, valid %d, continue %d\n",
            countit++, (int)!is_timestamp_valid, (int)do_continue_previous);
    return False;
  }

and this one:

    /* check actual pointer location since PanFrames can get buried under
       a window being moved or resized - mab */
    if (x >= edge_thickness && x < Scr.MyDisplayWidth-edge_thickness &&
        y >= edge_thickness && y < Scr.MyDisplayHeight-edge_thickness)
    {
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      add_time = 0;
      discard_window_events(Scr.PanFrameTop.win, LeaveWindowMask);
      discard_window_events(Scr.PanFrameBottom.win, LeaveWindowMask);
      discard_window_events(Scr.PanFrameLeft.win, LeaveWindowMask);
      discard_window_events(Scr.PanFrameRight.win, LeaveWindowMask);
    fprintf(stderr,"thickness\n");
      return False;
    }

When actual moves were taking place, it would print "thickness"
after that, it just keeps printing "timestamp...".

Gee, I must have been drunk when I wrote that code.  Not only
that the "root ..." part did not work at all because of several
bugs, it also broke regular parsing in several places, introducing
a new memory leak and breaking the parsed string.  Do I ever test
my code?

Please, everyone, if you notice I'm hacking 16 hours a day again,
give me a note that I have to go to bed instead of breaking
everything!

Bye

Uh, yes.  With these changes I synchronised handling of the
(No)IconOverride/NoActiveIconOverride styles so that
applications can't enforce their icon wish by changing the icon
hint after the window was mapped.  Xemacs' live icon is not
considered to be an active icon because xemacs uses the icon
pixmap hint, not the window hint.  In other words: you have to
use the "NoIconOverride" style for your xemacs windows.

Yep, that makes it work.

Now all we need to do is make "NoIconOverride" the default.

I need to revise these comments.

After I entered:

Style * NoIconOverride

another icon I used changed.

Just setting NoIconOverride as the default won't restore the old
behavior.

The icon that changes is a second XEmacs frame with the resource name
"xmh".  I have:

Style "xmh" Icon mail2.xpm

I used to see the "mail2.xpm" icon, I now see the XEmacs builtin icon.

It looks like, by default, I override program supplied icons, but
when XEmacs "actively" supplies an icon, fvwm used to accept it,
and now it doesn't.

Shouldn't fvwm treat a program changing its pixmap hint the
same way it treats a change in window hint?  Isn't the goal
of the application the same in both cases?

It's very difficult on a local X server, but I could by mapping
55 rxvts with a pixmap background.

Hm, line 379 belongs to the second return, but I think you are
talking about this code:

  /* Only continue to count the time, but do not start counting from
   * scratch. */
  if (!is_timestamp_valid && do_continue_previous)
  {
    /* Free some CPU */
    usleep(10000);
    return False;
  }

The is_timestamp_valid flag is basically set when the pointer
enters a pan frame and reset when the pointer leaves the pan
frames.  The do_continue_previous parameter tells HandlePaging to
continue counting time as long as the pointer is over the pan
frames.  Obviously this only makey sense if the pointer is already
there.
In moveLoop(), HandlePaging() is called twice.  Once while waiting
for events with do_continue_previous set.  This takes care of
paging while the pointer does not move.  When a motion is
started, the is_timestamp_valid is not set, so the HandlePaging()
calls will do nothing at first.  The second call is down in the
MotionNotify code and has the do_continue_previous flag unset.  So
this code can start paging by setting the is_timestamp_valid flag
(i.e. paging can only take place after at least one MotionNotify
event).
Now, I think somehow is_timestamp_valid is unset when the pointer
hits the screen edge.  Because of my change in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts() no MotionNotify event will be
generated anymore if the pointer does not move.  Hence
HandlePaging() will always be called with do_continue_previous set
and is_timestamp_valid unset, so it will always bag out at the
first return.
I think the fix is to generate even +/- 0 motion events.  Although
that appears to negate the benefit of my last changes in
fvwmlib_keyboard_shortcuts(), there is a difference: in the past,
when the pointer was at (1, y) and you hit shift-left, the pointer
would travel 100 pixels to the left.  The generated event
contained the new position (-99, y) which is nonsense.  With my
latest patch it will have (0, y), even if it started at (0, y).

Before you test that patch, can you please try out and see where
the is_timestamp_valid flag is unset right before you get stuck on
the page, Dan?  I suspect there is another hidden bug.  There are
four places where the flag could be reset:

(I)
  if (Scr.ScrollResistance >= 10000 || (HorWarpSize == 0 && VertWarpSize==0))
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

It can't be here because this condition is only true if paging is
completely disabled.

(II)
  if (Scr.VxMax == 0 && Scr.VyMax == 0)
  {
    is_timestamp_valid = False;
    ...
    return False;
  }

But in this case you would have a 1x1 desktop and paging would
never take place.

(III)

    if (XPending(dpy) > 0 &&
       (XCheckWindowEvent(
     dpy, Scr.PanFrameTop.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameBottom.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameLeft.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event) ||
    XCheckWindowEvent(
      dpy, Scr.PanFrameRight.win, LeaveWindowMask, &Event)))
    {
      ...
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

This contition should only be true if the pointer leaves the pan
frames.

(IV)
    if (x >= edge_thickness && x < Scr.MyDisplayWidth-edge_thickness &&
        y >= edge_thickness && y < Scr.MyDisplayHeight-edge_thickness)
    {
      is_timestamp_valid = False;
      ...
      return False;
    }

Same as III.

The fifth possibility is that paging is triggered on a desktop edge.  
I don't understand how any of these conditions can kick off.

This code prevents paging while you move the pointer along a
screen edge.  For example, if you grab a window title near the
page top and move it horizontally, you will often touch the page
top for a moment during the motion.  This code prevents that
paging takes place in this situation if the pointer still moves
fast enough (6 pixels or more per event).  Otherwise you may flip
pages a few times with a low edge resistance.  This would only
delay paging, but not disable it (it does not reset said flag).
Basically, this code is meant to trigger when you move *along* the
edge, not when you *hit* the edge (although this will still happen
once if you hit it too fast).

The keyboard shortcut code tries to emulate real pointer motion.
If you move the pointer with the mouse, the window will also lag
behind the pointer since you can't move the window before you know
where the pointer travels.  This is exactly what keyboard
shortcuts do: move the pointer, then overwrite the KeyPress event
with a proper MotionNotify event.

> I did make it go into the "too fast" logic using the mouse.

This code will be executed most of the time if you use the shift
key during motion (100 pixels per keystroke), but it does not
really matter.  The default motion step size is the width_inc or
height_inc of the window or 5, whichever is greater.  So, you will
often move 5 pixels per keystroke which is just one pixel smaller
than the distance needed to trigger this code.  Even if you move
windows with ..._inc > 5, it will only be called if the last step
of the motion when hitting the edge was really 6 pixels or more.

Hm. Possibly we need a new style.  The current three styles were
originally meant to do:

  IconOverride:

    Always use the fvwm provided icon.

  NoIconOverride:

    Always use the application provided icon, if any.

  NoActiveIconOverride:

    Only use live icons provided by the application.

The problem is to define a live icon.  For the old code, a live
icon was identical to an icon provided by an icon window hint.
But the style was only honoured when the window was created.  If
the applications changed the icon later, fvwm would *always* use
the new one, even with IconOverride.

It seems that we need a better definition of live icons.  Will
this one do:

  When window is created:

    Icon provided with icon window hint.

  When icon is changed:

    Any application provided icon pixmap or window hint.

Bye

Subject: problems with MenuStyle * Fvwm
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Dear FVWM workers,

after the recent changes in the menu code, I observe a strange problem.
Using the style:

MenuStyle * Fvwm

and moving the pointer with the mouse over the diferent items of my root
menu, the sub-menues pop up in strange positions, sometimes where I was
used to see them, sometimes not. For example, when clicking on the last
item, it can appear at the place of the first one, and so on ...
I've noticed that this happens if I move the pointer fast enough over the
different items.

The other styles (MenuStyle * Mwm and MenuStyle * Win) work fine.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

If your latest commit implemented these changes, then it didn't work.
The live icon is working, but the override isn't.  The icon starts out
with the icon I specified but then the built in one replaces it.

fvwm crashes (well, exits when it shouldn't) when using 'Restart' on a 
dual headed display.

I start fvwm from the ~/.xinitrx (exec fvwm2) with
openwin -dev /dev/fb0 -dev /dev/fb1
Is there a better way to start a multi-head system?


and my restart function from the menu is simply:

AddToMenu FvwmCommands  "Fvwm Commands" Title
+                       "Refresh"       Refresh
+                       "Recapture"     Recapture
+                       "Restart Fvwm"  Restart fvwm2


Here are the error messages I get.  the XPM ones are normal because its 
compiled without xpm support for the moment.

It should be 'Restart', not 'Restart fvwm2'.

On dual headed display FVWM spawns itself with -s and -display added
unless you yourself start it with -s and -display.

If you use 'Restart fvwm2' all command line arguments are lost, while
on Restart without arguments or with --pass-args, they are preserved.
Here are some cases when 'Restart fvwm2' will cause troubles:

  * running FVWM in a multi headed environment
  * running FVWM under a session manager (only 'Restart' supported here)
  * using command line arguments, like -f themes-rc or -cmd
  * if the first fvwm2 in the $PATH is not the same as the current one

Generally, you should always use Restart with no paramaters unless you
really know what you are doing. I think I may add a warning when Restart
is used with fvwm2 parameter suggesting to remove it, or specify a full
path and args if a user means "start another window manager instead"
rather than restarting the same one.

Thanks for the info... I think a warning would be a good idea, or even 
better a nice entry in the man page under Restart with the details (and 
pitfalls) from your mail.

Thanks,
Nils.

I shouldn't send 'thanks' mails until having tried it... :)  I still 
get the same error.  THe behavior is that the WM on the display kills 
itself (fvwm borders etc. disappear) and the one on the other display 
doesn't, then the WM and server die.  Any other suggestions?

Dominik, your latest commit fixed incorrect places of submenus, but there
are still other problems with the new code.

If you have a menu with submenus it is very slow to navigate in it,
it is fast to navigate over regular (non-submenu) items.

There is a core dump. Start FVWM as: fvwm2 -cmd "Mouse 2 R A WindowList"
Press middle button -> crash:

I think this come because of the new menu style PopdownDelayed which is
a default. I think that using PoupdownImmediately menu style will fix the
problem. Moreover, I think that PoupdownImmediately must be the default
and that may be it will good to add this to win, mwm and fvwm menu style.

I've noted the same problem.

This is correct regardless of anything else.

This is not quite correct, FVWM only does this under SM. Otherwise it uses
fork() in this situation.

The problem is that we detect Restarting (fvwm.c, +602 block) after fork().
If only it would be possible to move this prior to +389 block. Seems hard.

Ok, I tried to fix this differently. Can you try the latest cvs?
I have no multi-headed setup to test this myself. If this does not help
(it should if you restart on :0.1), can you see if uncommenting lines
424-425 helps? If not, I pass the torch to someone with multi-head. :)

The current feature is that Restart on one screen does not affect at all
fvwm's on other screens. Of course, without multi-head I can only guess.

Here is a solution which should work even without my latest fix.
Instead of exec fvwm2 you may use commands (the last is without ampersand):

  fvwm2 -s -d :0.0 [other args] &
  fvwm2 -s -d :0.1 [other args]

In this case, Restart (not 'Restart fvwm2') will work on every screen.

As a suggestion, since we're on the topic, could we modify these
names (style names) to something that makes more sense (similar to what's 
happening in the placement algorithm side - with Olivier & Dominik)

Could we embed the definition in the style name, here are a few suggestions,

IconOverride           -> UseFvwmProvidedIcon
NoIconOverride         -> DontUseFvwmProvidedIcon
NoActiveIconOverride   -> UseApplicationLiveIcon

Or whatever else that is deemed more descriptive and appropriate.

Just a thought

Yes, exactly.  There is a noticeable delay (150 ms) before a
sub-menu pops down when you leave the item.  During this delay the
new item will not be hilighted.  The idea is that when you try to
move the pointer into the sub-menu, you can pass over other items
without popping down the sub-menu.  The reason why it's so
sluggish is the length of the delay.  The default PopupDelay is
150 ms.  I chose the default PopdownDelay to be the same so that
when the sub-menu is finally popped down, a new sub-menu will be
mapped in a way so that you won't see the background windows to
reduce redrawing.  If PopdonDelay were shorter that PopupDelay,
this would not be the case.  I would prefer a shorter default
PopdownDelay too, especially if nobody objects lowering the
default PopupDelay too.

> and that may be it will good to add this to win, mwm and fvwm menu style.

I disagree.  I think the biggest flaw of the old menu code was
that sub-menus pop down when the pointer strays from the
corresponding item.  I'd rather break backwards compatibility
(well, it's only a default) than tire new users with the old,
uncomfortable code.

I don't see this, but obviously I overlooked a dirty hack that
destroys the event pointer that is the src in the memmove()
operation.  Please try this after my next commit.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

For the last week or so of CVS code I've been noticing something weird
about autoraise (FvwmAuto).  I don't _think_ this used to happen with
older code.  I'm not updating every day or even every week these days,
so it's hard to say exactly when this became an issue.

Here's the situation; I have a Netscape window, with focus, and raised.

I use C-n in Netscape to create a new window.  The new window overlaps
the old window such that the cursor is now in the new window, which then
has focus.  Since the new window is already on top, I can't tell what,
if anything, FvwmAuto does with this.

So far so good; here's the weird part: I move my mouse back to the first
window, and it gets focus _but_ it doesn't autoraise!!  To get it to
raise I have to flip my mouse over to some other window, then back
again.  That second time it does raise.

I'm using the default focus handling (no *Focus styles are set), I use
"FvwmAuto 500" as my module invocation (in InitFunction etc.), and I use
these potentially relevant styles:

                DecorateTransient, HintOverride, \
		RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement, CleverPlacement,\
                ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

It seems like, because the new window is created with focus, FvwmAuto (or
something) doesn't realize it's now on top so when I move my mouse back
to the original window, FvwmAuto thinks it's still on top and doesn't
try to raise it.  Or something.  Thoughts?

This CVS is about a week old; I'll try the latest, but I haven't seen
anything go through the mailing lists which seems relevant to this
problem.

Thanks...

Still the same problem as before.

#0  0x804d9d2 in MenuInteraction (pmp=0xbfffee30, pmret=0xbfffed60,
    pdkp=0xbfffebc0, pdo_warp_to_title=0x8095188) at menus.c:1436

(gdb) p pmp->event_propagate_to_submenu
$1 = (XEvent *) 0xb
(gdb) p *(pmp->event_propagate_to_submenu)
Cannot access memory at address 0xb

Ok, with both PopupDelay and PopdownDelay 100 it makes more sence to me.
Still I would make PopdownImmediately the default, not PopdownDelayed,
at least with the current implementation. Because in the first case plain
items and submenu items are processed consistently, they are hilighted
immediately even if submenus are not open immediately. In the second case
submenu items (only) are not hilighted immediately causing a unresponsive
or jumpy effect. Maybe they should be shown hilighted while the latest
submenu is still up (and when entering the submenu the father item should
be rehilighted if needed)? IMHO. Sounds complex, but it is already complex
and I see some synchronization bugs already with the PopdownDelayed.

On a slightly different topic. I think your previous idea about posting
submenus by a click (works with PopupAsSubmenu only) was good and arguably
preferable over this new PopdownDelayed idea. But 2 "features" in it make
it unconvinient and unfunctional:

* Once entered into posting mode, it is impossible to return to the
  original mode on the first main menu poping up. I think that the second
  click on the same submenu item should "unpost" the submenu, i.e. return
  menus to the original browsing mode.
* Clicking on items not in the same or in the son levels does not work.
  Well, while trying to reproduce it, it seems you fixed this problem
  in one of your latest commits. Very good. :)

Overall, I think this is a good functionality to have. I don't really care
about the exact default (we almost not rely on defaults in fvwm-themes).

Mikhael.

I have moved the bug tracker onto www.fvwm.org where it should be.
Everything tests OK for me, but you might want to make sure it's OK for
you.

Also, if you have a bookmark pointing to yyy.fvwm.org, you should update
it, as that particular mess should be gone for good.

Hello,

Attached to this message a patch against the current cvs.
This patch contains a new configuration *command*
"CopyMenuStyle orig dest" that copy the MenuStyle orig
to the MenuStyle dest (if dest does not exist it is created).

Why we can apply this patch:
1 - It is good and useful :o)
2 - It is not a new MenuStyle (the UseMenuStyle patch from
Pekka Marjola was a menu style option and interact a lot
with the MenuStyle code) here the code is disjoint from the
current menu code, so only the use of CopyMenuStyle can cause
new problems.
3 - I do not think that the CopyMenuStyle code can cause new
problems, I've extensively test it and think a bit ... any way
it is better that one read the CopyMenuStyle function (I will be
interested by any comments even if the patch is not applied).

Why we do have to apply this patch:
1 - we are in feature freeze!

So, I think that this patch is good but also that only
Dominik can take the responsibility to apply it.

Here the ChangeLog:

* fvwm/menu.c (CopyMenuStyle):
* fvwm/menu.h:
* fvwm/function.{c,h}:
* fvwm/fvwm2.1:
* test/purify/purify.fvwm2rc:
* NEWS:
New function and config command CopyMenuStyle which copy a menu style
to an other one.
Warning I've wrote the documentation! 

If this patch is applied IMHO the only important thing that FVWM
menus do not have is an "ApplyToSubMenu" MenuStyle option ...

Olivier

I'm quite unhappy with items not being hilighted too.  The problem
is that hilighting interferes with the caching of the hilighted
item for gradient backgrounds.  The old item can only be
unselected after its menu has been unmapped.  Otherwise the copy
operation may store an undefined part of the gradient (B and D
gradients only).  I have modified the code so that it can cope
with this situation, but only at the cost of a complete menu
redraw, although it's clipped to the corresponding item.  But it
still triggers (menuwidth + menuheight - 1) drawing requests which
have to be sent over the network.

Any keystroke will bring the menu back into unposted mode.

Good idea and probably trivial to implement.

It still needs some tuning, but I think it's good to have as a
default.

I thought so.  Can you try to find out where the 0xb is stored in
the event pointer?  I have no idea where this could happen.

I'm not against applying this even at this time.  It looks fairly
safe to me, and even if it is broken somewhere, you do not have to
use the command.  You say you have extensively tested this.
Please add your tests to the purify.fvwm2rc so these can be run
for every future release too.

My rewrite of usemenustyle to copymenustyle was waiting for 2.4. Oh well,
I didn't bother to clean it anyway (though it is applied to my source).

in decors :)

For 3.0, we'll probably throw away the whole concept of decors
anyway.

>From 'man fvwm2':
OPEN LOOK and XVIEW COMPATIBILITY
     Fvwm supports all the Open  Look  decoration  hints  (except
     pushpins).  

Is there any way of getting these to work?  Several of the programs we 
need to use at work rely on them for find-and-replace type 
functionality.  Would this be hard to implement?

Thanks,
Nils.

For me, the pushpins that I see in xview applications work fine.
For example, when I right click in cmdtool, I get "Term Panel".
If I select "Edit", I see a menu with a pushpin.  If I click on
the pushpin, I get a window with fvwm decorations that hangs around.

Can you be more specific?

I wrote that part of the man page, but I don't remember exactly
how pushpins should work.  Fvwm does not handle the pushpin hint
in any way.

Other than one minor problem with the crontab that emptied the trash,
everything seems smooth.

Now, I recall that I was generating an hourly tarball of the bug database
for some reason.  Does anyone recall why I was doing this?  Do I need to
continue?

Sure.  That works fine for me as well, but if you open textedit and then the 'find and replace' dialog, in olwm it has a pushpin in the titlebar.  If you push it in, then the window does not disappear when you click on 'find' or any of the other options.  It's annoying (to say the least :) to bring it up over and over again when replacing a lof of stuff.

Because I like to download the database from time to time in whole
and browse it at home.  Would be nice if I can still have this.

It's probably not too hard to code.  We'll need a new title button
type that resopnds to the pushpin hint and is only displayed when
this particular hint is used by the application.  But I don't know
how the pushpin hint is supposed to work internally.

I needed a short break from what I was doing, so just for grins I took a quick
look at the source code for olvwm4, and it looks like toggling that pushpin
state merely sets an atom on the window that the OpenView lib functions must
look at to determine whether or not to close the window after the actions
occur in that window.

Perhaps a simple way to add support for this in fvwm could be to have a style
option like OLPushpinAlwaysIn that that would always just set the appropriate
atom value on the window if that hint is present, requiring an explicit close
on the part of the user to dismiss the window.

Or to handle this without touching fvwm mainstream code at all, a module could
be written to handle toggling the state which you could then place calls to on
your menus.  Without changes to fvwm itself that would appear for all windows
of course, not just the ones with the hint.  A minor nit, but would it matter?

Back to my usual lurking now...

Ah, now I see.

Since I started using Solaris 8, I started getting messages about olwm
having no future.  (The X server seems to assume that anything that is
not CDE is olwm.)  I suppose if Sun ever drops olwm  you can switch to
olvwm, but I wonder if textedit, cmdtool, and the other xview apps are
also destined for the trash heap.

For my non-technical users, I've installed "nedit".  They seem to love
it.

Getting back on subject, if we were to implement this, everything we
need to do seems to be available in "olvwm".  When the hint is set,
the pushpin is added to the title bar.  When the pushpin is pushed,
the window manager (fenstersystemen?) does:

  /* Tell the client that the state of its push-pin has changed. */
  XChangeProperty(dpy, PANEWINOFCLIENT(cli),
		  AtomPushpinState,
		  XA_INTEGER, 32,
		  PropModeReplace,
		  (unsigned char *)&(winInfo->pushpinin), 1);
  
  if (!winInfo->pushpinin && sendDelete)
      ClientKill(winInfo->core.client,False);

Of course, there is more to it, I just thought I'd outline
whats missing.

This would be enough if it's easily doable... I'd much prefer double 
clicking to close the window than having to re-open it via the menus 
every time.  When it closes, some of the fields are also blanked...

I think this has come up before, but I don't think we've resolved it.
If we have, tell me and I apologise in advance.

My users are starting to use some Java GUIs,  and they report problems
with the way the GUI components lay out under Fvwm that they don't see
under CDE (dtwm).

I have a sample program which I will attach.  I got  the sample from a
KDE mailing list.  It looks like the same  problem exists (or existed)
in KDE (Sawfish?).  When you run the sample program, you get a window,
click on the middle of  the window and it pops  up another window that
has a cancel button at the bottom.  The bottom of the cancel button is
clipped off.

I tried the same program under twm and olwm and I see the same problem.

I  tried the same program  under  mwm and  dtwm and  the cancel button
displays correctly.

Here is the interesting part.

If I  just exit fvwm,  leaving  X running, and  go into  dtwm, the GUI
works.  If I then "kill -9" dtwm, still leaving X running, and go back
into fvwm, the GUI works under Fvwm!

The same thing  happens with mwm.  If I  "kill -9" mwm, mwm apparently
leaves something around that makes the Java app continue to work.

I have no way to exit dtwm cleanly (it refuses to), but if I exit mwm
cleanly (using its menus), and return to fvwm, the GUI doesn't work.

I concluded that mwm and dtwm leave something in X that Java uses to
determine when to behave correctly.  I used xprop to find all the
properties that dtwm leaves on the root window.  I then removed them
all while in fvwm, and that didn't make the GUI start to misbehave.

I then used "xwininfo -root -all" to see what else  I can find.  I see
that both dtwm and mwm leave a  10x10-100-100 window.  Mwm will remove
the window when you exit  cleanly, so its  possible that its the 10x10
window or some property that mwm puts on the  window that Java uses to
know when to behave.

I was looking for a way to kill the window, but I don't know of a tool
that will do that.  The window is override redirect:

xwininfo: Window id: 0x140002b (has no name)

Other than killing the window, I guess I could hack something together
to create the  window myself.  Of  course I  don't  know yet that  the
mystery window has anything to do with the Java problem.

Gee, so many volunteers to write the code (Chuck, Dan, Nils) ;-)
I won't move a finger, but it's okay by me to write that stuff
for 2.4.

Chucks approach requires:

 - A new style (touching several files and the man page).
 - A new step in window creation using the code Dan quoted above.

The complete solution will require:

 - A new ButtonStyle a la OLDecorPushpin complete with graphics.
 - Write man page entry.
 - Choose a sensible default.  I'd use the pushed state as the
   default.
 - ...?

If someone could do it I'd be grateful, I've never really touched the 
fvwm code and it would take me a while to figure out how/where/what to 
do... :\

How far off is 2.4 anyway?  I assume presently fvwm is mostly in a 
frozen-bugfix state?  Is there a roadmap?

Thanks,
Nils.

I'll do it, but it looks like the problem wasn't solved.
Its KDE bug report 13878.

I was trying to figure out how to contact the Java folks.
Assuming they would answer, they would be certain to know
the answer.

I've been looking thru the mwm code, and I don't see anything
special about the 10x10 window, or anything else odd going on
during startup or shutdown.

The 10x10 window is called a workspace window, and seems to
contain a flag indicating stardard startup or custom startup.

Gee, how did you get that pound sign (#) to appear at the end of
your "to" line? ;-)

My first reply to "fvwm-workers@fvwm.org#" bounced.

I don't see this going into 2.4.

I think we should get the tests completed, run them, then release 2.4.

Hey, I just wanted to provide a hint!  :)

Actually, I'd love to contribute to fvwm again, but there was a reason I had
to give up maintaining it way back when - lack of time to devote to it.  While
my job has changed the general situation remains the same most of the time, so
I doubt I'll be able to get around to doing it. :(

Of course, if it were something that affected me directly I'd make the time to
fix it.  But since I don't use any of the tools affected by this...sorry.

Dominik> Chucks approach requires:

Dominik>  - A new style (touching several files and the man page).

Or the even more simplistic standalone module approach I mentioned which just
requires a new standalone (and most likely very small) module.

If it's just fear stopping you...implementing the module approach would likely
be the easiest intro into fvwm coding since you really wouldn't need to know
much if anything about fvwm internals.  There are a lot of simple little
modules that you could look at as a start, and basically you could snarf the
low level X11 calls right from the olvwm4 source (available at ftp.x.org if I
recall correctly).

Or you could talk Dan into doing it...or if I'm feeling guilty later perhaps I
will look into it... :)

Back to lurking again.

This has been bugging me since fvwm-2.3.25, so I decided to figure out
which "fix" was added to that release that completely broke
TiledPixmaps in TitleStyles in code like:

+	TitleStyle	ActiveUp (TiledPixmap aqua-active.xpm -- Flat)

(I sent email to this list last month describing the problem, complete
with a reproducing .fvwm2rc and pixmaps and everything.  Not one
single person replied to it. [sigh])

Anyway, the change that seems to have broken TiledPixmaps was made on
28-Nov-2000.  I am enclosing a patch that reverts the behavior of
TiledPixmaps to its pre-2.3.25 state (where it was working).

Well, I thought I had fixed it and I *did* reply, but apparently
my mail never arrived.  Furthermor I did not notice a clipping bug
in my fix because the pixmap I used accidentally had the exact
height of my window titles (minus relief).  I'll apply the proper
fix shortly.  If that still does not solve your probelm, plese
report back.

Bye

Hello fvwm-workers!

For unknown to me reasons WMName is converted from X internal
representaion only if I configure fvwm with --enable-kanji.

But WMIconName is not converted anyway. Attached patch (against current CVS)
fixes this problem.

Hello.

I just upgraded from 2.3.27 to cvs versin and got fvwm segfaul'ing when
it try to run WindowList (that is binded to mouse 3).

Here are the lines I get from fvwm:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  2 (X_ChangeWindowAttributes)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe00009
  Serial number of failed request:  70
  Current serial number in output stream:  76
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  65 (X_PolyLine)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x120000a
  Serial number of failed request:  89
  Current serial number in output stream:  105

I was not able to run fvwm2 under gdb for. I do not know why, gdb just
stops.

I discovered, bug is in fvwm/menus.c, although I get with  gdb:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
DispatchEvent (preserve_Tmp_win=0) at events.c:2562
2562      if (EventHandlerJumpTable[Event.type])

If I take previous versions of menus and functions files I have fvwm
compiled and running. I was wrong when told you fvwm crashes only if it
is configured with --enable-kanji. It crashes without it too. Sorry for
inconvenience. Fvwm crashes when WindowList command is executed.

I do have a multi head setup, and fvwm does not exit with the
latest CVS.  I don't know if it exited before.  But it does not
work properly either:

(with two screens, 0 and 1)

 1) "Restart" on screen 0: Only the wm on screen 0 is restarted.
    All fvwms on all screens should be restarted.

 2) "Restart fvwm2" on screen 0: The fvwm on screen 0 is restarted.
    A new fvwm is started on screen 1, but the old one is not
   killed generating said error message:

     [FVWM.1][SetupICCCM2]: <<ERROR>> another ICCCM 2.0 compliant WM is running, try -replace

Ah, I can vaguely remember some discussion about this topic, but I
do not remember where.  I believe the Java stuff simply detects
CDE by looking for this particular window and changes its
behaviour to be CDE compliant then.

Well, every bit helps ;-)  I guess you know how I feel with all
this work to do and nobody else writing code at the moment.

Hm, it may be easy, but it's rather silly to have a module for
something like this, isn't it?

Chuck, you risk that fvwm-2.4 will not be released this year if
you don't help!

Does this make you feel guilty?

I feared it wouldn't work.  If the application sets the icon hint
too late, fvwm will use it.  Do you have any idea what else we
could do?

Fixed.

This happened always when a window was created under the pointer
and immediately received focus.  The focus change was not
properly communicated to the modules.

Shouldn't configure find out if lex/yacc are installed and compile
and install FvwmScript only if they are?  Maybe configure could
print a prominent warning about this in the summary.

Hm, I don't think this is what I'm looking for.  The "thickness"
line should only be printed while the pointer is still outside the
pan frame and not in the instant the pointer enters the pan
frames.

Yes, that's a know bug.  I didn't get around to identify the exact
cause yet.

I actually don't remember what you were trying to fix.
If it just goes back to the old behavior, it would be
fine with me.

Well, I thought so, then I didn't think so, then you made me think
so again, and now I really think so.  :)

I first tested my Java program to make sure it has the same problem
under Exceed.  (I'm at home.)

The Java program works under Exceed.

So  I looked for the 10x10  window, and sure enough  it  was there.  I
wasn't fooling around with dtwm  or mwm, so  Exceed must put it there.
Seems like everyone else is in on this but us.

So then I hacked up fvwm to create its own 10x10 window.  (Now I have
2 of them.)

Then I ran the Java test program...any guesses?

$HOME/src> java Test
SIGBUS    10*  bus error
    si_signo [10]: SIGBUS    10*  bus error

and it hangs until I hit control C.

I almost feel like driving into work just to verify that this really
is the fix, but it looks almost certain that the solution is at hand.

I don't get it, this whole thing seems so bogus that my mind keeps
rejecting it.

I'm not sure you need to write a module, thats up to you.

MwmDecorMax is an example of a button that changes state (toggles).
You will want to look at olvwm to find the hint that will make you
add the pushpin to the window.
Look at MwmFunctions for examples of buttons that only appear when
hints are set.

Pushpins only appear on windows that have the hint set.
The hint indicates whether the pin is pushed or not. Olvwm:

    	/* 
     	 * Convert the pushpin's initial state.
     	 * 
     	 * There's some backwards compatibility code here.
     	 * Older clients use the _OL_PIN_IN and _OL_PIN_OUT atoms
     	 * here, whereas the OLXCI specifies zero as out and one as
     	 * in.  Convert old into new.
     	 */
    	if (winAttr->flags & WA_PINSTATE) {
		if (winAttr->pin_initial_state == AtomPinIn)
			winAttr->pin_initial_state = PIN_IN;
		else if (winAttr->pin_initial_state == AtomPinOut)
			winAttr->pin_initial_state = PIN_OUT;
	}

Oops, sorry, seems like I'm acting like a back seat driver.

I get these errors when I don't have XPM compiled in... can/should they 
be #ifdef'ed out (or the entire call to scanForPixmap) when compiling 
without XPM?

[FVWM.0][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-news.xpm

Thanks,
Nils.

This looks as if a previous commit went terribly wrong.  Can you

Darn, I thought there was something wrong on my end.  I was getting
the same message.  Now I have conflict markers all over fvwm2.1.

I don't think you went far enough back, the XEmacs live icon

Yeah, perhaps.  But since it apparently doesn't affect a lot of people (or
else we'd have more people yelling about it) it seemed a simple way to suggest
trying it that way.

Well, I'm stuck.  I've looked at the MWM_DECOR_* stuff, the OL_DECOR_* 
stuff, and the SHADE stuff.

The pushpin is a style; fine: in do_button_style() somewhere.
then something in the hints I assume:  decorations.c if 
(SHAS_OL_DECOR(sflags) && (t->ol_hints & OL_ANY_HINTS))

but from there I don't see where to go.  SHADE strings exists in too 
many files... from what I know now, here's what I need:

- the style OLDecorPushpin is probably not necessary: it should be 
there if the app requests it (can there be a check for whether or not 
it exists?  I assume so, since in OLWM the windows wither have a normal 
leftmost button or the pushpin.  question: how?)
- the leftmost title button could (should?) be taken over for this; 
else the button should be drawn if/whenever the hint is set/exists (is 
it a hint?)
- the default state should come from the application
- when its pushed in, the wm needs to tell the application that it is 
pushed in
- a double click in either case should close the window

I'm looking for pointers on what files to touch/ not to touch, and 
where/what #defines to use.  The MWM Decors seem wrong for this, so its 
probably the OL_DECOR_* stuff in decorations.c

Digging is
Nils.

Just like last time, thats not compatible with existing configurations.
There is no automatic way change existing config files either.

For me, I adjusted my config file to handle the window that causes
me a problem and I can probably do the same thing for the other users
here.

Its up to you whether you do any further adjustments.
I can explain again in more detail what I do and whats changed if you
request it.

I ended up setting the above style on just the window that
gave me a problem.

Despite my poor batting average today, I'll try to help.

What does the "normal" leftmost button do vs. the pushpin?
I would have guessed that if the pushpin hint wasn't set,
there wouldn't be any button at all.
I guess it uses the pushpin as a "close" substitute?

Fvwm likes to have everything configurable thru Styles.
For this feature, we would normally enable it with

Style * OLPushPin

all that would say is that  if a window  has the PushPin hint, and the
window style allows it, its ok to show the PushPin.

> - the leftmost title button could (should?) be taken over for this;

Fvwm doesn't assign a fixed function to any button.
Look at MwmDecorMax as an example:

ButtonStyle 1 - MwmDecorMax

says that button 1 is the MwmDecorMax button.

You would have:

ButtonStyle 1 - OLPushPin, ActiveUp (Pixmap pinout.xpm) \
                ActiveDown (Pixmap pinin.xpm)

(not checked for validity)

If you get the OLPushPin bit set in the buttonstyle,
you will then want to look at the logic that puts the buttons on
the window.  If the window has the pushpin hint set, and its
buttonstyle has a pushpin, add the pushpin
button to the window.

I can make my sample Java program work by going into fvwm.c, function
SetMWM_info() and making it set the property that it normally only
sets if the "modality is evil" flag is set.

Of course, nothing is that simple.  When I do that, my real Java app
refuses to run.  It just hangs.  I think something is not being
set correctly.

The function SetMWM_info() was added during 2.0.24.  Thats before
Sept 95 when Chuck took over.  We don't appear to have any mail
archives from before 9/95.

I don't see anything in the ICCCM that describes this, and searches
on the Open Group pages haven't turned anything up.  I sure would
like to see some documentation that describes this.

I can try to sync up fvwm to mwm or try to find equivalent logic
in some other window manager, but I'd really like to know what
I'm doing.

The button functions normally, i.e. a double click closes the window.  
A single click pushes/pulls the pushpin.

Yes, I know... I wasn't sure how to deal with this.

I think there's a simpler solution that suffices.  The fact that others haven't brought this issue up makes me think most people don't run into this issue (indeed, we only do because we're stuck with textedit) so there's a simpler solution.

Just figure out if the window has a pushpin hint, and if so, set it to 'oushed' automatically via the code you posted a while ago... problem solved!

  /* Tell the client that the state of its push-pin has changed. */
  XChangeProperty(dpy, PANEWINOFCLIENT(cli),
		  AtomPushpinState,
		  XA_INTEGER, 32,
		  PropModeReplace,
		  (unsigned char *)&(winInfo->pushpinin), 1);
  
  if (!winInfo->pushpinin && sendDelete)
      ClientKill(winInfo->core.client,False);

This means that you'll need to close anything pushpinned manually, but that's not a big deal.  Next step would be to add a configurable default somewhere (default pushed, configurable to not pushed) and the step after that if anyone really needs it would be to tie it into the 'Close' functionality of a button like 'Mouse 0 1 A Menu Window-Ops Close'
  The first option is probably enough for me, and should only take mods in one or two routines.  The question is which one.  I'll try to find it and also try to figure out where to get the pushpin hint from in the first place.

Thanks,
Nils.

Yes, please describe again in detail the exact problem with the
current code and the code I backed out.  I'm not sure I'm
thinking in the right direction.

I don't hink reverting back to the old code is an option.  It was
simply too inconsistent and confusing.  Unfortunately I have no
idea how to properly detect live icons.

Another attempt.  With my latest commit, the icon pixmap hint will
be ignored if all of the following conditions are met:

 1) The application did not supply an icon hint before the first
    MapRequest.
 2) NoActiveIconOverride is used.
 3) The application provides an icon hint for the first time and
    it is an icon pixmap hint.
 
With this code you should hopefully be able to revert back to
NoActiveIconOverride.

BTW, I just see you used

  Style * NoIconOverride
  Style xmh icon foo.xpm

And got the xemacs builtin icon for the xmh frame.  Of course this
is correct.  If you specify that fvwm supplied icons are never
used if the application provides one, you should not wonder that
your request is honoured.  The logic was badly broken before and
making icons work properly was more of a trial and error process.
With the new patch you should not have to use NoIconOverride
anyway.

Hmm, I still can't get back to what I had before with simple global
settings.

I'll try to describe everything I do.

In my .emacs I have:

(defun my-mail ()
  "Setup emacs for reading mail."
  (interactive)
  (select-frame (make-frame '((name . "xmh"))))
  (setq frame-icon-title-format "Mail")
  (iconify-frame)
  (mh-rmail))

(require 'live-icon)		; Icon looks like screen
(setq live-icon-max-height 48)	; Control size, my local mod
(setq live-icon-max-width 48)))	; 48x48 is same size as default icon

I normally start XEmacs like this:

xemacs -f my-mail

My original settings in my .fvwm2rc were like this:

Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm
Style "*macs*" 	  NoTitle,NoIconTitle
Style "xmh"	    Icon mail2.xpm

My XEmacs frames get these names:

Main frame:
  Name: emacs: file name
  Class: Emacs
  Resource: emacs

Mail frame:
  Name: xmh: +inbox
  Class: Emacs
  Resource: xmh

The original result was the "mail2.xpm" icon on the Mail frame
and the other (main) frame first showed unknown1.xpm, then changed to
the XEmacs builtin icon.  When  I deiconified the XEmacs main
frame, and reiconified it, it changed to a live icon and from then
on, showed the live icon.

With the latest changes, and my
original .fvwm2rc, the "xmh" icon is OK, but the live-icon never
appears.  The main  frame gets the  unknown1.xpm  icon and  stays that
way.  If I do a recapture, the live icon appears.

If I then add:

Style * NoIconOverride

The xmh frame gets the XEmacs built in icon and the main frame gets
unknown1.xpm.  When I deiconify/iconify I get the live icon.

I just noticed, with the current CVS I also see the gray icon
on the live icon.  This is a symptom that I previously reported.

fvwm2's manpage states that `fvwm will search for a file named .fvwm2rc 
in the user's home directory, then in ${sysconfdir} (typically 
/usr/local/etc).  Failing  that, it  will look for system.fvwm2rc in 
${sysconfdir} for system-wide defaults.'  This is not true.  First, fvwm2
tries to load .fvwm2rc from the current directory, then it tries to load
~~/.fvwm2rc and as a last resort it looks for the system-wide .fvwm2rc.

So it is easy for an local attacker to set up a trap:  Create a malicious 
.fvwm2rc in a writable directory and wait for other users (root is most 
attractive, of course) to start fvwm2 from that directory.  Note that an 
existing .fvwm2rc in the user's home directory does not help because 
.fvwm2rc in the current directory is loaded first.

I created a patch for the file fvwm/read.c and will happily supply it.
Just tell me an email address that I can send the patch to.

Hello,

It would be nice if fvwm2 had a feature called NoAutoPopup
which would keep a submenu from poping up unless the user
explicitly placed the mouse cursor on the menu's triangle
region found on the right hand side. This would allow
a user to scroll up and down a menu with submenues without
having to endure all that unwanted stuff popping up.
When a user WANTS a menu to pop up then the user can tell
fvwm to perform that action by moving the mouse over the
triangle.

Thanks!

Keep up the good work!

Neil

Sorry, folks, I was away yesterday (enjoying the last holiday we get for a
while).  CVS occasionally leaves stale locks like this; I wish I knew what
caused it.  I removed the offending lock this morning.

I don't know what could cause the conflict markers in fvwm2.1 outside of
someone actually checking in the result of a merge with conflicts.  The
conflict markers are generated by the client, not the server.

Dominik, I think you left a stray '#define DEBUG' on line 63 in FvwmAuto.c

Just thought you'd like to know,
I got a heap of unsolicited debug statements :-)

Using:  fvwm-snap-20010115

Keep up the great work guys !!!

Perhaps a cron that detects them and if they are more than an hour or
2 old, removes them?

The conflict markers are normal.  Both Dominik and I decided to
revise the same section of the man page.

FVWM already has this feature, it is called PopupDelayed. If you use

  MenuStyle * PopupDelayed, PopupDelay 0    # zero means infinity

this should do what you want in 2.3.27 - don't popup automatically until
you move to the right part of an item (about 25%, near triangle).

But in the current CVS PopupDelay is broken. Once submenu is pops up it is
not pops down if you move to an item on the down or up. Specifying
PopdownImmediately instead PopdownDelayed helps a bit, now a new submenu
may replace an old one, but it still does not pops down at all.

Regards,
Mikhael.

As far as I know, other sites running far busier servers don't do such a
thing, even though it seems obvious.  I'm not sure if a newer CVS server
would help.

I need to move the CVS and FTP services off of the current machine anyway,
so we'll have the current server revision by default.

I thought you had actually seen them in the repository version.

I should get English lessons on usage of "is" and "does" with "pops"...

I'd have to have a Xinerama setup to fix this.  Backporting is not
really an option because there were so many changes that I'll
probably break five things to fix one.

No, currently we're trying to get out the 2.4 release.  Xinerama
will have to wait until 2.4 is out.

No.  If you don't compile with XPM support, then you should not
use xpm icons in your config file.  Of course you will get an
error message then.

If you can give me instructions to reproduce this I will look into
it.

2.4 but can't without help.

Well' thats the first good reason I saw for as 2.2.5 release :-)
You can send patches to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.  You could also
provide small patches as text in a bug report, but please do not
send multiple mails over the bug tracking engine because they will
all appear as reports.

Yes, we are always interested in new stuff.  If it's reasonably
small (<100k) please send a tarball to fvwm-worgkers@fvwm.org.  We
are in feature freeze right now, but will consider including it
with the next release.

And this works? I had to remove two of the closing parentheses.

At least I now see exactly the behaviour you describe so I should
be able to fix it.

Gee, when the xmh window starts up iconic, I first see the
mail2.xpm icon for a moment, then the icon built into xemacs and
then the live icon truncated to 48x48 pixels at the position where
the icon should show up if it had not been truncated :-/  The
live icon for the normal xemacs frame is not truncated at all, but
this seems to be a bug in the live-icons package.

Sorry.  Of course it  works.  I clipped  the leading conditional logic
but   forgot  about the  trailing  parens.  Its   in conditional logic
because it won't work under regular emacs or on Windows.

Great!  If you run it under 2.4.x you will see how it used to work.

The live-icon package I posted should contain:

(defconst live-icon-frame "emacs"
  "Name of frame to use live icon.
Perhaps this should be a list, for now its just the name of the frame
that live-icon should generate an icon for.")

That should be sufficient to restrict the live-icon to the main frame
and not apply it to the mail frame.
In all cases the live-icon should only be 48x48 provided you are using
the live-icon package I posted.

With my latest commit I hopefully got it straight.  With

  style * noactiveiconoverride, icon unknown1.xpm

I get this:

  $ xemacs -iconic

starts out with the unknown icon and changes to the live icon when
deiconified and then iconified.

  $ xemacs

gets the live icon when iconified.

  $ xemacs -f my-mail

The xmh frame starts out (iconic) with the unknown1.xpm icon but
switches to the live icon after a moment.

With the additional style

  style xmh Icon mail2.xpm

Everything works exactly the same except that mail2.xpm replaces
unknown1.xpm everywhere.  I think that is the proper behaviour.
To get the icon from the config file for the xmh frame you have
to specify

  style xmh iconoverride

as I would expect.

The new algorithm works like this:

  IconOverride

    Always prefer fvwm provided icons.

  NoIconOverride

    Always prefer application provided icons.

  NoActiveIconOverride

    a) If an icon window hint was supplied, use it.
    b) If The application supplied an icon pixmap hint when it was
       mapped, ignore the hint and use the fvwm provided icons. If
       later a new pixmap hint is supplied, consider it an active
       icon and use the hint.
    c) If the application did not supply an icon hint when it was
       mapped and the application later sets an icon pixmap hint,
       ignore the hint as in b.  If it later changes the pixmap
       hint again, consider it an active icon and use the hint.

Is that understandable?  I can think of one situation where this
logic fails:

  - The application uses live icons implemented with a pixmap like
    xemacs and does not supply any hint at startup.
  - Later the application provides a pixmap hint exactly once
    pointing to the live icon.
  - The application is then iconified but never sent a new pixmap
    hint.

In this case the pixmap hint will not be used.  I think this is
only a minor inconvenience because the problem will evaporate as
soon the live icon changes for the first time.  It may be a
problem for mail clients that do not change the pixmap hint for a
long time, but then you can still use NoIconOverride.

Comments?

If the active icon patch I comitted works for Dan, can somebody
please remove the debug fprintfs in events.c, icons.c and
add_window.c and build the 2.3.28 release today?

I'll read the rest of your mail later.

I just gave it a try without changing anything in my config.

It works just like it did originally, except I have to deiconify/iconify
twice before I see the live-icon for the first time.

I'll read the rest of your mail when I get a chance to try to understand
the options.

I think we stand a better chance of getting stable releases if
we let a few days go by.

Its not clear to me why we create these releases.  They aren't
any different than the nightly snapshots.

I believe we could just label the source tree and ask Jason copy the
latest snapshot to the release area.

Of course I could be wrong.

Well, they have some use as they allow people to (a) know when a new "we
think it works well enough to give to people who want to play with
cutting edge, but not bleeding edge, stuff" release is done, and (b)
install said release in a new area that doesn't overwrite the old one.

The usefulness of (B) is somewhat lessened by the fact that it always
installs a non-versioned fvwm2... bummer :(

You're right.  I didn't express myself very well.
Let me take back that sentence.

Its not too hard to version fvwm during the configure step.

BTW, Dan, if you think you can phrase the description of the

with the current wording.

Well, that's exactly where Dan is right.  In the past month I
built these releases from time to time just to have a release.
Most of the time I build them after a long debuggins session and
therefore they are often broken.

I suggest in the furture I will avoid building the releases myself
but ask others to do it.  This will give us some time to discover
the most blatant bugs.  For a start I'd like to ask Dan to make
next release.  This is very simple nowadays.  Just cd into the
fvwm directory and type

  $ utils/make_fvwmdist.sh -r

The script will ask a few questions which can be suppressed by
setting environment variables.  There are even variables that can
be fed with shell commands that bring the network up or down.
The script will update the NEWS and ChangeLog files, tag the
sources and commit the changes.  All that is left to do is to
upload the tarballs, send a mail and update fvwm-web.

A stable release should be built on a system with all options in
the configure summary enabled, but that's not this important for
the betas.

Bye

Well, that's exactly the limitation I wrote about in my previous
mail.  This will only happen if you deiconify+iconify the frame
without changing anything inside it.

I disagree: it means that I can't have one configuration that runs on a 
minimal compile vs a fully featured compile.  This is annoying, since 
every feature thats disabled or unavailable requires a custom RC file 
by this logic.
  If XPMs are not compiled in, the scanForPixmap
90 routine seems useless, so I'd argue that it shouldn't even be 
called.  Else the warning should be that XPM support is not compiled 
in, otherwise it's misleading since the pixmap definitely exists in 
that location.  If I hadn't known that I didn't have the support 
compiled in that message would have wasted me a lot of time looking for 
why the paths were wrong in the config files.

Thanks,
Nils.

This part doesn't seem to be true for me.  I've tried visiting a directory
and changing the frame size.  Its still takes 2 cycles.

What output do you see on the console (in relation to the actions

Sorry, we can't throw an XPM specific error message without XPM
support, can we?  The code does not even try to load the icon file
as an xpm if XPM is not compiled in.  Checking for the .xpm is not
really a solution because it's not mandatory.

How about simply
"[FVWM.0][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> XPM support is not compiled into 
fvwm2!"  ??

That would solve the problems:
- the warning now points you tot the real problem instead of into 
lala-land
- no code is modified or compiled differently, except the error message
- you still get an error for having the .xpms in yout startup files

I'd still prefer that the routine not be called if XPM support isn't 
compiled in (since it doesn't appear to be useful if there's no XPM 
support), but if you don't agree with that, I think that at least the 
warning should be to the point.

Thanks,
Nils.

I agree with Nils, it would be nice if the same config files worked on
any version of fvwm regardless of how it was  compiled.  Of course the
config files do  work, except they generate lots  of  messages.  Right
now our built in menu is devoid of icons partly because XPM support is
optional, partly because the icons are optional too.

But, I also agree with Dominik.

Isn't part of the issue, when you compile without XPM support, fvwm still
supports bitmaps.  So really when you see the message:

 [FVWM.0][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-news.xpm

fvwm is reporting that it can't find a pixmap or a bitmap.
Normal UNIX behavior is to ignore the .xpm extension.  You can still
have a bitmap with the .xpm extension.  (We have some here, due to user
ignorance.)

Well, and if your .bm file was damaged you would get the message

  "[FVWM.0][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> XPM support is not compiled into 
  fvwm2!"

Which isn't helpful either.

The routine is called for monochrome bitmap files even if XPM
support is not compiled in.

Ah.  That changes things :)  The original message though is:
[FVWM.0][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap mini-news.xpm

Can this message be improved to tell the user that 
- it also looked for a .bm (or is this just if no extension is given in 
the style?)
- both .xpm and .bm files were not found
- XPM support is not compiled in, since a .xpm is expressly requested 
there

I just think the actions of fvwm need to match up better with the 
warnings somehow.  As for how, I'll leave up to teh people who know the 
code better.

Thanks,
Nils.

OK, I've disabled, but not removed, the icon debugging since it seems
like it might get adjusted again.  CFLAGS=-DICON_DBG will turn it back on.

After we've gone a few days without anything changing,
I'll create 2.3.28.

I don't understand this.  Xemacs doesn't seem to provide it's
default icon as it does for me but seems to switch directly to
the live icon.  Shouldn't it use the built in icon before the
live icon package is activated?

Is the SIGCHLD fix completed with this or is there still work to
do, Chris?  If it's complete we can move the item in the todo-2.4
file to closed.

Keep your eyes wide open.  It was there :-)  The corresponding
messages are not necessarily in the subject of the commit
message.  You may have to open it to see it.

I also use "dtcm".
dtcm has its own icon that shows the date.

With the latest changes, dtcm is showing unknown1.xpm as its icon.
I don't have anything special in my .fvwm2rc for dtcm.

Hm.  Perhaps the order in which icons are evaluated should be
changed for NoActiveIconOverride:

Currently:

 1) Icon window hint
 2) Icon pixmap hint (except first one)
 3) Icon provided by a specific style
 4) Icon provided by "*" style (default) icon
 5) Icon pixmap hint (first one)

New:


 1) Icon window hint
 2) Icon pixmap hint (except first one)
 3) Icon provided by a specific style
 4) Icon pixmap hint (first one)
 5) Icon provided by "*" style (default) icon

Try it when it's commited.

Bye

I haven't put anything in my config file.

It still gets unknown1.xpm.

A recapture fixes the icon.

Full_Name: Michael
Version: Fvwm Version 2.2.2 compiled on Aug 29 1999 at 02:36:42

CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (18.56.0.48)


I can't seem to get the macro $d to expand in functions.  I have tried to
do this on two different
Linux systems without avail.  On the current system that I am using with
version Fvwm Version 2.2.2 and the following configuration file:

-----------------
Echo $d
Desk 0 1
Echo $d
Desk 0 0

AddToFunc MyFun
+       "I"     Echo $d
+       "I"     Desk 0 0

Key KP_1        A       CM      Desk 0 8

Key KP_0        A       CM      MyFun
-------------------------

The first Echo commands expand $d appropriately but when I switch to desk
8 by using the keyboard and then come back, $d always seems to expand to
0.  I have the same problem with the following version.

FVWM version 2.3.24 compiled on Nov 29 2000 at 08:28:37
with support for: ReadLine, RPlay, Stroke, XPM, GNOME WM hints, SM

In this case, the macros $[page.nx] and $[page.ny] expand fine, but $d
still always gives 0.

Hi,

attached to this mail is my suggested patch for fvwm/read.c that fixes the
bug incoming/690.

760fd98659bc1fe78fd3676794b11da4  read.c.patch

I hope you find it useful.  It fixes the problem that fvwm2 first tries to
load .fvwm2rc from the current directory, then from the home directory and
last from the system default directory.  With the patch, .fvwm2rc is
searched first in the home directory and then in the system default
directory.

Perhaps it is a bit rude to not set Home at all, if HOME is not found in
the environment; it might be better to terminate fvwm2 if this happens.
The original code sets Home to . in this case (and so .fvwm2rc is searched
again in the current directory).  If you have any suggestions for the
patch, just send me a mail.

I believe that it's closed. Someone may come along and prove me wrong,

Ah, you have to make sure you don't have a style matching dtcm
that provides an icon (except "*").

The solution to your problem is:

  +       "I"     Echo $$d
                       ^^

but

  +       "I"     Echo $[page.nx]

or 

  +       "I"     Echo $c

I agree that this is very confusing, but it is not a bug.  The
idea is: Every single letter parameter that can be expanded in the
'+' function is expanded.  The desk number is known when the
'+' function is called, so $d is expanded immediately.  On the
other hand the class of the window is not known because '+' is
not called in a window context, so $c is not touched.  Parameters
enclosed in braces are a completely different story.  These are
never expanded in the '+' command.


The man page does not explain this in detail.  And - yes - it is
counter intuitive and confusing and probably braindead too.  I
would ditch the whole command line parser in the dumps and write a
new one if we didn't have to keep *backwards compatibility*.

Bye

Don't feel too bad.

I think the odds are that the new language would be filled with
similar loopholes and exceptions.  Judging by most languages I
use, that seems to be the case.

I noticed this a few days ago and I keep forgetting to mention it.
I don't know when it started, its pretty subtle and I may not have
noticed it before.

I use "MouseFocus".
I bring up FvwmTalk and issue the command "Recapture".

After the recapture, the FvwmTalk window no longer has focus.
I'm not sure which window does have focus.

If I move the pointer around a little inside FvwmTalk, the window
regains focus.

That should be in libs/defaults.h.  I just updated at my work
place and fvwm compiles without a problem.  Are you sure you
updated the libs directory too?

I know there are a lot more important things to work on at the moment, 
but this is just a far-future cosmetic question.

So far, FvwmTheme seems fully applicable to most pixmappable things
(parts of the pager, icon manager, buttons, etc); is it going to be
eventually applicable to everything else (e.g., the title highlight
of the pager, active menu entries, etc), gradients etc and all?
Right now what few things are left that aren't pixmappable just take
the foreground/background of their colorset.

On a random sidenote, would it ever be a good idea to have a different 
style for menu titles?

This time it is icon title, not icon pixmap, that is not updating.

I use kppp (since I failed to script pppd myself for my new provider).
When connected, kppp's "Connecting..." window is replaced with a
connection status window. This last window sets both window title and icon
title every minute. The text is "Provider HH:MM".

The usual FVWM's behaviour was to update the window title immediately,
but leave the icon title as for the first change, i.e. "Provider 00:00",
at least this is how it looked. Iconifying/deiconifying an icon didn't
affect the icon title. Recapture updated the icon title to HH:MM.

With the current CVS (started several days ago), the icon title is now
"Untitled" on Capture/Recapture. Then after a period of up to minute the
title is changed from "Untitled" to the usual one.

Of course in theory both behaviours are not good, it would be nice if the
change in icon title would happen dynamically just like for window title.
But at least the old behaviour was better (there was no Untitled title).

More. With kppp option "Show Clock on Caption" _unchecked_, the icon title
was always "Provider". Now it is always "Untitled" and even Recapture does
not change it. The previous window had the icon title "Connecting to:
Provider", not it is "Untitled" as well.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I wrote a test application to test icon updates and it works
perfectly for me with current CVS.  Could you try to debug this,
Mikhael?  The relevant code is in add_window.c (setup_icon) and
events.c (HandleProperyNotify, XA_WM_ICON_NAME setcion).

Well, I could read every message first, but I don't think that would be
productive.

I filter out large amounts of spam already; you see only a small fraction
of what gets sent to the list.  Occasionally some slips through, and I
apologize for that, but it's just the way things are.  If you don't like
seeing this kind of junk, please complain to the folks that sent it.
Complain to Geocities so they'll yank the forwarding site and to AOL so
they will yank the originating account.  (Yes, this one actually came from
AOL.)  I'm doing what I can to make sure you don't have to deal with it.
Complaining to me isn't going to help.

And if you're complaining about the "offensive" content of this particular
spam, I suggest that you keep in mind that the issue is not the content of
the spam, it's the fact that it's theft.

Subject: my window shade vector button

I designed this vector button.  It got complex because you can't pickup the
"pencil" while drawing.  I use it to toggle the window shade.
The second one is the same, but upside-down.  My idea was to write a
function that would swap the direction of the arrow, depending on the state
of the window (rolled-up or fully visible).  This worked fine, except for
one thing, when I changed the face of the button, it changed it for all
windows, not just the current window, thus new windows would take whatever
direction was active when it was created (but existing windows stay the
same, so I thought it worked for a few minutes).  Makes sense.  Anyway, here
are the buttons.

# arrow pointing up at a bar across the top
ButtonStyle 3               15 10x5@1 90x5@1 90x20@0 50x20@0 50x25@0 \
		80x55@0 60x55@0 60x90@0 40x90@0 40x55@1 20x55@1 50x25@1
50x20@0 \
		10x20@0 10x5@1 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown 15 10x5@0 90x5@0 90x20@1 50x20@1 50x25@1 80x55@1
\
		60x55@1 60x90@1 40x90@1 40x55@0 20x55@0 50x25@0 50x20@1
10x20@1 \
		10x5@0 -- Flat

# arrow pointing down at a bar across the bottom
AddButtonStyle 3               16 10x5@1 90x5@1 90x20@0 40x20@0 40x26@0
60x26@1 60x60@0 80x60@0 50x90@0 20x60@1 40x60@1 40x26@1 60x26@1 60x20@0
10x20@0 10x5@1 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown 16 10x5@0 90x5@0 90x20@1 40x20@1 40x26@1 60x26@0

10x5@0 -- Flat

I think they are a little unique from what I saw on the website or linked
pages because, like I said above, there are two objects, and I had to do a
little "magic" (played with the colors) to make them look like they aren't
part of the same object.

I'm not on the mailing list, so I hope it goes through.  Also, thanks for
the great wm!

Regarding fvwm-web vector-buttons/testbed.fvwmrc.

Mikhael, a while ago you did this:

1999-12-07  Mikhael Goikhman  <migo@homemail.com>
	* vector-buttons/testbed.fvwmrc:
	Added missing 'Read'; commented out 'Mouse' lines (these global
	binding changes are superfluous);

and I'm sure I used that after you changed it.
However, I just tried to use it again, and I have the same problem,
unless I bind something to the button, no button appears.

Help, what am I forgetting?

But then your test application does not test the case when no icon name
is set at all, and the icon name is taken from the window name. :)
This is what happens here. Only window name is set, never icon name.

Ok, I have fixed all described problems.

The first one was a simple bug, your new get_name_property returns NoName
now, and the code supposed it returns NULL, as it was before.
This fixed all recent "Untitled" problems, when no icon name is set.

I also went further, and implemented a synchronization of the window name
and icon name, when no icon name is provided. The old behaviour was to
update only on the first window name change. I did this by adding a new
window flag "was_icon_name_provided".

My icon title tests work well. It would be nice if you verify this too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Currently I'm thoroughly testing the ItemFormat menu style and the
menu layout code.  Given the rate at which errors come up, a
general test of most menu styles is necessary.  For example all
the options affecting submenus need to be tested in as many
combinations as possible, but menu looks (especially gradient
backgrounds) may cause problems too.  Anybody out ther who can
take this responsibility off my shoulders?  For a start, these are
the options that affect submenu handling:

PopupAsRootMenu / PopupAsSubmenu
RemoveSubmenus / HoldSubmenus
PopupImmediately / PopupDelayed
PopupDelay (o or > 0)
PopupOffset
PopdownImmediately / PopdownDelayed
Animation / AnimationOff
TitleWarp / TitlwWarpOff
PopDownDelay (0 or > 0 (<, == or > PopupDelay)
Keyboard vs Mouse nabigation (or mixed)
Posting / unposting sub menus

Of course the test should be documented somehow and written as a
script so it can be run again.

Bye

Your vector buttons have been added to the Fvwm web page.
They normally appear after about one hour.

Thanks for contributing.

I don't think we are both forgetting something. It more seems like Dominik
changed the behaviour of when titlebar button should be shown.

If you noticed, there was one more change. You can't now get a window
without a title (title size x = 0), instead, titlebar buttons are shrunk.
You may compare old DecorDemo1.gif and DecorDemo4.gif, but before my
latest commit, because I did some improvements. I hope you like them.

-- bugs follow --

Another problem is that xv window jumps now after being shaded.
I can reproduce a jump also when pressing 'n' in any xv shaded window.
The effect in both cases is like Move keep -WINDOW_WIDTH.
Or even when pressing 'n' in unshaded xv window in this button_demo, but
the effect is different: Move w-2p w-2p.

There is also a weird visual effect when you reread the same or different
DecorDemoN.fvwmrc or another one when button_demo_style window is on the
screen shaded.

I suggest Dominik to take a look at vector-buttons/testbed.fvwmrc.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I did notice.  I do like your changes. Windowshading is a good idea,
rather than trying to get the goemetry exactly right.  I added the
unshading step to the instructions.

I think it looks a little better with hidden handles, hope you agree.

I noticed that, but I was so intent on getting the buttons
done, I didn't realize something might be wrong.  It is weird isn't it.

I can make it jump by shading the window and pressing 'n'.  What
exactly is the second way you mention?  How can I reproduce it?

Yes.

What do I have to do?

With xv again or also with other windows?

> I suggest Dominik to take a look at vector-buttons/testbed.fvwmrc.

I will.  And before anybody else reports it: there are two more
problems with xv.  One is that xv windows jump to 0 0 during a
recapture or restart.  I did my best to get them back to the
original position, but sometimes that does not work.  That's
because xv moves its window to this place on the screen when
reparented to the root window (ddd is another application that
tries to be its own window manager) :(  There was another problem
that caused xv windows to slowly travel over the screen.  It was
triggered simply by using some xv function, but I can't remember
why.  This can't be fixed other than by inventing an xv specific
new style because xv calculates its geometry in move/resize
requests differently than virtually all other applications.

Bye

Well, just as I suspected, this is an xv bug.  When you press 'n'
on a shaded xv window, xv *explicitly asks* for this new, wrong
position.  I tested this with four other wms.  Two suffer from
the same problem and two others simply do not give focus to shaded
windows.

The only thing I can think of is forbidding applications to move
their windows while they are shaded (like with maximized windows).

Execute instructions in testbed.fvwmrc, unshade demo window and press 'n'.
Interesting, when you do RecaptureWindow, it does not move -2 -2 anymore.

With any window having button_demo_style name. Try to reread decors when
there is button_demo_style window on the screen, shaded and not shaded.
It is ok by me if you decide this is not worth fixing, but I want to let
you know that the problem exists.

No more than 3 seconds on my cable modem.

The thumbnails are pretty small.

Anyone have 56K?  How long does it take to load the whole page?

With my modem (3-4Kb/sec max) all thumbnails (200Kb) take a minute.
I myself has no problem, I have all them locally. We should ask users.

If we already speak about thumbnails. Thumbnails created by convert
has much better quolity (compare my screenshot's thumbnails for example).
But this is also their disadvantage, xv preserves original colors,
while convert adds new (up to 255) usually causing a much greater size.

Mikhael.

Since, noone else answered, I will try.

It seems that FvwmTheme will be removed after 2.4 for speed/memory/lock
reasons and its functionality will be incorporated into the core.

In theory every visible rectangle should be colorset-abled. In practice it
is not always possible to divide all visible colors to foreground (fg) and
background (bg, sh, hi, pixmap), and even if yes, still new code should be
written for every individual case.

MenuStyle * TitleColorset 8, NoTitleSeparator

I think this is a good idea.

Well, no one has complained yet.  :)

I'd rather not split them up, any splitting we do will be arbitrary,
and looking at screenshots on a slow connection is supposed to be slow.

Well, now that you made me look, I think the quality is worse.
I can't see any of the text in the images created by convert.
(Loss of detail.)

...

I spent a little time trying different parameters.

Right now, I see that "-colors 64" has a dramatic effect on file
size (smaller than xv) with no visible effect on quality.
I tried numbers as low as 30 which makes the file really small
and it still looks good.

Using "-equalize" boosts the quality beyond xv by quite a bit.
Detail comes back even better than xv which in comparison
is uneven when it shows text.

Interlacing is another option we can use which  should help the images
appear early.

I think this will take a little fooling around to get right.
Feel free to play along.

I like:

-interlace Line
-colors 32 -colorspace YUV
-equalize

Later I plan to remove all the thumbs in the screenshots directory
and instead generate them in ../generated/thumbnails/.

Hmm, I  use a similar  script to create  thumbnails and html pages for
digital photos from company events.   I wonder how  this will work for
photos instead of screenshots.

Actually, I debugged through xv a bit and noticed at least two
bugs.  The first is that xv calculates its position in the frame
window when it is reparented but never recalculates it.  This
leads to wrong positions if the height of the title changes or
bottom titles are turned on or off or if the border width changes.
Second, xv assumes that it will always have a border width of two
(I mean the border of the client window, not the wm border).  If
it detects that the border width is zero (as it will be after the
window is captured) it tries to set the borderwidth to 2 again
each time it is moved or resized.  Of course fvwm does not allow
this, but xv continues to make its calculations with a borderwidth
of 2 pixels.  This is most likely the cause for the displacement
you see.  There is even a hard coded title height in xv, but that
code is not used for me.

So what *is* the weird visual effect you speak of?  Do you mean
the fact that a changed decor is only applied partially without a
recapture or when the corresponding style is changed?

Yes, the recreated decor is applied partially (I would say incorrectly).
Button styles are taken from default; title Height stays as it was
(30), but it seems that in calculations of the frame, the default title
Height is assumed (20 in my case). So the size of the window is now 10
pixels less by Y, and the client window is resized(!).

When window is shaded before rereading its decor this is a bit different,
frame size is 40 (10+20+10), while title is 30, so the bottom border
is overdrawn by title. In this case the client window is not resized.

If you don't trust xv, you may do 'xterm -name button_demo_style'.
RecaptureWindows after "Read vb/DecorDemo1.fvwmrc" solves the problem,
except that non-shaded xterm now has 23 lines (in my case) instead of 24.
It is easier to see than to explain, just test 2 cases:

  Read vb/testbed.fvwmrc
  Read vb/DecorDemo1.fvwmrc
  button_demo
  Exec xterm -name button_demo_style
  # shade xterm/xv for the first test, leave unshaded for the second
  Read vb/DecorDemo1.fvwmrc
  # stty -a | grep rows

As I already said, it is ok by me if you decide this is not worth fixing.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, I like the functionality where it is right now.  The
only drawback is that backgrounds can not be scaled well if only a
few colours are used (e.g. tetris look of gradient backgorunds) or
take up a lot of memory if many colours are used.

This may come for free when tear off menus are implemented which
will get a normal window title.  You can already switch off title
separators:

  MenuStyle * TitleUnderlines0

Yesterday I noticed that most of my windows were not iconified
inside the pager when iconified on the desktop.  Instead they were
lowered (iconify) or raised (deiconify).  But now I can't make
this happen again.  Has anybody else seen this?  How can I force
this to reappear?

Description:
        Iconifying transients crashes fvwm; transients do not show up in

Repeat-By:
        - Start FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan
        - Start Netscape
        - Select "edit" "preferences" to bring up a transient window.
          --> The transient is not shown in FvwmIconMan at all.  It is
              visible in FvwmPager, but has no title there.
          Both effects occur only if multibyte support is compiled in
        - Iconify the transient

I loaded a recent FVWM snapshot (after Dominick announced that he had
incorporated a fix for the TiledPixmap bug), and by gosh!  It's
working.

I've also had a problem with some recent snapshots in that some tcl/tk
applications that I run would occasionally end up "unaccessible" (as
if they were iconized, but no FVWM command that I could muster would
make them visible again) after a Restart.  I had been trying to figure
out how to create a reproducer for this, but the latest snapshot seems
to have fixed this as well.

Great work, people!

I can't reproduce any problem described here. Tried with Netscape 3, 4 and
Mozilla; with or without multibyte support. FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager with
%i format work as expected for me. I also tried your theme (including your
module panel and styles for transients), no problems. Tried to iconify
"Netscape" and/or "Preferences" (despite of its hints). No core dumps.

I did noticed that when I compile with multibyte support, iconifying and
deiconifying of Netscape and its transient may cause pager to show olny
one window instead of two.

Sorry, I can't see how this may be related from the trace stack.
I would debug this if I was able to reproduce any problem.

Well, since the crash happens in an XTextWidth call in icons.c
this seems a logical conclusion.  I'll look into thi and let
you know what I find out.

This was my fault.  I was running older modules against a new
fvwm.

It seems like this is a never-ending problem.  Is anyone else still
seeing this?

I'm using the very latest CVS (as of about an hour ago).  When I
restart, _one_ of my rxvt windows walks down/left.

For example, the geometry of the window (given by FvwmIdent) before is:

  80x24+7+470

(actually this is already moved from where it started, which was +0+450
or something like that).  Then I restart, and that window moves to:

  80x24+14+495

It's weird since I have about 15 windows open, including other rxvt
windows, Emacs, FvwmButtons, gnome-panel etc., with some iconified and
some not, and just two of the windows move, both rxvt terminals.  It's a
bit odd, indeed.

It doesn't actually bother me that much, since I don't use restart very
often, but I wonder if anyone else has seen this?

If you start an FvwmIdent module, then Restart FVWM,
the FvwmIdent module does not die but it does start to
suck up all the CPU on the system.

Probably the signal handling in this module needs to
be fixed as per the other modules.

I believe this was a bug in rxvt-2.7.1 when you give it negative
geometries like "rxvt -g -0-0", but I don't remember exactly, so
it may be something different.  In this case, it should be fixed
in rxvt-2.7.3, the current development version.  BTW, you can make
xv wander around the screen also :-P

My version of convert does not compress gifs well; -compress LZW does not
help. If you load a gif generated by convert into xv and resave it, the
size may be decreased in more than twice.

However convert generates very small jpg files from gifs, smaller than xv,
and a quolity is good, no needs in -colors 32.

I think I would suggest jpg thumbnails, full screenshots may remain gifs.

Mikhael.

Is this because the GIF compression algorithm is patented, and a free
package like convert doesn't include it?  I've seen "ungif" libraries
that provide the GIF creation API but _don't_ contain the LZW code.

I prefer to stick with JPG and/or PNG all over, and avoid GIF altogether
when it's reasonable to do so.

My version of ImageMagik has --enable-lzw as a configure option.
It defaults to no, and I don't think I overrode it.

I guess this explains the size and shows one way  we might get smaller
sizes.

I'd have to check the mail archives to see why we settled on gif.
I guess we had our reasons.

How's png support at this point? It may not have been widely supported
when the decision to use GIFs was made. I advocate GIF/PNG over JPEG
for screenshots, because JPEG is a lossy format that tends to blur
hard edges, which you typically find lots of on screenshots. The file
size savings is quite nice, but the results tend to look a bit fuzzy.
Quantizing a GIF/PNG to a small palette like 6-bit can be reasonably
economical, after compressing the data.

I think I made these same suggestions many moons ago. PNG may be a
more viable choice now, though.

Seems like we've stopped changing things so this looks like a good
time for a release.

The err_exit function in make_fvwmdist.sh isn't portable,
functions aren't allowed in Sun's /bin/sh.

The syntax

 elif ! grep "$CHECK_STRING1" "$CHECK_FILE" ; then

isn't allowed either.  I think it wants some []s.

I changed #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/ksh and move the file to /tmp.
That works up until it tries to do "make clean".

At the make clean step I get:

fork> make clean
Making clean in .
Making clean in tests
Making clean in sample.fvwmrc
Making clean in rpm
Making clean in docs
Making clean in utils
mksh: Fatal error in reader: = missing from replacement macro reference
Current working directory /u/tools/dane/fvwm/version-2_3_28/utils
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `clean-recursive'

OK, I see, I need "gnumake clean".
I changed make_fvwmdist.sh to use gnumake.

Seems to be running now...Oops, no, not yet.

Since I haven't exported CC=gcc like I normally do, the CFLAGS
of "-g -O2 -Wall -Werror" aren't any good.

Adding:

export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++

gets it a little farther, but -Werror isn't going to do it either.
Sun's X header files generate way too many warnings.  Should have
warned me that this is a Linux only procedure...Looks like the
-Werror has to go.

Anyway, expect 2.3.28 sometime soon.

*Sigh*  Isn't /bin/sh standardised?  I thought that bash was sh
compatible when called as /bin/sh :-(

That's probably the best solution with ksh being POSIXised.

Of course there is no gnumake executable on the average Linux
system.  It's called "gmake" there.

Can we disable warnings for system header files with gcc?

I didn't intended it to be Linux only, but of course I didn't test
it extensively.  The script simply does most of the steps
described in doc/DEVELOPERS.  The same problems would occur when
building manually.

On a Linux RedHat like distib. you need the package 
gnome-libs-devel. On a debian you should have a similar
package somewhere.

There's a POSIX standard for sh.  The POSIX standard definitely requires
shell functions; I've never seen a shell that didn't support them.  They
are definitely portable to any remotely modern system (certainly to any
system we'd want to build a distribution on :).

Also, the err_exit function works fine on my Solaris box.

Right; the "!" is very handy, but not portable to older shells.

However, you can't just add "[]"; that's not the same thing at all.

  dv> That's probably the best solution with ksh being POSIXised.

I disagree.  Ksh is a proprietary program and doesn't appear on any free
UNIX system, like Linux, FreeBSD, etc.  There is a free reimplementation
but I'm not sure how compatible it is, and most systems don't ship with
it.

We should avoid requiring ksh, just as we avoid requiring bash.

  dv> Of course there is no gnumake executable on the average Linux

On Linux, it's just called "make" since GNU make is the only make there
is.

Often you'll see people name it "gmake" on other systems to avoid
conflicts with the system make (although I don't bother; who wants the
system make anyway :)?

I think we should have a way of handling this.  The script can try to
find a GNU make, perhaps like this:

  make=
  for x in make gmake gnumake; do
    ver=`(echo 'all:;@echo $(MAKE_VERSION)' | $x -f -) 2>/dev/null`
    case $ver in
      3.*) make=$x; break 2 ;;
    esac
  done

  case $make in
    ?*) : OK, found one ;;
    *)  echo "Can't find GNU make on the PATH!"; exit 1 ;;
  esac

  >> gets it a little farther, but -Werror isn't going to do it either.
  >> Sun's X header files generate way too many warnings.

  dv> Can we disable warnings for system header files with gcc?

No.

Mine too, guess all the other problems I ran into confused me.

I agree that using /bin/sh is the best way to go, but
we install "pdksh" on our Linux systems.
We use ksh as our login shell, and in most of our
shell scripts.  It (pdksh) seems to do the trick.

I'm running on

SunOS topaze 5.7 Generic_106541-02 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
~ > fvwm2 -version
FVWM version 2.3.28 compiled on Jan 26 2001 at 14:33:24
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, SM


Sometimes when logging in (I'm using the graphical login for solaris), 
the X server dies and I need to log in again, at which point the 
session starts up normally.  This has happened since around .24 or .25 
I think.  I never thought much of it, but today something else 
happened:  I lost many colors ('Could not allocate' errors) such as 
MediumAquamarine which I use for network tools.


The startup when I get kicked out of X looks as follows in the log:
~ > cat tmp/restart/topaze_DISPLAY=:0
-- Session log created Fri Jan 26 20:23:54 MET 2001
OpenWindows Desktop Login
using xinitrc file: /u/lohner/.xinitrc
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).


~ > tail .xinitrc
...
exec /sup/bin/fvwm2

Should fvwm2 be exec'ed here, or just run?


I logged out and in a few times, etc. but nothing changed it.  Looking 
in /tmp, I saw a fvwmasdGh file (something like that- fvwm and random 
letters).  The file looks like it contains the m4 processed part of the 
fvwmrc file.  I deleted it, logged out and in, and the startup happened 
normally.

I'd like to know what generates this file and how its used.  I'll keep 
a look out for when it appears, and see if X startup failures occur 
when that file exists.  Any other information about this issue is 
appreciated.  I'll let you know when I find out more.

Thanks,
Nils.

They are two separate problems.  Seems that .28 may have introduced 
something that messes with the colormap, or eats a lot of colors?  I 
run a basic setup with just the pager module.

Unless you are using gradients in fvwm, I doubt its fvwm.

I've found lots of programs that like to grab every color in
sight.  Netscape will grab every free color.
Framemaker will grab a large chunk of the colormap in its
default setup.  Anything tk based (like exmh) grabs varying amounts
of color.  The more colors free, the more it grabs.

In a separate mail
I've sent you a program thats helped me on occasion find the colormap
culprit.

Sometimes you have to exit X, not just fvwm to free up all the colors.

I'm not.  It seems that something changed my display from 24 bit back 
to 8 bit.  I have no clue how/what. Now that I've reset it, 
everything's working fine again.  The restart problem I'll look into 
next week when people begin to log in and out more.

Since you're exec'ing fvwm, this may happen when fvwm dies
unexpectedly.  Any traces of a reason for this?  Anything on the
console or a new core file?

Probably no.  We didn't mess with any code related to colours for
many months.  The only possible culprit might be gradient menu
backgrounds, especially DGradient or BGradient backgrounds.  If
that holds true the problem would go away when using a plain solid
background in menus.

I think these files are generated by the preprocessor and removed
as soon as the preprocessor module has finished.  If these are
left on the filesystem this means that fvwm has died before it
finished to read the file.

The crash was most likely caused by the missing window title.
Normally, the title should then be replaced by "Untitled"
internally, but this did not work always and caused a crash in
serveral places.  This is fixed in the current CVS code.

The ordering is wrong.  gmake and gnumake have to appear before
make.

Is there any particular reason to check only for major version 3?

In my config file I define one icon box:

  Style * IconBox +580 +964 +1151 +863

According to the man page, this icon box can be disabled by
issuing

  Style * IconBox

However, new icons still go into the 'destroyed' icon box.

There is "Optional libraries used by FvwmGtk" section in INSTALL.fvwm.
You also get "checking whether trivial gnome compilation passes: no".
I think there is enough info, but I may add, if you think more is needed.

Mikhael.

Not really.  The idea is that only GNU make will respond with the
proper value for MAKE_VERSION (no other make I know even sets it), so it
doesn't matter which one comes first.  If "make" isn't GNU make, it
won't match anyway.

It doesn't matter, though, to me.

  dv> Is there any particular reason to check only for major version 3?

Because as far as I know there is no version of GNU make in existence
anymore with any other major version numer... and I don't plan on
changing that anytime in the forseeable future :).

You could use [3-9].* if you wanted, I guess.

Just an idea: most of the time, when building fails for me (not
just when building fvwm), the reason is that some vital program or
library is not installed.  Sometimes it is hard to guess what is
missing for me, and most 'newbies' have no idea what went wrong at
all.  The configure summary could print out what is missing in the
summary.  That would help a lot.

Bye
