*Shrug*  Complicated tasks should be split into small parts
anyway.  But I guess it can be done in two lines in sawfish-lisp,
right?

Well, *actually*, it is documented precisely in the man page.
Reading carefully should allow you write properly quoted functions
without trying.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not defending the
quoting.  In the best case one could call it odd.  But I find it
somewhat odd that you do not complain that you have to learn lisp
for sawfish, but on the other hand do not care to look at the man
page to learn the fvwm command language.

By the way, this is the main strength of the "language":  you can
start writing your own config snippets right away by looking at
the examples in your config file.  That will not take the beginner
very far, but it helps to overcome one's inhibitions.

Say what you want, but *please* stop insulting me without reading
the mailing list archives first.  I have criticised the command
language more than anybody else in the past.

I strongly disagree.  It is quite easy to write small functions like

  AddToFunc foo
  + I MoveToDesk
  + I MoveToPage
  + I WindowShade off
  + I Iconify off
  + I Raise

Of course, writing things like the "Quake" console is a difficult
task in any language.  It may vary with the given syntax, but it's
an impossible task for most normal users.

All these extensions can be done without fundamental changes to
the xommand language.  I already proposed most of this and much
more last year, but apparently nobody is interested in it.

cpp and m4 are macro expanders, not real scripting languages.
FvwmCommand, PipeRead and FvwmPerl are nice extensions, but only
extensions, FvwmPerl isn't really easier to use, as it has a visible
line separating "native perl" from "native fvwm" (yes, I've tried
writing perl extensions and I noticed that it was much like calling
FvwmCommand, only that you did it in a perl script).
PipeRead/FvwmCommand has huge overhead problems (running a external
command isn't really efficient).

It's just a library. Makes some of fvwm code obsolete, so the costs are
reduced a bit.

But that isn't that important. If fvwm would be able to do things that
you can do in Python (or any other popular language) just as easily,
I would be very satisfied. Pulling a external library with an
interpreter is only a "possible solution". So is "rewriting the engine".
But I believe that the second wouldn't give smaller code and would
probably have more bugs (shorter devel-debug-cycle compared to
a well-tested libperl or libpython, or lib<whatever>).

Fvwm isn't really *that* good at saving memory[1], so I don't think it
would brake any "fundamental fvwm rule" here.

[1] - take the modules for instance. If saving ram would be such a high
priority, then it should be possible to load FvwmButtons and then use it
to create more than one container, perhaps in different areas of the
screen. But no, if you want two containers you need to load two copies
of FvwmButtons, even if 80% of that code could probably be shared (only
config-related data is different). And fvwm modules are quite big
already.

"if..then..else" constructions are not what you could call

It's not about the lack (or presence) of documentation. Pulling PipeRead
with a "echo" command just to expand some variables isn't what I would
call "nice".  So it's fully documented. Do man pages change anything
about it being inconvenient or not well-thought?

I never said that I'm against reading docs. I just found lisp easier,
clearer, more coherent than what fvwm has to offer.

That's true for any given higher-level language. Not only fvwm's
configs.

Did I insult you? In what way?

a. You said it "isn't that bad"
b. You are sitting in the code for a long time now
c. Your perceive fvwm mainly from the "developer" point of view.  Proof:
   I spoke about it being bad, and you replied "I'm sure you analysed
   the code" - but not everybody reads the code. I can tell if something
   is nice or ugly by using it. I don't care if it's easy to read or if
   it's variables are named after a pattern. I just use it. That's what
   WM's are for - using. Not analysing the code. Yes, not only fervent
   programmers use fvwm. Us, stupid[1] users do it too.

So where's the insult?

It differs from most languages and is more complicated than batch
scripts.

a. there's this weird "+ I "

b. you can glue code to the function after invoking some different
commands (I know it's a feature, but still - it's different from most
languages with functions and it complicates things)

c. You know how my first errors looked like?

+I maximize

It just didn't work. No error message, nothing. I had to understand what
was wrong by myself, 'cause the manual obviously considers it as
"obvious".

[1] - now I could say that I feel insulted. I consider myself a normal
user. And you say that most people with my knowledge of computers
wouldn't be able to write more complex(?) fvwm functions? Just how
stupid you think normal users are?

Alright, how do you picture deleting all bindings for the "I" context?
Add twenty new commands, like
DeleteBindingsInContext(contex name),
DeleteBindingsToFunction(function name),
...
?

Sure, you can do everything that I mentioned if you add new functions.
But it's like constructing a cell phone with buttons for every entry in
it's address book. Is that really "user friendly"? That's good when
the address book has 10 entries. But when it has more than 100 of them
it's time to think of a new interface for the user.

What is the problem with starting the same module twice?  All you
waste is a few hundred bytes of dynamic memory that could be
shared by different containers, namely the memory used to store
the constant parts of the configuration.  And of course the two
additional pipes and the process structure in the kernel.  The
executable itself is loaded into RAM only once.  Any decent kernel
is clever enough not to load multiple copies of the same
write-only data.

I guess many people disagree with this opinion.  The main
difference is that to learn lisp, you have to learn programming.
This requires a lot of dedication.  Many people are simply not
interested in this deep level of understanding.

I don't know where you get that idea from.  It's certainly not

The insult is that you claim that I am unable to consider what
users want (hint:  read mailing list archive).  You ranted about
the scripting *engine*.  Only in the follow up mail you made it
clear that you were talking about its *interface*, not the engine
itself.  So don't condemn me for replying on the same level.

Well, that is not part of the design but simply a bug (in my
eyes).  Parsing of the "+" command is not good.

Then our image of a "normal user" differs very much.  In my eyes,
the typical computer user:

 - Will not learn a programming language to configure a program
 - Hates having to learn sopmething just to use the machine
 - Has no deep knowledge of programming, or even the computer
 - Sees the computer as a tool, not as a toy
 - Has little time to learn the internal workings of the computer
   or a program.

So I would hardly classify you as a "normal user".  Okay, fvwm is
a bit hard to configure anyway, but that is no good excuse to not
think about the most inept users too.

Not stupid at all.  I think "normal users" are simply not
interested in programming.

I wonder how you would delete bindings without a binding specific
interface in a different language.

In Sawfish you could get very far without real knowledge of lisp. All
you needed was the ability to invoke functions and pass parameters. And
maybe know that head/tail thing in lists. Sawfish provided/provides
some predefined popular functions, similar to those in fvwm. And
sawfish-ui (~FvwmConsole) had tab-completion, so it was really
convenient.

You were talking about simple, primitive examples ("That will not take
the beginner very far"). So I could name a simple shell script,
consisting only of a list of external commands to execute. Or a perl
script with a couple of print's. If you meant something more
complicated, then please compare it with something equally complicated
in fvwm, for example

Current (!State 2)
KeepRc TestRc (Match) foo
TestRc (Match) bar

It depends on how complicated the example is. With easy examples most
languages are easy to understand. With "advanced" code snippets most
languages are difficult, fvwm is no exception.

Don't take it hard, but yes, sometimes at least. I could name some
examples, but since you put so much weight to it I won't. I bet
you would just see thing "in a different light". If you insist we can
continue this topic in less... public conditions. My private email is
hoppke _at_ lubuska.zapto.org

My apologies if that insults you, but it shouldn't. We are all humans
and with bigger projects it's never possible to please *everyone*.
Just as it is impossible to read the minds of others and predict with
100% accuracy "what they want". That would be much like the theory of
politics ;)

I'm sorry, but there is no (IMVHO) definition of an "engine" or
"interface" when it comes to fvwm. If I would say from the start that
I mean the "interface", you could've thought that I mean FvwmConsole (as
a module) or something similar. In your mind the "engine" is that what
*you* know best - C code implementation. For me the "engine" is the set
of commands, the syntax - what keeps the whole thing running. That what
is under the interface (and the interface is, of course, the GUI). All
a matter of semantics.

I don't know about debugging, but I've never used that
"flexibility" since I use fvwm. In my opinion it may be a nice feature,
but I haven't found any use for it. I could imagine that this comes
handy with menu definitions (dynamical menus), but functions? And one
more thing: I would have found it easier if you could only continue
definitions after an AddTo* command. Right now if you interrupt
a definition you can continue by just using the "+ ". I don't know if
that's so great. Many times it meant troubles for me. The code got
appended to the "wrong" function or menu definition. I have never ever
needed this feature and I would have found it much easier if you would
always have to use a AddTo* after interrupting a definition to continue.

I thought it was designed that way. The "+" is allowed in names of
functions, so I thought that it's not a "reserved word". To give users
the possibility to do:

addtofunc foo+bar
+ I ...
+ I ...

function foo+bar

Although I didn't knew why anyone would want to allow a "plus" sing in
functions names...

Oh, you mean a "ZU" ;) That's what we call those people in my language.

Yeah, but I really don't think that a ZU (or "normal user") will ever
want to use fvwm. Fvwm is to hard to use:

a. It comes with no fancy default configuration
b. Not that much eye-candy as in most popular WMs
c. No GUI configurators (those scripts that come installed by default
   can only setup a small subset of fvwm's features)
d. It's ugly like 1981 (by default, of course)
e. You have to download fvwm-themes to make it look somewhat "modern".
f. Sounds. No nice wizard to do the configuration, no support for esd or
   arts - and they are standards in the "normal user" computer worlds.
g. The manual page is too cryptic and too long, there are too many
   options to actually get a strong grip on the WM
h. Some (very important for the Normal User) things don't work:
   - tray icons. Mostly KDE or Gnome apps.
   - fullscreen maximizing. In mplayer, Mozilla, ...
   - no fancy panel (plain taskbars are prehistory)
i. ...

Really, I would be amazed if an Normal User would choose fvwm. All that
I know have removed it from their systems and installed something
easier. Less powerfull, but easier. WindowMaker is very popular, so is
IceWM. Then, let's not forget, Normal Users mostly use ready-set
Desktop Environments like KDE or Gnome, and I believe they won't
exchange Gnome's Metacity for FVWM.

IMO the only way for a Normal User to use fvwm is in larger networks,
where the user has no influence. Universities etc. But on such sites
fvwm is preconfigured by sysadmins, so you don't need to worry about
making fvwm "not so easy".

I admire what you're trying to do, but I think that fvwm is unusable (or
not tempting enough) for a Normal User unless he receives
a preconfigured version of this WM.

You mean "keybindings"? In Sawfish there was a "table of bindings". It was
as if you would put all Key's and Mouse's into a table.

(...)
(Key,c,M,W,Close)
(Key,z,M,W,Minimize)
(Key,s,M,W,Shade)
(...)

Every row describes a binding. The row itself is split into fields which
can be separately analyzed if it's necessary.

The "binding specific interface" consisted of a synchronization
procedure between the table and WM's internals. You push a new row into
the table and a new binding comes to life. You remove a row, and
a binding get's wiped out. As you have normal acces to the list you can
pick specific rows just as you do it with data in lisp.

There was no other way to add a binding[1]. You simply had to place it
in a special table/variable. And because it was a normal table you could
modify it like a normal table. So there only needed to exist this
feedback pipe between the table and the WM, the developers didn't need
to think about all possible needs or wishes. This was done later by the
users themselfs. You want to make a function clearing the root context?
No problem, scan the table for "R" in fourth field and delete matching
rows.

[1] - well, there was also a convenience macro to do it quickly.

For Sawfish existed/exists a wiki with many custom functions, for people
who just can't write it on their own or want to publish something. With
this "open the internals" approach much load slipped off the developers.
Instead of patches for C code the users started to send in functions in
Lisp - easier to integrate and less prone to crash the WM (errors etc.
are caught by the interpreter).

I'm using the linux kernel, 2.4.21.

Results of the "free" command with 100 instances of FvwmPager running:

         total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

And the same after "killall FvwmPager":

I guess that with 'a few hundreds' per module te amount of memory freed
after killing all those pagers should change by a couple of megabytes in
worst case , not by ~60MBs. And I believe these readings are correct
- starting more modules (200 and up) chewed up all of RAM and swap, and
the infamous OOM killer started killing processes.

Either it's my config, or running two pagers uses more ram than just "(1
FvwmPager) + (less than 1KB)"

I meant the memory usage, not executable size (and debug info never gets
loaded while executing a binary (except for running under debuggers),
right?)

Dominik is completely correct here.

The point is that the memory consumed here is not consumed by either
the FvwmPager text (that is, executable data) itself or the minimal
bookkeeping required to load a second instance of the program.  It was
probably the actual run-time data required by each FvwmPager in order
to do its job -- this data is not likely to change significantly
whether each FvwmPager loads its own text or operates out of the same
text.  It is possible that some of this data could be shared between
multiple pagers running out of the same process ... it is also
possible that handling the contention for this sharing would
sufficiently complicate and enlarge the FvwmPager binary that the
_common_ case (one pager per X session) would actually use more
resources.  (I haven't looked, I do not know this for sure; it is
intended only to be an example showing that things are not always
black and white.)

Consider most of the other Fvwm modules, as well...  Exactly how many
concurrent instances do you typically run at one time?  I think you'll
find that this is not a large issue.

> Either it's my config, or running two pagers uses more ram than just "(1
> FvwmPager) + (less than 1KB)"

It is guaranteed to be at least a few pages (4kB each on most 32-bit
architectures).  It is, however, still negligible for a desktop
system.

I understand. But even so, something still seems wrong. Why is a module
like FvwmPager using so much memory?

Well, a couple of megs, making fvwm one of the bigger WM's. I wanted to
get the words "negligible for a desktop system" - to show that adding an
perl/python/scheme/whatever interpreter would have no real influence on
memory performance - it would be like running another FvwmIconMan.

Here is my calculation of what the pager uses.  This is on Solaris 8
using the "pmap" command.  This is the output, slightly reformattted:

           2832K

 total     3192K

The total memory is 3meg.
I separated that into read/write and read/exec.
The read/exec is common memory (its only used once no matter how
often the pager is loaded).  Of the 3meg, thats 2.8 meg thats common.
The balance is 360K.

So, I'd say that the each instance of the pager takes 360K.

Probably what is most important is how much of this actually resides
in memory.  That could be a lot less than 360K.

Another issue is how many libaries got mapped into memory that
I wasn't already using.  I this case, I think I have all of them
already mapped.

One of the nice things about Fvwm is how much memory the pager
consumes for me. (Zero, I don't use it.)

Yes why not, but I do not like to much to add (and write) an internal
only cmd that can be easily simulated by a complex function (why we
have complex function?).  So, I think that first I will use a complex
function in ConfigFvwmDefdault.  I you want and there are no objection
you may add a "RunWithSM" cmd.

Outch, I do not want to write the necessary parsing ...

Hi,

I think I've found a bug concerning the handling of the
sticky-attributes.  After restarting fvwm, windows with the
attribute StickyAcrossPages are also StickyAcrossDesks it they are
on a desk > 0.

I have attached a patch of which I think that it fixes this bug.

Cheers,

Robert

	libs           : Makefile.am 
	fvwm           : session.c session.h fvwm.1.in

	modules/FvwmButtons: FvwmButtons.c FvwmButtons.h parse.c 
Added files:
	libs           : FSMlib.h fsm.c fsm.h 

Log message:
* fvwmize SMlib and ICElib
* Fixed window matching for windows with no SM_CLIENT_ID and a window_role
* Added in the libs a set of functions (fsm_) for implementing a dummy session
manager
* Use the new fsm lib to make FvwmButtons a session manager for its
swallowed apps when fvwm is runned under a session manager and FvwmButtons
swallow some applications. This fixes swallowed apps multiplication after
every "save session/session restart".
* Do not say that GNOME 1 hints and EWMH support is a configure option in the
fvwm man page.
* New FAQ entries "How can I use FVWM with GNOME version >= 2 or KDE
version >= 2?"

Here I demonstrate some bad problems with the current move/placement
methods. I use TiledCascadePlacement, but this should not matter here.
I know that xv was always problematic, but I see this with some other
programs too. (And there were good workarounds for xv previously.)

1) Run:

  xv -geo 1500x1500 pictures/fvwm-logo-steelblue.gif

Part of the image is out of the screen, because the title is fully
visible, previously the image was fully visible and the title was
out of the screen. Additionally, click right mouse and double click
the file name, the window walks to the right (can't go down here).

Press "n" several times to see it walking right-down.

2) Run:

  xv -nol huge-image.gif small-image.gif

If you don't have any huge image, you may for example run first
"xv -geo 1500x1500 small-image.gif" and save it to huge-image.gif.
Click right mouse and double click the second (small) image for several
times, it walks right and down.

3) Run (like the previous, but reversed image order):

  xv -nol small-image.gif huge-image.gif

Now the window itself is ok (behaves like previously, try to double click
both file names to see it), but if you invoke any of the 7 windows from
the "Windows" submenu, they are placed partially out of the screen (the
offset of decorations).

Also try to maximize the small image and then switch to the huge one,
the maximized image is moved left-up.

Today I even experienced this strange problem with xv: just pressing the
window title (that invokes "+ H Move") caused the window to walk, but
unpressing returns the window to the original position. I currently
can't provide instructions for reproduction.

4) Run display from ImageMagick:

  display

Then press right mouse and choose "Image Info", this window is placed
partially out of the screen.

Any comments or fixes?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Note first that I have not xv on my machine (xv has disappeared from
some distributions as Redhat and Mandrake). You should try:

  Style "match_xv" MoveByProgramMethod IgnoreGravity
or
  Style "match_xv" MoveByProgramMethod UseGravity

However, maybe the ICCCM/Traditional move method can be improved: Do
not make any conclusion for window which are larger than the screen.

It does not seems that this is related to the new ICCCM/Traditional
move stuff. For me this depends on the position of the main display
window (if it is at top left then the transient image info pop up on
my screen).  I think it is a Transient Windows placement problem (or
miss-feature).

Any of these should work:

  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=xv&arch=i386

I know that I (and everyone else) should use IgnoreGravity for xv,
otherwise it walks, but I thought the autodetection may be improved.
I agree with your remark about large windows.

It seems that the placement of the 7 xv tool windows was always
problematic (just checked 2.2 and 2.4, for some reason I thought these
windows were fully on the screen previously, but they were not).

After more experiments, yes, display does not try to place its transient
aligned to some screen border as I originally thought, these were just
coincidences in my test cases. The same happens with any 2.x version.

I just noticed something odd (Mozilla 1.4, Linux).  I started
mozilla, loaded the fvwm home page and switched to another page
before anything was displayed.  When I finally came back to the
browser page, I could watch as the frame on the internal window
was drawn bit by bit.  That took about one second.  Is this
because of the web pages or because the rendering engine is too
slow?

I tried that with mozilla 1.4 but could  not  reproduce  it.
Maybe  it  is because I started mozilla on a remote maschine
and redirected  X.  Did  you  start  mozilla  on  the  local
machine? 
Generally this may caused by a number of reasons. What  kind
of  internet  connection  was it? If it was a telephone line
the decoration pics should be loaded as last  so  you  might
have watched it. Maybe the RAM was full and parts of mozilla
were put to the swap - I can often see this at  may  machine
at work were RAM is always full ;-)

I don't think that it is  caused  by  the  rendering  engine
neither  by  the  page design (that much). The actual design
has been optimized so that rendering  should  a  bit  faster
than  the  first design or the birthday theme. I sit here on
an about 300 MHz Sun Solaris  with  192  MB  RAM  -  mozilla
displays the page quite fast and nicely. 

Regards, Uwe

The fastest possible (I work for an ISP) :-)

The page had been loaded for several minutes before I viewed it.

Definitely not.  Even now the machine does not even use half of
its RAM.

Athlon XP 1800+ with 512 MB RAM (318 MB free).  I can reproduce
the effect at will:

  - start mozilla (on page 0 1)
  - use a bookmark to load http://fvwm.org/
  - switch to page 0 0 immediately
  - wait until the page has loaded
  - switch back to page 0 1

  => Rendering the pager and window borders takes about 1.5
     seconds.  Everything else is visible almost immediately.

  Note that it's only slow the first time the page is displayed.
  Switching between pages later is as fast as expected.

How do you know that it is loaded fully? ;-)

Using Firebird (mozilla engine) on my local box I could
reproduce it randomly a couple of times. I could not see the
problem when I used a remote started mozilla. It seems to me
that mozilla detects in some way that it is not visible -
maybe X notifies it. Could it be that this mechanism does
not work it the display is redirected?

By waiting several minutes :-)  A couple of weeks ago, when I
first brought up the load times of the web page, I though the
delay was cause by the long load times.  But since I can be fairly
sure the whole page has been loaded by the time I view it, it
must be a problem with rendering, not loading.

Sure.  If the mozilla window is not visible, it does not render
anything.

No.  It's just an X Event.

Really I consider this as a fix. But, if there are objection I can
remove this code (maybe not at once as I will be soon far from any
internet connection for a few days).

A couple of quick notes,

 1. Snaphots are not being created (last one is from July 30)

      ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/

 2. I mailed and tried to follow-up a couple of time with Jason
    about obfuscating people's email addresses on this list and
    never got a reply (I mailed him what needs to be included to
    the mhonarc config file to do that).

If you shade a window without decoration, then you have a 1 pixel
line. This is problematic, but why not. Now in the case of a
fullscreen window the 1 pixel line is on the top of the monitor and
often the offscreen top part of the monitor is black, also there is
(maybe) the panframe. So it is extremely difficult to unshade the
window.  This may happen with some non fullscreen window, but here I
get a criterion (fullscreen). However, if you think that we should
allow shading this is really not a problem for me.

Maybe if a fullscreen window is requested to be shaded, it is first
un-fullscreened?

I myself don't see a problem to disallow shading. A normal maximized
window is still allowed to be shaded; and anyone may un-fullscreen and
then shade a window if this is what he needs; or un-fullscreen, maximize
and shade. There is probably no much sense in fullscreen + shade states.
The whole fullscreen state is to help users (hopefully it is a user who
requests fullscreen, not a malicious program) to keep a window visible.

Mikhael.

Why can't the user decide whether it makes sense or not?

He may. And I showed several ways to do it. I can't see an advantage in
having a new fullscreen state that is an exact duplication of the
maximize state (i.e. borders, shadability etc.). If we introduce the new
state, it should behave to better achieve its specific task:

Anyway, it is not important to me whether a user may shade a fullscreen
window. Personally I would like a window to be un-fullscreened on shade.

   I'm a beginner in Xwindows programming. Which books may I read for a better understanding
 of Fvwm2 source code? I'm interested, basically, in graphical aspects of the Xwindow 
 system.

 I'm a beginner in Xwindows programming. Which books may I read for
a better understanding of Fvwm2 source code? I'm interested, basically, 
in graphical aspects of the Xwindow system.

 Regards

All the X window functions have man pages.
Try the man pages.

Also O'Reilly has a whole series of books on X-Windows programming,

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hello,

noticed this with the recent CVS version. To reproduce, start fvwm with
the attached config file, touch the taskbar with the mouse to shade it,
iconify a window by clicking the only titlebar button. Fvwm freezes,
using 100% CPU power (top shows 1/3 going to fvwm, 2/3 to the X server).
The only way out is stopping X via ctrl-meta-backspace.
This crash occurs since a few days (can't reconstruct the exact date).

I realize that the setup is somewhat artificial and the real solution for
me is to get a sensible configuration. However, I thought I should let you
know anyway.

Best regards

Jochen

Fixed (I hope) in current cvs. Can you try it?

This is not directly related but when animation occur when the TaskBar
is shaded and an animation occur the TaskBar is unshaded and reshaded.
This may break your config (Style FvwmTaskBar TitleAtBottom should fix
it). However, I will change this TaskBar behavior soon (by animate
on the shaded frame).

Thanks, Olivier

Found it.  The failure is at line 1726 of fvwm/functions.c, in routine
execute_complex_function:

  if (!GrabEm(CRS_NONE, GRAB_NORMAL))

so StartFunction and/or InitFunction fails.  I'm guessing both fvwm
instances are trying to grab the pointer, but one of them can't.  I see
the comment above it, so I understand the reasoning.  I'm just wondering
- should StartFunction and InitFunction perhaps be immune from pointer
grab failures?

Yeah, it works now.

Tested this, too, successfully (allthough I don't have a title on
FvwmTaskBar). The only weird thing, Fvwm emits messages like:

s   0/763  0/ 0, g   3/760  3/-3: +++ travelling traditional 0x08270838
'FvwmTaskBar'

These are debug messages that will stay in CVS for a while.

Hi together,

As seen I had some  difficulties  by  adding  all  converted
screenshots  at once. I got some error messages from the cvs
server. So I added all new directories step  by  step  which
causes a lot of cvs mails. 

While writing this  mail  my  cvs  copy  at  home  has  been
synchronized with the cvs server - cvs commit and cvs update
works as expected. 

There are still some files to transmit :-)

Cheers, Uwe

Hello everyone,

While using a utf-8 locale I get this message in my ~/.xsession-errors:

[FVWM][FlocaleGetFontSet]: (-*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*) Missing font charsets:
KSC5601.1987-0, GB2312.1980-0

This patch will fix it:

 /* rationale: -*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-13-* should gives "fixed" in
    most non multibyte charset (?).
    -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-* is ok for jsx

Hopefully someone can apply this patch.

Thanks,
sa
