The _XA_WM_DESKTOP stuff was explicitly removed by me, since it should no
longer be necessary. I changed the restart logic to save the per-window
state to the file ~/.fvwm_restart and reload it from there (using the
session stuff).

IIRC, he spoke about "fontsets" which is the term used in Xlib documentation.
The patch he sent did replace the fonts we use now by fontsets. If we speak
about doing it right or wrong, I think the right way would be to abstract
all font operations in a single file lib/font.c or something and aim at
only introducing I18N ifdefs there.

Sorry for the recent confusion wrt. to the Restart logic. 
I first broke restarting in several ways when I changed it to
use the session stuff for saving state and then obviously forgot
to commit the fix for fvwm.c which I assembled in last minute
before I left for the weekend last thursday. Anyway, the version
of Done() now in cvs (with fixes from Mikhail, I think) looks 
very much like what I intended to commit on thursday.

Hard to tell on the tiny feedback window, but I guess it is square, as you
say.

How do you restart them? If using "Restart fvwm-19990601",
the solution is to restart them as "Restart fvwm-19990601 -restart"
or "Restart fvwm-19990601 -restore ~/.fvwm_restart",
when a command parsing will be implemented (I hope soon).

Note, "-restart" argument does not exist yet, it is just my old intention
to add it ("-restore" exists). "-restart" will run RestartFunction
instead of InitFunction.

I am not sure about "-s". What is exactly this backward compatibility
argument? I still think that you can't determine anything about a program
by its executable name.

Yes, this is exactly what I wanted to do.
Also, unless someone converts me, I want to replace the substring matching
by the exact matching (without paths). This is just incorrect to match the
way it is now or it was; suppose my user-name is "fvwm", all my commands
in /home/fvwm/bin will be matched. :)

Mikhael.

All my windows wind up on desk 0 and I switch back to desk 0 as well.
So it seems like there is still a problem.

I believe you did.  When I noticed the bug I dug through the CVS database
and looked for a comment about it, which I found at the time but couldn't
find it when I went back and looked again last week.  The fix was in there
with a bunch of other things and I didn't have time to try and separate it
out since there were a fair amount of other changes in the files associated
with it before and after that fix too.

Dominik> Do you have any idea when or how this happened?

Nope, sorry.  I never grabbed any of the 2.1.x betas and I didn't grab 2.2
for quite a while after it came out, and by then a lot of work was going on
for 2.3.x as well, so I'm not certain when it all happened.

	I don't see any way this can happen...is it possible you didn't get a
clean restart and are still running an older version?

	Does anyone else have this happen on a Recapture, with the current CVS?

Oops, my mistake, I really shouldn't read my email so fast after a 3-day weekend.  The recapture is fixed, but the problem does still persist on restarts, and StartsOnPage styles don't get picked up on starts

	FVWM has been using the "-s" hack on Restart since version 1, to
prevent the new instance from trying to spawn multiple FVWM's to manage
multiple screens. Since it always does this on a Restart, it would
probably have been better just to *assume* a "-s" when restarting; but
unfortunately we can't go back and change all the old versions to Do The
Right Thing.

	A good point. Not too likely to happen, I think, but a good point.

	Thinking about the "-s" question brings another question to my mind.
Has anyone given much thought to the implications of the case where
there are multiple instances of FVWM managing multiple screens, all
trying to use the same restart file? Should the filename perhaps carry a
component identifying the display in use by a particular instance of
FVWM?

Well, actually I was back on Monday, but it seems that we were having power
problems and my remote access was b0rked.  (The battery in one of the UPS
units has failed, thus leading to the renaming from "uninterruptible" to
"interrupting".)

Anyway, I'm wading through seven thousand incoming messages (honestly) so
please feel free to remind me if I missed something important.

I'm pretty tapped out tonight, but if nobody comes up with any objections
I'll announce this tomorrow.

Actually it would be more of a "pr0n and warez" site.  This has actually

Newer FTP servers do support email notification of uploads so nobody has to
remind me.  Unfortunately ftp.fvwm.org isn't running one of those.  The new
machine will be, once I can devote a bit of time to it.

Another good point. We should change ".fvwm_restart" to a name
including screen (and display ?).

Again I'm rewriting large parts of the menu code right now, so please
don't touch that code for a while (not that I think anybody will).
This time it's the drawing code.

Both of these were mentioned already:

 1) Shaded windows are unshaded over a restart.
 2) I fear that my_argv[10] is too small.

Matthias, do you feel inclined to do something about either?

I use rxvt's with a background pixmaps for most of my applications.
When I switch pages this happes:

  1) The window borders are drawn without any decorations, titles, ...
  2) The background pixmap of the rxvt is drawn.
  3) The missing parts of the window borders are drawn.

There is a noticeable delay between 1 and 3, even on a fast machine.
I wonder if there is anything we can do to get the window borders
drawn completely before X draws the background pixmap.

Bye

I think the main feature you are looking for is a way to find out
which desks you have used.  I suggest implementing a menu which gives
you a list of all desks which have (non-sticky) windows on them.

How would you like that?

It avoids the problem of designing a good UI in the pager, and it
allows you not only to see that there are other used desks, but also
how many.

If you take all the *FvwmIdent lines out of your .fvwm2rc FvwmIdent will
display the DefaultBackground results (dynamically too)

Can I suggest that you use the code in fvwm/colors.c for creating
gradient pixmaps and the code in libs/Graphics.c:SetWindowBackground()
for using the gradient pixmap as the menu background.  It would simplify
the menu drawing if all menus had a background pixmap maintained by the
server rather than have fvwm draw DGradients on every expose event.

Cheers,
Tim.

You could configure your X-server to have backing store on always (not
just when mapped) if you have lots of memory to spare, but as a
developer I don't think you should because you would miss out on
expose-event testing.

For fvwm to do anything about this would require the border drawing to
happen in the frame's background pixmap.  Which would have to be the
same size as the window (i.e several Mbytes) rather than the size of the
border tile (probably small).

I don't think fvwm can control the order in which the server maps
windows and we can't keep the client unmapped until the frame
expose-event has been done because it may not arrive at all (if the user
has backing store turned on).

Cheers,
Tim.

I was hoping that you would make these changes :) I'll see what
I can do. Where is the functionality for C/S gradients you coded
lataly?

It in fvwm/colors.c:CreateGradientPixmap() which returns a pixmap with
the gradient in it.  You can then stretch this to fit the menu with
CreateStretchPixmap() from libs/Graphics.c (have a look at
Graphics.c:SetWindowBacground()). 
fvwm/builtins.c:SetDefaultBackground() it where this is all called from.

Cheers,
Tim.

Tim, since the stuff to strech the pixmaps in libs, would it be rigth to
put the stuff from colors.c there as well, maybe with a better filename.
That way modules if they wanted to could use the gradients as well.

I can't quite remember why the menu code saves the selected item before
hilighting it. Was there some performance bottleneck? Does anybody remember
this better than I do?

This is probably the right way to go but CreateGradientPixmap() uses
some things from the Scr structure (which the modules don't have) so it
would need rewriting, and it uses fvwm_msg().

I think this was because D and BGradient menus didn't have a background
pixmap and unhilighting an item would have meant redrawing the whole
menu (very flickery).  If all menu styles had a background pixmap
unhiliting would just involve an XClearArea() followed by drawing the
mini-icon and text.

Hmm, but why didn't B/D gradients have a background pixmap in the first
place? It's even unnecessary code to distinguish between the different
gradients.

It's the size. A screen filling gradient pixmap may use several
megabytes.

I don't know but it might have been a concern over the space required by
the server for the background pixmaps. H gradients are very thin and
tiled vertically, V gradients are very narrow and tiled horizontally. D
gradients would be the same size as the menu. I think for the sake of
code simplicity we should make all gradients use a pixmap and put a
warning in the man page to say that gradients other than V and H may
cause problems on servers with very little memory (e.g X-terminals).

Cheers,
Tim.

Well, if you have a 1280x964 screen size with 32 bit depth a single
screen-filling pixmap uses about 5MB. You won't get very far with this
approach (same with C/S gradients I assume).

Subject: Tcl/Tk raise command causes fvwm/app to pause

Full_Name: Andy
Version: 2.3.3
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 7
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (152.163.166.5)


The Tk command "raise" causes fvwm to pause for about 2 seconds.  This is
a new bug with fvwm, since 2.2 doesn't have the problem.  Also this has
been a problem with E for a long time, and is documented in the TiK FAQ.

I noticed from using TiK (http://www.aim.aol.com/tik) and turning on
the "Raise IM on new messages" option.  Everytime a new message
is received the app pauses.  You probably could reproduce by just
running wish and doing:
    toplevel .foo
    raise .foo
but I went back to 2.2 so I can't test.

	I don't think so. I tried your example, and got no delay. 

	Also, my TkZip utility (http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/TkZip) does
toplevel raises all over the place (politely and judiciously, of course 
:-)), and I've never noticed any delay, under FVWM's from version 1
through this morning's CVS (and Tk versions from 4.0 to 8.1).

	TiK must be doing something more involved than just a raise when a new
IM comes in; but I'm not familiar with TiK, so I've no idea what. I'd
try to test it, but I'm not sure what I'd do with it, since I'm not an
AOL IM user - is it feasible to test it without being one?

	Can you give us any idea what else might be going on besides the raise?
Also, does TiK use any of the popular Tk extensions, or is it straight
Tcl/Tk?

Ok, I will reinstall 2.3.3 and try and produce a short test case.

Ok, well it does change the title right before it does the raise.
However the option just controls a if statement around the
raise command.  When the raiseim option on it pauses, when off
it doesn't pause.  

I'm not trying to promote aim, but you can go to http://www.aol.com/aim 
and register for an account for free fairly quickly.  If this is impossible 
I can send you the user/pass for a test account that you can use.  (ie
I will go there for you. :)  Then go to http://www.aim.aol.com/tik
to download.

This is just straight Tcl/Tk.  I really don't know other then E has the exact 
same problem.  I get bug reports from tons of linux users about it, so it was 
added to the FAQ.  Since I use fvwm I could always say not a problem, until
now. :) Maybe if I should fool around with reordering the title changing and 
the raising.

It is 20 and it will be 30 with my today's patch (implementing Restart
command parsing and more clean-ups).
Is limiting a spawned process to 30 arguments acceptable?

This is just a follow-up of my previous patch of I18N_MB for
fvwm-2.2. I've received a report of that the patch does not draw a
string in FvwmPager.

If you have already used the patch, please backout the changes of
fvwm-2.2/modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c (or copy from original fvwm-2.2), 
then apply a patch attached below.

Sorry for inconvenience.

***

Yes I know, there are many problems in this implementation of multibyte
support. But in any way, I do NOT want to use fvwm without this patch;
a window manager with no support of multibyte is, just a scrap for me:)

We should know other major window managers are already have its own
code for multibyte support. I'm afraid the our greatest window manager,
named 'fvwm', becomes an old-fashioned window manager (already?).

Here is a simple test with the current CVS tree as of about 
ten minutes ago, so you don't nee TiK or an AIM account.  If I 
comment out the "wm title" line it doesn't help, only commenting 
out the "raise" line removes the delay.  IM Took is usually 2 
seconds on my machine, except for the first one.

	Now this is really weird! 

	First, I get exactly the same results you do, right down to the 2
second interval, on my Linux box.

	Second, I get no delay under 2.2, or under 2.0.46.

	Third, just to see what would happen, I added a "raise ." immediately
after the "raise .im". The result: "Test$n IM Took: 0 seconds" all the
way through! I got the same result with 30 or so runs of the test.

	It looks as though no delay occurs if the raise actually has something
to do - i.e., there is actually a higher window in the stacking order
for the target window to be raised above. But, when the window is
already at the top of the pile, the delay happens.

	Now, I haven't really looked at the window raising code since the
post-2.2 layer logic went in, so I don't know what might have introduced
this quirk. (Say...have we been stealing code from E?) Does anybody else
have any ideas?

Subject: Restart/Recapture - one mo' bug

Something is still not quite right in the relationships among the new
Restart logic, the change desk/viewport logic, and the Recapture logic.

	If you do a Restart from somewhere other than desk 0, page 0,0, then
when you do a Recapture the windows will start migrating to unwanted
places, some of them unviewable. They remain on the correct desk, but
they seem to move to a page to the left of or above where they should
be.

	Until you do that non-0,0,0 Restart, everything is fine.

	This *was not* introduced by Matthias' latest fix - he just made the
non-0,0,0 Restart actually work. I was able to duplicate this with a
version from a few days ago when it wasn't working - I just hadn't tried
it before today.

	I need to test this a little more - I'm not sure whether the windows
arbitrarily move by a page in either direction, or maybe there's a
relationship to how many pages in the positive x,y direction your
location is when you do the Restart.

	I would think it should be, unless the process is xv.  :-)

When detecting the Xpm library in the configure script, line 4389 is this:

LIBS="-l${smr_lib} ${xpm_LIBS} $X_LIBS $X_PRE_LIBS -lX11 $X_EXTRA_LIBS
$LIBS"

This expands to something like this:

cc ... stuff ... -lXpm -L/my/Xpm/directory -lXpm

which doesn't work since the first -lXpm comes before the -L option that
specifies
where to find it. The fix for me was to remove the -l${smr_lib} from the
LIBS line
above. I also had to do a similar thing for readline. I believe removing it
is OK
since ${xpm_LIBS} should contain both the -l and the -L part (if necessary)

Ok, here is another restart patch, it is multi-filed, use: -p 1 -u.

User visible changes:
  * Implemented Restart command parsing (single/double quotes, backslash;
    no environment expansion yet). The following works as in shell:
    Restart xterm -n '"X console"' -T \"X\ console\" -e fvwm1 -s -d :0.0
  * On parse error - the native Restart (using -restore) is used.
  * When the command is failed, first try the native Restart and then
    try to start fvwm only with initial arguments (which must work).
  * -s flag is not added on foreign Restart (use "Restart fvwm1 -s").

Note, if the executable name is not fvwm2, "Restart fvwm2" now works as a
foreign restart, which is correct, I believe. One must always use "Restart"
without parameters for a native restart if he is not sure about the
executable name. "Restart this-executable-name" is left to work as a native
restart (with fvwm parameters added) only for backward compatibility.
A patched man page includes this info.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Ok, a couple more tests show the following:

	1) The windows are all displaced negatively by the number of pages in
the positve x,y direction at which you're located when you do the
Restart.

	2) It's a one-time thing - subsequent Recaptures don't continue moving
the windows (unless you do another non-0,0,0 Restart).

It would be nice. Does xv support virtual desktops or fvwm still better?
Must Restart support globs for 'Restart xv *'? :-)

Hmmm ... I never noticed that the library was repeated on the command line
like that! 

This was solaris 2.5?  What compiler?  Can you do it again with a fresh
copy of the sources, and email me the configure command line used, and the
config.log file?

So specifying the library before the search path ("... -lXpm -L/xpm/dir
...") gives a link error?  I'm a little surprised that this doesn't work. 
It will be tough to fix, since it involves changing an autoconf macro. 

Or maybe the problem was that "-lXpm" is repeated two times?  This would
be easier to fix, and wouldn't involve messing with autoconf proper.

Sure, it is okay to do that.

Could html and manpage authors check over what's on the web pages to make
certain that everything has been correctly updated?  I'm concerned that the
copy from the 2.2.2 tarball may have overwritten something that is actually
newer in the mainline.  I also want to make sure all of the manpages are as
they should be.

Things look OK to me, but then again I didn't notice the last problem with
out-of-date pages.

I think even this isn't enough.  Suppose $PATH contains /foo/bin and
/bar/bin in that order.  Now suppose I said /bar/bin/fvwm to start
fvwm, and there is a "Restart fvwm" in the file -- this will start
/foo/bin/fvwm which is different from /bar/bin/fvwm.

Eek.

I found out that tk is doing a ReconfigureWMWindow and then waits for a
ConfigureNotify. It tries to be very clever by guessing if the wm will
actually configure the toplevel or the frame and does wait for the notify
on *that* window only if the guess is yes.

This behaviour of TK is not 100% ICCCMly correct, however, since the wm may
well decide to ignore the ConfigureRequest. The ICCCM requires the wm to
send a synthetic ConfigureNotify in this case, which we do. But the synthetic
event will always arrive on the toplevel, not on the frame, where tk looks
for it... this is what is causing the delays you have noticed. As a
workaround,
I have added code to send another ConfigureNotify on the frame.

Analysing all this, I noticed that the code for sending the synthetic
ConfigureNotify is in SetupFrame (old twm heritage), and thus we create
lots of useless ConfigureNotifys. I have moved the code to
HandleConfigureRequest, since we only need to generate synthetic
ConfigureNotifys in response to ConfigureRequests. The sendEvent parameter
of SetupFrame is now defunct and I will remove it from all callers, if nobody
steps forward with a good argument for keeping it.

The man pages are not as they should be.  I believe the pages themselves
are updated, but the index doesn't include FvwmAnimate.

I don't believe you are using the script from the latest CVS to
generate the pages.  The script should find all the man pages in
2.2.2 and create the index page.

Its not so much a problem as a link error as I don't want that one linked.
For example I have 
/usr/local/lib/libXpm... and /home/bgiaccio/lib/libXpm...

if I do gcc -lXpm -L/home/bgiaccio/lib -lXpm I get the first one the
compiler finds linked against, which happens to be in /usr/local and is
a very old version that I can't change.  So you deffinetlly don't want to 
repeat it unless you have to.

Subject: Configuring for readline

Full_Name: Johnny Johansson
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Irix 6.3
X_Server: SGI
Submission from: (NULL) (212.116.91.9)


I con not get configure to use my installed version of readline 4.0.
Readline is
installed in a non standard location (same as where fvwm was headed).

First configure does one check which passes: (from log)
configure:4782: checking for readline in -lreadline
configure:4801: cc -o conftest -n32 -mips3 -O2
-I/Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3
/include  -n32 -mips3 -L/Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3/lib conftest.c
-lreadlin
e -lreadline -ltermcap  1>&5

The it checks for the include files, which fails:
configure:4846: checking for readline/readline.h
configure:4856: cc -E  -I/Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3/include conftest.c
>/de
v/null 2>conftest.out
cfe: Warning 581: /Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3/include/readline/rlstdc.h:39:

Macro inline redefined.
configure: failed program was:
#line 4851 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <readline/readline.h>

Finally it does another check for the library which fails:
configure:4949: checking for readline in -lreadline
configure:4968: cc -o conftest -n32 -mips3 -O2
-I/Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3
/include  -n32 -mips3 -L/Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3/lib conftest.c
-lreadlin
e -lreadline -lncurses  1>&5
ld32: WARNING 84: /Home/opticore/PublicDomain/6.3/lib/libreadline.a is not
used 
for resolving any symbol.
ld32: FATAL 9: I/O error (-lncurses): No such file or directory
cc INTERNAL ERROR:  /usr/lib32/cmplrs/ld32 returned non-zero status 32
configure: failed program was:
#line 4957 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char readline();

int main() {
readline()
; return 0; }


Also I think the readline related options to configure are confusing:
--with-readline-library=PATH: What is PATH? The directory readline is in?
The path
to the actual file?...
--with-readline-includes=DIR: What is DIR? Obviously a directory but with
or without
"/readline" at the end?...


Other than that, thanks for a great window manager! :-)

That's the problem; I was using the script from the 2.2.2 release.  It
should be better now.

Interestingly enough, though, look at the FvwmAnimate page and scroll down
to the description of FvwmAnimateEffect.  I'm trying to figure out what
causes this.

	So...it seems that we've introduced a discrepancy between the
saved/restored Restart information about client window positions and
where they actually are, when you do the Restart from a non-0,0 page.

	I've found that if I shuffle the code in Done() around a bit, forcing a
MoveViewport back to 0,0 (and the Reborder) to occur *after* the
RestartInSession call (obviously, I'm not using a session manager), then
everything works fine. On restarting, we hop back to the proper page,
and Recaptures leave everything in the right spot. I'm not proposing
this as the solution; it just shows where the discrepancy lies.

	I'm not sure what needs to be adjusted to clean this up. Matthias - any
ideas?

Have you tried this with a recent version ? It works nicely for
me. Or do you complain that they are temporarily unshaded ?

The man pages should  definitely    be from the  current    production
release.  The FAQ, links, module  docs and other  pages should be from
the current CVS.

I don't think thats the case.

If a script, or a complete list would help, let me know.

If they're different (at least at the point that 2.2.2 was cut), that's a
problem, isn't it?

I'm done with the menu drawing code rewrite now. Initially all
I wanted was to get left and right aligned columns in the
menu items, but in the end it has become a lot more:

New menu style options:

 BorderWidth:

   menu border width (0 - 50)

 Hilight3DThickness:

  like Hilight3D... but takes a number as an argument (0 - 50).

 SubmenusLeft:

  Reverses the whole menu logic from using submenus on the
  right to using submenus on the left. All aspects of menus
  are affected (layout, popup offset, ...), except the position
  hints.

 ItemFormat:

  Takes a printf-like string to format the layout of the menu
  items. Labels, mini icon, submenu triangle, side picture and
  the hilight area can be placed freely.

Furthermore I removed all constant values from the file. Nearly
all of the layout parameters can be configured dynamically or
be changed by a #define now. I tried to duplicate layout exactly
(except a few bugs). If you notice something strange or unusual
with menus, please tell me.

Bye

I tried it on monday, I think, but perhaps I picked up an old
version at work. It's ok now. There is still an open bug report
for this.

Come to think of it, yeah I guess so.

I think  we need  some more  rules for preparing  a production  branch
release.  Ie. copy the "release independent  files", FAQ, module docs,
etc. from the lastest CVS into the branch.

Notice how I  blame my own mistakes  on the lack  of rules?  Oh  well,
practice makes perfect.

I would agree: *all* docs, faqs and the like ought to be from the
current supported/stable/production (whatever you want to call it)
release, i.e. 2.2.2.

I'm ambivalent about the need to put docs from the current CVS on the web. 
However, *if* the stuff from the current CVS goes anywhere, they must not
be linked from the main pages, but from a clearly-marked separate page.

Ah, good point.  I'll have a look at this on the weekend.  

Since we ultimately use the autoconf macro AC_CHECK_LIB(Xpm,...), and
AC_CHECK_LIB itself inserts '-lXpm' before all the optional library flags
-- which is where the "-L/.... -lXpm" comes from, I see no option other
than rewriting the AC_CHECK_LIB autoconf macro.  Anyone got a better idea?

I noticed there's still a link to Steve's autoconf patch for 2.0.46
on the web page. I guess we can remove that link now. Any objections
if I do that?

More dead links on the 'related sites' page:

 - Eric Kahlers web page doesn't exist anymore (at least at the old place)
 - Chris Rode gave up maintaining his site
 - Barry Warsaws page seems to have changed. The link may have to be updated. 
 - I can't reach "Orlando Andico's CDE panel lookalike" either.
 - The Fvwm95 link is stale.
 - The link to http://www.staticbomb.com/fvwm2gnome/ is stale.
 - The SCWM link does not work for me.
 - The Bowman link is stale.
 - John Lapeyre's FvwmConf page has moved to 
     http://newton.physics.arizona.edu/~lapeyre/fvwmconf/index.html 

That totals 9 stale links out of 19 :-(
If nobody volunteers to work on this I'll update the links, but
only if I really have to.

Be careful, here.  There are *some* files in docs that are
release-independent, like links.html and download.html.

The FAQ and module docs, on the other hand, are *NOT* release independent! 
The module interface, for one, just got changed with the GSFR.  The new
docs are not appropriate for distribution with 2.2.  

Before a release of 2.2.x, one should diff the FAQ file to see if any new
ones are relevant and add them.  But a wholesale copy of docs/* is wrong.

Check the current CVS version of links.html.  I did some cleanup there
once.  [That's where I removed the link to my old autoconf stuff.]

Unfortunately, I failed to copy this over to the 2.2 branch.

I agree that a wholesale copy is not the way to go.

I believe that the module docs generally  identify the release where a
feature  appeared.  (I haven't seen tghe  GSFR stuff.)  They should be
written that way.  If you  are writing a  module for 2.2.2, you should
be made aware of the "current" state of the module interface.

I think the FAQ goes the same way, if the answer to a question is based
on a beta, I think it usually says so.

This is my fault.  What changed is that FvwmIdent does not set itself up
as a transient window. It used to and the default style of
NakedTransient gives a border with no handles.  Now that it isn't a
transient it gets the default of a border with handles.  Your styles for
FvwmIdent end up as

Style FvwmIdent HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 4

which is why it used to get a 4 pixel border and now it gets 0.

I can't remember why I changed it, I may have just accidentally removed
the line in question. I'll put it back if you like.

Cheers,
Tim.

Volunteers required to upgrade these modules to follow the
Default{Font,Color,Background} command from fvwm:
  Fvwm{Form,Icon{Box,Man},Pager,Script,TaskBar,Wharf,WinList}
These modules already do if they have no config settings of font,fg,bg:
  Fvwm{Animate,Buttons,Ident,Scroll}
There is code in libs/ModGraph.c to help parse the config commands from
fvwm.

Now that fvwm can run in a non default visual it would be useful if the
FvwmCpp/M4 modules had some new variables to describe the visual that fvwm
is using e.g. FVWM_PLANES, FVWM_CLASS, FVWM_COLOR.

"HGradient 2 Black White" gives two colors but they are black and grey,
not black and white.  With more colors in the gradient the last color gets
closer but never quite makes it.

Fixing this will mean fixing non-linear gradients too so I'd like to
suggest
that non-linear gradients are changed to allow 0 as a segment size and for
the segment sizes to not have to add up to 100. This would allow for steps
in the gradient and make it easier to adjust gradients without having
to normalize the numbers to add to 100 each time.

e.g. "HGradient 50 5 red 1 red 0 white 10 white 0 blue 1 blue" would give
a nice three stripe pattern with the white stripe being 10 times the width
of
the red and blue stripes.

OK, then the module doc distributed with 2.2.2 needs to either be removed
(because we don't want people writing to that interface) or a nice
disclaimer about this documenting the development version and possibly not
applying to current stable code needs to be added.  Once that's done they
can be the same.  But there's no point in distributing a doc that is
radically different from the one we put up on the web page (unless the page
changes after the fact, but they should be the same at the time of
release).

Um, although taking the man page from the latest *stable* release is
a good idea it's definitely *not* a good idea to take the web pages
from the stable release. This update issue needs more thinking.

Well I don't really need it put back as long as nothing else breaks, I'll
just have to get used to the new syntax.

FvwmForm has text foregrounds and backgrounds and button and input
foregrounds and backgrounds.  Any comments/ideas on how this should be
handled?

I    believe     there    are     similar    issues     for  titlebars
(active/inactive/pressed), and menus (unhilighted, hilighted, grayed).

Doing part of  this with default  commands and part of  this somewhere
else seems like an issue.

It was a mirror (not working anymore). The original page is:

The new address is:
  http://vicarious-existence.mit.edu/scwm/
But the server is sometimes down. The next page is more relable as a link:

Seems not to be supported anymore.

Yet another link, which can be added:
  http://wm-icons.dhs.org/
(Window Manager Icons - efficient icon distribution to use with fvwm).

Today I ran across this:

http://www.xfce.org/en/index.html

It is FVWM based and supports KDE hints.  Perhaps there is something worth
using there.

As an aside, why does it seem that projects are always branching from FVWM
and not sending anything back to the main code?

Wow. It's fantastic! Congratulations, Dominik!
I have just played via FvwmTalk with new commands MenuStyle *. Almost full
power to the menu look. And it is extendable. I am very excited.

There are still some small bugs in menus. For example, for large menus
produced by BuildXLockMenu (with More... menu item), when I use "%r%r"
the first column is randomly adjusted (close to the center).

SubmenusLeft option does not do what is stated in a man page - when
ItemFormat is defined, it only places submenus at the left (and I think
this is the only its function, at least, by its name); when ItemFormat is
not defined it also reverts submenu triangle to be in the oposite side,
but does not affects other item elements (the icon, labels, etc.) and
probably must not (even triangle), see my next letter for some suggestions.

Also, once I got a partial item highlighting (top without bottom).

If I understand right, there is a limit to one menu icon, one submenu
triangle, one side picture, three labels and a lot of gaps.
How hard is to change these limits? Not that I want to.

Again, the new additions are very nice!

Regards,
Mikhael.

The following supposes SubmenusLeft is only affects submenu placements (as
its name says), not the original menu layout.

With the new menu code it is easy to create hebrew-like menus.
Actually, to have a real hebrew/arabic support, there must be an additional
format subdirective, say "!", added to label directives: %!l, %!r, %!c,
which reverts characters in labels. So "Salam" and %!r gives: "   malaS".
Or it is, probably, better yet instead of this subdirective to have
MenuStyle options NormalLabels (default) and ReverseLabels.

And in addition, there must be MenuStyle options, say, DrawFromLeft
(default) and DrawFromRight (which physically reverts the order and all %r
to %l, %< to %>, %5.3 to %3.5). For example, if in an item format there is
only one label, one icon, one side picture and so on, the following:
  ---------
  MenuStyle * DrawFromRight, ItemFormat "%.4s%.1[%.5i%.5l%2.3>%1]"
  ---------
can be already emulated by the:
  ---------
  MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.1[%3.2<%.5i%.5r%1]%4s"
  ---------
But if there is more than one element of the same type (like labels),
currently there is no equivalent to DrawFromRight. I think DrawFromRight
must not imply ReverseLabels. This is also because there are 2 ways of
storing hebrew labels: "Israel" (logical) and "learsI" (visual).

When these 2 options are added, the following defines the real hebrew menus:
  MenuStyle * DrawFromRight, ReverseLabels, SubmenusLeft
(ItemFormat remains the same as in latin menus!)
Note, DrawFromRight doesn't make format directives %< and others obsolete,
they can be used to have more pover over menus (having right triangle and
SubmenusLeft is ok if user wants this).

I hope all this does not confuse you too much.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Shouldn't this be handled by I18N in  a cleaner way ? I think R6 output
methods also support complicated things like right-to-left vs left-to-right
and context-dependent drawing ?

Mmm.  I'm not sure if the docs are written the way you say -- I probably
wouldn't have done so for any FAQ entries I touched -- but I agree that
they should be.   [Another rule for DEVELOPERS?]

Supposing that things are done this way, merging the changes back for a
2.2.x release seems reasonable.

When starting fvwm from xterm, it must invoke RestartFunction, not
InitFunction as it is in 2.3. I see that all code with _XA_WM_DESKTOP was
removed comparing to stable versions (including this additional Restarting     
setting). Please comment on this (Mathias?).

Mikhael.

Yes, you are right. It was stupid of me to suggest a ReverseLabels option.

Although it looks a bit different for me I can confirm there is a problem.
I'm working on it.

I forgot to state what it does with the item format in the man page.
If you use the default, uses a different string for left/right submenus
(the ones mentioned in the man page). But if you define your own
item format, the string is left untouched, i.e. you have to reverse the
string yourself.

Already fixed.

> How hard is to change these limits? Not that I want to.

Trivial for the labels, but every additional label costs 8 bytes per
menu item (assuming pointers use 4 bytes and shorts use 2 bytes). It's
a define already: in menus.c: '#define MAX_ITEM_LABELS 3'.

The other parts are more diffucult because the code isn't prepared
to handle with arrays of these elements.

For the triangles it's fairly easy to change, but not very useful. It
would simply require to handle an array of triangles and to parse
them from the ItemFormat string.

Multiple mini icons are considerably more work since the parsing of the
menu items has to be changed too.

For the side pictures I don't think I will ever write code that allows
to use more than two: one to the left and one to the right.

I have done more work on the menu code

 - fixed lots of bugs
 - %[ and %] in ItemFormat string have been replaced ba %|
 - menus 'bounce' off the screen border, i.e. if one menu
   is put left of its parent because it was too close to
   the border, all of its children will go left too.

I removed the _XA_WM_DESKTOP stuff, since it seemed stupid to have two
mechanisms for the same goal: saving some window state over wm restarts.

What exactly do you mean by "starting fvwm from an xterm" ? RestartFunction
should be used if and only if fvwm was exec'ed from a running fvwm via
"Restart". Am I missing anything here ?

Nope, further analysis shows that this is not a bug. The menu
labels generated by your BuildXLockMenu script contain trailing
spaces. E.g. the first entry I get in the menu is "ant      ",
not "ant" as it should be (strlen("ant      ") is 9). The bug
must be in the perl script.

I can confirm a previous report of windows being lost during
a restart:

  1) I use a sticky FvwmButtons
  2) GotoPage 1 0
  3) Restart

==> FvwmButtons is never seen again. Unfortunately this is not
    enought to reproduce the problem in 100% of the cases.

(I start FvwmButtons from InitFunc/RestartFunc).

Another problem:

  Restarts with an open FvwmIdent window are slower. There is a
  noticable delay before the decorations are drawn. May be a
  FvwmIdent problem.

I'd like to discuss several topics regarding menus. There are some
relics of old code for compatibility reasons I would like to remove.

 1) SeparatorsLong vs. SeparatorsShort

    Did anybody ever notice the difference between these two?
    I'd like to remove them completely and use the long
    separators always. I might be willing to replace them
    with a '%_' bit in the ItemFormat if it's really
    necessary.

 2) Hilight3DThick/Hilight3DThin/Hilight3DOff (made obsolete
    by Hilight3DThickness)

    We could removed the first three in favour of
    Hilight3DThickness. Would save about 50 bytes or so.

 3) PopupAsRootMenu and PopupAsSubmenu.

    I believe nobody ever liked the PopupAsRootmenu behaviour
    and removing the option would spare us a good chunk of hard
    to maintain position hints code.

Any comments on if I should remove any of these candidates?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Oh, and in case anybody notices it: I've replaced that
ugly menu cursor with a north-west arrow (the same one as
over window titles).

Try to "Restart xterm" and then start fvwm from the xterm.
In 2.2 and prior versions this is equivalent to just Restart with nice
side effect - redirecting fvwm output to an xterm. (With my pending patch
you can even combine these 2 things into one "Restart xterm -e fvwm -s")
With the current CVS version you get duplicate windows because of
duplicate InitFunction call. I would like fvwm to call RestartFunction
and not InitFunction in this case. Another solution is a "-restart" option
to fvwm to do the same only on request. What do you prefer?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I moved it into place.  I also decided not to keep the link that was in
/pub/fvwm; it seems that people were getting confused and just picking the
one with the highest version number.

Anyway, now that we have basically four (five?) separate "release"
increments that folks can get the source in, I think it's important that
they be detailed somewhere.

Discuss on fvwm list:
  Stable release   - If you don't know, use this.

Discuss on fvwm-workers list.  No promises:
  Unstable release - If you can tolerate some bugs but really need new features.
  Daily snapshot   - If you want the development stuff but don't want to
                     set up the build environment.
  FTP source tree  - If you want to use CVS but can't.
  CVS              - When you _must_ have the latest stuff, up to the
                     minute, or want to contribute heavily.

Not that I have any strong feelings about this, but why
change a default that can be changed anyway (using CursorStyle)?

If you really need this, then -restart might be a good way to achieve it
...but in what way is  -restart different from 
-cmd 'DestroyFunc InitFunc' -n' -cmd 'AhnToFunc InitFuncion "I"
RestartFunction' ?

Here is a patch that incorporates mouse stroke recognition into fvwm2.
the patch was made against the current CVS version 2.3.4. Hopefully, it
will still apply cleanly... I'm not so sure though with the productivity 
of the worker-list. :)

Someone mentioned a while back on the list about using mouse stroke in fvwm2.
The author of LibStroke is Mark Willey, and the libstroke library is available
at (http://www.etla.net/~willey/projects/libstroke/). He did have a patch
made against fvwm 2.0.45, but with the new autoconf and binding changes, I
had to make a lot of modifications.

Anyway, a man page entry is also included... Please check the patch and see
if you like it.


As a side note, is there something wrong with how Hilight interact with
MenuFace in the new menu code?

Here is what I use:
MenuStyle "*"\
    HilightBack Yellow, \
    Hilight3DOff, \
    ActiveFore Purple, \
    MenuFace DGradient 128 2 rgb:50/a0/a0 60 rgb:2f/b6/c2 40 white, \
    ItemFormat "%.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%2.3>%1|"

Before the new code was in place, I would get a menu item highlight of 
purple/yellow, with the rest of the menu in a DGradient.

Now, everything work as expect without the MenuFace line. But if I had the
MenuFace in there. I get a gradient, purple foreground, but no yellow
background. The background does not change at all in a highlight.

Hi!

(CVS snapshot June 4 & June 5):
The transparency for Eterminals as provided by

# Esetroot background_image.gif
# Eterm --trans

seems to be broken.

CVS snapshots of June 3rd and before work.
It also works if I use the fvwm2 binary
(/usr/local/bin/fvwm2) of June, 3rd 
together with the Fvwm-Modules of June 5th.

Version: 2.3.3
CVS_Date: June 5, 1999
OS: RH Linux 5.2, Kernel 2.2.9
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.3.1-1
glibc 2.0, Gnome 1.0
                   

thanx, 
Amir

Hi!

fvwm2 crashes and coredumps if one:
1. clicks on the root window to get a root menu, 
2. moves the mouse pointer away from the menu, 
3. presses the "left" or "right" cursor key.

Interestingly, nothing happens when I use the "up" or "down" keys.

Version: 2.3.3
CVS_Date: June 3, 1999
OS: RH Linux 5.2, Kernel 2.2.9
X_Server: XFree86 3.3.3.1-1
glibc 2.0, Gnome 1.0

happy hacking,
Amir

The default must be nice if you want to attract new users.

I just think it worked consistently and I prefer 2.3 to be somehow
compatible with 2.2 in that aspect.

Ok, here are other examples. Restarting to other window manager and back,
or restarting to another fvwm version and back. In the last case with 2.2
InitFunction and two RestartFunction`s are called (which is correct), with
2.3 versions three InitFunction`s are called which is very annoying.

What I am asking is determining that it is not the first fvwm (see the
subject), just like 2.2.2 did. "-restart" option is ok for me, but it
is sometimes not functional, since there are no fvwm versions (or clones)
accepting parameters in "Restart fvwm2 -restart". I can implement both
solutions, but prefer you to do this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	You may be underestimating Rob's cleverness here. In any case, it was a
very nice feature whose implications go beyond the xterm example, and
I'm finding it increasingly bothersome to lose it.

	One of the things that historically made FVWM friendlier than most
other window managers is its willingness to "restart" other things -
things like other window managers, not just an xterm. Because of the way
many of them work, using their "restart" function would cause FVWM to
restart instead (although they don't natively provide a command to
"restart" another window manager). So, you could, for whatever reason,
start up another window manager, do whatever you wanted to do under it,
then easily and gracefully return to FVWM, and FVWM would understand
that it was restarting. You can no longer do this, because of the
changes in argument passing and the elimination of the _XA_WM_DESKTOP
stuff.


> RestartFunction should be used if and only if fvwm was exec'ed from a
> running fvwm via "Restart". Am I missing anything here ?

	I think you are. A Restart should be recognized if FVWM is starting up
again in the same session as the previous instance, no matter how many
other programs may have been executed in the meantime.

	Now, I've tried to figure a way to save the "restarting" state across
an intervening invocation of another program, but I haven't come up with
anything fool-proof. 

	Clearly, the "-restart" option won't work with a "foreign" program:
that's the same problem as the passing of "-restore", which got Mikhael
started re-working the argument passing logic in the first place.

	I thought about storing a "restarting" or "how last terminated" flag in
the restart file, but this is not proof against the user's invoking
another window manager and then terminating the X session rather than
returning to FVWM.

	It seems to me that the only way you can reliably determine that you're
starting up under the same instance of the X server is to have the X
server communicate this information with you - which is done by setting
a property on the root window.

	Also, I believe there was a question some time back about how a program
determines whether FVWM is running. (I know, a well-written program
shouldn't be trying to do such things - but in the real world, people do
write such programs, and users often expect them to work.) We've removed
the ability to determine this.


> If you really need this, then -restart might be a good way to achieve it
> ...but in what way is  -restart different from

> RestartFunction' ?

	Huh? The purpose of a Restart (as implemented in FVWM) is to invoke a
completely clean instance of the window manager - insuring, for example,
that no global variables are left in a suspect state.

	I think we need to think long and hard about 1) whether the "-restart"
command flag is really workable, and 2) whether we should reinstate
setting a wm property on the root window.

Because it looks terrible, obscures the text and the average user

I decided to take a break from hacking fvwm for a while, so if you do it,
it might arrive earlier.

Btw. my final position on this whole restart business is that it would
be best to rip off Restart, InitFunction/RestartFunction (at least for the 
purpose of starting initial clients) completely. This is all
session manager functionality and should be provided by a session manager.

OK OK, it is obvious by now that removing XA_WM_DESKTOP caused a lot of
trouble and only a little code cleanup. So let's just bring back a property
for checking that fvwm is restarting. We can then set the Restarting flag
based on the presence of the property. using -restore ~/.fvwm_restart should
no longer be necessary then. Instead fvwm should look for this file
automatically if it is restarting.

But I have already added a better way to do this. Check out ICCCM 2
on "manager selections".

Well, the complaint was about RestartFunction not being run. I just wanted
to point out that you can force this on the command line simply by making
the two functions the same.

I vote for 2).

First of all, here is a patch that enable hilight background on a gradient
menu. This is a feature I like, and it was available untill the recent menu
rewrite.

Do you feel this is the right behavior for menu, Dominik? I would like to know
your opinion... Maybe this should be made into a customizable option?

BTW, I do use SeparatorShort for my menus; I hope it would remain, but I could
live without it.


My question is about the stroke patch I submitted, here is the situation:

In my .fvwm2rc, I use Button 3 for the stroke button. This works pretty well,
except now that ButtonPress and ButtonRelease for button 3 are both sent to 
fvwm. Even when I am focused in another application. As I don't know much about
X programming, I really don't know how to solve this. What I want to do is for
fvwm to receive Button event wher I am in the context defined in the stroke
definition (for example, root). But when I am focused on another application's 
frame, I wanted to have some way for fvwm to release the grab on button 3. Can
anyone show me where should I change this?

I hope it is the best solution. I can restore this sometimes soon.

Also, as Matthias said, we can do not add "-restore" on a native Restart.
And the same goes to "-s". In this way "Restart command args" is always
parsed and there are no special cases of it (except of empty "Restart").
On empty "Restart" the original fvwm with the initial arguments is called.
Any complains?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Log message:
Created libtool branch.

This branch is for experimenting with libtool support, which allows
easy generation of a shared libfvwm.

Check out this branch with "cvs checkout -r libtool fvwm" or
"cvs update -r libtool" from currently-checked out sources.

You need libtool (see www.gnu.org) installed to use this branch.

Shared libraries are off by default, use --enabled-shared to build (&
install) shared libfvwm.

Additional note:

After the checkout, run "libtoolize" in the top-level of the source tree

Can you send me both the full command line for configure and the full
config.log file.  Thanks.

The check cannot have succeeded.  If it had, the second check would not
occur.

Er, well, the "--help" strings are meant to be reminders, not the primary
documentation.  Does the INSTALL.fvwm file clarify things?  If not, can
you suggest improvements?

Hello Jason,

A while back you mentioned that you were investigating other bug tracking
systems.  Did you reach any conclusions?  

One that you had mentioned was Debian's.  I had a look at their web page,
and it sounded really nice.  I particularly like the fact that developers
can update it by email.

Istanbul was Constantinople,
now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'!

There is a similar function in libs/Parse.c already: GetModuleResource().
Perhaps it should be moved into libs/Module.c, but I don't think we need
the function twice.

Really? I thought it didn't work. Hmm, I think we had a discussion about that when
we made some enhancements to the menu gradient code and thought that wouldn't
work. But later we made a change that should have fixed it.

Of course. What does the man page say about this?

But it already *is* an option. Nobody forces you to use HilightBack if
you don't like it.

That's the problem with such features. If you have them you'll always find
someone who dosn't want to lose them :-)

Hello,

A few months ago you posted to the fvwm list about a problem with
FvwmCommandS dying with "dead pipe", and the CC'ed people contributed
to the thread.

I tried to use FvwmCommandS yesterday, hit this problem, and found the
thread on Dejanews. Dejanews didn't throw up the more recent messages
(including Toshi's quick fix), so I started debugging. You might be
interested in the results.

I'm also copying to fvwm-workers, who might want to note the last
paragraph; even though I'm not involved with fvwm at all---hope
that's OK.

You didn't say what OS you were using, but I'm betting it's Linux.
It turns out (after about six hours trying to work out what could
possibly be wrong with fvwm :-( ) that there is a bug in all Linux
kernels (at least all 2.X kernels). Namely, if you do a read() of
length zero on a non-empty pipe, it returns an error. This is
blatantly wrong, of course, and is a simple bug in the system code.

This is triggered by the FvwmCommandS line that sends a null message
to fvwm2: fvwm2 reads the command size (0), then does a read of length
zero to get the text. Owing to the kernel bug, this returns error, so
fvwm2 shuts down the connection.
The reason it is (as I found) intermittent, typically going away when
you trace, is that a 0-length read on an *empty* pipe does work: so if
fvwm2 reads the text before FvwmCommandS has sent the "cont" flag, it's
OK.
I don't know why it doesn't seem to have been a major problem with the
2.0 kernels; maybe some artefact of scheduling meant it was rarely
triggered.

I enclose a copy of the message I sent to linux-kernel, and I think
the bug should be fixed in the next kernels. However, as people
probably upgrade fvwm2 more easily than kernels, it might be worthwhile
for the fvwm community to incorporate a work-around, by not doing any
zero length reads in the functions that read from pipes.
(Sorry, no patch: I only have an old version of fvwm2.)

Here's the message I sent to linux-kernel:

Subject: [PROBLEM+PATCH] 2.X zero-length read on non-empty pipe returns EAGAIN
Date: Mon, 7 Jun 1999 12:19:44 +0200 (MDT)

[Note: I can't find a maintainer for this, which means it's probably
Linus, which means there's no email address to send patches to.
Is this the only place I need to send it? ]

This problem was observed with kernel 2.2.9 on an i386, but appears
from the source to be present in all 2.X kernels.

Description: a read() with count=0 on a pipe that is not empty
should return 0; instead it returns -1 with EAGAIN.

Reproduce by the following program:
----- begin pipebug.c -----
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  int fds[2];
  int n; char junk[10];char *data = "0123456789";

  pipe(fds);
  if ( fork() ) {
    close(fds[1]);
    sleep(5); /* just to ensure the write has happened in the child! */
    n = read(fds[0],junk,0);
    printf("Got %d chars\n",n);
    if ( n < 0 ) perror("first read");
    n = read(fds[0],junk,4);
    printf("Got %d chars\n",n);
    if ( n < 0 ) perror("second read");
  } else {
    close(fds[0]);
    write(fds[1],data,4);
    sleep(10) ; /* to avoid closing pipe */
  }
}
----- end pipebug.c -----

Analysis: simple bug in pipe_read() in linux/fs/pipe.c.

Fix: *If* the manual page for read() is correct in saying that 
a read of length zero should always return 0 and do nothing else,
then the enclosed patch is probably right. (Somebody who knows, please
check that it should indeed come after the invalid seek test---I don't
know enough about what the fs routines are defined to do.)
If on the other hand there are circumstances in which such a read
should return an error (e.g. if it is felt that the locking should
still be done), then a slightly less trivial fix is required.

Without a similar bug in FvwmCommandS it would never have surfaced.
We were doing a zero length write and were expecting it to succeed,
which - acoording to the man page - it doesn't. Now that we don't do
zero writes FvwmCommandS doesn't get a dead pipe. I think it might be
better to see if more such problems surface that to clutter the fvwm
code with workarounds for bugs in the code of someone else. Once its
in the code we will never be able to remove it again, but if
someone complains we can simply tell him to update his kernel.

Oops, sorry, my memory has failed me. The man page says that nothing
is written to a file descriptor for a length of zero.

To me, GetModuleResource() doesn't look at all similar to either of the
two functions I added.  Please elaborate.

It ain't a library, it's a TOOL to *create* libraries -- shared libraries
in particular -- in a portable way.  Think of it as "automake for shared
libraries".  

You can find the links on www.gnu.org.

OK, GetModuleResource() doesn't *check* if the string begins with
*ModuleName, but checks and then returns the string following

Right, I should have read the source more carefully (or tried it!).

In 2.0, the check for count=0 was done by the read system call itself,
but in the recent kernels it's done by the file operations. I wonder
why?

So, my apologies for exaggerating the problem (to all),
and thanks to you for catching me out!

AND it does up to two malloc()s and one free()
AND it requires the prefix to begin with '*'.

GetModuleResource() is much more specialised than what I wrote --- which
is basically a strncasecmp() call. 

I wrote it because I saw a lot of

      }else if (strncasecmp(tline,CatString3("*",MyName,
      else if (strncasecmp(tline,"ImagePath",9)==0)
      else if (strncasecmp(tline,"ClickTime",9)==0)
      else if (strncasecmp(tline,"ColorLimit",10)==0) {

in the module code.

When I changed IconPath & PixmapPath to ImagePath, I missed updating a few
of the string lengths, which caused crashes.  I thought StrHasPrefix()
might spare someone this pain in future. 

But you're right to point out the similarities with GetModuleResource(),
since these strncasecmp()'s really are a parsing step.  The next
instruction is often something like 

	CopyString (&imagePath, &tline[9]);

in which case a routine that checks the prefix (without mandating an
asterisk) and returns the next token would be a win.  But does there need
to be all these mallocs and frees?

That bothers me too, but I'd prefer a different approach of cleaning
this up. Just call GetModuleResource() once to strip the *ModuleName
from 'tline' and then use StrEquals() to do the comparisons.

Using str*n*casecmp is stupid anyway. Reading the word after *ModuleName
and comparing against that seems to be the right way.

No, of course not. We can as well have a PeekModuleResource function
like we have PeekToken vs. GetNextToken.

Hmm, your function is a good start. It can be used without large changes in
the modules and prevents some future (and perhaps present).

Not really.  I haven't seen any real contenders besides BugZilla and the
Debian system, so I'll probably install them both at some point and see
what happens.

Email maintenance is not limited to Debian's system, though.  Requiring
email is something I see as a very serious flaw in any system, though.

Sorry for not making this clear. This feature was working for me in 2.3.2, and
It is broken since 2.3.3 (basically right after the menu rewrite). Now, by 
broken I meant the following config line will not give me a hillight without
the patch. And it is because in the hilight code, there is a specific check 
against gradient menu.

MenuStyle "*"\
    HilightBack Yellow, \
    Hilight3DOff, \
    ActiveFore Purple, \
    MenuFace DGradient 128 2 rgb:50/a0/a0 60 rgb:2f/b6/c2 40 white, \

This won't work.  "ColorLimit" is sent to each module not
*FvwmModuleColorLimit.  Fvwm send a bunch of global config things in
response to a send_config request from a module but since fvwm doesn't
know what name the module is looking for it can't prepend the module
name in front of the ColorLimit line.

Cheers,
Tim.

Did anyone ever notice that we don't have a single screen shot on our

Just to be perfectly clear, since my statement above is a bit
ambigous: fvwm-2.2.2 modules don't do zero-length writes any more, since
this has been fixed in the correct place, namely SendText().
Thus fvwm-2.2.2 is correct, but it still tickles the recent Linux bug.
Making FvwmCommandS.c send " " instead of "" is the sort of workaround
that you were discouraging in your first reply to me, so it shouldn't
be bad news that that isn't in 2.2.2.
So I don't think there's a problem if you hold to the view that other
people's bugs are not your problem.

It's bad news because 2.2.2 doesn't work and 2.3.3 does. Sending " "
may be a hack, but sending "" is a *bug*. From my Linux man page (write):

  If count is zero and the file descriptor refers  to  a  regular  file,
  0  will  be returned  without causing any other effect.  For a special
  file, the results are not portable.

So think of sending " " as a bug fix since a zero write isn't even defined
for pipes.

You say that FvwmCommandS from 2.2.2 gets a dead pipe but doesn't do zero
length writes. So where does this happen?

Dominik, something in your changes seems to have changed the vertical
spacing between menu items.  With really short menus the text looks
almost squished.  I checked the manpage but I didn't see anything under
MenuStyle that would apply.  HEre is my menustyle if you need it.

MenuStyle * mwm, \

It seems in the last week or so, about the time the restart changes
happened that StartsOnPage stopped working on startup and restarts.

I have GlobalOpts CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage, RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
in my rc, which always used to work when I started up fvwm2 on an
existing X server.  This is the way I always do it so I can switch
between different versions of fvwm without loosing my X session.

Previouslly when I started up all my windows would get put back in the
right places.  Now they just stay on desk 0 on the page they were on
before the restart.

At the moment I can't check to see if a restart works or if its just
a clean start issue since M4 doesn't get rerun when I use the restart
function anymore.

	Oops! Looks like I broke this while trying to fix the other wandering
windows on Restart/Recapture problems. I'll look into this - I may have
to re-think the whole thing.

	If I recall correctly what I did, you should have the same problem with
restarts.

Well, it works for me (CVS on June 8th). At least the part that fvwm
plays in this works.  Esetroot seems to have problems if run more than
once and Eterm is broken by design 8-).

What do you think is broken?

Cheers,
Tim.

don't know if it's related / already fixed:

1) back in 2.0.47 there was the need to wait a little bit during restart.
   Especially on slow machines (had a sparc ipc then), there was the need
   for hidden (or swallowed) windows to be remapped, so that the new
   windowmanager recognized them and added them to the stacking order &
   other structures. 

   The wait was usually one or two banner calls in RestartFunction.
   (Depending how slow your machine was. Could be that it dosn't occur
   often on todays machines.)
   If anybody cared to fix it, it never got incorporated (up to 2.0.47d) 

2) it's possible to have a window moved completely off page.
   If you (like me) have an 4x2 desktop, there are sometimes windows, which
   are on page 0 -1 (!)

3) another artefact is a sticky window on the _next_ page.
   if you move to the next page, it moves, _too_, since it's sticky.
   so you can never catch it, as it's always on the _next_ page.
   You can see it in the pager, but you can never reach it by switching to
   that page.
   You can move it in the pager via the middle mouse button, though.

   I don't know how I produced that. (you might experiment with style
   sticky and big placement values to see the effect, though that wasn't
   the case for my observations.
	e.g: xclock -geometry +1200+1200
   produced that effect - xclocks are sticky for me)

   It's happened several times over the years after restarts.

That's an intentional change. I reduced the item height to the absolute minimum
with a gap of one pixel above and below the items. Is this a problem?

Well to my eye the menus look awfully squished on 1280x1024 display.  I
suppose I can become acustom to it, unless its someplace in the code I
can change easilly.

Not if you have some of your windows "WindowListSkip'ed".  That was one of
the assumptions I was making in my original request.

I can confirm this. The transparency is really broken (seems like Eterm 
gets wrong window coordinates on move from fvwm).

And without a transparency the background image of Eterm does not appear
until the first window move.

Mikhael.

I have increased the space by one pixel again. Does it look better now?
All parameters to modify the menu looks are very easy to change now
(that was one of the main goals behind the menu drawing rewrite). Look
at menus.c. At the start of the file you will find lots of #defines
controlling nearly all spacing values (except the ones that can be
configured anyway). The ones you would want to change are

  /* gap above item text */
  #define ITEM_TEXT_Y_OFFSET        0
  /* gap below item text */
  #define ITEM_TEXT_Y_OFFSET2       2

Note that when you wrote your mail the second offset was 1.

Well, "very easy to change" is relative.  Preprocessor substitutions are 
easy to change at compile time, but that's incredibly hard to change at
run-time (or if you're only given a binary, which is unfortunately
becoming more and more often the case, esp. as binary rpm and other
packaging formats gain popularity).

One of the fundamental problems I think fvwm2 still suffers from is
*way* too much compile time configurability of things that should be run 
time configurable.  E.g., the spacing of menus is clearly something
where different users will likely have different preferences;  you don't 
want to have to build different binaries for different users, so those
values need to be run time parameters, not compile time #defines.  It's
easy enough to make values run-time configurable, and I'm surprised it's 
done so infrequently.

Run time options are also far better for testing than compile time
defines and conditional compilation directives;  imagine having to build 
all the different versions of the source code to be sure there wasn't a
path through conditional compilation directives that was going to cause
problems.  Too much preprocessor is a disaster!

Given a spec file, I can make an RPM.  I suppose I could take the spec from
the current RedHat packages.  I've actually made my own RPMs since the last
time this was discussed, so I understand what is involved a bit more now.

(As an aside, I'm being sorely tempted by Debian after my RPM experience.)

I just last night got the latest cvs version 2.3.4 it says.  I'm quite
interested in the new stroke functions, however apart from a simple cfg
file on he libs home page and I really can't find any thing in regards
to docs on how to configure it.  Since this is a cvs version and this
lib may or may not end up in the release version I was just wondering
where someone would get the docs to even write a man page about this.

Coooooooome to the light! :)

Actually, I quite like RedHat a lot, and I'm not sure Debian's package
stuff is any more straightforward than RPM from a development
standpoint, but I switched from RH 5.2 to Debian 2.0 when I got my new
system in January, and it would take a _lot_ to convince me to move
back.

Initial install may be slightly simpler for the newbie with RedHat, but
ongoing system maintenance/package upgrade with Debian is _light_years_
more simple than RedHat.  Want the newest version of a package?

  # apt-get update
  # apt-get install <package>

That's _it_.  I don't have to know anything about ftp site directory
hierarchies, etc. etc.  Want to update to all the latest packages you
have (obviously, taking into account (possibly conflicting) dependency
issues, etc.)  What to upgrade to _all_ the latest packages?

  # apt-get update
  # apt-get upgrade

Done.  That's how I went from Debian 2.0 to 2.1.  Flawless.  And,
although the default Debian sites might not contain stuff like Qt and
KDE, there are alternate sites you just add to your site list, then you
can use the above commands to get these packages, too, without doing
anything special.

RedHat could do this too, and I hope they do.  But until then... Debian
for me.

I tried 2.0 many months back and was well on my way to really liking
it a lot better than RedHat, when I fscked things up rather badly. Now
I'm stuck back in my RH4 installation waiting to find the time to do
the big migration again.

The one thing I think .deb's got over .rpm is that .deb allows for
post-installation configuration, which .rpm doesn't seem to do, based
on the skim I made of _Maximum_RPM_. I've also never seen it happen,
so...

Anyway, I think it's come up before, but I think it'd be nice if we
(fvwm-workers) included .spec for making RPMs and whatever it was that
was used to build .deb's. Julian seems a likely candidate for
maintaining the Debian file...

Well, I did hack up a Stroke entry in the fvwm2 manpage. So, if you search
for Stroke in the man page you will find an example and syntax on how to 
config fvwm2 to use strokes. BTW, you do need to install libstroke first.

I will be glad to answer any config problems you may have. Now, I am having fun

Hmmm, I can see a pronlem but only with large background images, a small
tile works fine but with a large picture Eterm gets the wrong origins
for the main window and the scrollbars. As soon as you move it though it
fixes itself.  Maybe we're missing sending a synthetic window configure
event on map since the window won't map where it positioned itself but
somewhere else. It gets the size it wants so I guess the server does not
send a message when fvwm reparents it to another place. Maybe it was
just luck that the small tile repeat just matched the offset

This sounds like an Eterm bug, it feels like a buggy app: when it first
appears there is no menu bar but when I move it the menubar appears;
Esetroot only works once, I had to remove the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID &
_XROOTPMAP_ID properties from the root to get it to run again.

Hi!

2.3.3/4 CVS, beginning from June 4th through June, 8th

Once again, Eterms:
Not only the transparency and background image processing are broken,
as reported before.
Odd enough, the scrollbars are gone, too, rendering the Eterms
almost useless.

It's interesting, though, that the Gnome-Terminal is uneffected by the
latest changes in the fvwm source, transparency, background images, and 
scrollbars are alive and well. 
The Gnome-terminal is no real replacement for Eterm, in terms of 
configurability, and also when it comes to scrolling (bad flickering in
the Gnome-terminal). 
Eterm's line break algorithm is superior to xterm's or nxterm's, too.

So I keep on whining, and I'd rather go without new options the nicely 
reconfigured menus and stick with 2.3.3 ;)

The "problem" is only related to the fvwm2 binary, not the Modules, so 
I simply run the fvwm2 binary from the june-3rd-CVS together with the 
June-[4,5,6,7,8]th-modules (insane, I know...)

thanx,
Amir

Does this mean it works with 2.3.3 ?

I never intended the user to change the vertical spacing at all (and
neither the horizontal spacing, it's a byproduct of the ItemFormat).

Come on, I can't do *everything*. You should know menus.c from 2.0.46 well
enough to know it was a mess (in general and refering to the drawing
code as well). Constants numbers (I'm not talking about macros) were
scattered all over the file. Getting to the present state took me
4 full days, spell *thirtytwo hours*. And the result is that nearly
all numbers influencing the placement and look of the menus *can* be
changed in a single place. Just take the border width that was hard coded
to 2 pixels before.  There were about twenty places where it was used, and
often you didn't even know why (you can't imagine the amount of bugs in
the drawing code I found). Now there are about fifteen macros for
menu drawing and I could easily think of a few more. I really don't
want to bloat fvwm with fifteen new options that nobody except me is
able to use (and in half a year I'll have forgotten what they do exactly).

Yes. I'd like to take out most of the configure options too. I think most
of them don't work properly anyway if switched off.

At present we have 14 features that can be explicitly turned
on and off with configure. Most of them don't make much sense.
And turning off all these options saves only about 20k of code.

  BORDERSTYLE
  MULTISTYLE
  EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE
  GRADIENT_BUTTONS
  PIXMAP_BUTTONS
  VECTOR_BUTTONS
  ACTIVEDOWN_BTNS
  INACTIVE_BTNS
  MINI_ICONS
  USEDECOR

All the above options do you no good except savig very little
code.

  MODALITY_IS_EVIL
  FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS
  SHAPE
  GNOME

These four are the only ones that may have user visible effects.
The debug messages are a mess anyway (you don't ever get useful
information from them), so I'd take them out too. SHAPE is probably
something to detect automatically. We could still have a fvwm
command that turns shape labels on and off. I don't know if there
are people who disable MODALITY_IS_EVIL.

What do you think, should we remove all the buttons/style/decor
related options (i.e. the first group) in a first sweep?

Maybe we shouldn't do that, since we might regret it, when we eventually do
native support for multiple displays - but maybe it will fit in nicely ...

Like the -s this can be a severe compatibility issue for later versions.


sorry, I just wanted this issue to be discussed first

ok well minus the space saving of a piddly 20k if their config doesn't
use them does fvwm run any slower?  If not I see no real reason to
change the way it is now personally.

Is the shape extension part of standard Xlib? If we remove the ability
to compile out SHAPE would we risk fvwm not compiling on some platforms?

I vote yes.

I have rpm packages made up for RedHat 6.0 using the SPECS from the
RedHat 6.0 version of FVWM2 2.2and modified for FVWM2 2.2.2. I have the
source rpm, and the binary rpm's for fvwm2 and fvwm2-icons. They are on
my machine and home, and I can upload them if you want.

Hmm.  Interesting.  Well, SHAPE is an X server extension, first, so I
suppose it's possible to compile fvwm with SHAPE enabled, then connect
to an X server that doesn't support it.  No idea what fvwm will do with
that.

Second, it's possible to build fvwm on systems where the SHAPE extension
isn't supported; I'm not familiar enough with the details of the code to
know if that will cause build errors if SHAPE isn't defined.

However, I don't think Dominik was suggesting we remove the #ifdefs for
SHAPE, only that it be determined automatically by configure and
provided as an option to the user.

My personal opinion on all these items is, if we have to make it
optionally compiled for some reason anyway (like it won't be supported
on some systems) we might as well let the user specify it, too.

All the places I've seen shape stuff look like:

#ifdef SHAPE
if (ShapesSupported) {
 ...
}
#endif

so a shape enabled fvwm will work with a shape disabled server.

No, it's not noticably slower.

Well, you don't have to maintain the code. It's a pain in the ass
to have to think about 2^14 combinations of compile options while
writing code. And many of the options don't do what they are supposed
to anyway. E.g. there are lots of places handling mini icons even if
the MINI_ICONS define is inactive.

You can't remove the ifdefs completely because you may not have the
shape extension on the machine you compile.

Why not make a fvwm command that switches shapes on or off if it's
compiled in:

  ShapedIcons on/off

That would work for SHAPE, since (based on Tim's description) it's
already coded that way.  It might not work for other optional features,
though (XPM support, etc.)

Note SHAPE deals with more than just icons; I'd prefer something like
ShapeExtension or UseShapeExtension.  YMMV.

The reason why I talk about SHAPE is that there is a user visible
change in behaviour depending on if you have them or not. If you
don't like shaped icons, disabling the configure option changes
the looks of your icons, even if you don't touch the config file.

> Note SHAPE deals with more than just icons; I'd prefer something like

I don't care. I noticed that some of the modules use the SHAPE #define
too, so we will have to extend the module interface.

I'd rather see style options: ShapedIconYes/ShapedIconNo,
ShapedWindowYes/ShapedWindowNo. These would default to Yes if the server
supports shapes, be fixed to No if the server doesn't support shapes,
and would only be compiled in if SHAPE is defined.

Cheers,
Tim.

Subject: InteractiveMove fix in 2.2.2 makes move act strangely

Full_Name: Joe Ramey
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: Sun X server
Submission from: (NULL) (192.94.94.1)


When I changed from 2.2 to 2.2.2, moving windows started acting strangely.
What I mean is this: when I click on the edge of a window to move it,
then begin moving it very soon after I click, the mouse pointer somehow
gets ahead of the window.  Normally (including with 2.2) when I click
on the edge of a window and then quickly move the mouse, the mouse pointer
remains firmly attached to the edge of the window.  With 2.2.2 though
there
seems to be some kind of delay between the mouse movement and the initial
window movement.  I can easily reproduce the problem just by clicking the
edge
of a window to move it and then move the mouse very quickly.

I found that if I removed the change to fvwm/move.c that was made between
2.2 and 2.2.2, the problem goes away.  The change between these versions
was very simple:
*** move.c-2.2  Tue Jun  8 17:14:33 1999
--- move.c-2.2.2        Tue Jun  8 17:14:17 1999
***************
*** 788,794 ****
        XFlush(dpy);
      }
  
!   if (eventp->type != KeyPress)
      {
        DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
        DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;
--- 788,794 ----
        XFlush(dpy);
      }
  
!   if (eventp->type == ButtonPress)
      {
        DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
        DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;

I added some debug code to print out the value of eventp->type when
InteractiveMove is called.  I don't understand this, but the value
printed was 5: according to my X.h file, 5 is ButtonRelease.  I would
think that ButtonPress would be the event here, but I'm not much of
an X programmer.  Maybe I'm missing something.

Anyway I made the following change which fixes the problem for me and
retains the sense of the change that was made from 2.2 to 2.2.2:

*** move.c-2.2.2        Tue Jun  8 17:14:17 1999
--- move.c      Wed Jun  9 11:40:06 1999
***************
*** 788,794 ****
        XFlush(dpy);
      }
  
!   if (eventp->type == ButtonPress)
      {
        DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
        DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;
--- 788,794 ----
        XFlush(dpy);
      }
  
!   if (eventp->type == ButtonPress || eventp->type == ButtonRelease)
      {
        DragX = eventp->xbutton.x_root;
        DragY = eventp->xbutton.y_root;

Again, I really don't understand why this is happening though.

Joe

I can't remember the exact logic behind this right now, but the code

  if (eventp->type == ButtonPress || eventp->type == ButtonRelease)

is correct and the line we have in the current development code.
Unfortunately this bug fix dosn't seem to have made it into 2.2.2.

Pending for 2.2.3:

1) Web page updates
2) Window moving problem

I think it might make sense to solve #1 with the proposed new
source tree for screenshots.  Maybe it should be the "fvwm-web"
source tree?

One problem is the "NEWS" and "FAQ" files in the source tree create
the NEWS.html and FAQ.html files, which sort of blows that idea
right out of the water.

I had asked this question before and haven't received a response,
thus, I'll try once more in hopes of an answer (yes, I looked into the
DOCs and the FAQ)

   Is there anyway to get a Fvwmbuttons button to stay pressed-in to indicate
   a certain feature is on/off.  In other words, is it possible to have all
   the buttons start-off with a non-pressed-in look and change based on
   certain functions embedded into the button.  For example, this used to
   work fine in fvwm-1.24r (the button would in fact look pressed-in)

     in fvwm-1.24r

     *GoodStuff Paging       clamp.xpm       TogglePage

   I was able to recreate the functionality in fvwm-2.x.x (TogglePage was
   retired) by doing this in my .fvwm2rc file

     in fvwm-2.x.x

     AddToMenu MiniScrollMenu
     +       "ON"                    EdgeScroll 100 100
     +       "OFF"                   EdgeScroll 0 0

     *FvwmButtons Paging     clamp.xpm       Popup MiniScrollMenu

   But now I don't see the button pressed-in.  Is there anything I could do
   to toggle between a pressed-in look (to indicate OFF for example) and
   non-pressed-in look (to indicate ON)

I'm using 2.2.2

Dominik,

     I was entering a new bug into Fvwm's BugTracker and noticed that
bug #86 is noted as fixed (it really isn't); bug #86 is very much
part of bug/enhancement #266.  The two (86 and 266) ought to be combined
into one bug which is still evident today in 2.2.0/2.2.2

Reminder: the whole discussion came about because of FvwmWinList.c line #744
          (Magic Number)

Just clarifying.

On a "fresh" login into fvwm (if I were to invoke xscreensaver everything
works fine.  If I were to do a "restart" of fvwm and now invoke
xscreensaver,
the FvwmPager is still visible during the screen-saver's activity.

Steps to follow:
 1. Login (not via a restart)
 2. start xscreensaver-3.12
 3. note that NOTHING is visible while screensaver is active (just the
hacks)
 4. do a restart of fvwm (through a menu or something)
 5. start xscreensaver-3.12
 6. BUG -> FvwmPager is still visible while the screensaver is active

I've FvwmIdent'ed both pagers, the pre-restart and post, and both contain
the
same exact data.  What else can I do to narrow the problem ? 

Using:
 version        : fvwm-2.2.0  AND-OR fvwm-2.2.2
 host           : SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_105428-01 sun4u sparc

Well my guess would be your having problems because there are two xscreensavers running.  When you do a restart the first does not go die it is still running so there is no reson to restart it

Hi!

I think I found some (odd) ways to make Eterms working again for me:

1) Simply click CTRL + mouse button into the Eterm and voila:
   transparency/menus/scrollbars appear.
   All mouse buttons work as long as you press CTRL.
2) Resize. Same nice effect.

Fascinating.

maybe that helps, but:

> Hmmm, I can see a pronlem but only with large background images, a small
> tile works fine but with a large picture Eterm gets the wrong origins
> for the main window and the scrollbars. 

I can't conform this, small pics don't work either.

> What happens if you move the it? What version of Eterm are you using?

Nothing. no menu/scrollbar/backgroud image/transparency appears.

(But I think I might know why it works for you and not for me ;) 
- do you move windows with CTRL + mouse? )

> What version of Eterm are you using?
Eterm-0.8.8

> Does this mean it works with 2.3.3 ?

Yes, although I'm not sure about the exact date of the transition 
to 2.3.4 (was it June, 5th?).
It worked with all CVS-snapshots since April, and stopped working 
on June 4th.

Another observation:
when I do a restart from fvwm2-binary version 2.3.3 (June 3rd) to version 
2.3.4 (June 8th) and had a transparent Eterm already running, 
then it will keep its scrollbar. 
It is unable to update its background image, though, so moving the Eterm
around doesn't change its appearence.

If I remember correctly, Eterm fully worked on May.

I though it might be a good idea not to remove all the ifdefs
in the code for the configure options we won't allow in the future.
How can I tell autoconf to enable the macros unconditionally?

It *is* fixed. You don't get that extra space if you don't compile with
MINI_ICONS. This is what the bug report was about. However, when I take
remove the possibility to not compile with mini icons #266 will become
a very real bug. However, I won't do anything to solve this in the near
future (I haven't got the time for such minor but hard to fix bugs). I'd
welcome a patch.

	Brad, this should fix your broken StartsOnPage options. I had gotten a
little over-enthusiastic in making sure that windows didn't switch pages
on a Restart/Recapture.

	The other part of this change fixes the page migration on the first
Recapture following a Restart done from a non-0,0 page. For now, it does
so by doing a MoveViewport back to page 0,0 when restarting - once the
new instance of FVWM starts up, the viewport is then switched back to
the proper place.

	I'm not totally satisfied with this solution, but I haven't been able
to work out the other approach (changing the startup logic to adjust for
the discrepancy), and I was even less satisfied with those peripatetic
windows.

	If anyone finds the switch back to 0,0 during Restart annoying, please
let me know.


- Bob

OK, 20k of code ... that's less than 10% of the (stripped) size of my
linux fvwm2.  Not a big deal in terms of disk.

I wonder if there is any impact on the *in-core* size of a running FVWM if
the options are disabled?  That's the only concern I have about removing
compile-time options.  I don't know the ins and outs of all the options in
question, but part of FVWM's heritage was that it is -- or can be compiled
to be -- cheaper on memory than other WMs.  I'd hate to lose that.

Comment out the AC_ARG_ENABLE commands and the corresponding setting
of the relevant shell variables, retain the AC_SUBST and give a
meaningful value to the relevant variable, something like:

SHAPES=yes
AC_SUBST(SHAPES)

Haven't checked precisely on the code, but if they are simple
substitutions, this should work.

Hi!

Under the latest CVS (June 9th), in a number of programs, 
menus (application menus, NOT fvwm menus) display an
annoying behaviour.

As an example, netscape:

1. fire up netscape
2. move the window to some arbitrary position.
4. Click on a menu button.

Effect: the menu will appear at a position that corresponds the initial 
        position, as if the window hadn't been moved.

I provide a list of some programs that show the effect and some programs 
that don't, because the bug might be depending on the X toolkit the apps
use.
Sorry, I didn't have the time yet to check the CVS for June 4th - June
8th, but I know for sure this bug wasn't present before June 4th.

broken:
 Acroread
 addressbook (tcl/tk ?)
 Amaya (html-editor)
 control-panel tools
 exmh (mailer)
 FileRunner (tcl/tk)
 ghostview
 ical (calendar)
 impress (tcl/tk)
 jazz (MIDI sequencer)
 Nedit
 Netscape (4.51 / 3.04)
 rosegarden (MIDI editor)
 SoundStudio (tcl/tk?)
 slab (StudioLab, hard disk recorder, tcl/tk)
 xfig
 X-files
 xconfig (tcl/tk)
 XPaint
 xwave


ok:
 (probably) All Gnome Applications
 (probably) All KDE/Qt Applications
 Applixware
 Eterm (after using CTRL + mouseclick ;)  )
 emacs (of course)
 GIMP (well, GTK)
 licq (qt toolkit?)
 mtv
 StarOffice (does its own thing anyway ;) )
 tgif
 XMan
 xmovie
 xpdf

System settings:
RH Linux 5.2, Kernel 2.2.9
X Server: XFree86 3.3.3.1-1
gnome 1.0
libc 2.0
make-3.76.1-2
automake-1.4-1
Color Depth: 24/32 bit


thanx and happy hacking,
Amir

I do find it annoying, but I can live with it. I rarely restart from
a page different from 0 0. Don't spend time on this unless many people
start complaining.

I can confirm this on my system. Since the only broken application I use
is Netscape I didn't get suspicios. I thought Netscape was freaking out
again (as usual). The bug has been around for about a week now. There
are two possible candidates that may (or may not) have caused it:

 - the strokes patch (?)
 - A patch to events.c by Matthias (I don't understand it myself.
   Matthias, what d you say?)

        * fvwm/events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): send the synthetic
        ConfigureNotify here whenever the client may not receive a real
        ConfigureNotify on its toplevel window (as the ICCCM demands).
        As a hack to support buggy tk, duplicate the ConfigureNotify on
        the frame window.

Any ideas? Has window placement changed recently?

If we want to save memory there is only one place where it really has
a noticable impact: function and menu items. Since 2.2.0 the memory
consumption of function items has been reduced radically at the cost
of some additional code by separating the functions code from the menu
code. Functions use up 13 bytes per item + the length of the action
(assuming int = 4 bytes, short = 2 bytes, char = 1 byte, pointer = 4 bytes)
plus 20 bytes for the function structure (+ name of the function). I can't
see any potential to save more than perhaps one byte per item here.

Menu items on the other hand use up 64 bytes each (+ memory for labels and
mini icons and the action). Not using mini icons would save 13 bytes and
using two instead of three labels another 8 bytes. There might be a potential
of 4 to 10 bytes at the cost of drawing speed (some members like 'prev'
or 'label_strlen' are there only for performance reasons).

There is lots of stuff in the FvwmWindow structure too, but optimizing it
will be a painfull process.

This might also explain the problems with tranparent Eterms (I think
they might not be getting a ConfigureNotify when they are mapped).

Wow Dominik, you are a much braver man than I, doing restart from non
0,0.  Thats all I need for something to go wrong and then spend the next
hout putting all my windows back in the proper place.  So as you may
have gest the change doesn't bother me any.

Actually, the AC_ARG_ENABLEs in question are wrapped up in a fancy
"smr_SWITCH" macro, in an attempt to deal with the pre-autoconf mess. 
There were a dozen or so of these defines, some which were on by default,
some which were off; some of the symbols enabled a behaviour
(FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS) and some that *inhibited* a behaviour (MODALITY_IS_EVIL
-- i.e. disable modal dialogs).  See acinclude.m4 for full details.


The answer to Domink's question is:

1. comment out the corresponding "smr_SWITCH" line in configure.in, by
   putting "dnl " in front of it
2. find the `#undef SYMBOL' line in `acconfig.h', and set to the value
   desired -- either leave it undefined, or change to #define SYMBOL 1

I expect that you are right.  I have not checked the code nor compiled
with options off to see if the RSS is any smaller.

Maybe this question can be answered by the old-timers.  In acconfig.h
there are comments before each option symbol.  These comments came from
the Imakefile of 2.0.47, so perhaps they are no longer relevant.  But
several of them say "disabling this saves some memory."  Are any of these
comments still relevant?  If so, about how much memory are we talking
about? 



SHAPE:
 * Shaped window extensions seem to increase the window managers RSS
 * by about 60 Kbytes. They provide for leaving a title-bar on the window


ACTIVEDOWN_BTNS:
 * "ActiveUp" state is used instead.  Disabling this reduces memory
 * usage.  */


INACTIVE_BTNS:
 * is used instead.  Disabling this reduces memory usage.  */


USEDECOR:
 * the man page entries for AddToDecor and DestroyDecor.  There is a
 * slight memory penalty for each additionally defined decor.  */

Don't know. I'd leave this one in *and* make a command to disable it.

Saves less that 30 bytes (two names).

Saves less that 50 bytes (two names and three lines of code).

BTW, the _BTNS defines change the way the buttons behave. Perhaps this
should be made configurable (if anybody uses it).

I guess it saves a few k of code, several dozen bytes in the global
default decor and two pointers in the FvwmWindow structure.

Subject: FvwmPager: problem moving window to current desktop

Full_Name: Paul Slagle
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: Sun X11
Submission from: (NULL) (138.12.4.25)


In FvwmPager, move a window from one desktop to the current desktop (out of
the
pager).
While dragging, the outline of the window is not visible in the current
desktop.
At completion of the move, the window itself is not visible.
Bring focus back to the window via WinList, and the location of the window
is +0+0 on
the current desktop.
 
Seems to work fine if moving within the same desktop (using Pager).
Also works fine moving within Pager (i.e., move from one desktop to
another
staying within FvwmPager.  Works to current desktop, too).

Version of FvwmPager is one distributed w/2.2.2.

This bug also seems to affect the latest version of rxvt in the same manner
if thats of any help to anyone.

	This is the culprit. I just reinstated the code in borders.c
(SetupFrame) and the problem went away. I thought I'd wait and see if
Matthias has any further comments or insights on this before committing
the change.

Another candidate for Xdnd support would be FvwmPager. And IconMan and
IconList. Actually, Pager support for Xdnd would be really neat. You
could D&D (anyone thinking of the game from TSR? :) to any window you
have open, anywhere. Kinda useful, perhaps?

Yep :) That's why I spelled it in lower case. Reminds me too much of this
strange role playing game. I prefer my own rules.

Nice idea.

Hmm.  What you're talking about here isn't really D&D support per se,
but some kind of D&D "redirection" where the Pager would forward D&D
protocol requests to the window you dropped on.

That could be cool, I suppose, but we'd have to check the protocol to
see how possible it is :).

Yeah, I spotted XdndProxy, which seems to be exactly the thing for all
the potential applications that I've seen mentioned so far, for Xdnd
support in FVWM (well, at least its modules).

Looks like the AfterStep Wharf supports Xdnd too. This is from the
Wharf docs at http://www.afterstep.org/man/stable/Wharf.html:

  Wharf supports the OffiX Drag and Drop standard. The following is
  an example of a DropExec line: 

  *Wharf trash Recyler.xpm DropExec "" rm %s
  *Wharf trash - Restart "" afterstep

  The button will restart AfterStep when pushed. If a file is dragged onto
  into it, rm will be called with %s being replaced by the dropped filename. 


I'm sure it would be beneficial to glance at the AfterStep code, seeing
as AfterStep orignally span off from fvwm.

Hey folks

I was looking at the AfterStep web page, and one feature they have
is transparent backgrounds for titlebars, borders and menus. There's
a screenshot at:

http://www.afterstep.org/screenshots/webmaster@afterstep.org/Translunacy-big.jpg

Looks quite cool.

Another thing I was looking at was Enlightenment, which allows several
effects when moving windows. The usual rubberband and opaque styles,
but also a transparent move effect, where the window in motion becomes
transparent during the move. That's the entire window and its
decorations. This is quite a resource hog, but it set me to thinking
how cool it would look if it was available as a style. One could
even have all windows except the currently focussed one be transparent.

OK, enough afternoon daydreaming, back to work.

Cheers
Ric

That one is a gross hack. Raster achived that by copying the whole
screen into a new buffer, infront of all other windows and poking around
with raw graphics there.

It's not too bad a resource hog.. it works just fine on the SPARCstation
LX's over here (about a 486/33 or so if you compare). Opening menus in E
has an annoying latency though..

FvwmWharf module in the curren fvwm2 already has D&D skeleton in there already,
though, I think it is disable. Maybe someone can look into enabling it by a
configure option. It seems that the parsing, and button setup code is in there
already. Not sure why the author did enable it before? Just search for
ENABLE_DND. btw, it does seem to be an old version of Offix XDND protocol,
though.

On a side note, there was some sort of synchronization between Afterstep wharf
and our wharf. Why did it stop?

Hmm.  Well, I guess I can see usefulness in having FvwmButtons, for
example, support D&D directly.  Maybe you want to program a button that
does one thing if you drop a file on it, another thing if you drop
some random text on it, and yet another thing if you drop a GIF on it.
Or something like that :).

I've spent about 4 minutes thinking about this so maybe there's a
better way to do this (maybe have a button that just invokes a
general-purpose "drop handling tool", then just have FvwmButtons
redirect D&D requests to that?)

Yeah, I'd use transparent decorations with transparent rxvts.

I would definitely describe it as useable on my P200, though it was
noticably slower than opaque or rubber-band moves. I found that menu
latency depended quite a bit on the theme being used.

Typically the attitude of the FVWM-workers when presented with _serious_
eye candy is, "if you want E you know where to get it!" :)  That's not
to say that individual bits of candy won't be considered.

Although it's not written down anywhere, the vision for FVWM focuses on
(a) high configurability and (b) smaller size / good speed.  We add fun
features which still allow us to sleep at night, given those goals :).

However, IIRC the "transparent window move" thing came up on the list
last fall and was soundly rejected when it became apparent what was
involved, and how powerful a system you had to have to make it useful.

Transparent title bars haven't been discussed, I don't think.

With white text over yellow backgrounds as shown in the example?

Its hard enough to come up with the 3 or 4 contrasting colors needed
in menus now.  (Ignoring gradients and pixmaps.)

IMHO, the screen shot is well named, "lunacy".

Oh, I agree. Just batting about a few ideas.

Yup, if it involves ridiculous hacks.

Might be straightforward. There's transpant background code in FvwmButtons
already.

The creator of that example is quite obviously either colourblind

everything, including the root window.

I tend toward dark backgrounds,  but if its  an image, its got to have
some lighter colors somewhere.

Even still, you need 3 or 4 contrasting colors in a menu.  The example
menu is black and white, but no item in the menu is selected or grayed
out.  It still looks nuts to me.

My  background changes every hour under  cron  control, with about 500
images in use.

Having cron   alter  my menus  on  an  hourly basis  to   go with  the
backgrounds ... AARGH!

I recently mined AfterStep for its Icon Animation.

Since I try to never touch rodents, I'm not the one for this DND stuff.

All it takes is someone with the interest...

I think the accent is on *Trans*lunacy. All rainbow colors are in the
background image, how funny. Actually, "smoked glass" fixes most of the
problems here.

There are many nice tiles/images (1/3 of all supplied with Eterm, for
example), which do not include light colors. White or pastel foregrounds
are ok on them.

I agree with you. Consider also menu-icons with transparent backgrounds..
It is hard to choose a background color to satisfy all foreground colors.
Thinking about this, it is good to have relative fore-colors (XOR-ed?)
and then changing a background color can automatically update all
foreground colors. Menu-icons are still a problem (XPM only supports  
absolute colors and an icon was not designed to change them anyway).

Nice idea. The hardest part here is 500 nice images. Are they tiles or
large images? Hmm, if one image is 100Kb, 500 are 50Mb. Managing this is
not easy, I suppose. :)

I think they'd be useful only if they are really transparent.  The
eterm-like pseudo-transparency only shows you manipulated bits of the
background which doesn't give you any additional real estate.  If you
actually get some screen space back then it might be worthwhile.

I didn't think so.  It looks pretty washed out to me.  But these are
opinions, I'm sure it in the eye of the beholder.

Tiles I believe.  Last time I had to use CDE, I was impressed with its
tiles.  If I remember right, they get  an amazing variety with 2 color
dithered tiles.  Looking thru my copy of Eterm backgrounds, (it may be
old), only BladeRunner  seems to be uniformly dark.   So dark, I can't
see the image.

I'm not following the XOR-ed part.  XOR on pseudocolor displays produce
random colors.

All images.  Most of them large.  Only 2 are tiled onto the background,
most are streched at display time to fill the screen.

Current total size is 60MB.

I  find managing it interesting.   The images serve as backgrounds and
xscreensaver hacks.   I also  have  some perl  that builds fvwm2 menus
from the "database" for manually setting the  root, or just displaying
individual images.  About 20 of us run  the same cron script, every so
often I get a call from one of the 20 saying  how much they appreciate
the show.

Checking file system dates, it looks like its taken 5  years to get to
500 images.  Thats only 10 a month (in round numbers).  I find APOD to
be one of my favorite sources.

With enough  interest, I could  be bribed to share  the scripts.  They
are not terribly complex, but they did take some time to work out.

I thought it might be nice to allow menus to be hotkey-able
automagically. So I wrote a little patch that does this. It's now a
MenuStyle option called AutomaticHotkey/AutomaticHotkeyOff. Naturally
it defaults to being off... It's a pretty trivial patch which seems to
work fine. Here's the Changelog entry:

1999-06-10  Michael Han  <mikehan@best.com>

        * fvwm/menus.c (AddToMenu, GetMenuStyleIndex, NewMenuStyle):
        added AutomaticHotkey handling
        * fvwm/menus.h: Added a "feel" flag for automatic_hotkey and
        macros to handle the flag
        * fvwm/fvwm2.1: documentation for AutomaticHotkey MenuStyle

And it's very useful and is almost no size penalty (172 bytes extra in
the executable but 97 bytes saved from my .fvwm2rc).  I vote for
adoption.

Well, we have different definitions of cool then ;-).  Another point is
that I've never seen a transparent terminal emulator, they all seem to
be hacks that copy the root pixmap into their background (which means
they should use the same visual as the root, rxvt doesn't and fails
dismally).  Real transparency is what you have with shaped icons and
oclock and can be useful.  Fake transparency falls over as soon as you
move a pseudo-transparent window over a normal window, I don't think
you'll find many screenshots with this situation, it looks too bad.

As Jason said: real transparency could be useful for the window
decorations. It would require the shape extension, we could even do
shading/tinting by stippling the shape mask before drawing the title
text and gadgets into it. If this is going to happen I'd rather see it
in a module.

It is just an effect, it's not the real window that you're moving.  For
me this makes translucent moves the same as rubberband moves i.e the
server is grabbed (your mpeg playback is halted) and you can't see what
the desktop will look like when you complete the move. The only
advantage of rubberband moves is that it's light weight and if you abort
nothing has to be redrawn. Real opaque moves have the advantage of not
stopping any other graphics activity and you can see exactly what the
result will be (very useful if you're moving a window underneath
another).  I think it's bloat and it's in the right place already (i.e.
in E and not fvwm).

Cheers,
Tim.

PS anyone know why Eterm can't just copy the root pixmap? It needs
_XROOTPMAP_ID which means I have to use the brain dead Esetroot.  If it
has to be told why doesn't it use _XSETROOT_ID like every other root
painting program does?

No. MakeMenu (now called make_menu) calculates the size of the menu and
manages the menu continuations. paint_menu() is the function that does
it.

BTW, Tim, how does your gradient code work now. Is the a single function
that creates a pixmap of a given size with a gradient in it? If yes,
could you modify the code so that creating the pixmap is in a different
function than the drawing itself? This way we could simply call the 
drawing functions, provide a drawable (i.e. a pixmap *or a window*)
and draw into it. This might come handy for the menu code when you
don't want to spend large amounts of memory on the pixmaps.

The drawing parts assume the drawble is of a certain size (dependent
upon the number of colors in the gradient and the gradient type). 
Making it draw in arbitrary sizes would mean factoring in the width and
height.  It wouldn't be too difficult as all the gradients are drawn in
loops like:

    case 'D':
      for (i = 0; i < width; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < height; j++)
          XPutPixel(image, i, j, pixels[i + j]);
      }
      break;

You would just have to change this to

    case 'D':
      for (i = 0; i < width; i++) {
        x = i * (ncolors + 1) / 2 / width;
        for (j = 0; j < height; j++)
        y = j * (ncolors + 1 - ((ncolors - 1) / 2)) / height;
          XPutPixel(image, i, j, pixels[i + j]);
      }
      break;

My opinion on this is that if memory is tight don't use pixmaps at all
or just stick to HGradient/VGradient.  I think that simplifying the menu
code to always use a background pixmap would be better.

Cheers,
Tim.

Duh, do you mean that I'll get a 1000x1000 pixmap when I use 1000 colours?

You underestimate the amout of memory these pixmaps use for menus. Since
you can't reuse the gradient pixmaps (thy all have different sizes) you'll
get one pixmap for each menu. If you have 50 menus (and some Linux distibs
make massive use of menus) this will use massive amounts of memory thus
rendering any gradients but v/h useless in many cases.

I was trying to create some screen shots for our web page. I tried
xwd and xgrab, but both screw up my colourmap, i.e. when I view
the screenshots with xv, certains colours are not correct (e.g.
the blue gradient of icons/side.fvwm2.xpm is red when I view it).

I use a true colour (32 bit) visual with 1152x864 pixels. Any ideas
what I can do about it?

xv has a tendency to not play nice with xwd's.  You can either have xv
do the screen grab for you (it not obvious but if you do a hidewindows
and set delay for a few seconds you can move over the root window and it
will grab your screen.  Your second choice is to try pulling the xwd up
in gimp, you can do the grabs with gimp but it uses xwd to make the grab
anyway.

I think I've been around long enough to fit the old-timer category,
but I don't remember any numbers.  My guess is if there were numbers,
they would have been mentioned.

I think the ifdefs are part of a general desire to stay true to the
fvwm design objectives, and the feature of "patch" that makes it so
easy to generate the ifdefs.

Perhaps not enough thought was given to the actual savings, and the
long term impact on code readability.

I think  selective  removal  would be  OK,   especially for   the more
pervasive ifdefs like mini-icons.

Duh, yes, you asked for 1000 colors, what's the point of returning a
10x10 pixmap with only 10% of the colors you asked for?  What you do
with this pixmap is CreateStrectchPixmap(window width, height) and use
the stretched (or shrunk pixmap) as the background of the window. The
end result is that the server has a pixmap the same size as the target
window.  If the size of the intermediate pixmap bothers you just use
fewer colors.

I guestimate that 50 menus ona 24 bit display will use 4 Mbytes 8-). The
size of the pixmap for each will be at most the size of the menu, much
less for V & H and zero for plain colors.  How much memory your menus
use will depend on the total area of the menus. If you're desparate we
could set the menus to have a CWBackingStore of NotUseful which might
save the same amount of memory for the server.

Cheers,
Tim.

	Oh, *please* let's not render the diagonal gradients unusable. They're
the only kind I use in my menus.

No, I'm fighting hard to have them work no worse than at present :)
I have been experimenting with the gradients in the past few weeks.
V/H gradients are usable too if you use colours that are close to
each other. When I have completed my screen shots I can show you
what I mean.

Doe the code use just the first letter of the item or does it try to find
meaningful hotkeysr? E.g. if you have twenty entries beginning with
'fvwm ', do they all get the 'f' as the hotkey?

Unfortunately, it's the former. A simple-minded hotkey the first
letter approach (MI_LABEL(tmp)[0]). I figured a "smart" approach would
be way too difficult to do well, and would probably lead to
unnecessary bloat... Still, I think that it could be a useful
timesaver when writing .fvwm2rc from scratch, since if you enable
Menustyle * AutomaticHotkey
you get first letter hotkeys for free, and need only worry yourself
with exceptions.

Hm, can I override the automatic hotkeys with my own?

MI_LABEL(tmp)[0] returns the first label, not the first letter of the
first label (use MI_LABEL(tmo)[0][0]). Do you check if MI_LABEL(tmp)[0]
is NULL first?

	I think that using the first character of each menu item is the
best way to go... So long that 1: If one has > 1 menu entries hotkeyed to
a letter, then pressing the hotkey multiple times will step through each
item and 2: Explicit hotkey assignments could over-ride implicit
(automatic) hotkey assignments.

Hi,
I am trying to use MoveToPage to move an off-screen window to the current
page.
Specifically, I am using the following function..
-------
# What this function does is, given a key mapping to this function, it
will
# raise the specified window ($0) eg xcb and if the window doesnot exist,
it
# will create it. Note that it execs the $1 argument and not $0.

AddToFunc "my_window_open_func" \
+ "I"  Next ($0) Iconify -1
+ "I"  Next ($0) Focus
+ "I"  Next ($0) MoveToPage
+ "I"  Next ($0) WarpToWindow 30 40
+ "I"  None ($0) Exec $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
-------

Specifying arguments such as MoveToPage 1 0 works , but if I don't specify

any arguments to MoveToPage, it doesn't move the window.
As per the man pages, MoveToPage should move the selected window to the
current page.

Thanks,
Chetan

So does this mean that applications really expect to see ConfigureNotifys
even if they haven't sent a ConfigureRequest ? This is incredibly broken,
if you ask me. If they need to track their absolute position (to pop up
override-redirect menus, eg), they should query their geometry and use
TranslateCoordinates...

Aiee! I knew there was something confusing me about that... it's that
the label is a list of labels in each column! I *do* check for the
presence of MI_LABEL before trying to play any games. Strangely, my
code works correctly... Anyway, I'll go back and fold in proper
handling of label columns, including the case where the left-most
column MI_LABEL(tmp)[0] == NULL but some other label isn't.

Well if that weren't the case, I'd be one rude boy!

I tried doing this yonks ago on a text menuing system, it sucks unless
the smartness is at least as good as a human (highly unlikely from my
code).  If you just pick unique letters as the items come in you quickly
get hot keys that look just like random choices e.g.:

Bilbo
Baggins
Aragorn

gives hot keys of B, a & r. A better choice would be B, g & A but you
can't choose this without knowing all the menu items first.  For fvwm
this would mean recalculating the hotkeys every time the menu is popped
and the contents have changed.  If someone has a menu e.g. that is a
list of recently edited files they will find the hotkeys will jump
around as the history builds up.  If that's not enough a smart system
should pick consonants from the start of syllables that form the
emphasized parts of words e.g: if e is not available "elephant" should
have p rather than l and definitely not h.

I would stick to the first letter, it's predictable and fvwm handles
having the same hot key twice in one menu nicely.

Cheers,
Tim.

If you run without a window manager and move a window the client gets a
configure notify event from the server.  With window managers the
windows are reparented into the border and they never move (relative to
their parent) so the server never sends configure notify's.  That's why
the window manager has to send these synthetic ones. Polling their
geometry every time a menu is popped up is not the way to go.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS clients don't send configure requests either, they do an
XMoveWindow() and the server translates this into a configure request
because the window manager has set a subspace-redirect attrubute
somewhere. The window manager does some computing and moves the parent
window of the client.

But if you run without a window manager, windows will normally not be moved
unless they send the ConfigureRequest all by themself...

Hmm... I've had to throw in a quick 'int j;' in my AddToMenu change,
in order to be able to walk a for loop from j=0;j<MAX_ITEM_LABELS;j++
to acount for the possibility of a menu labeled like "^I^IRight-side
text", where I want to give the hotkey to "R". Any objections here?
I'll just take some time to look over my new diff to make sure it's
sane and that I didn't do any other silly things.

Clients move themselves with XMoveWindow(), well maybe that's unusual
but lots of them resize themselves and the mechanism is the same. With a
window manager running the client isn't guaranteed to get what it wants
so it can't pop up menus where it think they should be, it can use the
configure notifys to track where it is and then it doesn't matter wetehr
a window manager is running or not or wether the clients moved the
window or something else did.

Cheers,
Tim.

OK, right. We should send ConfigureNotifys then. But I still think that
the stuff with the sendEvent parameter of SetupFrame is messy. Its only use
is to force sending a ConfigureNotify even if no resizing or moving happened.
The only case where this might be necessary should be in response to a 
ConfigureRequest, where it is handled independently now.

No objections. I will proof read the patch anyway when I apply it.

Shouldn't the mouse pointer be a clock or watch during the startup
or restart processing?

I think there is one case missing: when a client creates it's window the
first time it won't get put where the client created it because the
window manager will have moved it to make room for the decorations. A
configure request won't go to fvwm because it got a subststructure
notify instead.  In add_window.c there is a call to SetupFrame() with
the send event flags set to true.  I think sending a configure notify at
this point would fix this bug and Eterms transparency problems.

Actually there are lots of places that SetupFrame is called with send
event forced.  May be some of them are uneccessary but removing the send
events from SetupFrame may cause bugs that we haven't tested noticed
yet.

Cheers,
Tim.

Okay, here's my second try at an automatic hotkeys patch for fvwm.
This compiles and works for me. I've added proper handling for columns
since I forgot that the menu label is a list of labels, in one of
three columns. Again, here's the Changelog entry:

1999-06-10  Michael Han  <mikehan@best.com>

        * fvwm/menus.c (AddToMenu, GetMenuStyleIndex, NewMenuStyle):
        added AutomaticHotkey handling
        * fvwm/menus.h: Added a "feel" flag for automatic_hotkey and
        macros to handle the flag
        * fvwm/fvwm2.1: documentation for AutomaticHotkey MenuStyle

And the patch is an attached diff -u.

I had a go at FvwmForm and failed by getting lost in the lists of
dt_types or something. My idea was that initially the color and font was
inherited from fvwm and as soon as you specified a different color it
created a new dt_type.  I was going to put in a new command
*FvwmFormDefaultColorAndFont so that you could have an explicitly
colored bit of text/button/input and then have an inherited part later
on.

There are also big problems with the pager/winlst type of modules. I
think it's time to decide if this stuff is worth it or to junk it.  To
carry on I think we need to implement sets of color/font rather than
just have one.  I don't know what to call these things, I'm not keen on
calling them themes since that name seems to mean more than just the
look.  CDE calls them colorsets which is OK but theses things include a
font as well. Any suggestions?

Yeah, it's only a part solution at the moment.  Having fvwm send the
DefaultGraphics to modules is not right, the first half (the visual to
use) is invariant, the XORGC is not very useful and I don't think just
sending the XFontID is enough if we are going to do the I18N thing
(which I don't understand and can't test).

I don't think we have to bloat fvwm with this. I'm thinking that fvwm
would send out the visual information only and a module could manage the
sets of colors and background pixmaps.  You could even have a variant
that links with Imlib to give you gnome theme support, or CDE or KDE
perhaps.

This is too big a task for just me, help!

Cheers,
Tim.

FvwmGtk does this already (imlib and gnome theme support, i mean).

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Here is a patch that restores removed _XA_WM_DESKTOP code (all code, not
only with Scr.Root; I think it is needed to be really compatible with 2.2
and prior versions) and other clean-ups on Restart logic.

The result is that fvwm now determines it has been restarted. This means
Restart to 2.2 version or itself (via xterm or other window manager) works
as expected (no InitFunction).

Bob, Matthias, what do you think about this?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Shaped windows can give squashed titlebar look that saves real screen
real-estate as the titlebar is smaller than it otherwise would be.  I
think twm was the first to have the option.  Looks something like:

|-------------|
| Title here  |       EXTRA BACKGROUND VISIBLE (via X, not hacks)
-------------------------------------------------
| window contents here                          |
. . . . .

I have a question about ImagePath or IconPath or PixmapPath.

If I have two of more dirs defined to look in but have two or more
pixmaps with the same name will fvwm just take the first one it finds
with that name via the first path defined or will it just wig out and
start picking them at random?

Also is there a way to add/remove dirs from the path without having to
define a 'base' dir every time?

Also I've just restarted after a new cvs compile and it looks like shape
extentions didn't work properly.  I've looked through the changelog and
I didn't see anything that would have fit this so I have to assume it's
a bug or something.  All my icons have backgrounds and look as if they
are in a box and have window shading and hilights.  I've check my
configure logs and shape says yes.  I haven't changed anything in the
way of libs since 2.3.4 a few days ago when all was fine.  I this is a
new feature like icon backs or something is there configuration with it
as well?

The cvs grab is only about 2 hours old.

Yeah, its got lists of lists of lists of lists.  (At least that many).

I'm not sure you would   need a command,  the  first color or font  it
detects sets the overall default.  If no color or font command is ever
sent, it uses the defaults in  FvwmForm.h.  I think its those defaults
you'd want to mess with.

I think you'd want to  set "screen_background_color" without  changing
"bg_state" to do the  background.  The other things  you'd want to hit
are the "font_names" and "color_names" in the same file.

(Actually, I'm  under the impression you  don't actually send names of
things, but thats a detail.)

But the issue at hand is it needs at least 4 colors and 3 fonts.

I'm not not   an expert on  CDE  but I think  CDE can   make this work
because they restrict so many things.  Because we are so configurable,
its a non-trivial problem.

I think we need lists:

Title fonts
input fonts
text fonts

button colors (fg/bg)
text colors (fg/bg)

Still things like the pager are special cases.  Each desk should be its
own color so you end up with

desk 1 background
desk 2 background

I don't know, I think it requires some more thought.

Hi,

I haven't given up, and I'd like to thank all of you for your suggestions
and comments.  I have recompiled version 2.2.2 of fvwm and have chose to
build in rplay version 3.2.0b6.  I am using the following command, as per
the man pages

*FvwmEventCmd builtin-rplay

only this time it is not FvwmEvent which core dumps, but FvwmTaskBar.  The
output of running gdb over the core follows.

I'm planning on trying to decipher the code this weekend, but I thought I
might ask if anyone out there who probably knows a lot more about this
software than I do would like to help me out?  


The second option I tried was to use another sound player than the
builtin-rplay.  Segments of the fvwm2rc follow

*FvwmEventCmd myplay
*FvwmEventDelay 5
*FvwmEvent startup              matra.wav
*FvwmEvent shutdown             Shutdown.wav

...

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec /usr/bin/play /usr/share/sound/$0

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec xpmroot /home/tom/AnotherLevel/XPMs/moorish2.xpm 
#+ "I" Exec xsetroot -solid BG_COLOR
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent 

and 

/usr/bin/play /usr/share/sound/matra.wav 

does play when executed from a shell.

So, again I've run gdb over the core

This time however I've looked at the file FvwmEvent.c and can only find
one instance of strcasecmp and that is

#ifdef HAVE_RPLAY
    /*
     * Builtin rplay support is enabled when FvwmAudioPlayCmd ==
builtin-rplay.
     */
    if (strcasecmp(cmd_line, "builtin-rplay") == 0)
	if ((rplay_fd = rplay_open(host)) < 0)
	{
	    rplay_perror("rplay_open");
	    exit(1);
	}
#endif

So what gives???

Thanks Much in advance,

Tom

If you have a recent fvwm that supports ImagePath, then just use it and
forget about Icon/PixmapPath.

It should pick the first found.

You can easily add dirs (to the end or beginning of the path).  A '+'
token is expanded to the previous path, so you can say

	ImagePath   first/dir:+:/last/dir

for example.  There is no way to remove dirs.

If you find the manpage confusing on this issue, clarifying suggestions

Yeah I knew about just using ImagePath rather then Icon and Pixmap path just
wanted to see if there was different options for them or something.  Well
thanks that is very helpfull.  Well then is it possible to do something like
PATH=/dir/somewhere, ImagePath $PATH:/newpath/, and then change it with
ImagePath $PATH:/othernewpath.  Basicly is there a way to store varibles
somewhere in .fvwm2rc?  If not I think this would be a very usful feature,
esp. for themes setup and the like.  Or even perhaps a PipeRead might work.
+ I PipeRead cat somefile | echo ImagePath +:/NewPath or something, I know
that won't work like that, what kind of syntax would work here if at all?

I've never done anything remotely so complicated, but it seems to me that
"PipeRead set-image-path", where `set-image-path' is a script that spits
out "ImagePath ..." is the way to go.

Hi,

when trying fvwm2.3.3, I ran into the following annoying behavior:

I have no binding for M-tab (<alt>+<tab>) because I need
that key combination for some applications. In 2.3.3 however,
when I hit that key combination, the window list pops up (more
specifically: the window list for the current desk, regardless
of the mouse position always at the same location at the left
edge of the screen). 

Furthermore, when scrolling through the window list with the
cursor keys, most entries are skipped without any obvious system.

Regards,
            Peter

I see the same effect. 
The transparency/shape-function for icons is broken completely.
This change was documented (CVS Hippo), although as an enhancement ;)

But not only, e.g. for 

# xdaliclock -transparent

the background area (starting black) is not updated, so if you move 
a window over the clock you can see parts of that window as 
"background" for xdaliclock. 
I should mention that I use Esetroot.

In fact, client supplied icon bitmaps are (still - I never had a 
problem with that) drawn correctly. 

Amir

Hi,

wasn't fvwm originally based on twm? What happened to this feature?
This really is more than just eye candy. When you have lots of
overlapping windows it makes it _much_ easier to get to a specific
window with one click. I personally had been hesitating for a pretty
long time before I switched from twm to fvwm, mostly because fvwm
didn't have shaped titlebars.

Regards,
                Peter

Why not just go ahead and put them on ftp.fvwm.org in /pub/incoming/fvwm so
I can look at them when I have the time?

Could you describe how these spec files differ from what RedHat uses to
make their packages?  (I admit to never having seen RedHat's files since I
generally do things the old fashioned way.)

Sorry you are  finding it annoying, I felt  that most users would find
it helpful.

In the 2.3.x series that   key combination is automatically bound   as
follows:

Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

I'm not sure hardwired is the right word. You must be thinking of some
other WM.  :-)  You can remove the binding with:

I've never seen it do this.  Maybe someone else has a comment...

Not really a question, just thought I'd point this out to whom ever is
responsible to make to change.

Under the my latest cvs compile the FvwmScript man page states that the
*FvwmScript-Path variable sets the load path. It didn't work for me so I
went to check the source in it states that it's looking for
*FvwmScriptPath.  Just thought the man page could use a quick update.

I've picked going the FvwmScript route.  As it's a joke to set this up
since I can store variables in the script from a cat grep of the
.fvwm2rc file which is basicly what I wanted to do from the start.  And
since I'm also doing a bunch of other things that require Func commands
upwards of 20 lines I figured I'd just move everything I wanted to
FvwmScript instead. 

However I do have more questions.  Say I was playing around with
FvwmConsole making decor changes and such.  Now I like the way it looks
but I can't remember half the stuff I put in there to make it look the
way it is and I've done the trial and error route so looking through the
buffer of what I've typed is of little help.  So is there away to have
fvwm2 do something like dump all the settings it has in memory to a
file?  Or even for a module such as FvwmScript to ask it what the
current settings are for say button 1?  I am assuming the frame work is
in place for a module to find out this info, just not sure if any of
them can do it, maybe FvwmEvent it seems pretty versatile

Is there some where other then the source that lists all the built in
functions and one might bind to FvwmEvent or the like?  I tried checking
through the source but there are lots of them and I am hardly a
programmer and it would probably take days.  I know the FvwmEvent man
page lists a bunch of them, but that can hardly be all of them that we
can use.  Or would it just be better to call a sound play even for
example when to do a function?

I don't like clocks since you can't see where the hot spot is, but
thats my only objection. It would be nice if you could see when all
the modules have started properly. I find myself opening menus before
the pager has been swallowed by FvwmButtons.

But I don't know how big the menus will be when I write a config file.
With small menus, 50 colours will be enough, but if they fill half of
the screen I need 500 colours for a very smooth look. And is there
anti-aliasing code in the CreateStrectchPixmap() function? If not
a 20x20 pixmap (using 20 colours) stretched to 200x700 (a typical
menu) will more look like tetris that a B/D gradient. And I don't
dare to imagine a stretched yin-yang gradient :-)

Ah, CreateStrectchPixmap() seems to tile the pixmap instead of strecting
it. That works only with V/H gradients.

Hi,

first of all: I really love the idea of having a transient pager!

Some proposals how the transient pager would be easier to handle:

- no desk switching on start 
Right now, the pager immediately switches to the uppermost
desktop with the mouse pointer in the upper left corner of pager. 
It would be nicer, if it would pop up on the current desk & page 
without any "automatic" switching and with the mouse positioned 
on the current page.

- stay open until the next mouse click 
if invoked by a mouse binding, the pager stays open only until
the mouse is released again (right now, if another button than
button 1 triggered the pager, it seems impossible to switch
the desk at all). It would be easier to handle, if the pager
would behave more like a menu: stay open until the next mouse
click; if the mouse event was outside of the window, just ignore
it.

Regards,
            Peter

Some fallback bindings would indeed be extremely helpful, but
only in 2 cases:

- there is no configuration available at all
- the configuration is not usable (very easy to get when you use
  M4: just forget a closing quote ...)

Wouldn't it be better to only use the default configuration in
these situations? (I'm not so sure what would be a good way to
detect these cases, though.)

It seems like this is a bug in the menu code: In all menus, the
up and down keys usually only toggle between the 1st and the 3rd
entry in the menu. Furthermore, it seems like whenever a horizontal
position for a menu is spezified, it shows up at the left edge
instead.

                Peter

Hmmm... this sounds like something that ought to be in NEWS -- it is a
user-visible change.  

I'd also suggest that the way to return to the old behaviour also ought to
be in NEWS.  Or in the FAQ with a pointer in the NEWS item.

Here's the fix: make your xterm one character wider, then look at the
manpage again.

It's the line-breaking that makes it read "*FvwmScript-
Path"!

Maybe it was added to *twm after fvwm spun off? Or perhaps Rob

I seem to remember this issue being discussed on the list quite a
long time ago, but I can't find it in the archives. Anyone remember
the conclusions last time?

There's a nice screenshot demostrating this feature in vtwm at

I agree, it should be in the  NEWS and the fvwm2 man  page.  In fact I
really thought I put it in both.  I'll get to it.

I don't know if my memory is any better than  yours, but I remember it
the same  way.  It was rejected  as bloat.  I certainly don't remember
who the rejector was.

As I remember, it was a request, not a patch.  (I think theres a big
difference.)

The bloat rejection I remember best was the requests that lead to the
creation of fvwm95.

I'm  not voting for or against  shaped  titlebars with these comments.
I'm sure  I wouldn't use them.  I  almost never stack windows,  and my
windows are almost always full screen height.  But I don't think I'm a
typical user.

Now don't I just feel the stupid fool.  It is an honest error since the
man page on the web page is also structured in this fashion.  I
apologize for my over site.

That's why we don't recommend to use alpha releases. This has long been 
fixed in CVS, but it slipped into 2.3.3 before I realised it.

I saw this on LinuxToday; I'll probably join but I won't really be able to
comment intelligently.  Does anyone else here have the time to follow this
list?

 The Window Manager Spec needs revision. We want to make it a
 desktop-neutral specification, used by KDE, XFCE, and anyone else who
 wants to use it. There's already been some movement in this direction;
 Miguel has spoken with Raster about it, and I believe KDE is in on it
 too. A common spec will improve interoperability (mix-and-match pagers,
 etc.) and ease the maintenance burden on window manager authors. Window
 managers could even use the spec to implement their native pagers.

 Anyway, if you know about window managers and hints, or you maintain a
 window manager, please subscribe to the mailing list:

 Mail wm-spec-list-request@gnome.org with 'subscribe' in the subject. 

 This list needs to have excellent signal-to-noise ratio so WM maintainers
 will stay on it; please, if you don't hack window managers, don't even
 subscribe. The list will be archived on www.gnome.org with the other
 lists. Let's hope these guys can reach a consensus and give us a nice spec
 to work with.

 It would be nice to get people from X.org or people who've worked on the
 Motif hints or other original X stuff involved here as well.

Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I just noticed that the Gnome people have started a new effort
to create better wm hints. They also seek to unify them with the
upcoming new KDE 2.0 hints. 


Mailing list: wm-spec-list@gnome.org 
Archive:      http://www.gnome.org/mailing-lists/archives/wm-spec-list/
Web page:     http://gnome.windsofstorm.net/wmhints/

They list as participants (or wanted participants) representants of
blackbox, icewm, enlightenment, scwm, windowmaker, kwm and mosquito (?).
No fvwm yet :-(

I think I'll subscribe to the list. Maybe others are interested too ?

Palettes and font lists (like in CDE)?

It will indeed be a big effort. But I think the gains may be worth it.
Wouldn't it be great if you could configure fonts and colours in a central
place and all modules would use them? I could imagine it like this:

In the main fvwm module there are commands to define a font list and
a palette, consisting of eight fonts/colours (actually this is exactly
what I have in my config file via FvwmCpp now).

  DefaultColour 1 black
  ...
  DefaultColour 8 green
  (colour 1 = default background, colour 2 = default foreground)

  DefaultFont xxxs 5x7
  DefaultFont xxs  6x9
  DefaultFont xs   lucidasanstypewriter-8
  DefaultFont s    lucidasanstypewriter-10
  DefaultFont m    lucidasanstypewriter-12
  DefaultFont l    lucidasanstypewriter-14
  DefaultFont xl   lucidasanstypewriter-18
  DefaultFont xxl  lucidasanstypewriter-24

In the module configuration you can use the colour names 'DefaultColour1-8'
and the font names 'DefaultFontXXXS-XXL' which are handled appropriately
by the lib. Each module has to have a certain common structure to hold this
information so that the lib can handle it. A great enhancement would be if
you could change the font list and palette at run-time and the modules
reconfigure themselves to display the changes. That would be a big step
ahead in themes support.

Hm, I don't think it can be done without an enhancement of the module
interface.

I'd love to, if it's not me who does the main work this time.

Dan, I just noticed you put an '#if 0' around a line in
GrabWindowButton() (libs/Bindings.c). Is there a particular
reason why you did this? If I remember correctly this line
should allow you to activate a binding even if you told fvwm
explicitly that one or more of the modifiers you used for
the bindings should be ignored. E.g. with

  IgnoreModifiers S
  Key F1 A S Beep

Nothing will happen with shift-F1 without that line, but
it will work with it. So, if you don't have such screwed
up bindings in you config file you won't notice any
difference.

Bye

Try replacing the function RemoveButton in ButtonArray.c (FvwmTaskBar)
with this version (I've checked in a bug fix for 2.3.4, but I think it
works with 2.2.2 too):

void RemoveButton(ButtonArray *array, int butnum)
{
  Button *temp, *temp2;

  if (butnum == 0) {
    temp2 = array->head;
  } else {
    temp = find_n(array, butnum-1);
    if (temp == NULL) return;
    temp2 = temp->next;
  }
  if (temp2 == NULL) return;
  temp->next = temp2->next;

  if (array->tail == temp2) array->tail = temp;

  ButtonDelete(temp2);
  array->count--;
  if (temp != array->head)
    temp = temp->next;
  for (; temp!=NULL; temp=temp->next)
    temp->needsupdate = 1;

  ArrangeButtonArray(array);
}

The reason is that when the last button in the internal list was deleted,
the code tried to access 'temp2->next' although temp2 might be NULL. I didn't
check that fix myself, so it would be nice if you could verify it.

That's is pretty cool.

I wonder what WM they're using?  The article says it looks like windows;
I wonder if it's fvwm95 or icewm--has to be something small to fit in
8.5M so I'd bet it's not KDE or Gnome :).

This is the Changelog that goes with it:

  * libs/Bindings.c (AddBinding): Only add one entry to the binding
  table when a key generates the exact same information with more than
  one modifier.

We were trying to solve performance problems on iconification.

I'm pretty sure I applied that patch at your suggestion.

I don't have IgnoreModifiers in my config file.

Dan, I just noticed you put an '#if 0' around a line in
GrabWindowButton() (libs/Bindings.c). Is there a particular
reason why you did this? If I remember correctly this line
should allow you to activate a binding even if you told fvwm
explicitly that one or more of the modifiers you used for
the bindings should be ignored. E.g. with

  IgnoreModifiers S
  Key F1 A S Beep

Nothing will happen with shift-F1 without that line, but
it will work with it. So, if you don't have such screwed
up bindings in you config file you won't notice any
difference.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

One of the questions I asked was;

If FVWM added GNOME compatability and Drag And Drop funtionality in the
near future, would RedHat consider putting the lighter FVWM back as the
default window manager instead of the one shipping in RedHat 6.0.

The answer was that they liked lighter, and that this would certainly make
it an option, and that they would be evaluating the window manager in
upcoming releases. He then qualified the answer with, "what the user really
wants, and needs, is a good graphical interface to manage and configure the
window manager", and this would play heavy on any future directions.


I thought you would waould want to consider this.

Randall

Yes, I remember that part, but I can't see what the commented line
has to do with it. It has no effect if you don't use bindings with
modifiers that you have deactivated with IgnoreModifiers.

> I'm pretty sure I applied that patch at your suggestion.
 
I can only imagine that we tried to remove this command to see if
it helps but forgot to activate it again. Can you verify that
you lose performance when you put it back?

> I don't have IgnoreModifiers in my config file.

Neither do I. It's so much better to solve it in the Xmodmap.

My fault, I had cleaned up the bit of code just before fvwm tests to see
if shapes are suported by the server and had left an `else' hanging.
This prevented fvwm from checking for shapes and so it draws icons (and
windows) as though they aren't shaped.

All fixed now.
Cheers,
Tim.

I think it's time to start working towards 2.4 soon. What are the pending
issues? Possible candidates are:

Enhancements:

 e1) Tear off menus (I can't promise that I'll have the time however).
 e2) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)
 e3) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).

Fixes:

 f1) Fix the pager bugs I reported today
 f2) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is
 ... (I have a list of more problems at home, I'll add them later).

Testing:

 t1) Run the purify script again (and update it).
 t2) Test the strokes patch.
 t3) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)
 
I wonder if we should put this to do list into CVS or in Jitterbug so that
we can track comments and further ideas. Comments?

Future issues:

 f1) User friendly configuration (e.g. with scripts, menus or FvwmForm?)
 f2) Palette and font list support for modules.
 f3) Investigate drag and drop support.
 f4) Tear off menus.
 f5) Shared library.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Quite frankly it wasn't a big deal for me too much.  One would have to
expect this sort of thing from using cvs version.  I actually was just
hoping if was the icon backs feature that I saw on the web site :). 
Grabbing a new version now.

I myself have been playing with a FvwmScript script file to do this very
thing.  However the largest problem I see with this is the wide variety
in how a config file can be setup, and there for making the script huge
with parsing routines to find them out.  Quite frankly I think fvwm1
with it's .fvwm structure would have been easier to modify in this
fashion.  If we could get people to install from scratch their .fvwm2rc
files and use the GUI config tool that is come up with I can't see much
trouble then in modifying them.  Only other thing that has to be done is
to make sure the modules decor functions all have the same type of name
and structure.

Just my humble views on this.

- Start a pager and an application with a long icon title (e.g. netscape)
- Iconify the app.
--> icon looks ok in pager
- move the icon.
--> icon in pager grows horizontally to the width of the expanded title
- deiconify the app.
--> sometimes the deiconified window is shown at the place where the icon
was
    in the pager, sometimes the icon window in the pager grows to the width
of
    the deiconified window.

If you move an icon on the desktop, the motion is not reflected in the
pager as it
is with normal windows.

While you move a window the pager does not reflect the effect of the
SnapGrid, i.e.
when you move the mouse and the window itself does not move due to the
SnapGrid, it
still moves a few pixels in the pager. When you end the move the window
jumps to
the correct position in the pager.

I have nearly screen filling window on page 0 1 of a 2x2 desk. when I move
it a few
pixels down and right off the page with the pager (a few pixels in the
pager, that
is), the window vanished from the pager. When I flip pages or do a
recapture, the
window appears again.

Is this a typo in this mail, a typo you made or one on the web page?

They only have to wipe their files if they want to use the tool.  Don't let
the fact that some people won't do this get in the way of writing the
tool.  Some folks will never use a graphical configurator anyway.

The important thing is that the tool not mangle an existing setup.

Sorry, I'm not ignoring your comments, I'm busy right now.

I didn't think so.

My reasoning being:

  If the window list is going to  be bound to  some key, its better if
all users  bind it  to the  same  key.  One way  to  do that is  set a
default binding.

  99 out of  100 users  are  going to  be  perfectly happy with  m-tab
pre-bound.  The  other 1% should have  no trouble undoing  the default
binding.

If you are trying to take on complete configuration, you should check
out the dotfile generator.  Follow the link from the fvwm site.

I think the only reason  we haven't given in  and  accept this as  our
"standard" configurator, is   the Tcl/Tk requirement.  (Well,  I'm not
that familiar with it, but the screenshots look good.)

If you can do anything using FvwmScript that would be great since it
doesn't require any other packages.

It sounds like you are trying to address overall configuration.

I've been  trying  to chop off  pieces,  (FvwmForm, FvwmAnimate), each
with its own config file.  I was hoping, that  after I chopped off all
the pieces, there  would  be nothing  but a  standard, skeleton config
file left.

My  tests  show  that the   commented   out  code  has  no impact   on
performance.  All my keys seem to work the same with or without it.

I did an extensive search of the mail archives without determining why
the logic was commented out.

I did see one patch from you to me, but the actual patch didn't seem
to be in the archive.

I downloaded the complete archive for 4/99 but the raw archive
seems to be only the fvwm list.

I'll remove the '#if 0' then.

A typo in my bug report I think.
I would have used cut/paste in the FTP session.
However, it's working now, so either I simply can't type
or something transient was going on and it's gone now.

Sorry to have bothered you. Thanks for the quick response.

I've had a look at it.  Yes the screen shots look good, but it doesn't
support half the features and it's mostly like FvwmConfig in that you
still have to specify most of the options by typing them in by hand, all
it really does is add in the proper header types and such.

That as mostly the reason that I was do it that way, and it's also alot
easier then writing a x program from scratch.

This is sorta what I had it mind also, although the module stuff is
rather easy other then FvwmButtons (frankly a config script for
FvwmButtons would probably be harder to write then this one) there
really isn't too many options.  I think if you seperate the
functions/styles/decors all up then it should be alot easier.  E.g.. a
main script that writes/read the config file and launches separate
scripts for each module and style/functions and such.

There are only a few problems that I can think of that pop into my
brain.  First is a way to let people make their own functions in a non
write them in themselves and just write them to the config file way. 
Second is things like style defines, what I'd prefer is something like
they point at a window and it would grab the windows class name info
then they just have to click on radio buttons or something to like set
icons/borders etc.  Could also be added to a window button like Wmaker
has Is this possible?  Something like FvwmIdenet > /tmp/tmpfile then
just parsing that file for it,  maybe FvwmEvent might work here, I'll
have to check.  And third, think it would be better to have one script
that is run at a fresh install so make a starting .fvwm2rc file, then
have one for post install config that contains all the parsing routines
and the like?

And finally, I'm also working on a script to do theme changing so you
can select what you wanted changed, like sounds, background, icons etc.
and a another to make themes.  I guess these could also be included in
there as well.  But as this theme route has been tried many a time
before and never really made it anywhere simply because of the massive
amount of changes and structure that has to be added to most .fvwm2rc
files.

Well I think I've come up with some good ideas on how this can be done
and requires very little in the way of changes to an existing rc file. 
I'll include what I'm doing it and how, plus few questions as it's just
about done in my next message.

If you have no iterest in themes for fvwm2 in any shape or form please
feel free to rm this e-mail, and sorry for cluttering up your mailbox
with it.

Now I know what your thinking.  Didn't this thread die yet? Haven't we
established that fvwm2 is not very good at themes because the rc file is
too easy to change around.  Gnome themes aren't very well setup.  I like
what Scott Scriven did but the configuration is unwieldy and too hard to
add to my setup.  I hate reading man pages so I just run (insert other
wm name here).  Is fvwm.themes.org still there?

Well I'm here to tell you that I think I've come up with IMHO a good way
to do it.  I know sounds like big words from someone that's only
complained about bugs on the mailing list, but I happen to love fvwm2
and would do just about anything (except give up money) to see more
people using it as it's still the best one out there I think.  I'm an op
on #linuxhelp in efnet and I have people ask me all the time what wm
should I use,  I always reply fvwm2.  Then someone pipes up and use
(insert wm name here).  So I figure I'm always up to try something new,
so I d/l, compile/install and show back up in the channel running it. 
So I play with it's window shading functions (if it has them) poke about
with the docs, search for snap attraction/to, changing functions, how
can I run a menu bar etc. 99% of the time they have almost no features
that I either care to use or have only 1% of the ones I think are the
most important.  So it's back to run good old fvwm2.  So here is how I
plan to make it better.  (Gosh I feel like a used car salesman)

First off I totally believe in the separate rc files and using just the
read function as it makes each file much cleaner and easier to edit. 
Secondly I've hardly cornered the market on the best way to do this,
just the way I came up with after sifting through the man page over a
few days, so if after reading this you think something would be better
setup another way please let me know.  Hopefully together we can all
come up with something that works.

All the rc files are of course split into a few other files.

.fvwm2rc (or I guess system.fvwm2rc):  Basically sets up GlobalOps,
Focus type, starting ImagePath, the basic feel EdgeScroll/Resistance,
Clicktime etc. and reads all the other rc fills in this order.

~/.fvwm/functions: does all the function commands minus init (.fvwm2rc)
and restart (~/.fvwm/modules, as all restart functions I've seen are
only module restarts) It also contains all of the mouse and keyboard
defines

~/.fvwm/menus: simple, defines menu option that appears on every menu.

~/.fvwm/styles: pretty simple aswell, however it also does a few
addtodecor functions.  E.g. you want different styles for
FvwmModules/regular windows/xterm/emacs/foo, all with the use style
function.  the rest of them are all MiniIcons and Icons styles.

~/.fvwm/modules: as of right now it loads all the modules on a restart,
and defines all the module settings for each type.  I thinking about
reads for each module type (is it worth it?).

~/.fvwm/default.theme: this fancy dancy file was actually just a sym
link to ~/.fvwm/themes/themename.theme before I started in on
FvwmScript.  Now when you change themes this file is generated
automagicly by FvwmScript from the settings you want to use, e.g.
borderstyles, icon, but not sound or background,  whatever the theme
contains which is also figured out by the script.

Well that's about it for the basics, but as this is about themes I'll
explain how they work now.

A standard default.theme file contains this.
#theme,somenumbers
#modules 0
#sound 0
#icons 1
#buttons 1
#borderstyle 0
#menu 0
#background 1

1 means this theme has this feature or define, 0 is naturally it
doesn't.  And the first line is auto generated by FvwmScript, as I can't
figure how to turn it off :) non generated themes now have this as a
desc line.

(gosh are we done yet?  Not even close :)

theme files have to have some kind of specific structure to make then
easier to parse so a file can be generated, there for this is what one
must contain.

if #modules = 1 it must only contain settings on what these modules look
like, as FvwmButtons is something completely different in this respect
and subject to something people might not want changed I'm thinking of
making using defines for this selectable on the main theme screen.

if #sound = 1 then it should contain only the extension to use as all
the sound files have the same name and the FvwmEvent path to find them
is in ~/.fvwm/themes/themnamedir/sound/
some kind of of standard sound format should be decided on as play does
some files ok and other it can't do well or at all, and I think this is
what most people will use to play them (or not), and sound it of course
something you can select or not on the theme screen

if #icons = 1 then as with sound no icon names are defined as they will
all have the same name and be installed in
~/.fvwm/themes/themenamedir/icons/,  this way you can have icons for all
kinds of standard stuff like netscape but not have to define any of them
to use, this path is simple added before the base imagepath dir as it
pixmap path.

if buttons = 1 this one gets a touch complex though.  It calls a
function called nobuttons which removes all the buttons on all the
windows and uses the themes config for them.  Seriously thinking about
taking this one out as many people point out this might constitute a
feel rather then a theme, (new spin off here feel?)

if borderstyle = 1 then the file must contain all the boarder defines to
use without addtoborderstyle, just borderstyle the add is placed in
there automagicly, same with titlestyle.  I suppose this one can be
taken out as it's the basis of themes, I was just looking for things to
fill up the window with and never took it out :),   Also all borderstyle
titlestyles and/or buttonstyles created under a decor called default,
that title is static and will never change no matter what theme you
choose, I saw no reason to change this as the styles file decorates most
windows with this decor

if background = 1 all it has to contain is the word background (so the
script can file the line) .xpm, jpg .gif .foo. and the way it's
displayed, max title maxspec or whatever.

if menu = 1 then it should have a menustyle line(s)

Additional comments: I'm pretty sure all the pixmaps icons and sounds
can just go into the themedir rather then separate sub dirs with only a
minor change to the script if that is more preferred.  people use just
about everything to do root window decor so figuring out which one they
use and what it's options are might present a bit of a challenge.  I'm
toying with the idea of adding a font style to choose from, so if say
someone only has the minimum X fonts installed they aren't forced to use
fixed when fvwm2 can't find font name foo.  If the theme file doesn't
contain any *FvwmModule lines then the script try's to generate some for
most of the common modules people use from the info contained in the
theme file, it's hardly perfect though, this can also be turned off

And naturally all the themes can be applied, committed to change or
canceled.

Ok advantages over any of the other themes setups I've seen on the net. 
Scott's is pretty good he has a nice setup and some neat themes but you
can't select what to change, and basically the only thing that changes
is the window decor.  The gnome one has some pretty neat ones also but I
didn't care for them myself and again the only that changes is the
window styles, no provisions for sound or icons and is rather hard to
tailor to your setup.  I won't comment too much on fvwm.themes.org style
as it was a good idea at the time but just isn't implemented well.  That
an I believe he monitors this list :).  And this system is pretty easy
to write themes for and tailor to your system.  And new features or an
updated script can be dropped in with little or no change (at least
that's the way I designed it)

Problems.  Well first is if someone's fvwm2rc file is a mess it has to
be cleaned up some what to work at all.  There may be some editing of
the script file required for paths, but they are right at the top in
variables so that should be minor if it's need at all.  Fvwm2 doesn't
come with a standard root window background program other then xpmroot
which only does xpm and using xv isn't always the best solution as many
people may not have it installed.  My scripting ability is very limited
as I've just learned FvwmScript (sorta) this past week so the script
file my be unnessacarly complicated.  The themes can't be selected from
a menu as the format doesn't allow fvwm2 to handle it properly.  Then
theme file should be rather structured and if it's not e.g. if someone
creates one by hand and doesn't follow the format very well the script
will have a hard time with it.  Currently you can't select that only
certain windows get certain decors as Scott's system can.  It doesn't
work with the fvwm2 versions that don't have the ImagePath statement yet
as it uses some features that only came out after that.  And it's only
been tested on Linux,  There should be no problem with any *nix that
contains the gnu tools, only thing that it uses is grep tr and cat, but
then I'm no shell expert but I believe | commands work the same on all
of them.

Well enhancements I'd like to add but can think of how to do them:
Sound, if someone unchecks the sound button then applies the theme I'd
like it to ask them if they just don't want to use sound from this theme
or turn off sound.   an AddToFunc soundplay exec cat $1 > /dev/null
doesn't seem like a very good way to go for turning off sound, having
FvwmEvent spit out a billion soundplay commands not found is not good, 
and just killing FvwmEvent is not a good idea either.

Modules: I don't believe there is any other way to send module restart
commands other then killing then running the restart func so the style
changes for them take effect.

I can't think of the best way to implement global themes and $HOME dir
themes as I think this might greatly increase the size of the script.

Well that's about it (finally) any questions about anything I may not
have explained well enough or any suggestions on how to do something or
features to add are greatly welcome.  I'm sure they might be flood of
messages about this on the list once I send this out so feel free to
send me private e-mail and I'll forward some of them to the list.\

I also apologize for the size of this messages but as it's not quite
finished yet I really want feedback on it so I can change things before
I release my creation to the real world.

hrmp, well my scripting style may be a bit sloppy but I was just about
finished writing the final few routines when I hit FvwmScript's max
variable limit of 60.  Should I just try to be more efficient with my
scripting or can I change the source for this?  Is this just some random
pick limit or it set at 60 for a reason?

Hmmm, I just had a thought regarding the themes script I'm almost
finished and the titlebar buttons issue.  If a theme included say 6
default buttons for like close, min, max, menu, kill, etc or whatever
people seem to use most, or even all 10 then the script could just parse
and find out what kind button pixmap or vector goes where, that would
solve the feel problem and still allow the theme maker some kind of
flexablity.  what do you people think, does that sound like it should
work?

If so what are the most common button uses that people have?  If it's
just min max menu and close please don't respond.

I can't get MAKEFLAGS=-j5 to work.  If I cd into a leaf directory and
type 'MAKEFLAGS=-j5 make' it works but from the top of the fvwm src tree
MAKEFLAGS gets lost somehow.

Cheers,
Tim.

I usually use 
MAKE="make -j 20" make -j 20 
from the root and it works fine, haven't tried MAKEFLAGS though.

Yes, that won't work.  When GNU make starts up it reads MAKEFLAGS and
parses them just as if they were normal flags--and applies the same
rules to them as to normal flags before putting them back into the
MAKEFLAGS variable for the submake.

Note the next version of GNU make shouldn't require this hack; it has a
new feature where the make and all it's submakes communicate to ensure
that only X subprocesses are running at the same time--so make doesn't
replace -jN with -j1 for submakes anymore.

Seems to work, and it's really quite lightweight--just like fvwm, it
uses simple pipes.  Gotta love UNIX :).

Hm, the screenshots look terrible with my 1024x768x16 visual. I wonder
if that can be improved a bit. I think the thumbnails are too big to
look like real thumbnails and too small to look good (the menu entries
look like fly droppings).

We should take some effort to get screenshots that really look good, even
when viewed with few colours. Perhaps there should be sections of
screenshots that look good with 8/16/24/32 bit planes. We don't want
people to run away horrified because they vievew gradients with 1000
colours on a 256 colour display :)

Dan, can you send me the marble you put on window borders? Viewing it
with netscape gives me the creeps. I want to judge the difference
first-hand.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

P.S.: Nice work, Dan.

That's strange. They're all gifs, so they should only be asking for
8-bits of color. I for one was glad to see gifs instead of jpegs. I
suppose pngs would be okay, too.

I quantized mine down to a 5-bit color-palette .gif. Didn't seem to
lose much color detail when I did this. See
http://www.best.com/~mikehan/fvwm2rc.html

Oh, and how do I submit a screenshot? I have a newer one than the one
on my page.

Any suggestions are welcome.  I used Gimp to create Mikhael's thumbnail,
and xv to create mine.

Using Gimp I just asked for a .25 reduction, using xv, I asked for 2
1/2 size reductions.  (Using the theory that throwing away 1/4 of the
pixels would cause the least distortion.)

I know the thumbnails are sketchy,  but the full size screenshots look
good to me.  (1280x1024x8.)

Agreed.  I have access to a 1600x1200x24 visual, I mean to give that
a try.

I hope to include some full size screen fragments:

Vector buttons, gradient menus, FvwmButtons, etc.

Hm, my graphics adapter has a peculiar notion of how colours should look
like. And netscape dithered parts of the images. I have too view them
at home to judge the differences.

Dan, would you take care of adding screenshots from people without
commit privileges?

What irritates me is that the thumbnails are still quite big. They didn't
look like thumbnails (21" screen with 1024x768) but like real desktops.
I think reducing the size by another step will help.

Send them to me (not the list).  Please, not everyone at once.

Include some text.  I'd like to at least identify the things on the
window that would be of interest.  Perhaps some config file fragments.

Should I be doing anything with the contents of the fvwm-web module?  I can
set up an auto-update to the web site if it's to the point where you want
to do that.

Should we provide new fvwm tarballs packed with 'bzip2 -9' too for
people with a slow internet connection? I think it's as trivial as
unpacking the .bz and repacking it with said command (and unpacking
it again to compare it with the original). Could be done as a simple
shell script, but should be reflected on the web pages.

Shouldn't we remove the web pages from the tarball and make a
separate package for people who want them? I guess only a few
people will ever use the web pages on their disk.

Subject: EdgeScroll doesn't work diagonally with Move

Full_Name: Brent Beacham
Version: 2.2.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: SunOS 5.5.1
X_Server: X11
Submission from: (NULL) (128.100.24.33)


This isn't really that serious but I've notice that the behaviour of
EdgeScroll for flipping to a page diagonally from the current page
is different when a window is being moved compared to when one is not.  

If, for instance, I have "DeskTopSize 3x2" and "EdgeScroll 100000 100000"
and I am in the bottom left page.  If I move the mouse pointer to the 
top right corner of the screen the page will change to the top middle 
page (as seen in the pager) as expected.  However if a window is being 
dragged with Move then the page will not change diagonally.  The page 
can then only be changed to one above, below, or to the left or right 
of the current page and nothing happens if the pointer is moved to the 
corner of the current page.

An auto-update  would be great.  Do it  at your convenience.  I expect
that  there will be lots   of changes for  a  while.  I haven't really
thought  about the link  from the main pages  yet  (but we should have
one).

Moving the rest of  the web stuff  out of  the main distribution  into
fvwm-web makes sense.

I think we could shed our "legacy icons" the same way.

They don't look like much at all reduced another step.  Of course this
is display dependent.  At 640x480, each one would fill 1/2 the screen.

Right now, I'm doing all my viewing using "file:".  I'll have to check
this out over  a 28K modem, it might   be best to  skip the thumbnails
completely like some of the other sites I checked do.  We'll see.

Dan, why don't you check out the size of the enlightment thumbnails for
the screenshots.  As I recall they aren't very large thumbnails just
large enought to give you an idea of what is going on.

While I was playing around with my desktop to try to come up with a
decent screenshot, I found that MenuStyle SidePic not longer works with
an xpm that has a transparent background. It looks as though the whole
xpm is treated as transparent; i.e., all you see is a rectangle of the
SideColor.

	On a couple of my menus I've been using a side pic called
side.fvwm99.xpm, that somebody (I forget who at the moment) sent to the
list a while back. I made a new version with the transparent color
edited to a solid color, and it works fine. I'm guessing, therefore,
that the problem is in some of the recent graphics changes rather than
in the menu code, per se.

	Has anyone else seen this problem?


Cheers,
Bob

The  sidepic issue    reminds me, we     need a winXX   (fvwm95)  type
screenshot.  I can create  one,  but my menus   don't look that  good.
Anyone else?

Hi,

I just tried the latest CVS version and notized that at least in
my setup (fvwm started with "-cmd FvwmM4"), fvwm drops all
command line arguments on restarts. (In fvwm 2.3.3, this was
still working)

regards,
               Peter

Well, I really had hoped someone else would volunteer for pushing
the project towards 2.4. Seems that I have to do it again then
(no hard feelings, I'm just under stress and perhaps there's a tiny
bit of disappointment too).

Here's a much more complete list of open issues (without the future
enhancements, I'll move them to a separate thread):

To do (must):

 1) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).
 2) Add screen shots to web page.
 3) Add link to fvwm cats page to web page.
 4) Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5) Update the links on our home page.
 6) Remove several configure options.
 7) Create an I18N fvwm package (from 2.2 or so).
 8) Add an explanation about the various packages and where to
    discuss them to the web page.
    (stable, unstable (alpha), snapshots, ftp source tree, CVS).
 9) Set up RPM packages.

To do (optional)

 10) Remove 'PopupAsRootMenu' menu style (?).
     [comments wanted]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [comments wanted]
 12) Set up bzip2 tarballs.
 13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.

Fixes (high priority):

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
 15) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
 17) Fix the bug that causes icons to lose management (bug #352).
 18) Check if there are still growing windows as reported for 2.13.
     [bug #184 reported by Michael Hughes <mhughes@bridge.com>]
 19) Try to reproduce that KFM windows stay on top of normal fvwm windows.
     [reported by Andrew Morton <morton@nortelnetworks.com> on 16-May-1999]
 20) Check why no icon can be set for Eterm.
     [reported on 8-May-1999 by Amir Chossrow Akhavan <amir@phy.ucsf.EDU>]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
 22) Investigate bug #290.
     [mail thread from April]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
 26) Investigate bug #315.
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.

Fixes (optional):

 29) Fix the pager bugs I reported recently.
 30) Fix the broken size hints of FvwmWinList (in fvwm itself).
     [reported by Dan, verified by me (Dominik)]
 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
     [reported by me (Dominik)]
 32) Several applications are reported to not resize well under fvwm
     (Datek's "Streamer", CodeWarrior).

Testing:

 33) Test the GNOME patches.
 34) Run the purify script again (and update it).
 35) Test the strokes patch.
 36) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)
 
===

If anybody wants to help, please concentrate on one of the following items
for the first sweep:

1-5, 7-9, 12, 33, any of the high priority bugs.

I see you have missed some places where strokes should be handled. I've
fixed the places I am aware of. Can you try this with the latest CVS
code and tell me if it helps?

What is your:
  * fvwm executable name,
  * Restart command,
  * ChangeLog time?

For now, "Restart fvwm2" is not a special case and does not add arguments.
It will be, probably, changed to be more like in the previous versions,
but personaly I don't think it is good to have special cases in Restart
command.

As a general solution, Restart without arguments must do what you want.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry, after looking more closely it seems that a restart alwasy puts
me on page 0 1 (on a 2x2 desktopn).

Actually the problem I reported with button grabbing is entirely my fault.
In my configuration, I had

Mouse 3 A A

to remove ALL of the bindings to mouse button 3. Unknown to me, this had the
side effect of causing fvwm to receive all buttonpress and buttonrelease event,
even if the pointer is in another window. Once I noticed this behavior, I
started to use

Mouse 3 R A

and this solved my problem. 

Although this works now, this behavior strikes me as incorrect. I would never
expect "Mouse 3 A A" to send normal application events to fvwm, because I would
expect "Mouse 3 A A" to just remove the bindings added by fvwm.

But everything works fine, now. So, I really don't have any problems.

That is exactly what it is supposed to do. The 'A'ny context tells fvwm
to bind this action anywhere on the desktop, regardless of where the
pointer is. 'R'oot is the context for only the root window. I don't
know where you got the idea, but certainly not from the man page, did you?

I was working on that a few months ago. Hmm, seems I placed a copy of
the rcfile on my site, so there's *something* at
http://www.best.com/~mikehan/windoze.fvwm2rc
Though there's no accompanying screenshot right now. This all took
place a while ago so I forget exactly, but I recall that I was
struggling with some things that were bugging me... I think I was
having trouble mastering placement hints for the menu (wanted the menu
placed over the Start button). May have been working with 2.1.x, so it
could've been a bug that was later fixed. Anyway, the rcfile is there.
The color palette matches the default win98 palette exactly.

I understand the idea of Any context to bind a key/mouse binding. But what I
didn't expect is that using Any context in the case of removal will remove
bindings not added by fvwm. The man page is clear on adding bindings, but it
did not make me realize that Any context removal will really remove everything.

But like I said, this is not a real problem, as making a special case for
removal is not really worth the trouble.

When you work with different configurations (possible bad) you sometimes
get no root menus and can't do anything. The default menu contains
Exit option, this is all. I think it is good to add FvwmTalk, so you can
execute anything you like, including restarting with a better config file.

Here is a manual patch to fvwm.c (line 873 for now):

+    "+ \"&3. Fvwm Command\" Module FvwmForm FormFvwmTalk.",

Mikhael.

	Sounds like what you're doing is restarting FVWM under a different name
from the last invocation. With the current state of the Restart code,
FVWM doesn't recognize that it's restarting in this case, so it doesn't
switch back to the previous page. You should also see your InitFunction
being executed instead of your RestartFunction when this happens.

	Have you tried out Mikhael's Restart patch from Friday? I haven't had a
chance to do so yet -- my schedule's been really crazy this week.

Try to remove ~/.fvwm_restart and start again, does this help?
I will look at this tommorow to determine the possible cause of this.

	I tried chopping them approximately in half (about 160x128), and they
look fine on my 1280x1024 display. Of course, I'm using a truecolor
visual, so I can't judge the effects of dithering.

	I think that thumbnails don't need to give more than a suggestion of
what the real think looks like.

	Also, as Dominik suggested earlier, we may want to have different sets
for different color resolutions - maybe not *all* possible ones, but at
least for pseudocolor and truecolor.

	FVWM can produce some really nice effects with a truecolor visual, and
there's no reason we shouldn't show that off, but the thumbnail page
should indicate that certain shots won't look good with 256 colors or
less. By the same token, we do want to have some that look good at any
resolution, 'cause 8-bit folks like eye-candy too. (Dan, I think you
mentioned a few days ago what a remarkably good job CDE did with
backgrounds/color schemes - they definitely showed what can be done with
limited resources in this area.)

	(I don't currently have access to the good ol' 256-color Sun box I used
to use, so I can't really judge how things look in 8-bit. Even if I
crank my XAccel Linux server down to pseudolor, the color still looks
better than it did on the Sun.)

	Actually, I think you may have been right both times! I think it's that
it always tries to go back to the last page a restart was done from when
the restart file was written - even on a cold start, after terminating X
and starting it up again.

	I finally got it to settle down by deleting my .fvwm_restart file. (I
also shut down X and started up again cold.) Now it seems to be working
pretty much the way Restart used to (which isn't quite what we want,
granted). 

	The current version isn't writing the restart file, so I can't say
whether it would be correct if it did - but it won't continue to confuse
itself or another version of FVWM. It will get confused, however, if you
do a Restart from another recent version.

	Can we live with it like this for a day or two? I won't have a chance
to look at it seriously till tomorrow evening at the earliest. (Of
course, by then, Mikhael may well have spotted the problem.)

I guess, I should have been more specific - sorry.
After looking more closely at the sources, I guess, the "bug"
that I reported probably is a feature :-)

I have several different versions of fvwm2 floating around (I
don't think this is too abnormal: one stable version to do real
work, other versions for testing & experimenting). They have
names like "fvwm2.3.4". 

So far, it was enough that the name of the executable contained
"fvwm2" as a substring for the Restart command to assume a
"native" restart. Now it seems to be intended to only do a "native"
restart, if there is no argument at all or the argument matches
the name of the currently running executable - which makes it at
least pretty difficult to alternatively use different versions.

Furthermore, if "Restart" has no arguments at all, it is always
assumed that the name of the executable is "fvwm2" (IMHO, it
would be more logical, to use the path of the currently running
executable instead; so far I got around this by constructing the
full path of the current version with an M4 macro, but this will
drop all command line arguments now - fatal if you rely on
preprocessing).

Regards,
            Peter

(P.S.: I am referring to the CVS version from Jun 17 7:30 GMT)

No, it is not too abnormal, instead, it is normal for a developer.

No, it is not difficult. Restart them using the command:
  Restart fvwm2.3.4 -cmd FvwmM4

I don't think that guessing anything about the program from its name is
correct. I know at least one developer having names fvwm-2.3.4. Is this
fvwm1, fvwm2, other window manager? There is no way to know from the name.

There is no hardcoded "fvwm2" anywhere IIRC. It just uses your original
command arguments (fvwm2 -cmd FvwmM4) with no changes at all.

Sorry, I deleted the original mail.

The right way to prevent fvwm from stealing key events from a window
would be not to bind keys to the window in the first place (the same
applies to button presses too). THe initial binding is done in
add_window.c. The right way to do that is to create a new style:

  Style VNC IgnoreKeyBindings, IgnoreButtonBindings

The only drawback is that this can't be done dynamically, i.e. if
the window starts with a name 'foobar' and then is renamed to 'VNC'
the key bindings will still work (and vice versa). If we start
messing with the events in events.c it's too late.

No, it's the other way round. I don't *restart* fvwm, I reboot my machine and
start it then. Althought it's clearly no restart, the .fvwm-restart file
is evaluated. I don't know if my windows are started from RestartFunc or
InitFunc, but they all pop up on page 0 1. The .fvwm-restart file has
0 1 stored as the current page (I didn't look at the sections for the other
windows). I noticed the problem first with the patch applied.

I think it might be a good idea for .fvwm-restart to be deleted as soon
as it has been used.  The only time it should exist on disk is when fvwm
is restarting itself.

Gm, that patch didn't apply to the CVS code. I looks right, but still I had
to do it by hand. Is there something wrong with the CVS instructions on

I'm a bit confused about the status of this. With all available patches
applied it still happens.

Yes, but there is no harm (not the case for the moment) of having
old .fvwm-restart, since it will only be used on Restart (not on StartUp).
Also .fvwm-restart probably must not be removed, if you exit from fvwm,
but not from X and then start fvwm again (Restarting implied in this
case).

Mikhael.

Ther right address is is dominik.vogt@fvwm.org. I try to mangle each and every field
in mails to the outside world, but I didn't find a way to set my address when I
send private mail from work.

I have no objections. Any other votes for Mikhael?

Dominik,

as I pointed out in my response the the original poster, using Num Lock,
for some reason causes the events to get passed through correctlly. By
this I mean I have my regular fvwm on my default X server with
Ctrl+arrows to move around pages.  Then I start a VNC window also
running fvwm, with the same Ctrl+arrows bound.  Now if I have focus on
VNC and hit Ctrl->right my default fvwm moves.  But If I have Num Lock
on and do Ctrl->right the VNC page moves instead.

Now why it works with Num Lock I have no idea.  Yes I know that Num Lock
is a modifier it doesn't match in the toplevel fvwm so it gets passed to
the application.  Now why VNC strips Num Lock I don't know and I don't
care as long as it works.

As for adding a Style Option that was my first thought, and I did in
fact hack it in, but the VNC window has noclass and noresource, so you
only have the icon/window name to work with, which gets set to $USERS's
x desktop.  Which the expresiion to match was conflicting with some
stupid bx windows, so I gave up.  And just used the Num Lock trick.

Notwithstanding the fact that '==' actually does work in the above, using
strcmp() is *way* too error prone. 

Better to look at libs/Strings.h for some help.  I see "StrEquals", for
example.


And for the above, what is up with "getBasename"?  What is wrong with
using strrchr?

The only thing that I can see where this binding could actually be
a problem is that most users coming from a Windows background (the
ones that are looking for WIn9x configurations) will expect Alt-Tab to
behave a certain way.  The WindowList function, while useful, will not
work that way.  This could be confusing for such users.

Personally, I prefer binding Root+Mouse2 to displaying the WindowList,
since it looks very much like a menu.  This is, however, just a personal
preference.

Maybe we should have some documentation as to exactly WHAT fvwm2 will
do in the event that it cannot get a configuration file:

    Is there a root menu oe mwnua?  If so, how do I activate it or them,
    and what will be on it or them?

	[Here is one place where I think that fvwm2 could be improved.
	The current default menu, with only one item which exits the
	window manager, is rather limited.  How about a local xterm
	and a restart option?]

    Are there any hot-keys?  If so, what are they and what do they do?

    What decorations are put on windows (active and otherwise) by
    default?  What do these decorations do and how do I use them?

	[Can windows be resized or moved?  Can they be minimized?]

    What is the focus policy?  Are there any other policies that are
    enforced by the window manager which occur by default in the
    absense of a configuration file?

This should be defined and specified in the fvwm2(1) manpage.

since when does == work with char * in C? And strcmp is only errorprone if you pass it nulls but we check that case in the code beforehand, besides only said strcmp because that is what is used throughout the if.

It took a while for it to sink in that  our FAQ always mentioned M-TAB
and the "original" was A-TAB.  I think this  makes sense however since
Exceed users  would surely want  A-TAB untouched, leaving M-TAB as the
logical default.

Yep.  I'd still want some key binding.

Have you checked the latest CVS?  From the fvwm2 man page:

.SH BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS
The following commands are built-in to fvwm2:
.EX
Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
.EE

The "Help" and "F1" keys invoke a built-in menu that fvwm2 creates.
This is primarily for new users that haven't created their own configuration
file.  Either key on the root (background) window will popup an menu
which should help you get started.

The tab key pressed anywhere with the "meta" key held down will pop-up
a window list.

There is no reason why you can't override or remove these bindings.
To remove the window list binding, use this:
.EX
Key Tab A M -
.EE

Now I know you haven't checked the latest  CVS.  The builtin menu will
start an xterm,  invoke  a setup dialog, or   exit.  The setup  dialog
creates the users config file(s) and has a restart option.

See above

With no config file, there are no decorations, and  the only thing you
can really do well is use the xterm or setup dialog.

Not until you've done the setup stuff.

I  don't remember.  I'm    not sure if   the default  focus policy  is
important enough to be in the man page.   What would be important is a
tool that lets a user control his focus policy  without having to look
in and change the default .fvwm2rc.

All  the  above represents my  current  opinions.   I'm  still open to
suggestions.

This is good, and a real start.  However, is MenuFvwmRoot defined in
the man page?

I don't have CVS access through the firewall here at work, and I'm not
really gung-ho about using a possibly buggy window manager on my work
system.  At home, that's another story.  [smile]

If fvwm 2.3 releases start getting stable in preparation for an
upcoming 2.4, I would be willing to use those, most certainly to test
my environments:  at work, I run a pre-release Tru64 Unix 5.0 system, at
home, I run SunOS 4.1.3, Linux 2.2.9, AIX 3.2.5.  All these systems
have unique monitor sizes and/or resolutions from 8 bit to 16 bit to 32
bit depths, and from 1024x768 to 1152x864 to 1280x1024 to 1600x1200. 
It's a testament to fvwm2 that I can survive with a single
configuration file that will work perfectly and almost identically on
all these environments!

Fine.  Is this menu documented?

I was just making a few suggestions in my previous post.  I am glad to
see that some of them have been anticipated and are already implemented
in CVS.

When 2.3.x is in a stable enough state, I'll be glad to download a
snapshot.


On another subject, I have heard comments that the module interface may
have changed in the new release.  Does that mean that a module that was
built for fvwm2.2 (specifically, tkgoodstuff) may need to be modified
before it will work for 2.3+?

Only to the extent shown.

I understand not using a buggy window manager at work.
I should have been clearer on the CVS issue.  We have nightly snapshots
on our servers.  All you need is ftp.

I understand.

I'd say its pretty stable now.  By this evening, who knows.
Actually I download CVS updates every day or 2.  Its pretty rare that
I can't actually use the current CVS.

Sorry to keep copying you and the workers list.  I would guess you are
on the workers list, but what good is a guess?

Well, I thought  my 1/2, 1/2  theory  made sense, but  uniform size is
nice too.   The   thumbnails I saw   were  160x120 so   thats  the new
"correct" size.

Interestingly, both the thumbnails  and the full  shots are jpgs.   We
are still using gifs.

By the way I have been happilly running current CVS every since we went

errors?

Probably but you're not copying to (0,0).  The clipping is done on the
destination pixels not the source so you have to set the clip origin to
the destination of the XCopyArea().

== in C works just fine with any pointers (including char*).
It does not work with strings (in java context).

Maybe it is good to have it just in case other OSes use different
directory separators. I agree, getBasename (if any) must use strrchr.

Okay, just send a user name and an encrypted UNIX like password to
Jason and he will give you access. BTW, don't forget that CVS
access implies certain responsibilities (like updating Jitterbug if
you fixed something).

  I am have problems with growing windows.  I see it the most when I start
elvis on a remote machine.  I just had it do this 3 times in a row.  The 
window will display, refresh and be a little bigger, refresh and be a
little
bigger etc.  If I resize the window it stops.  I just tried to get it to
do
it again and nothing after 3 tries.  I see that there is a bug report of
the same thing that is marked fixed.  Did something happen to change that
in 2.1.13?  I went to 2.1.13 to fix the problem with moving windows in the
pager with the center button.

Yes, I see the same. To fix it temporarily you have to do this:

Buggy code:

/* draw the inside relief */
if(
#ifdef BORDERSTYLE
   !(borderflags & NoInset)
#endif
   && t->boundary_width > 2)

Correct code:

if(t->boundary_width > 2
#ifdef BORDERSTYLE
   && !(borderflags & NoInset)
#endif
   )


And a similar error somewhere in builtins.c:

#ifdef MINI_ICONS
    tmpbf.u.p = NULL;
#endif

has to be replaced by

#ifdef MINI_ICONS
#ifdef PIXMAP_BUTTONS
    tmpbf.u.p = NULL;
#endif
#endif

I recently tried out fvwm-2.3.3, but I noticed dragging a gnome menu
from top to bottom causes an enormous slowdown in X. It completely hangs
for a minute or two before I can continue working. I switched to a
virtual console and found out X consumes up to 90% CPU time.

The problem starts just when the menubar is dragged over the exact
position te be released. As long the bar moves downwards there is no
problem yet. Moving the bar from bottom to top has the same problem.

OS: Redhat 6.0 linux i386
XServer: XFree86_S3  3.3.3.1
configure options: --enable-gnome
gnome-libs-1.0.8-8
tested gnome apps: gmix-1.0.1, gnomecal-1.0.7

fvwm-2.2 doesn't have the problem.

BTW, wouldn't it be useful to print the configure options together with
version info when I'd type "fvwm2 -version"? (just like my vim does)

Kind greetings,

Tung

Subject: rectangle positioning menus
Date: Thu, 17 Jun 1999 11:12:48 -0700
From: Michael Han <mikehan@best.com>
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I was trying to use the "rectangle" context for positioning a menu, as
in:

Key     Escape  A       C       PopUp StartMenu Rectangle 1x20+0-0 \
+0m -0m Fixed

and discovered that the geometry I specify always gives me trouble...
fvwm2 always returns an error citing "invalid rectangle geometry".
Looking at menus.c (I get this for all kinds of geometries that should
be parse-able), I see that the token is being passed to
XParseGeoemtry.

I cracked out gdb, and here's what I saw:

Breakpoint 4, GetMenuOptions (
    action=0x8098680 "Rectangle =1x20+0-0 +0m -0m Fixed", w=8388698, 
    tmp_win=0x8096fb8, mr=0x0, mi=0x0, pops=0xbffff45c) at menus.c:6115
6115          flags = XParseGeometry(tok, &x, &y, &width, &height);
(gdb) print naction
$6 = 0x809868a "=1x20+0-0 +0m -0m Fixed"
(gdb) print tok
$7 = 0x80985a0 "Rectangle"
(gdb) print taction
$8 = 0x8098680 "Rectangle =1x20+0-0 +0m -0m Fixed"

Without spending a lot of time here I'm not exactly sure what's
supposed to happen here. Should tok be free()'d before a GetNextToken
is called? Whatever the case, I think this is also a problem in the
2.2 branch, because I had the same problem back with 2.1.x in February
or March and just assumed I didn't understand the Menu positioning
hints syntax.

This is fixed. Now waiting for Jason.
I will send you the patch again if there will be no access in 3 hours. :)

There are still problems on restarts, like placing sticky windows on
wrong pages, so they are visible only in a pager (if at all).
I didn't have time to look at it more closely.

Mikhael.

I don't know which options would be removed, but I like all the "disable
options", because I don't need all those gradient, pixmap and other
"flashy" stuff. Compiling fvwm with them doesn't make sense for me. I
know this is just personal taste..

I can set up an RPM package for i386.. if I can find out how to build
the specs of course one day.

I don't understand this dispute. I suppose everyone knows C here. :)
There are functions, which return a pointer inside the given string,
like strchr or getBasename, so these lines, for example, are equvivalent:
  (str == strchr(str, '.'))
  (str[0] == '.')
where str is a valid string.

Mikhael.

Of course! The must be a big, flashy, colourful link from the first page

Not really. I wanted to emphasize that it's important. People keep
asking me about it.

Why not. On the other hand we could simply fix it. I think we agreed that
the problem is that fvwm prints the message when an application requests
zero size increments. This isn't really illegal.

Because it's hard to maintain. Disabling all options (at least the ones
I'm planning to remove) will save no more than 20k code and a few k
of dynamic memory. That's not worth the additional effort and pain.

I think Jason just needs the spec to set up a script to do it automatically.
If anybody can provide the spec we'd be grateful.

Isn't FvwmConsole a better choice? You need only one module and
I find it easier to use. I haven't tried the FvwmForm script however.

Should the command "Module FvwmForm FormFvwmTalk" do anything useful?
I just get a tiny window (1x1 characters). When I enlarge it I see the
title is FvwmTalk, but it doesn't do anything useful.

Yes, of course. You can use == to compare pointers if you know they
point into the same string. What I wanted to express is that you can't
use == to compare arbitrary strings.

You forgot trailing dot in FormFvwmTalk. .
Yes, sure. It must be FvwmConsole. I have always used FvwmTalk since
FvwmConsole didn't work for me sometimes with fvwm 2.0.*.

>  13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.

I did a little experiment with this, and I don't know if it is worth
it. We can easily change the root cursor - or even all the fvwm-controlled
cursors, but many apps (even xterms) will still use their own cursors.
Changing these would be difficult, since we would have to reset them to 
their old (unknown) values after restart.

But if changing only the root cursor makes you happy, I'll commit the
5 lines necessary to do it.

Hm, I can't get FvwmForm to work. I've added an FvwmConsole menu entry.

If you're trying to position you start menu the position hints are
not correct. Use '+0m -100m'. '+0m' is the same as '-0m'.

Right. There were two bugs that caused even correct rectangles to fail.

Fixed.

Yes. GetNextToken mallocs the string. Perhaps I'll rewrite most parsing
to use PeekToken instead (just copies the string into a static memory area).

You don't see application cursors while moving, using menus etc.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.78.227.230)


I use desks with 2x1 pages, so I have one on the left and the other one on
the right side.

Resolution 1152x864, the same problem with 1280x1024.

Windows placed on the right end of the left are visible on the right page
as well, it seems that there is an area between the two pages which is
shared.
Placing a window at the left side of the right page gives a comparable
result.

e.g.
xclock at 164x164+970+100 can be seen "on the other side" with coordinates
-52+100.

Dom also mentioned me, but unfortunately I have to take more of a sysadmin
role here because my C is realy rusty.  If FVWM were written in Perl I'd
have no problem.  As it is, Majordomo must take the bulk of what free time
I have.

I actually have the spec (well, as part of a src.rpm which was recently
uploaded).  Now I just need to find some time to set up a build on an
up-to-date Linux machine.

I actually have the machine; we took apart a small Beowulf cluster so I
have some PPro200s sitting around.  I have one set aside but haven't found
the time to start moving services over to it.

Nothing's really been heard on this after a few people (including me)
tried unsuccessfully to reproduce the problem. I was hoping to see a
version number and a reference to the motif library in use.

> 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.

Do you mean the one that Thomas was reporting a few weeks back? I
noticed you'd been looking for the report... I'm including it at the
bottom of my message. I've been looking this one over and I can't make
heads or tails of his gdb output.

It appears to core in strcasecmp(), because the first arg is NULL. Now
I don't understand this, because it's being called by MatchToken() in
libs/Parse.c, which is supposed to verify that

if (ntok) 

before calling strcasecmp() with ntok as the first arg. What's even
stranger is this is called from config() in FvwmEvent.c, where the arg
that's being fed to MatchToken() is coming from the event_table. I
don't understand how in the world *any* event_table[i].name could
possibly be NULL, as long as "i" starts at 0 and increments as long as
it's less than MAX_MESSAGES+MAX_BUILTIN.

Just tried to duplicate the bug, and couldn't. I'm all out of ideas on
what this bug is all about. Anyone got any ideas? Seems to have
originated from a clean compilation of 2.2.2.

builtin-rplay.
     */
    if (strcasecmp(cmd_line, "builtin-rplay") == 0)
	if ((rplay_fd = rplay_open(host)) < 0)
	{
	    rplay_perror("rplay_open");
	    exit(1);
	}
#endif

So what gives???

Thanks Much in advance,

I agree, that it is questionable to deduce the window manager
type from its name. Having to duplicate the command line
arguments in the configuration file, however, is even worse,
because it lies in the nature of command line args, that they are
not constant. You would have to remember changing the
configuration file, too, whenever you want to user different
arguments.

IMHO, it would be better if the restart command had an optional
argument for telling it the type of wm (actually, I guess, all it
really needs to know is whether to propagate the original command
line)

Mmm.  That's a good point.  It really ought to be in libfvwm, though,
'cause most of the modules do a similar check (for module aliases).

Yeah, that's what I was getting at.  It's rather ludicrous to write
pointer-manipulating code like that.  There's too much potential for
off-by-one errors, whereas the C library has a well-debugged strrchr() 
that does the job perfectly.

I think this one got beaten to death already.  :)

The str[n][case]cmp() routines are error prone in that it is way too easy
to forget the "== 0" bit when you want to test strings for equality.
Didn't I just see a message this morning that Dominik applied a patch to
put "== 0" into some code that needed it?

I don't know about the rest of you, but I frequently make the mistake of
forgetting "== 0".  Conversely, when someone is perverse enough to use
"strcmp(a,b)" to mean "strings a and b differ", I usually misread it as a
bug at first.

I know the C hotshots will never make these mistakes, but for the rest of
us, it is much easier to read "StrEquals(a,b)" and "!StrEquals(a,b)".
This should not unduly confuse the hotshots, either.  :-)

No, I don't think allocating new colors would be a good idea in
StretchPixmap, it just stretches. If the result is too jaggy then the
original is too small. If the original is a gradient then the colors are
supposed to gradually change so the jaggies shouldn't be seen. You can't
expect gradients to look smooth on an 8 bit display.

If you go from black to white in 20 colors you will see steps in the
gradient no matter what method is used. If you go from #000077 to
#2222aa in 20 steps and you can see steps then your eyes are better than
mine (no cheating by using a 16 bit display, use a 24 bit one).

What I'm trying to say is that I understand gradients to be a gradual
change in colors and that this implies that stretching by large amounts
doesn't matter because you can't easily discern any one color from its
neighbours.



I had a quick play with using SetWindowBackground() in makemenu() so
that menus follow the DefaultBackground command.  V & H gradients and
TiledPixmap work fine but stretching to the full size of menus makes the
menus take too long to pop up the first time. I think the problem is
that makemenu() is called when the menu is about to be mapped.  This
could be fixed by calling makemenu() for all modified menus in the main
event loop just before the select call. I think this would mean that the
menus are ready to be mapped but they aren't rendered too often (i.e.
it's pointless to redraw the menus every time and AddToMenu is called)

Dominik, could you provide a code segment that runs through the list of
menus calling makemenu() if necessary? I'll try putting this in various
places to see if it speeds up response.

Cheers,
Tim.

Don't put pressure on yourself. Nobody expects that you start hacking C code.
As it is you take lots of work off our backs. Work that most of us would hate.
We're in no particular hurry at the moment.

No, that's wrong. It depends on the contrast of the colours *and* the size
of the lines for each colour. You won't see steps with this gradient if
the drawing area is just 20 pixels wide. The bigger the window, the more
colours you need. But allocating colours takes up real execution time.
I tried it with 100 colours on my menus. It takes several seconds to
allocate them. So I want them only if I need them.

I spent quite some work to call make_menu only when it's really needed. The
problem is the MenuStyle. If that changes you'd have to update all menus in
a single sweep.

??? Menus are never redrawn when mapped. make_menu is not called from
AddToMenu. That was the main goal of my work on make_menu.

void update_all_menus(void)
{
  MenuRoot *mr

  for (mr = Menus.all; mr; mr = MR_NEXT_MENU(mr))
    update_menu(mr);
}

This is just a hack, it traverses the list much mor often than it is
necessacry, but if you don't use hundreds of menus you can get away
with it for now.

I see no problem with the cursor only changing on the root.  It always
seemed to me that the window manager "owns" the root,  so I think this
would convey the feedback I was  looking for.  (Ie. the window manager
is busy.)

Sorry, my intent got lost somewhere here, yes of course you can compare
pointers.  What I didn't understand was the purpose of the == in the
first place.  It seems to just check if process is foo that I didn't
pass in arg as <pathto>/foo but just said foo again.  The whole reason
I brought it up was that this if doesn't do what I want and I was going
to have to add a couple of lines anyway to get the job done right, and I
was just trying to understand it all before I added my own fix.


In case your wondering for myself and about fifteen others that use my
binaries we run a script called fvwm2, that will make a copy of the
most current binary into fvwm2.$USER and almost all of us run M4.  The
problem is when they say restart I want the script fvwm2 to get run
not fvwm2.$USER, so my users won't have to exit to pick up the latest
binary.  And I can't just remove there binaries and replace them when I
recompile because fvwm2 crashes when the inode gets removed.

if we put the spec into the CVS tree as fvwm2.spec.in you can put all
the versioning stuff as variables and when you do the configure you'll
get a fvwm2.spec that has all the current values set to build your rpms.
But your right the best starting point is probabbly using an already
built srpm.

Note that the original statement "you sometimes  get no root menus and
can't do anything" does not reflect the current state of fvwm2.

I'm more concerned that "FvwmTalk" isn't working for you.

The tiny  box symptom indicates that  when FvwmForm issued the command
"Read  FormFvwmTalk.  quiet", that it  couldn't find the  file, or the
file   didn't  have    any   commands  in    it    that started   with
"*FormFvwmTalk.".  Is   there  a   file   with  that  name   in   your
"$sysconfdir" (/usr/local/etc/fvwm) or some place similar?

"FvwmTalk" and FvwmConsole do just  about  the same thing.  Which  one
you would use is mostly preference.

Does addining the switch "--original-arguments" or similar solve
your problem? If so, I will add it, so you can write:
  Restart --original-arguments fvwm2.3.3

You can suggest a shorter name for the switch.

Mikhael.

I never install fvwm with 'make install'. I have a script that copies the binaries.
And I link all that libexec/foo paths to ~/bin/fvwm2. I couldn't figure out where
to put the forms.

I wanted to say "no root menu, except the default one". I really need fvwm
command tool in the default menu, just to be able to Raise/Move windows,
Restart with a better configuration (Restart fvwm2 -f file) and so on.

I agree, but, personally, I like FvwmConsole more, because it has no
limitations of FvwmTalk (no history, no copy and paste etc.).

Mikhael.

Attached is a tiny context diff to libs/System.c for a patch to
getostype(), fixing a bug when compiled with gcc on Solaris (and
possibly other platforms as well) 

Also attached is the Changelog diff.

The patch was made to 2.2.2

Regards,

Tim.

I can see anyone on the workers list putting a command tool to use
this way, but surely not on a continuing basis?

Currently, FvwmTalk has paste, no copy.
FvwmTalk is slightly more new user friendly in that it has a help
form.

Don't take  these comments as  disagreement.  I'm not strongly against
"extra" things in the built-in menu.

Ok, if everyone happy with this name.

Recently I tried profiling fvwm hoping I could identify some places that
gobble up precious CPU time. I ran the core fvwm for about 15 minutes
while working as usual. Unfortunately fvwm used only 0.13 seconds of CPU :-)

Bye

Don't try to understand this. This was not final. I will remove the
entire "if" in the question. No need for special cases for "Restart wm".
I thought to leave this special case for backward compatibility, but there
are more problems with it than benefits. Also, if you noticed, the "if" in
the question affected only ones with session manager and not others.

Oh, your users run fvwm for so long that you are able to install a new
fvwm version between their restarts, right? :)
I will implement "Restart --pass-args fvwm2" soon.

This would be ok during startup, what I tried to do was: changing to
"busy" at the beginning of Done() (old wm) and change back at the 
end of StartupStuff() (new wm) - it would be difficult do a grab for
that. But the amount of time taken up by Done() is probably neglegible
anyway, so doing the grab only at startup time would be a good solution.
And we even have the hooks for it in place: we could simply add it to
the (Un)BlackoutWindow() functions.

Ooh.  Yes, that is definitely something we want to do.  I'll extract the

I could probabbly install several times between their restarts and
unless they are the ones complaining about some bug then it doesn't
matter to me when they restart.  For example one user has been logged
in 87 days, the X server has been running for 87 days and their fvwm2
has been running for 3 days (because that is when I upgraded the 2.2
instillation they all use).

It should go in /home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm/
i.e. the same dir as configure lib/ fvwm/ modules/ ...

Hm, I like Dan's reasoning that the pointer on the root window is sufficient.
Let's simply try it out. If we don't like the result we can do the more
complex solution with grabbing. BTW, I'd prefer the 'shuttle' cursor for
startup (I did mention that I don't like clocks/watches, didn't I :) ).

Just a thought here but what about folks that set the root cursor in
their init Function, won't the busy cursor blow it away or are you
somehow caching the cursor.  My init function does something like start
4 modules then run xsetroot to set the cursor.

Hmmm.  What about the debian package spec?  One for Stampede?  Solaris?
Would a 'packaging' subdirectory be a better idea?

well I know that rpm likes to have its spec file at the top level. I
know you can force it with a switch to look somewhere else in the source
tree, but I've had trouble with that in the past. as for the others I'm
not really sure I haven't tried the other Linux packiging systems yet,
and I gave up on Solaris packages a long time ago.

I have my preferences too, some of them, even I recognize as weird, but
the idea was to enhance user  feedback.

I think the clock or watch is the "right" default.

I assume there is a way to capture the current cursor, set by the user
and restore it.

My root cursor preference is xaniroc.

Agh, it's so easy! We can take the config file from fvwm95. I'm already

Description:

  Xemacs, which chooses a non-default TrueColor visual, no longer has an
  icon with the current state of fvwm in the CVS tree.  Only the text
  label of the icon shows up.  The default visual is 8-bit pseudocolor,
  the app runs with Truecolor.  Netscape's icon is also broken but at
  least displays (netscape also automatically chooses a TrueColor
  visual).  The transparent part isn't transparent, it just draws as
  black.

Repeat-By:
  Start fvwm, start xemacs 21.2b15, iconify it, examine missing
  icon

Mikhael, 
I found this in the ChangeLog:

        Removed all references to "-restore".

        (InitVariables): calling LoadWindowStates, LoadGlobalState only
        on Restarting.
 
Have you actually tried this with a session manager ?! I guess SM is
totally broken now. -restore was there for a reason, namely to give the
SM a way to tell fvwm what session to restore. You have removed that
part from the SmRestartCommand... LoadWindowStates and LoadGlobalState
must always be called with the filename received via -restore in order
to make SM work.

If something is broken, it will be restored.
I remember it was your suggestion to remove "-restore" option (file-name
is hardcoded to ~/.fvwm_restart) and determine Restarting in other way
(using _XA_WM_DESKTOP).

It seems logically. Is this really broken?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I suggested that -restore is not needed for restarting, I didn't 
mean that it should be removed completely.  

The session management protocol is very explicit about the fact that
a client is not allowed to reuse the last session save file, thus we can't
use a fixed name like ".fvwm_restart" for session saves. Instead we have
to use a fresh filename created via tempnam(). After creating this fresh
file fvwm (used to) tell the sm about the new file via SmRestartCommand.
(the last two arguments were "-restore" filename). the session manager
would then restart fvwm with the proper -restore argument.

The reason why we can't reuse the old file is that a session manager may
allow multiple named sessions and thus he is the only one who knows
if the old file is still be needed (eg xsm allows you to start session "foo"
and later save the current state as "bar").


Thus my proposal for reverting the changes is: 

Reintroduce -restore, set the restore_filename from the following arg,
and only override restore_filename to the fixed ".fvwm_restart" if 
we have determined (via _WM_DESKTOP) that we are "Restart"ing. Then call
LoadWindowStates() and LoadGlobalState() unconditionally. And don't forget
to reintroduce the last two arguments to SmRestartCommand.

Sorry :( This was a misunderstanding.

I will do this in the nearest time. And this time I will test that with a
session manager.

Hi!

Before it's too late (2.4) - but it is probably already - a request for 
2 enhancements:

1. A style option like IconForeground and IconBackground
My title fonts are white on a dark background when inactive, and black on
a
bright background when active.
The window borders are some sort of light grey, and when the icons are
unselected, reading the iconname is really a bit difficult. 
I've tried all sorts of color combinations to overcome this while still
preserving the general look and feel, and my "solution" is to use a
slightly
darker default background but have an additional bright pixmap for the
window
borders (there is no BorderStyle "color" or alike)
So a style to set the icon font colors and the icon background
colors, maybe even with an active/inactive option, would be nice.

2. This is more a "look" & eye-candy thing. 
Maybe there's no need for an enhancement, because it's already implemented
and
I'm just to dumb to figure it out.
My icons are displayed in a column along my right desk border, 
very NeXT like. 
If I deiconify one app, there is a gap in the column, and after a while
the
whole thing looks really messy, especially if the icons have different
heights, it's an eye sore.
I couldn't figure out up to now how to convince fvwm to automatically
rearrange
the icons and  fill these gaps. I had no luck with the icon manager
modules,
because they are  not transparent and they have borders etc. (or is there
a
way?) As I said, this is just a "look" thing. 

thanx & cheers,
amir

So for about two years, there's been this feature that I've wanted to
have working in FvwmIconMan. It was to have a single list of the
windows in my viewport and a second list of all the other windows.
This is referenced in the first paragraph of the manpage (well, I
inferred that I could have one of each at the same time...).

Anyway, I've finally written a patch that does this. To make it happen
I hacked handling of alias module names back into FvwmIconMan, and
then hijacked the function win_in_viewport to respond to two new
resolution types, "!desk" and "!page".

The trouble is, I think that this really isn't the Right Thing to do,
but given the way FvwmIconMan's designed, what I want to do (which I
think is pretty piddling) isn't really do-able without some major
redesign.

What do you think? I've dumped a copy of the patch at
http://www.best.com/~mikehan/iconman.diff

I have spend several hours to test and debug fvwm under a session manager
(I used gnome-session). I have fixed two small bugs, but this is not
enough. Here are some random notes on the subject.

1) I think, it must be in the man page that InitFunction/RestartFunction
must not include Exec's which map windows (like xterm, but xsetroot is ok)
if anyone wants to use a session manager.
Or probably new functions SessionInitFunc & SessionRestartFunc can be
executed if a session manager was detected.

2) There are problems with swallowed windows in FvwmButtons. They are
usually duplicated by the session manager and fvwm on the next start-up,
because they were unswallowed on the previous module exit. The solution
is either to not unswallow them (forcing Swallow (Close) if a session
manager detected) or to delay somehow swallowing by FvwmButtons. I am
not sure which is more correct here if at all.

3) SaveWindowStates sometimes produces wrong geometry, for example:
  [GEOMETRY] -1 -1 104 94 0 0 114 0 0 0    - for FvwmPager.
    must be: (0  0 104 94)
This causes my sticky pager to become invisible, he is on the page (1,1)
instead of the current (0,0). I use another pager to move it to (0,0) and
then close. This happens, of cause, without a session manager too.

4) Sometimes (on start-up) window flags are not restored.

5) Must fvwm have QuitSession command? Current Quit behaves very
unexpected creating troubles on the next start-up (fvwm is not started),
the cure is to switch to another WM (via gnomecc) and back.

Mikhael,
Regards.

What is the exact problem with these ?
If you are running a session manager, you shouldn't start apps via
the InitFunc anyway. The session manager is responsible for that.

Probably not. We should maybe add some documentation about the interaction
of Init/RestartFunc and SM to the FAQ.

Wow, unforeseen problem. I'll have to think about it a bit.

This is most likely due to my wrestling with C's mod() and div() functions.
I did stupid things there and didn't get around to fixing them yet. Maybe
you could have a look at it ? IIRC I had problems with negative coords
which I tried to solve by writing my own mod() surrogate.

No, users have to be educated not to use Quit if running under SM.
Using Quit under SM simply causes fvwm to leave the session which 
continues to run. You could instruct the SM to automatically restart fvwm
in this case...
It should btw already be possible to define QuitSession by Exec'ing
a commandline tool to control the SM (doesn't Gnome have something
like session-quit ?)

The problem is that I want to have one rc file, good for both running
inside a session and without it. Is it only me wanting this?

Yes, restarting seems to be more expected. At least there will not be
such bad situation, although it seems to be gnome bug here thinking WM is 
running (on the next start), when it is not.

I didn't find something similar. This works: killall gnome-session :)

I really should figure out how to tell rmail to add these...

OK, good point. Then Session versions of InitFunc and RestartFunc may
be a good way to achieve this.

Matthias, that doesn't work too well, I see the cursor flashing to the
watch for a tenth of a second or so and then it changes back to the X
before any windows or modules have started. I think the grab should
persist until all the modules have started. Don't know what we can do
about other apps.

Hi,

I just tried the latest CVS sources to check, whether the Restart
command works again - no luck.

Let me summarize the 3 different cases and their intended
semantics (as i understand it):

- "Restart" (without any arguments): Re-execute the currently
  running WM with current  configuration (save window states to
  file, pass all command line args)

- "Restart --pass-args /path/to/wm": Same as above, except
  argv[0] is replaced with "/path/to/wm"

-- "Restart /path/to/wm --some -more -args": Execute something
   completely different

So much for the theory. As far as I understand the current
sources, this is not exactly what is intended right now:

For Restart without any args it is seemingly not intended to pass
the command line parameters. People who use CPP- or
M4-preprocessing (guess what - I am one of them ;-) will end up
with a totally unusable fvwm, because without the "-cmd FvwmM4
/path/to/configuration", fvwm will either not find a
configuration file at all or will choke on it because it contains
preprocessor makros.

In the second case, it looks like the desktop state is not saved
- it probably would be useful if it was, because passing the same
command line args only makes sense if the executed WM also is
some incarnation of fvwm, which also should understand the
".fvwm_restart" file (if it is an older version, the presence of
the file at least shoulnd't do any harm)

I couldn't find out why, but currently, the "--pass-args" doesn't
seem to work at all: the wm is allways invoked without any
arguments. The only way to restart fvwm with the appropriate
arguments, is to explicitly is to explicitly give them all to the
3rd variant of "Restart" (which is not particularly elegant and
doesn't preserve the desktop state).

Regards,
            Peter

Dan, I noticed the fvwm-web directory is a subdirectory in the fvwm module.
This has the unpleasant side effect that the screenshots are updated every
time I update the sources. I think the module should be anchored one level
up in the directory structure like fvwm-cats is.

Another thing: does cvs know that these .gif aren't source code? It's
taking ages to do an update today and I'm wondering if the server is
trying to diff two revisions of a .gif.

Hmm...looks like I missed some mail.  I never saw the original of this.
If there was some other issue in the same mail, I missed it.
I'll see what I can do to move it.

If you do a "status -v",  you will see they were  all added with "-kb"
which I believe  marks them as binary.   I  think that would  stop CVS
from trying to manage these with diffs.

Comparing the 2 repositories,  I don't see a difference:

fork> cd ../fvwm-cats
fork> pg CVS/Repository  
/home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-cats
fork> cd ../fvwm-web
fork> pg CVS/Repository
/home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-web


Here's what I did the first time:

mkdir fvwm-web
cd fvwm-web
cvs -d :pserver:dane@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm import -m'create' \
  fvwm-web fvwm-web start

It responded:

No conflicts created by this import

cd somewherelse
cvs -d :pserver:dane@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm-web
cd fvwm-web
create first.file
cvs add -m'first file' first.file
cvs commit


If this isn't right, what should I be doing?

Looks exactly like what I have done to create fvwm-cats. Hm,
/home/cvs/fvwm is our root directory, so /home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-web
shouldn't be visible in the fvwm module. Jason, do you have any
idea what happened there? Did you change something in the CVS
setup lately?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I just did an "update" and a "commit".  I didn't see any activity in
fvwm-web.  Where are you seeing the problem?

Hrm, here at work a checkout doesn't touch fvwm-web, but at home it's
alwasy dumped into fvwm/fvwm-web. Is it possible that I checked out
fvwm-web into my source tree by accident and that it is updated every
time I do a checkout now? BTW, I can confirm the extremely long delays
before a gif is updated. It does indeed look as if CVS send the complete
file to compare it before doing the checkout. Cant't you tell CVS to
use only size and checksum?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

So: if you check out the fvwm-web sub-module in a subdirectory of the
master tree, it gets updated along with the master tree.

Solution: check it out in a separate directory, or delete it if you don't
want it.

DV> Did you change something in the CVS setup lately?

Nope, although I really need to move it to the new machine.

BTW, Dom, I think either your clock of your timezone is way off:

I just had FvwmIdent hang twice with this mornings CVS.
(Sometimes it works fine.)  Heres the dbx output:

(dbx) where

It seems to hang about 1 out of 10 times I invoke it.

I don't use the module everyday, so I can't say when this started.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello,

I have recently mad a perl script to produce a book (in .tex) from
the fvwm2 man pages (and the FAQ ...etc.).

I have noticed a few formatting misprints in fvwm2, Animate, Command, 
ConsoleC and Event manual pages. I have attached a tar.gz file which
contains patch for these misprints for the 2.2.2 version (some of
these misprints are also in the 2.3.3). 
IMVHO the fvwm2manpatch "need" to be applied: at one point the words
".fvwm2rc" does not appear on the formatting page (with e.g., xman of
XFree86-3.3.3.1 and man-1.5d-3); the same thing happen one time with 
".Xdefaults" (this is because these words are at the beginning of a line). 
One can found these misprints in the 2.3.3 version.
The others patches are mostly "cosmetical" ...

Yours, Olivier

Minor question here:  Why just the Restart command?  Why not expand
environment variables of form ${VAR} for all commands?  This would be
more orthogonal, wouldn't it?  We could keep the current behavior if
the curly braces are omitted to avoid breaking existing config files.

Anybody else have thoughts on this?

I have one instance of ${xxx} in Exec commands in my .fvwm2rc,
So I'm not crazy about the idea.
Can't say what caused my to go that way:

Exec set -A back 1 E I 8 9;rxvt -pixmap ${back[`random 5`]}

(Random pixmap backgrounds in rxvt's.)

But then I'm not really sure of the rules of {} vs. () if there are any.

What other commands do you expect to expand $VAR? I can think about
*Path commands, but they already do this.

This is strange. I also use parameters for fvwm2.

Right, I am still not sure if the second one must be like the first or the
third.

Please check your configuration, is it really Restart without arguments
or is it "Restart fvwm2"? Everything works for me as described in the man
page.

I will think about creating .fvwm_restart for all cases.
Actually, under a session manager the desktop state must already be
restored in all 3 cases (if wm supports this). But there are still some 
bugs.

It always worked for me, and now even the last two work (all equivalent):
  Restart --pass-args fvwm2
  Restart --pass-args ~/bin/fvwm2
  Restart ~/bin/fvwm2 -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc++

Can you check this again?
If the parameters really get lost, can you please add this to main():
  vprintf("[FVWM ARGS]: %s %s %s\n", argv);

and check when exactly they get lost. Thank you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK.  Here are some:

1.  Exec, Read, and PipeRead can use variables like $HOME very easily.

2.  .xsession file (or whatever it is that starts up fvwm2) can use
    environment variables for saving fvwm2 "state" information (last
    decor selected, etc.).

3.  .xsession file (ibid) can call xdpyinfo and parse out the current
    screen dimensions and/or depth (I know that these are available if
    you use FvwmM4; I'm just giving an example where such things may
    be useful).

4.  Probably more uses than you or I can think of right now, since
    users tend to use features like these in ways that we never have
    dreamed possible.  [smile]

Why not allow \$ or $$ to precede things that shouldn't get parsed?
This is what the shell and make do, respectively.

No, AFAIK, Exec or ReadPipe are different in that they pass the string to
the shell as is, while ImagePath or Restart do not.

man sh :) Actually, some of the shell ${VAR} sub-syntax can be implemented
in libs/envvar.* if there are requests.

OK, you shamed me into RTFMing.  I'm  a ksh user, so  I man ksh'd.  So
thats the difference...  (I look these things up when  I need to know.
Then it leaves my mind completely.)

So  we could do  some of this expansion in  libs/envvar.*, but we sure
couldn't deal with my example above.  Assuming we  don't want to break
existing config  files, doing   automatic  variable expansion  on  all
commands doesn't look like an idea whose time has come.

These e-mail discussions can  get confusing.   Mikhael, I don't  think
you proposed that we do  automatic expansion, in fact  I think you are
pointing out why we  can't same as me.   I think  Larry is asking  why
not.

So,  to answer the  e-mail  from Larry,  "$$" or "\$"  would work, but
existing config files would be broken.  I  sometimes think this is OK,
especially  when I  can  imagine a  sed  script  or some other  simple
mechanism  that could automatically  move  a config  file forward.  In
this case, I don't think that would be so easy.

Ah, I see, you pointed out that this will break *your* config file.
Anyway, this was an answer mainly to Larry. Exec must not do any parsing.

Shamed? No way. I executed "man sh" and read about the syntax, then I
wrote you to try too. I am tcsh and bash user and don't remember this,
because there is a man page which is a much better storage then my head.

I noticed this yesterday at first.
The fastest way to reproduce this is to bind it, say, to Alt-Shift-F10.

  Key F10 A SM Module FvwmIdent

Focus a window and hold Alt-Shift-F10 for a second (not more!).
Some of the open FvwmIdent's will be broken (destroy them).

There is a problem with the binding itself (this is an old problem).
FvwmIdent must not be closed on key releasing (only on pressing),
otherwise keyboard binding with modifiers will not be usable.

Regards,
Mikhael.

When compiling fvwm 2.2.2, egcs reports...

FvwmForm.c: In function `ReadXServer':
FvwmForm.c:1343: warning: comparison is always 0 due to limited range of

This is because line 1343 is this:
             (buf[0] >= 160)) {         /* regular or intl char */
 
and buf is defined as
  static char buf[10], n; 

this should probably be 'static unsigned char buf[10];'.

Matthias, autorising icon titles and moving icons doesn't play nicely
together. I tried to fix it but couldn't. Here are some instructions
to show the problem.

 1) Create a window wit a long icon title (e.g. netscape).
 2) Iconify it.
 3) Move the mouse over the icon. The title is expanded. The new icon size
    is not reflected in the pager (this is correct so far).
 4) Now drag the icon with the mouse, release the button and make sure
    you don't move the mouse afterwards.
 5) Now the icon title is collapsed again, but the pager got the wrong idea
    of the icon's size and now draws it as wide as the expanded title was.

The problem I see is that the width of the expanded title is really set
in the window structure. It should never be broadcast anywhere. Any ideas
how to fix it?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Thanks for the effort. Could you please make a patch for 2.3.3 or preferably
for one of the current development snapshots? The will most likely be no
2.2.3 release since we are closing in on 2.4 now.

Thank you and Bye

This topic comes up once in a while and each time I tend towards one
or the other. But there are a few reasons why we should not allow it:

 - It's a rich source of future problems. The quoting we have now is
   hell. Why make it even more complicated.

 - There is little gain in usability. People who are trying to use
   environment variables in their config file are most likely capable
   of writing a simple shell script.

 - There is not the slightest gain in functionality. Modern shells
   are incredibly versatile tools. They can do parsing so much better
   than a window manager ever will (even the infamous POSIX ksh ;-) ).
   The philosophy of the UNIX command line is to have small tools that
   can do a limited task well and to combine them to get the desired
   result. Why should the window manager try to replace them all?

 - One reason for allowing shell scripts in the config file that came
   up in the past was being able to have the complete configuration
   in a single file. But we have already abandoned that path.

Hah! I can't hold back, I must brag with my knowledge of shell syntax
(without reading man page. Really!):

  ${foo} is replaced by the value of the environment variable foo. There
         are much more complicated things you can do inside ${}, depending
         on the shell (If you had seen the addres book shell script I wrote
         for zsh you'd know what I mean ;-)

  $(foo) is replaced by the stdout of the command foo (same a back quotes)

  $[foo] is replaced by the arithmetic value of the expression foo.
         E.g. $[1+2] is replaced by 3.

8-)

Hello,
OK, I have take the cvs. Maybe I need one week to do a good job: since
you seem interested I will do a new check for formatting misprints
(via my manpages2book.pl).
Yours, Olivier

PS1: Do not worry I will not try to correct english misprint :o)  

PS2: I follow the instruction to get the cvs tree. When I run
autoreconf, automake says "install-sh, mkdirinstall, missing, file
not found". Is this normal ?
(After I took the above files from 2.3.3 and every things run ok).

Hi,

the more I am experimenting around, the less I know what is going
on: whatever makes my command line disappear obviously happens
nodeterministically from time to time, while at other times 10
times in a row everything works as it is supposed to. In those
cases when the arguments get lost, fvwm is really called without
args - the vprintf put at the beginning of main then says:

[FVWM ARGS]: /usr/local/X11/bin/fvwm2.3.4 (null) PWD=/

.. I'll let you know as soon as I know more

Regards,
           Peter

Yes. You have to run automake with the '--add-missing' option first.
It will then generate the necessary files.

I'll have to look at the code.

I haven't got xemacs 21.2b15 but xemacs 21.0 works fine.  It doesn't
provide an icon pixmap but an icon bitmap,  I tried to get xemacs to use
a truecolor visual but it refused with the error message:

Invalid Depth specification in TrueColor... ignoring...

(I ran it with xemacs -visual TrueColor, I have an 8 bit Pseudo default
and just one other visual: a 24 bit TrueColor). What depth is your
Truecolor visual?  If xemacs works with any other window manager is the
icon in color or monochrome?

I made some changes to the icon code on the 10th June 1999, is your
version of fvwm before or after this date?

Cheers,
Tim.

if you have a de-iconify function put:

All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

into it.  You may have to experiment with using CurrentPage in the
parentheses if you use virtual pages. It will also forget the fact that
you may have moved an icon manually.

Thats cool, but can you forget it completely to make room for some new
stuff?

Actually, this is with ksh:

fork> echo $[2+2]    
$[2+2]
fork> echo $((2+2))
4

(No, I didn't have the $(( )) memorized.)

I'm not sure what we're arguing about but the above applies to the
current method of doing gradient menus i.e. with a Vgradient you won't
know how many colors to allocate unless you know the height of your
tallest menu.

I think we have diverted from the topic here.

I can see the point about not wanting to break existing config files,
but I really thought that it would be nice to have "variables" within
fvwm2 to provide for stuff other than home directory pointers, etc.

For instance, button bars are very popular, but some people would like
them to occupy the {top,bottom,left,right} side of the screen.  Without
hard-coding the width or height of the screen into the .fvwm2rc file,
this cannot be done without FvwmM4.

Actually, I had wanted this feature for a while in FvwmButtons and
FvwmIconMan.  I've stopped attempting this, and have gone back to using
(and now maintaining) tkgoodstuff, which can "stretch" if desired.

Dominik was correct in that adding variables may increase complexity
for little gain, so I remove my suggestion.

However....!

How about something to simply achieve the affect I had been trying to
get:  a button bar that "stretches" to take available width/height.

Something like:

# Have FvwmButtons be as wide as the screen:
*FvwmButtonsExpand	horizontal

# Have FvwmButtons be as tall as the screen:
*FvwmButtonsExpand	vertical

# Have FvwmButtons use its existing geometry calculations (default)
*FvwmButtonsExpand	none

I have thought a bit yersterday about a possible solution.
It is nice to have fvwm internal variables (not environmental), which can
be expanded on every command. The problem is to choose a good syntax not
to break things. Maybe this:

To assign variable:
  set var "string"
  set var $env_var

On any command %{var} will be expanded.
  set var3 "%{var1}, %{var2}"
  MenuStyle "*" Background %{MY_BACK_COLOR}
  *FvwmButtonsBack %{MY_BACK_COLOR}

%{%} can be expanded into % for the rare cases to escape %{ sequence.

The problem with this is that advanced users very soon will want a much
more compicated syntax, like:
  if (%{var1} == "left") set var1 "right"

and so on...
Fvwm configuration language is one-line oriented and not good for such
things, it is more a documentation language, not a programming language.
For example, scwm uses scheme (much like lisp), which is a very powerful,
(but difficult for most users) language. It is not less powerful than any
shell language despite of the last Dominik's comment.

What do you think, may adding 'set' command and expanding fvwm
variables be a good start? This can help peoples writing non-hardcoded or
themable configurations without preprocessing.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think you really should use a preprocessor for handling variables. 
They really are much better than fvwm will ever be.  For instance I run
FvwmButtons that is 25% of the width of the screen, I specify it's size
with FvwmM4 thus:

*FvwmButtonsFrame 2
*FvwmButtonsGeometry -0-0
*FvwmButtonsPadding 0 0
*FvwmButtonsColumns 5
m4_define(BOXSIZE,m4_eval(WIDTH/20-4))m4_dnl 5 boxes per quarter screen
*FvwmButtons(4x1 Frame 0 Swallow gbuffy "Exec gbuffy")
*FvwmButtons(1x4 Size BOXSIZE BOXSIZE Swallow asclock "Exec asclock")
*FvwmButtons(4x3 Swallow FvwmPager "FvwmPager 0 3")

I can switch screen resolution and it always works.

Just putting variables into fvwm won't help me unless you also include
equation evaluation, in which case you might as well use SCWM. I would
rather fvwm not do variables at all rather than do them poorly.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think you hit the nail on the head.  If you start adding programming
constructs to the configuration language, where do you stop?  Why not go
all the way and use scwm?  Or go half-way and use the existing
preprocessed config files?

I think Dominik made the point that even just _expanding_ variables adds a
lot of complexity for little gain.  I would have to agree.

I remain skeptical.  I think the onus is on the proposer to demonstrate
what value variables add, as opposed to using a pre-processor.

I agree.

I believe   Larry  withdrew his  variable  suggestion.   Larry's  last
suggestion was to be able to have FvwmButtons expand.  (No variables.)

I think thats consistent with our goal of removing extraneous modules.
The    expansion is  one  reason  FvwmButtons   is not an  FvwmTaskBar
replacement.

Ah yes, ksh. A 'decent' shell doesn't need these double-parentheses :-)
(And no, I'm not sure if there are other shells than zsh which use
braces).

Why don't you simply use the 'Maximize' command?

  Next (FvwmButtons) Maximize 100 0

Note that FvwmButtons doesn't resize too well with lots of buttons since the
buttons are all the same width/height. So if you have 70 rows (I have), the
width is always a multiple of 70 pixels.

What is so horrible about preprocessing? Just allowing all these fancy
stuff in the config file doesn't make it more user friendly (see 'quoting').
Or would you like to have to remember a syntax like %{foo}? It's much more
likely that you know how to use a C preprocessor.

This is dumb. Would anyone complain if some buttons were 1 pixel
wider/taller than others after they had resized it.

I've been thinking about the current scheme of fvwm sharing graphics
contexts with modules and I think we should axe it before 2.4.  It's too
difficult to change a lot of the modules, it's not supported by Xlib and
it forces fonts to be shared as well as colors.

To replace it I propose the following:

1) fvwm continues to send a Default_Graphics config line to each modules
but the line will just contain the visualID and colormap that fvwm is
using.

2) fvwm manages a linked list of colorsets that starts with two members:
Colorset 0 is the same as DefaultColors, Colorset 1 is the same a
HilightColor.

3) A new command "Colorset" (or is it "ColorSet"?) can add to the list
or modify existing colorsets. The syntax is:

Colorset n fg bg [background_type [args]...]

n is the colorset number, fg and bg are either colors or - which means
no change, background_type is the same as the DefaultBackground command.

4) The colorsets are dumped to modules with their configuration and as
they are modified if the modules has selected dynamic configuration
updates.

5) Some library function to be written to grok these Colorset config
lines and manage a copy of the linked list of colorsets in each module.

6) Additional module config commands to be added to each module to
enable them to use the colorsets (e.g. *FvwmPagerWindowColorsets 2 3).

7) (optional) add colorset access to fvwm's menu and border code.


A Colorset structure would be:
typedef struct cset *Colorset;
typedef struct cset {
  Colorset next;
  Pixel foreground;
  Pixel relief;
  Pixel shadow;
  XID background;
  unsigned int number : 4;
  Bool bg_pixmap : 1;
  Bool bg_keep_aspect : 1;
  Bool bg_stretch_x : 1;
  Bool bg_stretch_y : 1;
  unsigned int bg_width : 12;
  unsigned int bg_height : 12;
};

Each colorset would take 48 bytes, there would be up to 16 of them and
they could handle pixmaps as large as 4095x4095 (which should be OK for
about 5 years).

Any objections?
Any volunteers?

Cheers,
Tim.

I don't think so, but I've no idea how many places would have to be changed.
Probably all size calculations depend on the assumption that all buttons
have the same size.

I can't remember most of the discussion either, but consider this:

  MenuStyle * MenuFace BGradient 20 colour1 colour2

Both colours are close together and I'm using a 16 bit display, making
it even worse. The tile is 20x20 pixels and the menu is 200x600 pixels.
With the current code I get a gradient consisting of 20 diagonal bars.
The gradient isn't very smooth, but it's acceptable if you don't expect
much. But if we would stretch by a factors of 10 and 30 you will not
get bars but ugly blocks. In the end I wouldn't use gradients on my 16
bit display any more (Or I would have to use much more colours that
would get th same pixel values, just to get the diagonal bars right).

This seems to work a treat:

AddToMenu Module-PopUp "&4. Icon Auto Arrange" Module FvwmEvent IconArrange
*IconArrange deiconify "All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow"

We've  had a number of  requests for this feature,  and I keep putting
the requests  off.  This seems  to be the  same as enhancement request
124.  Without any  icon sorting.  Any reason this  can't be offered as
the solution?

Tim wouldn't we want to inlude fonts here as well, I thought the idea was to mirror the effect of CDE?

There is no way an application can provide an icon pixmap, short of 
providing an icon window and do the drawing itself. The ICCCM only
supports bitmap icons.

It may be true that fvwm wouldn't choke on a pixmap instead of a bitmap,
but from an ICCCM point of view, apps relying on that are broken.

To do (must):

 1) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).
 2) Add screen shots to web page.
    [in progress]
 7) Create an I18N fvwm package (from 2.2 or so).
 8) Add an explanation about the various packages and where to
    discuss them to the web page.
    (stable, unstable (alpha), snapshots, ftp source tree, CVS).
 9) Set up RPM packages.
    [in progress]

To do (optional)

 6) Remove several configure options.
 10) Remove 'PopupAsRootMenu' menu style (?).
     [comments wanted]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [comments wanted]
 12) Set up bzip2 tarballs.
 13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.
     [in progress]

Fixes (high priority):

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
 15) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)

Dominik, I don't really know what to do about the clock disappearing too
early. I have already put the UngrabPointer as late as possible (at the end
of StartupStuff). It seems the initial apps come up after StartupStuff has
ended.

You can make the pager representation of the icon shrink again by
moving it in the pager... but never mind, I just committed a 
one-character (!) fix to avoid the problem. If we want to protect against
its later reapearance, we should change all broadcasts of icon geometries
to use icon_p_width instead of icon_w_width. I have done this only
in move_resize.c for now.

The solution as it stands is close enough for me.

I inserted that line, build again.. and guess what.

It seems I can't reproduce the "bug" anymore. Maybe I forgot to "make
install" or did something else very stupid when I had the problem.

It  looks like fvwm2  no longer accepts  "xbm"  (X11 bitmaps) files as
icons.

I don't know much about FvwmEvent (it took me about 3 solid minutes of
looking at these two lines to (I think) figure out what they do :) but I
don't understand why we're invoking a whole Module operation here.

Why can't we do what Tim suggested, and just put that into a function
for deiconify?

What does the FvwmEvent module invocation give you?

Nothing.

Sorry, I didn't parse Tim's mail too well.

Eterm sets the icon window hint instead of the icon pixmap hint as would
be correct. I have reported this to E.

The Eterm bug seems to be fixed already. I tries transparent rxvts with
afterstep and icewm. with icewm they don't work well either (the border is
transparent too), with afterstep it works, but the background does not move
while the window is moved.

That's because Eterm tells fvwm which window to use instead of an icon.
Usualy applications use their own icon windows if they want to draw into
the icon themselves (like biff or xterm with an active icon). So the
(in my eyes) proper behaviour for fvwm is to always honour this hint.
But Eterm enforces its icon in this way instead of giving a icon
pixmap hint instead. I consider this an Eterm bug. However you can
change the icon with the --icon option to Eterm.

> In addition to that, the Eterm icon jumps around occasionally.

Never seen that.

> BTW, everything worked fine in the 1.May snapshot of 2.3.2.

Yes, the code changed back and forth a couple of times.

I don't see this bug with current CVS and Eterm 0.8.9. Either Eterm or
fvwm must have been fixed (we did something with configure events).

Thanks. I've fixed the 'dump in post 2.2.2 code. There was no problem in

No, after looking at the ICCCM again I see that this is okay. But then
there's no way to make Eterm users and xterm users happy at the same
time.

I just read that GNOME WM-specs might undergo some revisions and they
need feedback from wm developpers.

Maybe you could check it out:

Yes, you're right. I've looked at the code and I don't know wither.
Seems the watch make sense only with a slow machine :-) Perhaps
we should note in the man page that the startup cursor can not be changed.

It took me two minutes to get the large icon representations again :(
But don't worry, I've already made a patch.

In progress:

 2) Add screen shots to web page.
    [in progress; Dan]
 9) Set up RPM packages.
    [in progress; Jason]
 15) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)
     [in progress; Mikhael, Matthias]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
     [in progress; Dominik]
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [in progress; Dominik]
 40) Investigate bug #394. (Overlapping pages)
     [in progress; Dominik]
     [most likely an X server bug]

To do (must):

 1) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).
 7) Create an I18N fvwm package (from 2.2 or so).
 8) Add an explanation about the various packages and where to
    discuss them to the web page.
    (stable, unstable (alpha), snapshots, ftp source tree, CVS).

To do (optional)

 6) Remove several configure options.
 10) Remove 'PopupAsRootMenu' menu style (?).
     [comments wanted]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [comments wanted]
 12) Set up bzip2 tarballs.

Fixes (high priority):

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
 17) Fix the bug that causes icons to lose management (bug #352).
 19) Try to reproduce that KFM windows stay on top of normal fvwm windows.
     [reported by Andrew Morton <morton@nortelnetworks.com> on 16-May-1999]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
 38) Investigate bug #389. (StartsOnDesk does not work)
 41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).
 42) Get bitmap icons working again.

Fixes (optional):

 30) Fix the broken size hints of FvwmWinList (in fvwm itself).
     [reported by Dan, verified by me (Dominik)]
 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
     [reported by me (Dominik)]
 32) Several applications are reported to not resize well under fvwm
     (Datek's "Streamer", CodeWarrior).

Testing:

 33) Test the GNOME patches.
 34) Run the purify script again (and update it).
 35) Test the strokes patch.
 36) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)
 
=====

Done:

 3) Add link to fvwm cats page to web page.
 4) Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5) Update the links on our home page.
 13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.
 18) Check if there are still growing windows as reported for 2.13.
     [bug #184 reported by Michael Hughes <mhughes@bridge.com>]
     [no, doesn't happen for 2.2 and up]
 20) Check why no icon can be set for Eterm.
     [reported on 8-May-1999 by Amir Chossrow Akhavan <amir@phy.ucsf.EDU>]
     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 24) Investigate bug #314.
     [fixed]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
     [fixed]
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.
     [fixed in 2.2.3, no bug in 2.3.4]
 29) Fix the pager bugs I reported recently.
 37) Fix interaction of moving with autoraising icon titles.
     [fixed]
 39) Investigate bug #390
     [fixed]

Bye

This happens from time to time. I'll close the bug report then.

My, there are more updates than bugs :-)

In progress:

 2) Add screen shots to web page.
    [in progress; Dan]
 9) Set up RPM packages.
    [in progress; Jason]
 15) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)
     [in progress; Mikhael, Matthias]
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [in progress; Dominik]

To do (must):

 1) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).
 7) Create an I18N fvwm package (from 2.2 or so).
 8) Add an explanation about the various packages and where to
    discuss them to the web page.
    (stable, unstable (alpha), snapshots, ftp source tree, CVS).

To do (optional)

 6) Remove several configure options.
 10) Remove 'PopupAsRootMenu' menu style (?).
     [comments wanted]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [comments wanted]
 12) Set up bzip2 tarballs.

Fixes (high priority):

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
 17) Fix the bug that causes icons to lose management (bug #352).
 19) Try to reproduce that KFM windows stay on top of normal fvwm windows.
     [reported by Andrew Morton <morton@nortelnetworks.com> on 16-May-1999]
     [may be the same as 22/bug #290]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
 41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).
     [confirmed by me (Dominik)]
 42) Get bitmap icons working again.

Fixes (optional):

 30) Fix the broken size hints of FvwmWinList (in fvwm itself).
     [reported by Dan, verified by me (Dominik)]
 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
     [reported by me (Dominik)]
 32) Several applications are reported to not resize well under fvwm
     (Datek's "Streamer", CodeWarrior).

Testing:

 33) Test the GNOME patches.
 34) Run the purify script again (and update it).
 35) Test the strokes patch.
 36) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)
 
=====

Done:

 3) Add link to fvwm cats page to web page.
 4) Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5) Update the links on our home page.
 13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.
 18) Check if there are still growing windows as reported for 2.13.
     [bug #184 reported by Michael Hughes <mhughes@bridge.com>]
     [no bug; doesn't happen for 2.2 and up]
 20) Check why no icon can be set for Eterm.
     [reported on 8-May-1999 by Amir Chossrow Akhavan <amir@phy.ucsf.EDU>]
     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
     [fixed]
 24) Investigate bug #314.
     [fixed]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
     [fixed]
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.

 39) Investigate bug #390
     [fixed]

Move this to in progress:

   [in progress; Dan]

This is the NEWS entry:

* Fvwm2 is GNOME compliant.

This is the man page content:

.SH GNOME COMPLIANCE
\fIFvwm2\fP attempts to be GNOME compliant.  Check http://www.gnome.org for
what that may mean. GNOME support is an
installation option.


If any Gnomers on the list would like to expand on this,
you can send me mail or patches, or point me to a URL.

It seems to me, we should state the release of the GNOME standard we
support, and the things we don't support or support in an unusual way
(similar to our ICCCM documentation.)

OK, I've done some picking at the spec file that David Frye uploaded.
(After figuring out cpio, that is.  Why on earth cpio instead of tar?)
There are some interesting things there that I wasn't aware of.

First, there's a small patch which amazingly doesn't touch any code.  (I
guess they didn't feel the need any more.)  Changes:

location of perl in FvwmConsoleC.pl
Remove various items from the system.fvwm2rc that don't ship with RedHat.
Nuke the remote-logins popup from system.fvwm2rc (which I think is dumb
  anyway).
Remove most of the other WM choices from the Restart menu
This hunk from configure.in:

-FVWM_MODULEDIR='${libexecdir}/${PACKAGE}/${VERSION}'
+FVWM_MODULEDIR='${libexecdir}'

That's it for the patch; it's all reasonable for RedHat's situation except
for the last bit, which some folks might have issues with.

There is an included tarball of 'compat-icons'; the content listing of that
archive is at the end.  I don't remember if there were reasons why removed
these.

They distribute icons that seem to be from 2.0.46; most of them are in the
CVS tree but some aren't.  A list of those is also at the end.  And note
that we name mini icons like "mini.arch.xpm" while they replace '.'  with
'-'.  In the list below, I have made their names confirm to ours for the
purposes of finding which ones are really missing.  I also don't understand
why they choose to include some icons in both the compat and regular icon
tarballs under different names.

The icon issues are rather important; they prevent us from providing a
drop-in replacement for the RedHat package.  Does anyone know how Debian
deals with this?  Particularly the fact that we removed some icons should
be an issue.

Can you send me your fvwm configuration file please? Try as I might,
I can't duplicate this with mine.

Is it possible to find out if there are any pending functions (paused on
a Wait)? If there is you could move the ungrab pointer to the event
looop and only do it if there are no pending functions.  This would
allow users to put a Wait in their InitFunction.

Cheers,

If a client de-iconifies itself the FvwmEvent solution will work.

I think there may be problems with this as a solution: I'm not sure what
state you lose with RecaptureWindow; and I had an email saying this
doesn't work well if you use (CurrentPage Iconic), I don't use virtual
pages so I can't easily test this.

Tim.

The old problem. Personally I don't care if all applications have started
before reverting the cursor, but it would be nice if at least the modules
would tell fvwm that they have reached their main loop.

Well, if you don't want to make this patch (ok by me), why don't we
explain how to do it in the man page (e.g. by hinting at the FAQ)?

Matthias, can you look after this? I still can't build FvwmGtk.

Hello,
I have installed libstroke and compile the "last" cvs
(Strokes support : yes). Then strokes_test works very well.
So, following the fvwm2 man page I add this at the 
end of my .fvwm2rc

Mouse Mouse 2 R A - 
Stroke 14789 2 A A WindowList 

Unfortunately, this does not work and Mouse 2 R give me
the default button menu ... I try a number of config but
do not succeed to obtain something

Sorry if I have misunderstand something

gcc -Wall generated a warning in FvwmAnimate.c that there was no prototype
for time(). I have included "time.h", but I'm not sure if there is a
portability issue.

I wanted to duck the issue of fonts.  I don't want this to get in the
way of the I18N patch and I wanted to make it simple enough that it
stood a chance of happening.  Hacking modules to make them capable of
font changing on the fly could be very difficult but hacking them to
change pixel values and do a refresh sounds a bit more practical.

If this gets the go-ahead and the modules get changed then we can think
about fonts.

Cheers,
Tim.

  tp> if you have a de-iconify function put:

Hmm.  I tried this with the latest CVS as of about an hour ago and it
gives _really_ odd results.  Maybe I did it wrong.  I did this:

  AddToFunc Iconify-and-Compact
  +       "C" Iconify
  +       "C" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

  Mouse 2   I   A   Function Iconify-and-Compact

Ouch.  What happens is everything seems more-or-less normal until the
first time I use the function (click mouse-2 on an icon), then it goes
to heck.

After that, every new window that's created is created iconified by
default.  This persists until I restart fvwm2.

Also after this happened I got some other weird effects.  Once I tried
to raise my Emacs GNUS frame (using a key in Emacs) and the window frame
appeared but the contents were never refreshed.  Emacs was running OK,
though, it wasn't hung.  I tried moving the window, iconify/deiconify,
redraw, etc. and nothing fixed it; I had to restart fvwm2 to see the
contents.

They can do it but the pixmap has to use the default visual and colormap
since there is no way of querying a pixmap to find the visual it uses
(you can't do XGetWindowAttributes on it, all you can do is
XGetGeometry).

Netscape does it fine even when the root is PseudoColor and Netscape
uses an TrueColor.

Tim.

This sounds like quite a nasty bug, can you fix it?

Ah, yes, this is a problem I noticed as well after I wrote the man page. The
problem is that '-' is supposed to disable a particular binding, but it
actually didn't work for me. So, the only way I can disable a binding is by
doing this:

Mouse 2 R A

the empty action will disable the binding as well. I am assuming the doubling
of the Mouse command is due to cut-and-paste. :)

btw, you do have to press button on the root to 'draw' the strokes.

I got the same effect from FvwmEvent.
It seemed too weird to be a bug.

Another weird thing in the latest CVS:

I have a button defined like this:

  (Icon n/netscape.xpm, Title Netscape, \
          Action (Mouse 1) 'Exec "Netscape" exec netscape', \
          Action (Mouse 2) 'Exec ns-start "`wxpaste`"', \
          Action (Mouse 3) 'Exec ns-start "`wxpaste`" ,new-window')

The netscape.xpm pixmap has only 14 colors, but when it appears the
colors are all screwed up.  The weird thing is I use other pixmaps
(although with less than 14 colors) and they all appear correctly.  I am
definitely not out of colors (yes, I ony have an 8-bit display, but the
buttonbar is essentially the first app to come up and so there are
plenty of colors available--also I can display that same pixmap using
sxpm after startup and it appears just fine).

I don't have a ColorLimit defined in my .fvwm2rc, either.

Any ideas?  Do you need a screenshot?

To   "improve"  the user   configuration   process, Colorlimit  is now
automatic on 8 bit displays.  Use "Colorlimit 0" to turn it off.

I can by that logic, I guess I didn't consider what could happen to a
layout if you went around changing the fonts, so your right just colors
make sense for now.

You have my vote.

Automatically set to what value?

And, why isn't this documented in the man page ;)?

  ...

Ah, yes, setting "ColorLimit 0" fixed it alright.  I'm not sure of the
utility of this improvement, myself :).

This  command only  makes sense  on screens that display a
limited number of colors at  once.
If your  display can display  more
than 2 million colors at once, this command is ignored.
Screens that only display 256 colors at once are known as
8 bit displays.
The 2 million color cutoff point corresponds to 21 bit color,
the most common screen that exceeds this limit would be 24 bit.

On 8 bit displays, the default color limit is set to the size of
the built in table, (about 60).  We recommend that you start with the
default value, and not include this command in your .fvwm2rc.

For you or I, I would rate it as useless, and possibly a bother.

(Except that I now have access to both 8 and 24 bit color systems
and I am still avoiding CPP and M4.)

I was hoping for the average user, they wouldn't even notice.
Therefore, we would never get one of those problem reports,
"fvwm is eating all my colors".

Yes that works very well, I appology because it was some where in the
archive ... I have noted that Modifier does not seem to work.
So for me context need to be R and the modifier need to be A and
evreythings seems to be great : my touch pad become a "pallet" !

A thing that it will be find to have is (esspecially for a touchpad) :
Stroke sequence M A M Function
i.e., Alt+mouse-move will work everywhere.

Many Thanks, Olivier.

Hmm... that's not there when I say "man fvwm2".  I guess my man page
isn't getting installed somewhere that man is looking when I run make
install.  Ho hum, I'm off to check my MANPATH.

I guess so.  It doesn't bother me all that much now that I know about it
;).

Subject: Iconify-and-Compact function wreaks havoc

Full_Name: Paul Smith
Version: 2.3.4
CVS_Date: 23-Jun 10am EDT
OS: Solaris 2.5.1
X_Server: X11R6.3
Submission from: (NULL) (192.32.138.39)
Submitted by: psmith


Tim Phipps suggested a cool idea for allowing the deiconify
operation to reorder the remaining icons, compacting them.
I implemented it like this:

  AddToFunc Iconify-and-Compact
  +       "C" Iconify
  +       "C" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

  Mouse 2   I   A   Function Iconify-and-Compact

However, now after the first time I deiconify with mouse-2,
_every_ new window created thereafter is created in an iconified
state.

Maybe the StartIconic flag gets set in all new windows, somehow?
No clue.

Of course they can do it ... and hope that the wm is as clever as fvwm
in dealing with this. I just wanted to make clear that the description
of WM_HINTS in the ICCCM says: (putting on my ICCCM hat again)

The icon_pixmap field may specify a pixmap to be used as an icon. The
pixmap should be: 

* One of the sizes specified in WM_ICON_SIZE...

* 1-bit deep... 

Later on I find: 

Clients that need more capabilities from the icons than a simple 
two-color bitmap should use icon windows.

     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]

Does this spec file still apply the FVWMDIR patch? It restores the
FVWMDIR variable for use in FvwmCpp and FvwmM4. The spec file from
fvw2-2.2-1, the latest RPM I found (in contrib.redhat.com) was
applying it, I suppose to support AnotherLevel.

Also, does --prefix=/usr/X11R6 or /usr/local?

Fixed.

The isIconicState variable was not properly reset before mapping
a new window. It was set upon RecaptureWindow and then used for all new
windows until is was set by the next RecaptureWindow. It's a two-line
fix in HandleMapRequestKeepRaised (events.c).

Hello,

I do not think that the changes mad in fvwm2.1 about Stroke are the good
one. At least this does not work on my machine. The following patch give 
some thing that works good one my machine (and I think on the machine 
of Ke Huang). Moreover, I change the examples to more natural examples 
(for me).Of course it is only a humble proposition since I have not take 
any look on the code (I experiment cvs to ...).

Yours, Olivier

I don't think so; all I see is what I mentioned.  Other than the system
fvwm2rc changes there's just the change to FVWM_MODULEDIR.

MH> Also, does --prefix=/usr/X11R6 or /usr/local?

ENOPARSE, but perhaps this will answer your question:

%build
CFLAGS="$RPM_OPT_FLAGS" ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --enable-extras \
        --libexecdir=\${prefix}/lib/X11/fvwm2   \
        --sysconfdir=/etc/X11/fvwm2
make

>From Linus' Q&A session at USENIX:

What Desktop do you Use 

I can feel the flames coming... My current desktop is fvwm2 which is like
saying "Okay, I have the horsepower to run something better because I have
machines that most hackers have wet dreams about." But I still just decided
that fvwm2 is what I need and I subscribe to the tenant that small really
is beautiful. I've seen some of the enlightenment demos and I like the fact
that when you move Windows around you can kind of see transparent Windows
moving. When I saw that for the first time, I was drooling. Basically I
don't really care about that kind of desktop issues. I can select my own
background color and that's just about the control I need personally
frankly and I refuse to use the really old Window manager.

fvwm2 was the first one that made me happy and then after that I stopped
bothering to even search for better things. So in that sense I'm not so
interested in kind of the desktop as you see it on the screen because my
needs are not that high. I think that is where most of the really
interesting work is going to happen. Not the Window manager per se but the
desktop applications, the desktop use, and the desktop is interesting in
that it's the only use of computer that isn't specialized. Supercomputers
are basically always used for one thing.  The same is true of the embedded
space, so above and below you have specialized use. And the desktop is
interesting exactly because the use is so varied and that makes it much
more interesting to me as a kernel person because I get [unbelievable]
problem reports from the embedded space. So above and below you have
specialized use and the desktop is interesting exactly because the use is
so varied and that makes it much more interesting to me as a kernel
person. I get problem reports you wouldn't believe and that would never
ever be a problem on a super computer or on an embedded device. So that's
why I'm interested in the desktop because of the kind of user space issues
that people keep pestering me about and that doesn't mean that I'm
interested in the Window manager personally.

Hello again (or good morning),
I've got a problem with the TaskBar:
If I startx fvwm2 without any application that give raise to a "button"
in the TaskBar, then I've got a shadow button in the taskbar with the 
default mini-icon and with the title (@(@. Then, if I start an application 
foo, foo use this button and either the TaskBar Crash or works find until 
I begin to close applications, then the buttons are quite crazy. If I 
close foo, then the button do not disappear and the title begin with an
expression of the form [.]@[.]@ and the Taskbar Crash ...
I do not have this problem if I start, say xconsole, in .xinitrc and if
I do not  close it. Also, I do not have this problem with 2.3.3 (which is
very stable on my machine in general). I have this problem with the
cvs since I re-use the Taskbar (48 hours).
Yours, Olivier

PS: I am not sure that I use the good procedure to report bugs. The FAQ
says to use the web-based bug-tracking system and fvwmbug "says" to use the
fvwm-workers mailing list. Since it is a cvs bug  I use the mailing
list. If I bother you say me.

Mikhael,

I can now confirm all three of these work for me with todays CVS,
yesterday using --pass-args I kept getting the message can't exec
--pass-args fvwm2.  Upon inspection I couldn't see why, but this morning
I can't reproduce it, and the only change wass Dominik's fixes for
-Wall.  I let you know if I see any problems again.

I tried to start FvwmGtk within fvwm2, but I don't see anything happen.
When I run it from the command-line, it segfaults.

This is gdb output:

(gdb) run

Tim, does that mean I can't have gradients in my Ident window and
feedback window I had really grown accustomed to that.

fvwm2, cvs 1999-06-24, i386 redhat 6.0 linux

I don't really use FvwmWinList, but when I run it this message shows up:

--
[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> FvwmWinList window 0x2800002 has
broken size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

There are no FvwmWinList preferences specified in my rc file, so this is
just the default module.

The feedback window is unchanged but FvwmIdent is back to where it was
until someone hacks in colorsets.

Cheers,

If you haven't added any FvwmGtk configuration commands, it'll just sit there
lurking. Does it show up in 

ps ax | grep Fvwm*

?

> When I run it from the command-line, it segfaults.

Fvwm modules can only be spawned by fvwm. Shouldn't segfault though, just
refuse to run.

PS Here is a minimal config to try it out:


*fvwmgtkmenu test
*fvwmgtktitle test
*fvwmgtkseparator
*fvwmgtkitem item1 "exec echo item1"

module FvwmGtk
mouse 3 a r sendtomodule FvwmGtk test 3

You're not allowed to run any module, including FvwmGtk, from the
command line.  Modules must be started by the fvwm2 Module command.

Of course, it shouldn't segfault.  Most modules die with a polite
message:

  $ /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.4/FvwmButtons
  FvwmButtons v2.3.4 should only be executed by fvwm!

So, the segfault is a bug (weren't we going to create a "ModuleInit()"
function that did all the basic setup for modules in libfvwm.a?).

As to why "nothing happens", how do you have it configured, and what did
you expect to happen?

  t> PS. Is there something wrong with JitterBug? I can't submit my

Why not?  I mean, what happens when you try?

I hadn't read the man page well, I thought it would do "something". I

When I clicked the submit button this moring around 10:30 MEST, Netscape
told me it was contacting www.fvwm.org, but no data came in. I tried
three times, and I had to use the abort button each time. Dunno wether
it is still a problem right now.

We had an outage which ended at 8:20AM CDT, but everything's been fine
since then.

I sure would like to get my UPS back online.  As an aside, think twice
about buying APC products; I've lost two 2.2KVA units in the last year.
Unfortunately I don't know of anything else like a Symmetra (which I really
want), so I'll have to spring for 24hr on-site service.  Sigh.

If that doesn't work there must be some binding in your config file
already. Masking that binding with an empty one is not the way to go.
I don't understand why this is an issue anyway. If you have a binding
that interferes with a previous binding, the newer one overrides the
older. Why is this different with strokes?

Okay.

Mandatory. We can't make all this configurability and then ignore
it in the main module.

8) Touch all modules to make them use the colour sets if not
explicitly turned off.

I count only 24 bytes. You have counted the bit fields as 32 bit. Why
use a list if there can be only 16 colour sets?

> Any objections?

I'm not completely happy with these colour sets. First of all I can not
see the exact use model behind them, or perhaps I am too preoccupied with
the solution I have myself. For example I use five different colours
in my FvwmPager from an eight colour palette. The same colours are used
in various other places for different purposes. I don't understand why
we have to say that the first colour of the set is a foreground colour
and the second is a background colour. That seems to limit my choice
how to use them.

 - I can't use a background colour for foreground and vice versa because
   I don't have the proper Hilight and Relief colours.

 - What can I do if I want to use, say the background colour from set 5,
   but I got a pixmap?

 - We'll waste too many colours for reliefs and hilights that are never
   used.

I think background pixmaps should be handled separately from colour sets.
Here is what I propose:

 - Make a single colour set with e.g. 16 colours.

 - Dont send hilight/relief colours. They can be easily calculated by
   the lib function. On the other hand we will never have configurable
   hilight/relief colours if we do it this way (although I don't like
   the idea anyway).

 - Make certain statements about the colour sets we would supply, e.g.
   colour 0 is the default background, colour 1 is the default foreground
   (used for all text), 2 is the hilight colour, 4 is the menu background,
   5 the menu item hilight background, 6 the colour for shaded entries,
   7/8, 9/10 are pairs of similar colours, one bright and one darker,
   11 and 12 are colours quaranteed to give a nice, smooth gradient in
   conjunction with 7-10, 13-15 are colours with a red/green/blue tint.
   The user could redefine any of these:

     SetColour 7 green

   typedef struct cpalette *Palette;
   typedef struct cpalette {
     struct {
       Pixel colour;
       Pixel hilight_colour;
       Pixel relief_colour;
       unsigned has_hilight_colour : 1;
       unsigned has_relief_colour : 1;
     } cset[16];
   };

 - The modules are preconfigured to use colours 0-6 for their default
   look. This restriction to 7 colours ensures that we may restrict
   the palette to fewer colours. If you don't have lots of colours
   to spare you can disable sending of the hilight and relief colours.
   You can use a library call to get the appropriate relief of hilight
   from a colour. If the corresponding flag is set the function returns
   the colour from the structure, if not it calculates the colour with
   the usual mechanism.

 - We have a similar method to convey information about up to four
   background pixmaps. Pixmap 0 (if defined) is used as the background
   pixmap for the main application window while 1-3 can be user defined.

   struct dflt_back *Backgrounds;
   struct dflt_back {
     struct {
       Pixmap pixmap;
       Bool bg_keep_aspect : 1;
       Bool bg_stretch_x : 1;
       Bool bg_stretch_y : 1;
       unsigned int bg_width : 12;
       unsigned int bg_height : 12;
     } back[4];
   }

All your ideas how to actually implement this look good to me.

> Any volunteers?

I am willing to help, but I won't do everything.

I've seen it has in select() too. Looks like module

Finally I found the time to confirm this. xmms (the former x11amp)
requests a maximum size smaller than the minimum size when unshading:

  # xwininfo -size 
  xwininfo: Window id: 0x2c00009 "XMMS"

    Normal window size hints:
        Program supplied minimum size: 275 by 116
        Program supplied maximum size: 275 by 14
    No zoom window size hints defined

I've reported this to the xmms developers.

Can you send me a minimal config file and some instructions to reproduce
the problem? And please try to fetch me a stack trace. In the directory
with the core file type

  # gdb FvwmTaskBar core

and at the gdb prompt:

  (gdb) where

Thanks

GetConfigLine was called when a fvwm packet was pending. GetConfigLine
waits until a M_CONFIG_LINE packet arrives. All other packets are dumped.
Since no M_CONFIG_LINE came, FvwmIdent hang. I use ReadFvwmPacket now
and do the parsing of the packet in FvwmIdent (code copied from Module.c).
BTW, the returned string 'tline' was freed. But GetConfigLine doesn't
malloc memory.

Tim, I think it's your code I changed (list_end() in FvwmIdent.c).
Could you please double check that my fix is correct and that the
same bug isn't in the other modules too? It was in the default
graphics handling.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

It chooses one by default if the display supports it.  Even when the
default visual is 8-bit pseudo-color.

24-bits.  Until I updated my fvwm CVS workspace it was color.

After.  Here's the exact message fvwm emits:

[FVWM][GetIconBitmap]: <<ERROR>> Bad client icon pixmap depth 24

And all I get is the text label.  If I open and close again even
the text label disappears (probably off-screen?).

We got one! So putting in this message wasn't completely useless...
maybe we should implement a ICCCM-compliance testing mode, where
every failure to obey ICCCM would be reported (but change the
message to "Please report this to the author of the offending program")

Does this only happen with RaiseLower or also with Raise ? It may be
related to a change in RaiseLower which I did sometime back. I'll
investigate, although it is a bit hard without a safe way to reproduce
the problem.

I don't know yet. I saw it twice yesterday. Both times I tried to debug
it from a second X server, but both times accidentally killed the
offending window. Debugging a running fvwm from a second X server is
really helpful sometimes:

  exec xinit /bin/sleep 100000 -- :1

To start the second server.

  fvwm2 -d :1

To start the second fvwm. Then switch to display :1 and attach gdb
to the running fvwm (or module). This way you can set breakpoints
without halting the debugger too.

The messages are definitely valid, but I took me about two hours to debug the
problem. First I installed x11amp, but the version was too old, it had no shade
functionality. I tried www.x11amp.org, but the software was renamed to
xmms. I downloaded and compiled, but my gtk/glib was too old. So I
downloaded gtk/glib 1.2.3, compiled them, installed them, compiled xmms
and could finally verify the bug. And all this work only because we don't
print the size hints along with the warning :( Matthias, would you add
a printf that prints the application supplied hints and some indicator
in which code line(s) the broken_hints flag was set?

Whould we change the default cursor for selecting windows to
something more comprehensible that the filled circle we have now?

Any comments?

The question mark.  (Fvwm is asking which  window you want the command

I had  no worry at  all that InitGetConfigLine would  be called with a
matching string  that  would overflow   the  buffer, but   I think you
replaced working code with a memory leak:

Bless you, Chris. I was trying to fix RemoveButton for weeks now.
FvwmWinList has the same problem (I copied the code there). Would
you fix that too?

Remember, we've decided alloca() is OK for fvwm.  We're using it in some
places already so we might as well use it more often.

In general, anywhere you see an auto buffer variable it's best to
replace it with an alloca() call rather than a malloc() call; then the
scope is the same as the original variable, but you get to expand the
length of the buffer dynamically for more robust behavior.

Submission from: (NULL) (194.202.174.20)


If a client specifies resize increments (e.g. xterm) fvwm reports
the size during an interactive reset in those terms. i.e. you
can resize an xterm to 80x24.  Fvwm does not tell you what the
size of the client is in pixels so you can't easily reproduce
the size in a function.  The Resize command takes either pixel
sizes or percentages of the screen.

I'd like another suffix letter 'c' to indicate client sizes e.g.

Resize 80c 24c

Starting new applications such as Emacs or Matlab in fvwm is slow in
comparison
to other window managers s.a. mwm or even CDE-dtwm. This is generally not
a
problem as the timing difference is a couple of seconds for most apps.,
and
once a programme has started it runs at normal speed. However, one
particularly
severe example that I have found involves changing fonts in Emacs using 
[Mule][Set Font/Fontset][...some font other than default...] in which it
can
take over a minute to change font. This command is instantaneous using mwm
or CDE. I have tried both running fvwm using 'startx' and running it on
top
of CDE. In both cases, the problem persists.

Compiling the latest CVS as of a few minutes ago, I get:

  ../../../fvwm/modules/FvwmGtk/FvwmGtk.c:486: `g_int_equal' undeclared (first use in this function)

Can't find any reference to g_int_hash or g_int_equal; are those
supposed to be provided in the GTK includes?  Maybe I need a newer
version (mine is pretty old)?

In that case, what's the minimum version needed?  We should add
something to configure to test for it.

When using tiled pixmaps in windowborders, combined with mouse focus or
sloppy focus,
the initial border pixmap doesn't seem to get drawn until the window first
obtains 
focus.  I have tried this with ClicktoFocus, and the problem did not
occur.

I can provide more detailed setup information if requested via email.

I usually do it from a different virtual console (under Linux). I also
had some fun attaching a debugger to fvwm from an xterm being managed
by fvwm. You just have to be very careful about not loosing keyboard
focus when a breakpoint comes around :-)

But keep in mind that fvwm report the size relative to the base size
(or doesn't it ?)

Alternatively or additionally to the proposed `c', it would be nice
to have a way to make fvwm report sizes in pixels.

configure currently checks for >=1.1.0, but I'm not sure about

I can't verify this on my machine, but it isn't a Solaris machine. So
I have prepared a file with debugging output that should help to find
the problem. Could you please replace the file
extras/FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c with the attached file (make a backup),
recompile and install and record the console output? As this will generatei
tons of output, please do it exactly this way:

  1) Start X with fvwm and log the console output into a file.
  2) Do whatever you need to start the task bar.
  3) Focus a window with a shell and type 'cp logfile logfile.bak'
     where 'logfile' is the name of the file your console output is
     logged to. Don't hit 'Return' yet (i.e. type the command but do not
     execute it).
  4) Don't do anything. Don't touch the mouse or keyboard, simply wait and
     watch a few minutes until your problem occurs, i.e. your FvwmTaskBar
     should have updated the clock but didn't.
  5) Hit 'Return' to run the command you prepared above.

Run

  man select > select.manpage

on the offending machine. Finally send 'logfile.bak', 'select.manpage'
and the *FvwmTaskBar commands from your .fvwm2rc to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
Please tar and gzip the files if you feel they are too large. If it's
still more than about 50k, send the files directly to me
(dominik.vogt@fvwm.org) and I will truncate them appropriately before
forwarding them to the mailing list.

One thing you could try afterwards is this:

 1) Find the function EndLessLoop in the FvwmTaskBar.c file. If looks
    like this:

      void EndLessLoop()
      {
      fd_set readset;
      struct timeval tv;

      while(1) {
      ...

 2) Add a line before the 'while(1)':

      Xsynchronize(dpy, 1);

 3) Recompile and see if the problem goes away.

Your help will be much appreciated.

Duh, I forgot about this. We should definitely have a 'safealloca' function
in the style of safemalloc.

Hm, strange. Could you try out a few things, please?

 1) Start fvwm with an empty configuration file, i.e. clean out your
    .fvwm2rc, but do not delete it. Start a xterm (either from the
    builtin menu or from you .xinitrc) run try if the problem is still
    there.
 2) Copy one of the example config files that come with the fvwm sources
    over your .fvwm2rc and try again.

Does one of the above solve the problem? If yes, please send me your
original configuration file.

How do you start your Emacs? From the command line or by using
FvwmButtons, etc.? Does it happen with both?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

(the question mark looks rather ugly). There is a new 'RESIZE' cursor too.
* Improved(?) double click handling (my X server seems to swallow button pressesif they come too fast).

Wouldn't be handy to be able to select multiple windows to move around or

Personally, I like 'dot' more then 'crosshair'. But 'crosshair' is ok.
Anyway I reconfigure most of the default cursor fonts and their colors.
I have added a form for an easy root cursor setting:
  FvwmForm FormFvwmRootCursor.
Someone may find it useful to play with the standard X cursors and their
colors.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I scanned through my mailbox and saw that bug #290 seems to be different
from what I have been experiencing with XEmacs/Rxvt. I can make strange
things happen with ddd (a GPLed frontend to gdb et al.):

 1) Fire up ddd.
 2) Open a backtrace window from the status menu. The new window is above
    the main ddd window.
 3) "Lower" the ddd window: main window lowers behind all others.
 4) "Raise" the ddd window: it raises above all but the backtrace window.
 5) "RaiseLower" the ddd window: nothing happens. Fvwm thinks the window
    is not on to and tries to raise it, but doesn't raise above the
    backtrace window.
 6) "Lower" the backtrace window: ok.
 7) "Raise" the ddd window: the backtrace window pops back to the top.

Steps 4, 5 and 7 don't do what I would expect. Looking at the
RaiseWindow() function in stack.c I would bet it has something
to do with the code in '#ifndef DONT_RAISE_TRANSIENTS' :-)
Hm, how would this work:

 case 1 (main window on top of the stack and above the transient):

   "Raise" raises the transient to the top
   "RaiseLower" lowers the main window

 case 2 (main window on top of the stack but below the transient):

   "Raise" raises the main window above the transient
   "RaiseLower" does the same

 case 3 (main window not on top of the stack and above the transient):

   "Raise" raises the main window to the top and the transient above it
   "RaiseLower" does the same
   
 case 4 (main window not on top of the stack and below the transient):

   "Raise" raises the main window to the top (over the transient)
   "RaiseLower" does the same

 case 5 (main window above transient 1 and below transient 2):

   "Raise" raises the main window to the top and transient 2 above it
   "RaiseLower" does the same.

Additionally I'd prefer to have this DONT_RAISE_TRANSIENTS stuff
as a style option.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

P.S.: That does *not* solve the other problem I am experiencing.

I don't like either of them. Most of the X cursors are quite ugly.
I just thought the crosshair would be easier to understand than the
dot (for a newbie). The resize cursor is looks especially unintuitive.
Perhaps we should simply draw the cursors ourselves.

Dominik,

	thank you for getting back to so quickly on this. My mail program
( pine ) did not show any attachment though. :{  I looked at the problem
again briefly and it seems that the focus needs to go between windows for
the time to be updated. i.e. sitting on a window or moving from a window
the root window does not update the time. But going between two xterm
window, etc will cause the taskbar to query the time. I am going to try
the suggestions at the end of this email, and hope to hear back from you
with the attachemt.


			thanx,
				len

The crosshair is a good choice.  Xv uses it for grab, and this use
is similar.

Well, of course you can't do that.  Any memory alloca()'d is
automatically "freed" when the function that invoked alloca() exits.
That's the whole point, after all.

Alloca() allocates memory from the stack, so the only way it could fail
is if you blew the stack size.

I suppose you could make a "safealloca()" _macro_.  Not sure it's really
worth it, though.

PS. Note that most GNU/etc. programs use the functions "xmalloc()",
    etc. instead of "safemalloc()" (the "x" means "exit"; as in the
    function won't return if the allocation fails).

Hello,
Mouse 0 R N - gives me the bultin menu even if there is no other 
mouse binding in my config file.

The man page instructions for Stroke still do not work on my machine
(but it works find with Mouse * R A and ... Stroke * * R A ...)

Hello,
Attached to this message a patch for the man pages.
This patch corrects misprints of "formatting" nature
(see below for details). One thing I have do is to add some 
"example" environment (.EX/.EE or .nf .sp/.sp .fi)
where their miss (this is mostly non visible, however, rman, 
a popular man2everything under linux, work better with this).
This patch is against the cvs-tree (cvs update, cvs diff > ManPatch,
juste before sending this message). 

Yours, Olivier.

Files that the patch will modifies if applied (with comments):

ChangeLog (fvwm2.1: corrected misprints)

fvwm:

fvwm2.1 :  Correct .fvwm2rc and .Xdefaults "bugs". Add an EX/EE environment
arround the Stroke grid. Correct two other misprints of troff nature.

fvwm2 version: cvs (1999-06-26)

I can't start up FvwmPager in my RestartFunction anymore. It used to
work a few days back. When I start fvwm2 the first time, the pager shows
up, but when I hit restart, it just disappears it does NOT come back. I
added some debug output in RestartFunction and it IS printed on stderr.
Launching FvwmPager from the console always works. And executing
RestartFunction in FvwmConsole just does it work.

-- functions.config --

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+	"I"	FvwmPager 0 3

AddToFunc "RestartFunction"
+ 	"I" 	echo Beginning RestartFunc ..
+	"I" 	FvwmPager 0 3
+ 	"I" 	echo Ending RestartFunc ..

----

UPDATE:
I just found out I have to start the pager TWICE before it shows up. It
doesn't matter wether it is done in the RestartFunction or in the
console.

That's a bug we are hunting for a couple of weeks now. We still have not
found a way to reproduce it. Please send us your config file. How often
does this happen?

Yes, I understood so much, but why do you think alloca will never
return a NULL pointer? Excerpt from the man page on my Linux:

       The  alloca function returns a pointer to the beginning of
       the allocated space.  If the  allocation  failed,  a  NULL
       pointer is returned.

And why should this be less likely than that safemalloc fails?

In progress:

 1) Document the GNOME stuff (man page still missing).
    [in progress; volunteers still needed]
 2) Add screen shots to web page.
    [in progress; Dan]
 9) Set up RPM packages.
    [in progress; Jason]
 15) Get restart straight (sometimes an application vanishes over restarts)
     [in progress; Mikhael, Matthias]
 19) Try to reproduce that KFM windows stay on top of normal fvwm windows.
     [reported by Andrew Morton <morton@nortelnetworks.com> on 16-May-1999]
     [may be the same as 22/bug #290]
     [in progress; Matthias, Dominik]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [in progress; Matthias, Dominik]

To do (must):

 7) Create an I18N fvwm package (from 2.2 or so).

To do (optional)

 10) Remove 'PopupAsRootMenu' menu style (?).
     [comments wanted]
 11) Add FvwmKb module?
     [comments wanted]
 12) Set up bzip2 tarballs.

Fixes (high priority):

 14) Figure out what the problem with Amaya is.
     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
 17) Fix the bug that causes icons to lose management (bug #352).
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
 41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).
     [confirmed by me (Dominik)]
 42) Get bitmap icons working again.

Fixes (optional):

 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
     [reported by me (Dominik)]
 32) Several applications are reported to not resize well under fvwm
     (Datek's "Streamer", CodeWarrior).

Testing:

 33) Test the GNOME patches.
 34) Run the purify script again (and update it).
 35) Test the strokes patch.
 36) Test the new menu styles (ItemFormat!)
 
=====

Done:

 3) Add link to fvwm cats page to web page.
 4) Add link to Mikhael' wm-icons page.
 5) Update the links on our home page.
 6) Remove several configure options.
 8) Add an explanation about the various packages and where to
    discuss them to the web page.
    (stable, unstable (alpha), snapshots, ftp source tree, CVS).
 13) Use a 'busy' pointer during startup.
 18) Check if there are still growing windows as reported for 2.13.
     [bug #184 reported by Michael Hughes <mhughes@bridge.com>]
     [no bug; doesn't happen for 2.2 and up]
 20) Check why no icon can be set for Eterm.
     [reported on 8-May-1999 by Amir Chossrow Akhavan <amir@phy.ucsf.EDU>]
     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
     [fixed]
 24) Investigate bug #314.
     [fixed]
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
     [fixed]
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.
     [fixed in 2.2.3, no bug in 2.3.4]

Hello,

I thought that it would be nice if there were a feature in

Fvwm that allowed all icons to be "StayOnTop".

The reason for this is that icons occupy little space and

hence do not clutter the desktop. If they are StaysOnTop

then they are clearly visible and occupy less space than a

WindowShaded window. On the other hand there are times

when you iconize a window and it disappears under the buttonbox

or under the pager, which is terrible especially if the pager

or buttonbox has no frames.

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

Hello,

I like the WindowShade feature and use it quite often.

I believe I found a new bug or lack of functionality in

WindowShade. I have a button on the titlebar that does

a "Maximize Horizontally". When the window is shaded and

I click on that button nothing happens. The expected

behavior here is that the titlebar should expand to occupy

the width of the screen without unshading the xterm.

It would also be nice if the titlebar could be resized

horizontally while shaded. Then, when unshaded, the window

should retain the new width of the titlebar, not the old one.

Thanks for developing Fvwm2,

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

Hello,

I would like to suggest a new feature for Fvwm2.

It would be nice if one could bind to a button a

reassignment of geometry to a particular window.

Hence as an application one could click on a titlebar

button and the window could move to position +0+0 or

-0+0 etc... depending on the button binding.

Hence you can sort of move smaller windows out of the

way by the click of a button, and you can also make them

small and of a particular size by the click of a button.

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

Have you looked at the manpage for the builtin function Move? I don't
really see that FVWM can't already do what you're asking. Did I miss
something in your request? For example, from your above request, let's
say you have titlebutton 10. It's trivial to create a binding like:

Mouse 1 10 N Move 0 0
Mouse 1 10 S Move 0 -0
Mouse 1 10 M Move -0 -0
Mouse 1 10 C Move -0 0

For button one to take the window to any of the corners. HTH.

Okay, I have taken the risk and applied this patch as best as I could
to the current CVS (the coming 2.3.5) anthough we are close to 2.4 now.
Without enabling this the sources still compile as before, so I am not
too concerned of the risk. If we don't get it running we can remove the
code without too much effort. These are the problems I am aware of:

 - The redefinitions of XDrawString at the beginning of FvwmWinList.c
   do not compile.
 - I didn't apply the patch to fvwm/read.c (changed too much).
 - I didn't apply the patch to FvwmForm.c (too big).
 - There are probably some new 'isspace' calls that have to be modified.
 - Same with XDrawString.
 - I have seen several calls of XTextWidth that are not handled (e.g.
   in menus.c). I'm not sure if this is okay.
 - I didn't check the patch for completeness. 

Makoto, please, if you want to see that patch in the fvwm distribution
take the time to update read.c and FvwmForm.c for the current CVS and
check if I have done things right (and complete).

To our autoconf/automake experts: please have a look at the patches
and see what we can do to reduce ifdef'ing drastically. There is the
mentioned compatibility problem with a #define at the start of
FvwmWinList too.

I'd really like to see this patch in the distribution. Please help.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

This could be done by defining a layer for icons. Matthias, is it
much work to implement this?

This is fixed in the current CVS version 2.3.5 (unstable).
Maximize XX YY works as expected.

Yes, but this is old behaviour. The same should happen with 2.0.
When I reworked the stack manipulation functions to work with
layers, I left that part untouched.

If you ask me, these are more than enough problem to back it out and
wait until we find someone who knows I18N under X, has enough time to
clean up and debug this stuff (and has a system where he *can* debug it.

I'm strongly opposed to include this in its current form. If there are
japanese fvwm users who have more time than the original patch submitter
they should step forward and help us get this in shape.

I don't know. It may be simple. Right now we keep icons and the window
they belong to next to each other in the stack. 

But I don't think the feature is really worthwhile. Neil should solve his
problem of icons slipping under the pager or taskbar by using a suitable
icon box.

Not exactly. I can reproduce it very easily.
Actually, you can find and drag your first pager using the second one (if
you have more than one page on a desk).

I think I finally fixed this bug with the latest commit.
TG: can you, please, try the latest CVS and check again?

Mikhael.

We won't ever get it if we don't make a start. It's too big a task
for any single person to complete it alone. Furthermore it has no
impact on the standard cod. If we don't get it running, all we have
to do in automatically remove the I18N defines, three new files
and patch one Makefile.am.

Yup, I fixed it 15 Minutes after I read the bug report :-)
Maximizing horizontally did work, but resizing the window
failed to move the title to its new position.

Yes, I see that there is something strange, but I'm not quite sure what
the correct behaviour is:

When I use the BorderStyle command but no TitleStyle, newly created windows
use the pixmap only for the border, not the title bar. But when the border
gets redrawn for the first time, the pixmap is applied to the titlebar too
(may work only with sloppy/mouse focus and when the windows don't map under
the pointer). But isn't the bug that the BorderStyle is applied to the title
at all? Does anybody know this better than me?

I never said it couldn't fail, I said you can't make a safealloca()

Because, any memory you "alloca()" in the safealloca() function
disappears as soon as the function returns.

You could, as I mentioned, make a safealloca() macro.  But of course
when it's a macro any code there is duplicated however many times you
invoke it.

  dv> And why should this be less likely than that safemalloc fails?

Because typically people don't put that much stuff on the stack, I
guess.  I don't have any idea how much more or less likely it is,
statistically, but I _do_ know that a large percentageof GNU projects
use alloca() and I've never yet seen one test the return value.

Hello Dominik and Ke
I have attached that patch to this message. In fact I do a little more:

Modified files:
                : ChangeLog

Log message:

  * fvwm2.1: Corrected Stroke entries.

Ke, It is perhaps good that you look at that patch since you know a lot
more about stroke than me (I am just a tester and since stroke is not 
a module it is difficult to read the code). Note that I have add the 
following: "At the present time it is preferable to use R as context 
and A as modifier." However, I think that this patch is good and I hope
that it will save time for you.

Yours Sincerely, Olivier

Hello again,
Ok, but I need some time for cleaning the code (I learned perl during
writing this script).
I take the occasion for some questions on the docs directory.
Why the docs directory is not installed (says in prefix/doc/fvwm) 
by make install ? Ok, for example, the rpm package do this, but ...
I have look at run_man2html.sh and it seems that we need to run it
in the source tree (run_man2html.sh prefix/man/man1 somewhere,
will format all the man page of prefix/man/man1).  It seems that 
there are also some shell compatibility problems :o)
Do you want I work on this ? In fact my idea is to provide
a perl script that do all the html job. There is a number of good man2html
(as rman -f HTML ...), however, I can use "my" fvwman2book.pl to
do something pretty. 

Yours, Olivier

With todays CVS (28th June) the height of menu items is wrong. Items
with no mini-icon only get about 2 pixels and the text is drawn too far
down.

With the attached config files, it always happen. I just start up fvwm2,
no extra apps, and I hit Ctrl+F4, r to restart and the pager disappears.

When I comment out line 10 from app.styles:
	Style "Fvwm*"           NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip
there is no problem anymore.

My config files are ordered this way:
---
.fvwm2rc
.fvwm2rc.d
  |- config
      |- buttons.config
      |- functions.config
      |- pager.config  
      |- menus.config
      |- styles
           |- app.styles
           |- window.styles
---

  
I noticed some "strange" things:

FvwmPager DOES start up (I looked in top), but it doesn't show up on my
screen. And I can kill it with KillModule in FvwmConsole. Starting it a
second time and the pager pops up at the right place. 

DesktTopSize is set to 2x1, when I use 2x2, the pagers shows up
prefectly.

BTW, DeskTopSize doesn't get read in my fvwm2rc during restarts, I need
to type it in FvwmConsole or shut down fvwm2 and restart it manually.

Tim, I don't get this on my machines. Could you recomplie everything

please prepare a minimal comfig file and mail it to me.

As of 6/28 CVS IconMan won't start up I get a SEGV on a XQueryColor in 
#0  0xff22b5b8 in XQueryColor () from /usr/local/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.0
#1  0x1f068 in adjust_pixel_brightness (pixel=7885137, factor=0.5) at ColorUtils.c:225
#2  0x1f0b8 in GetShadow (background=7885137) at ColorUtils.c:255
#3  0x1b1b8 in X_init_manager (man_id=237360) at x.c:568


I'm running under solaris with a TrueColor X server , this worked Friday
before the commit to make it use fvwm's visual and the font patch.

I'm not quite sure what the problem is here, I'm not defining the font
patch so it should be somethin with the visual.  Any ideas.

Brad

I think I broke this, I was assuming icon bitmaps had a depth of 1 not
0. I've fixed this bug but it may not be the cause of your problem.
Could you try again?

Cheers,
Tim.

The documentation looks good. The examples should work with stroke as it is.
Thanks for catching the INSTALL.fvwm file fix. This must be the first time in a
long time that I looked at it. :)

Glad you found that missing line of code I don't think I would have ever
figured that one out.

It looks like it is trying the allocate colors before it reads any
configuration in. I've added in a hack that initializes the color lookup
routines early on in the startup, could you test this to see if it
works?  If it does I think we should add a bug report that FvwmIconMan
may use up unessary colors.

Cheers,
Tim.

Well it does work fine, I'm not quite sure why it allocate colors to
early.  Because it has already read it resources before I crash, using
read_in_resources, then it calls X_init_manager to actually set things
up, and that is where I segv.

my configure line is:
./configure  --prefix=/home/tim --with-readline-library=/home/tim/lib
--with-readline-includes=/home/tim/include --without-cxx --enable-gnome

I think it's something to do with the I18N patch. I just noticed that
the feedback window is the wrong size.  Line 1473 of builtins.c has the
setting of Scr.StdFont.height commented out which probably explains why
the window ends up very short.

Tim.

Argh.. I was using Pixmap and not TiledPixmap in my TitleStyle statements.  I
can't believe I let that slip by. :(  So why was it even working at all?

I have noticed that the ConstrainSize function prefers to limit a
window to a size a few pixels larger than the maximum allowed size.
I vaguely remember a discussion about that, but I don't know what
was decided on this matter. Matthias, I think you had the best
knowledge about that.

Your MTA doesn't report enough useful information, but from checking all of
my connection lots it seems to me like your mail server is completely
ignoring the fact that there's an MX for fvwm.org and delivering straight
to the machine of that name instead (which simply won't work):

XYX:karazm:~> host fvwm.org
fvwm.org has address 129.7.128.51
fvwm.org mail is handled (pri=0) by Karazm.math.uh.edu

If you connect to 129.7.128.51, as your MTA is doing, you won't get mail
through.  That's why there's an MX record.

To fix it, get your company to fix its mail system.

I'm not sure if there are any XFree devel group members here besides me,
but this may be useful anyway.  XFree 4 supports a mode called Xinerama
where multiple heads are supported at the client level simply as a single
surface with lots of pixels.  The extension merely chooses the common
visuals from all existing cards and strings things together at a low level.

I think this is going to be a big thing, but it doesn't work too well with
current window managers.  The problem with this is that things like window
positioning and maximizing do what you want because the WM doesn't know
that the big bunch of pixels it sees are really organized in some fashion.
There may even be holes in the desktop.

I'm trying to get someone to detail an API for determining where the
boundaries and holes are.  This will most likely result in is obtaining a
list of rectangles that are OK to position windows entirely within.  Can
someone familiar with window positioning and such give an idea as to how
difficult it might be to handle these situations:

1) User maximizes window.  FVWM chooses the union of all 'view rectangles'
   (or whatever they call it) that the window is an and maximizes to the
   rectangle containing all of those.  (This works great for
   identically-sized heads but doesn't do too well if the desktop has
   holes.)

2) New windows appear within the view rectangle that the mouse is currently
   in.

That would take care of the complaints I've seen so far.  On the other
hand, FVWM already has some kind of multi-head support but I don't know how
it works at all.  Perhaps some of these issues have been solved in a
reasonable manner already.

When maximize my window horizantally, I can't immediately maximize it
vertically. I need to resize it manually first.

Are there any plans to change this to a more consistent behaviour?

Mouse 2 	2       N       Maximize true 0 grow
Mouse 3 	2       N       Maximize true grow 0


Greetings,

Dominik,
	I recompiled with the FvwmTaskBar.c you sent me. I've attached 4
files. 

1. Logfile.bak is the file created as you specified. I ran fvwm2 w/
taskbar, and then after a few minutes when the time was not updated I
pressed return to copy the console logfile to logfile.bak.

2. Logfile.bak2 was a second copy I made of the logfile, right after I
changed focus to another window, and thereby causing the time to be
updated.

3. fvwmtaskbar is a text file showing the *FvwmTaskBar options. The users
local .fvwm2rc issues the commands Read system.fvwm95rc and and Read
stat.fvwm95rc. Those are the only two lines in the local .fvwm2rc.

4. is the select.manpage from the solaris system.


	Also I tried to add the line Xsynchronize(dpy,1); to the
EndLessLoop function but the functions is not defined and the compile
fails. I will look into this some more.

	Let me know if you need anything else.

			Thanx,
				len

I'm surprised. What exactly are depth 0 pixmaps ? I always thought
bitmaps are just depth 1 pixmaps.

I am trying to make FvwmButtons look like my FvwmWharf setup using Panels.  The
problem I am having is that with FvwmWharf I can specify a xpm to be the
background of the buttons.  The xpm does not get tiled but just set as the
background for each button.

With FvwmPager I can only set a pixmap to be tiled.  I can play around with the
Size option to get the buttons near to the correct size, but then the panels
have been another story.

All of that was said just to make/ask one suggestion/question.  Will there ever
be an option to use gradient colors with FvwmButtons?  If there was I could live
without the pixmap background.

Another question.  Every time I start FvwmButtons I get the following printed to
my console:

b=0x33620, font_string=-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-8-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

I've looked this up in the mailing archive, but have found no record of this.

I have one more thing to ask.  How hard would it be to add an option to
FvwmButtons telling this module what size buttons you wish to use.  For example:

FvwmButtonsSize 65 65

All buttons including Panels would then inherit a size of 65 x 65 including
titles.

While I like FvwmWharf, I wish it could Swallow the pager in more then just one
button like FvwmButtons and I wish it had the balloon option that Wharf has in
AfterStep (sorry for mentioning another WM here).  I have played with trying to
get this other WM's Wharf program ported to Fvwm2, but have had no luck so far,
but even if I did , I still would have the problem of swallowing the pager in
multiple buttons.

Thank you for all the past, present and future this group has given me.

Dominik, grepping through ChangeLog gives

1999-05-07  Matthias Clasen  <clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fvwm/move_resize.c (ConstrainSize): make sure to stay within
	min and max.

	* fvwm/add_window.c (GetWindowSizeHints):
	fix the fix to silently accept min width zero,
	reject any negative values in aspect ratios, scale the aspect
	ratios to be <= 65536 to avoid overflows in ConstrainSize.
	(gcd): removed.


So I at least tried to solve this. (IIRC, I inserted the "step 2a")

Do you refer to the fact that fvwm can handle multiple *screens* ? 
That is something a bit different: screens are independent monitors 
sharing a keyboard and mouse. You can move the pointer between them,
but windows cannot be moved from screen to screen, since they may have
totally incompatible visuals. fvwm handles them by simply spawning copies
for each screen it finds.

Btw, I don't think the tasks you mention are very hard to implement,
once the XFree team comes up with an X extension to get at the list
of rectangles.

Dominik,
Before the latest cursor code rewrite, a user had got "dot" cursor when a
function was started (in case it had several triggers). Now there is no
indication that the function is started and there will be soon activated
one of the defined triggers; which is not convenient, IMHO.

Speaking about functions, I think, the bug #359 can be in the bug section,
not in the "enhancements to do". No matter how you look at the "M" trigger
(for one it may be totally broken, for another it is improved) - the "C"
trigger is still broken. Because, in contradiction to the man page, the
"C" trigger is activated even after ClickTime. ClickTime is not taken into
account here at all. I really miss the "M" activated after ClickTime.

Regards,
Mikhael.

>  41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).

The problem can be reproduced with the following instructions:

 1) Start e.g. gnome-terminal or any other GNOME app with a
    menu bar. If necessary switch the menu bar on first. It
    may or may not start anchored to the app (this seems to
    be caused by the GNOME menu bar design; I have reported
    it to the GNOME folks).
 2) Grab the move button on the left side of the menu bar
    (it may not be drawn properly, but it still works) and
    drag the menu bar out of the app window. (Don't use
    fvwm to drag it).
 3) Drag the menu bar back into its place in the app.

==> X hangs for several seconds before the menu bar snaps into
    place.

Fvwm hangs in one of the calls handling the X input queue. I
have seen it hang in My_XNextEvent, SetupFrame or DoSetFocus.
In DoSetFocus I could narrow it down to the XSync(dpy,0) at
the end of the function. I don't know enough about X event
handling to figure out what happens. Please help.

Oh, now you have made me feel really dumb. So *that* was your point
in talking about the memory being automatically freed. How embarassing 8-)
I guess there is no xalloca function commonly available?

It is absolutely consistent if you understand that a maximized window
is not simply bigger than usual but that it is in a different state.
Using 'Maximize' on a maximized window unmaximizes it, regardless
of the arguments. I agree that this is a bit unintuitive, but I don't
really know what we could do about it without redesigning maximizing
completely.

Not as the background for individual buttons, I guess, but very likely for
the whole button bar when we have decided to handle this default graphics
stuff (and implemented it).

That might have something to do with the fprintf in FvwmButtons.c, function
RecursiveLoadData :-) I have removed it.

Perhaps a bit tricky, but not hard. All it would require should be to handle
the new options vs. the old geometry option and resize the window accordingly
after it is clear how many rows and columns of buttons there are.

That's okay as long as you mention it only to show fvwm's superiority ;-)

Hm, I had hoped that you don't need that cursor anymore because an
action is alway triggered as soon as the user stops fiddling with the
mouse. But the real reason is that running functions and selecting
windows shared the same cursor and that I didn't see a real need here.
I imagine the dot cursor is a bit confusing to new fvwm users. It would
be trivial to undo that change.

It's in enhancements because I still think the way it is handled now is
more intuitive. You made a suggestion about a 'Hold' action. This is
what I would consider an enhancement. The man page has to be corrected if
it says something different. Sorry if I didn't find the time to implement
this (and that won't change for a while). If you want if this badly it
would be best if you try to make the patch yourself. The IsClick()
function is a bit tricky, buth otherwise there is not much to it.

The problem here is that currently time from the function start and its
action can take minutes (while holding mouse pressed) and a user can't
know that after releasing the mouse button something will happen. :)

If there will be "H" implemented and "C" will be limited to ClickTime,
there will probably be no need for this cursor (it would be nice to have
it anyway as an option maybe), since in this case one of the actions will
be evaluated during ClickTime (which is less than half a second usually).

I didn't mean that _you_ must implement this, I only wanted to bring this
question up. And you definitely need not to be sorry.
Thank you for all your work!

  dv> I guess there is no xalloca function commonly available?

Nope.  Everyone just seems to assume it will always work.  I guess they
figure if you're so low on stack space that alloca() fails, your program
is due for a very rocky landing soon anyway (maybe you couldn't even
call the proper perror()/exit()/etc. functions!)

I would suspect a more likely cause is a bogus parameter to alloca()
than _really_ blowing the stack, but again, no one seems to check it
*shrug*.  Typically you wouldn't invoke alloca() unless you were pretty
sure that the value was fairly small (even if you have a decent stack
you can suck it up pretty fast with alloca() if you're not careful, or
use it in deep recursion, or whatever).  Whenever folks get data where
the size could be significant they use traditional malloc/heap storage.

That's what I thought, too.  Were we mistaken, or has the consensus

Dominik fixed the problem I had with the Recapture iconify-and-compact
function Tim suggested, where every new window appears iconified once
you use that function the first time.

However, the other strange effects I saw are still there :-/.  I haven't
updated FVWM in a couple of days; I'll do so first thing tomorrow and
let you know if I still see these, but I wanted to raise them here:

First, note that I can reproduce these only with Emacs (I'm using GNU
Emacs 20.3).  I couldn't reproduce it with xterm or rxvt, and it doesn't
seem to happen with Netscape.

 1) Shuffling window :(.  Any Emacs frame with a negative geometry that
    is iconified when the recapture command in that function is invoked,
    will be offset some number of bytes to the left when you de-iconify
    it.  For example, if I say:

      $ emacs -geometry -0+80

    then I see the problem.  If I use +0+80, it doesn't happen.  These
    seems to only happen once, but if you kill the frame and recreated
    it, then iconify, then recapture, it happens for the new frame
    again.

 2) Frames don't deiconify properly.  I have keys in Emacs that
    automatically deiconify and raise frames.  After that function runs,
    if I use one of these keys, I get FvwmAnimate animation of the frame
    opening and the icon disappears.  However, it opens _behind_ all the
    other windows.  If I send the things in front of it to the back, I
    can see the frame but it never will take focus and doesn't contain
    the right contents.

    If I hit the key again, the icon will briefly flash into existence
    and disappear again, then the FvwmAnimate graphics will run again,
    then the frame will appear completely and work properly.  I've never
    had it fail to do this on the second attempt.

    If I use the mouse (click mouse-2) to deiconify, it works every
    time.

    Note I use autoraise, and this might be involved: it seems much more
    likely to happen if there's the possibility of contention beween
    which frame should be raised (e.g., if I iconify a frame then
    de-iconify another one quickly in succession).

    I'll try to quantify this one better tomorrow.

One thing I've noticed for a while is that FvwmForm takes a lot longer
to tear down the Form window than it used to.  I used to hit return or
quit or a button and it would _immediately_ go away.  Now it hangs
around for probably a second or two before disappearing; a noticeable
delay.

For example, I have a form to start xterms (who doesn't ? :).  Before
I'd hit return and bang, the form would vanish then the xterm would
appear.  Now the xterm comes up... then the form goes away.

Anyone else notice this/have any ideas what FvwmForm is doing with
itself now that it didn't before?

Now that you mention it, I'd noticed the same thing. I seem to recall
the extra-long close surfacing some time around 2.1.x, though for a
while I couldn't get my forms working at all... It's all a blur now.
I'm willing to peek at the code, though I suspect Dan knows this best
and can find it fastest.

The consensus has implicitly changed by ignoring me and my question
and requests for help on this topic completely. If I have to do this
stuff alone, without any actual knowledge of multibyte support, I will
do it.  Sorry, I don't want to look aggressive, but I will continue
this way unless somebody comes up with something constructive. Sure,
in the current form the changes don't fit into our striving for clean
code. But we don't really expect that someone shows up, writes complete
and clean multibyte support, volunteers to test and maintain it and
causes us no additional work at all.

Oh, and BTW, I asked at least half a dozen times for someone else
to take up the job to plan the release. I can live perfectly well
without all this pressure, so if there is a volunteer to do it and
he tells me to remove the patch - no problem.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Well, *absolutely* is perhaps a bit strong here... With the many
possibilities for influencing the size to which the window is maximized,
a simple state switch with just one saved geometry is not optimal.

One could think about a stack of saved geometries...

I just tried to start gnome-terminal under Xnest and twm to see
if the same problem happens for other wms, but: 


bash$ Xnest :1 &
[1] 6329
bash$ twm -display :1 &
[2] 6330
bash$ gnome-terminal --display :1 &
[3] 6331
bash$ X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62 (X_CopyArea)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  1175
  Current serial number in output stream:  1183
X connection to :1.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
xterm:  fatal IO error 32 (Datenbergabe unterbrochen (broken pipe)) or KillClient on X server ":1.


The same happens for gedit. Is this a Xnest limitation or a gtk bug ?
I have repeated the experiment using an X server on a different console
and found that twm doesn't have the problem.

I don't know if this is related but I have had problems with Imlib with
a server with odd visual depths.  I had to edit imrc to tell it what
visual to select in the end.  Does you Xnest have visuals of different
depths?

Cheers,

They are the same depth (both 16, TrueColor), but have different id's 
(0x20 vs. 0x22)

The reason for the hang seems to be that GnomeDock has the pointer grabbed
(since they are doing the move themselves), and doesn't release it before
the docking is over. fvwm insists on grabbing the pointer in GrabEm:

  while((i<1000)&&(val=XGrabPointer(dpy, Scr.Root, True, mask,
				    GrabModeAsync, GrabModeAsync, Scr.Root,
				    Scr.FvwmCursors[cursor], CurrentTime)!=
		   GrabSuccess))
    {
      i++;
      /* If you go too fast, other windows may not get a change to release
       * any grab that they have. */
      usleep(1000);
    }

but the only reason for using GrabEm in the first place is that
HandleHardFocus has a stupid way of getting a new timestamp. This
should be replaced by something better and it shouldn't use
GrabEm.

But I saw it hanging in a plain XSync(dpy,0) too (in the end X hung in
a select() call). That could be caused by the pointer grab too (I
think), but it isn't our fault. Right?

Hm, yes. Commenting out the timestamp stuff in HandleHardFocus solves
the problem. Isn't there a way to simply request the current time from
the X server and patch it into the event structure (no, I don't have
that X books here at work)?

I can confirm both these behaviors with the very latest CVS stuff :(

Also, I'm doubtful now that the second problem is related to autoraise;
it seems to happen even when you wouldn't expect autoraise to come into
play.

I still haven't been able to get either one to happen except with
Emacs.  I wonder if this is an Emacs bug?  I've also only tried on my
Solaris system (but note I'm using X11R6.3, and not OpenWin or CDE) and
only with Emacs 20.3.

Does anyone else see this?

I was sure I didn't see it in 2.2, but perhaps I was mistaken, if the

Ah, my old friend bug #4 :).

RE: Dan's note to this bug: I look at it as a "workaround" :).

IMO fvwm should be fixed to manage the pipes better so these kinds of
shenanigans aren't necessary.  Not the least problem is it makes fvwm
look pokey and unresponsive.

Uhh, guys, slow down.  I've  been back in the  office 2 1/2 hours, and
just finished reading my mail and was about  to look into the problem,
and here is the answer...

I  guess I thought  the one second sleep  would be invisible, and with
the speed that my home system operates, it really was invisible.

The "solution" is to just remove the sleep.  As I will attempt to do
provided one of you doesn't beat me to it.

Hello,

It would be nice if BitmapPath were introduced as an

alias to IconPath in the .fvwm2rc file. This naming scheme

simply makes more sense. The IconPath syntax could be left

intact for compatibility reasons.

Hello,

It would be nice if fvwm2 had an option, say RestartsOnPage,

so that restarting left you on the same page as when you

clicked on the restart menu button, rather than moving you to

page (1,1) (or (0,0)?).

I guess I assumed the sleep() was there for a reason.

I think the sleep command I introduced was just  some bad reasoning on
my part.   I'm not  against fixing bug  #4,  but using "killme"  works
pretty well.

Well, there  is an XWithdrawWindow  just before this logic.  I thought
that  would make the window  disappear.  (It  doesn't  seem to.)  So I
reasoned that going to  sleep to give fvwm2  time  to turn  around the
"killme" command would be a good idea.

I'm a little  confused about the  XWithdrawWindow, but  looking back I
think going  on the the  piperead is just  as good  a way  of going to
sleep as the call to sleep.  (Probably the same system call anyway.)

Paul, I'm grasping at straws here but you could try checking the return
value of XWithdrawWindow to see if the UnmapNotify succeded or not.  If
it didn't then fvwm has a problem with synthetic UnmapNotify's.

Another bug bites the dust.  (Its fixed.)

Anyone else notice their titlebar disappearing?  So far I have no clue what
causes it, but I've seen it twice in the last week.

The pages aren't installed automatically since you would normally go
to fvwm.org to read them.  If you don't normally have internet access,
you might find it useful to install them locally.

You don't say which release you are looking at, but the requirement to
put   the man pages  in a  "prefix/man/man1" environment, was recently
removed.

As always, if you want to try your hand at making improvements, make
sure you are working from the current CVS, and are subscribed to the
fvwm-workers list.  Also, be sure to read the "docs/DEVELOPERS" file.

We are always interested in improvements.

Uh, no I guess not.   I must have gotten my  moved and un-moved icons
mixed up.  But moving  an icon seems to  be the  way  to get  one icon
behind another.

The logic  of the "feature"  is clear  enough  now.  Once  you move an
icon, its moved-to position is permanent.   I don't think I follow the
change you are  suggesting.  If I make  a moved  icon, avoid anything,
then that will be changing its position.  Are you suggesting that once
an  icon is moved, it creates  a "hole" in  the iconbox, that no other
icon can  occupy?  I think  that could be  done, but I'm not  sure its
desirable.

Patrick seemed to be satisfied with the current behavior, so I moved
this thread to the workers list.

While helping someone compile FVWM on SGI recently they were using the
bundled SGI C compiler, and they got _tons_ of warnings because of the
way we define bitfields in FVWM.  I've also heard of these types of
warnings with HP's C compiler.

Basically, we use this in many places:

  Bool  isThis:1;

The problem here is that Bool (an X type) is defined to be int, which is
a signed integer.  So there could [*] be a bit reserved for signedness.
But, we have only one bit.  Thus warnings.  Most compilers with DTRT
here, even as they spit out tons of warnings (it's a quality of
implementation issue :) but still it'd be nice to avoid them in the
first place.

Similarly, if we use something like:

  int   numItems:2;

we really can't be sure whether the valid values for this bitfield are
the expected 0-4, or {-2, -1, 0, 1}.

The latter is simple to fix, by using:

  unsigned int numItems:2;

The former can only be fixed by punting the X Bool type.  The question
is, should we just change these to straight "unsigned int" or do people
feel that creating a "uBool" type would be more appropriate?  I prefer
just using unsigned int, but I'm not losing sleep over it.


-----
[*] According to the C standard, whether or not an "int" bitfield is
    considered to have a sign bit or not is "implementation defined"; I
    hate that.  What use is it to have a standard if you're not going to
    define stuff like this?  "Implementation defined" is no better than
    not having a standard at all; you still can't use either feature
    portably. Argh.

Hm, I'm not sure what can be done about it. I thought when you map a
moved icon and it overlaps some other icon in the same position it could
avoid it by moving a short distance up/down/left/right. Or - it it still
is within the icon box - it could be placed as usual. Sounds weird.
Perhaps it's best just to place it normally when it overlaps another icon.

No, that is not what I meant.

Hi Neil,

that is already in the current development code. Expect to get

Look at icccm2.c for a different way to get an up-to-date timestamp.
I think I used a zero-length append to a property.

unsigned int x :1 

is the correct way to do bitfields.

Yes, I see that too (only with Emacs, not XEmacs). But it has nothing to
do with iconifying. What happens is this:

When emacs is mapped first, it sets this normal hints:

 x        408
 width    740
 gravity   NE

And

 border width 2

Let's assume fvwm uses a border width of 9. Then the frame window starts
2 * (9 - 2) = 14 pixels left from the original position, at x = 394 (the
old window border is removed and a new one is drawn within the frame).
But when emacs is mapped, it notices its new position and sets new normal
hints:

 x        401 <--
 width    740
 gravity   NW <--

This truly reflects the current client window location (which is
located at x = 403). Emacs wants to be clever but does not take the
WMs border width into account. Then we recapture the window and
the new frame is placed at 401 as requested (note that the gravity
has changed!). So the client portion of the frame begins at
401 + 9 = 410 which is (9 - 2) = 7 pixels too far right.

At this point I stopped debugging since it's clear now that emacs
is broken. THe is another effect that doubles the mis-placement so
that emacs ends up 14 pixels too far to the right.

I have reported this to the emacs people.

Thanks. This convinces me that you are experiencing a configuration

With your config file (using only the lines from system.fvwm95rc) I see
it too. The seconds are not updated. The clock is refreshed every 60
seconds or when something happens on the desktop (as it is documented in
the man page).

You say you tried to increase the update interval and it didn't work. So
I suppose you made a typo. When I add the following line to the end of
the system.fvwm95rc the clock runs as it should:

  *FvwmTaskBarUpdateInterval 1

(without the leading spaces, of course). Please tell me if it solves
your problem.

Is that just a cut-and-paste error? If not it will stop the next line from working.

In most other places we use

  unsigned foo:1;

For consistency it's better to always use it anyway. Let's simply make
the change.

I wonder what HandleHardFocus() is good for anyway. It doesn't
seem to hurt to replace it with SetFocus(). Does anybody know
the intention behind this function?

Yes, I see that too (only with Emacs, not XEmacs). But it has nothing to
do with iconifying. What happens is this:

When emacs is mapped first, it sets this normal hints:

 x        408
 width    740
 gravity   NE

And

 border width 2

Let's assume fvwm uses a border width of 9. Then the frame window starts
2 * (9 - 2) = 14 pixels left from the original position, at x = 394 (the
old window border is removed and a new one is drawn within the frame).
But when emacs is mapped, it notices its new position and sets new normal
hints:

 x        401 <--
 width    740
 gravity   NW <--

This truly reflects the current client window location (which is
located at x = 403). Emacs wants to be clever but does not take the
WMs border width into account. Then we recapture the window and
the new frame is placed at 401 as requested (note that the gravity
has changed!). So the client portion of the frame begins at
401 + 9 = 410 which is (9 - 2) = 7 pixels too far right.

At this point I stopped debugging since it's clear now that emacs
is broken. THe is another effect that doubles the mis-placement so
that emacs ends up 14 pixels too far to the right.

I have reported this to the emacs people.

In most other places we use

  unsigned foo:1;

For consistency it's better to always use it anyway. Let's simply make
the change.

I think HandleHardFocus needs the new timestamp only to ensure that
the focus is set on the new tick. But I can't see a reason why this
cannot be done immediately. I have disabled Handle HardFocus for now,
so if anyone sees a problem with the focus or something related,
please tell me.

HandleHardFocus is called only when destroying or unmapping windows
with ClickToFocus or when destroying transients.

Well that is a little odd, straight from the man page
     The XWithdrawWindow function unmaps the specified window and
     sends a synthetic UnmapNotify event to the root window of
     the specified screen.  Window managers may elect to receive
     this message and may treat it as a request to change the
     window's state to withdrawn.  When a window is in the with-
     drawn state, neither its normal nor its iconic representa-
     tions is visible.  It returns a nonzero status if the Unmap-
     Notify event is successfully sent; otherwise, it returns a
     zero status.

     XWithdrawWindow can generate a BadWindow error.

Its not supposed to generate BadRequest errors, just BadWindow my
guess is that fvwm is causing the BadRequest because it doesn't handle
synthetic UnMapNotifies properlly, i.e. making the window state withdrawn.

I don't think I broke it but FvwmTaskBar is not doing tips or autohiding
any more. I think the problem is with the way the alarm event is
propogated back from the signal handler invoked by the alarm.  What it
tries to do is and XSendEvent() to itself but the event never arrives. 
Can anyone debug this?

Cheers,
Tim.

Subject: patch to 2.2.2 for user-defined shadow and highlight colors
Date: Wed, 30 Jun 1999 12:13:53 -0400

Hi,

Enclosed is a patch to fvwm-2.2.2 that lets the user specify which colors
fvwm should use for shadows and highlights. I've tried this before :) but
this patch is better. It's smaller and requires fewer changes to existing
.fvwm2rc files.

It adds one command to .fvwm2rc: "AddHilightShadowMapping". You say (for
example)

	AddHilightShadowMapping mistyrose plum1 plum4

in .fvwm2rc. Then core fvwm will use `plum1' as the highlight color and
`plum4' as the shadow color when the background is `mistyrose'. (This patch
doesn't affect modules.)

love,
ed

They are, but fvwm initialized the depth variable to 0 and didn't update
it when it had loaded a bitmap. I made a change to the icon drawing code
and put in a test for pixmaps of depth 1 and so messed up with bitmaps.

_This_ is what I was referring to a few weeks ago when I said that
configure died if you didn't have a C++ compiler.  Maybe it works OK if
you don't have a c++ program at all, I haven't tested that.

But I still think configure should "catch" the error if the C++ compiler
can't be used, and continue on.  After all, C++ is needed only for one
module, and probably one of the lesser-used ones at that.

We can add a note or warning to the informational printout at the end
saying that the C++ compiler wasn't found or was unusable, but IMO
configure shouldn't choke.

Can we do that with autoconf?  Would we have to write our own versions
of the compiler checking macros?

OK, maybe I'll check the latest Emacs 20.4 beta and see if it's fixed.
It's really too bad they don't have anyone who knows much about X,
window managers, ICCCM, etc. on their development team :(.

What about the other problem, with frames not de-iconifying correctly
the first time after a recapture?  Has anyone seen that?  It's pretty
easy to reproduce, for me.

Since it also only happens for Emacs frames it could well be an Emacs
problem, as well, but it's at least more subtle...

Hi,
Between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 a bug was introduced. It occurs when the pager
tries to load a pixmap. In the current code, the pager use Scr.Pager_w
as parent to the pixmaps. A this time the Scr.Pager_w does not exist,
since it is created after the configuration has been read. I have
attached a Q&D fix for this problem to this mail. 

	 / Johan

I am busy now, but if noone will do this in the near future, I can do it.
Also, my own todo list for 2.4 (a must):

 * new SessionInitFunc and SessionRestartFunc or a similar solution
 * fully test fvwm under a session manager (there are some problems)

There is also a report from Tung saying that DeskTopSize command, after
changing in config file and restarting, has no effect. I can confirm this,
although the gnome pager *is* wrongly updated to the new desktop size.
(wrongly because new shown pages are not active, only old ones).

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is also the reason for me to always do: configure --without-cpp
Must be fixed, IMO.

Say, what module do you mean? Not FvwmConfig, by any chance? This
isn't in the distribution anymore.

You said you would elaborate on this and I was hoping for more

Sorry; I made another post that elaborated more but maybe I wasn't
clear.

I've done some more testing, this time on my Linux box at home, and it's
trivial for me to reproduce.

Start an Emacs 20.3 in X mode.  Use C-x 5 2 to create a new frame.
Iconify the new frame.

Now run the Iconify-and-Compact function:

  AddToFunc Iconify-and-Compact
  +       "C" Iconify
  +       "C" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

Note!  A normal "Recapture" command works OK!  You need to use (I
suppose) RecaptureWindow.

Now if you deiconify the Emacs frame with the mouse, it works OK.  But,
if you use the Buffers->Frames menu to pick it and have Emacs deiconify
it instead, it doesn't work (the first time).

When I do it, the frame appears (along with FvwmAnimate animation) and
the icon disappears.  However, _only_ the frame appears, the contents of
the frame are never mapped.  Further, I can't give this frame focus or
bring it to the front.  I can, though, resize it and move it via the
border; the interior of the frame is just a copy of whatever was on the
screen when it was created.

If I use the Buffers menu to ask for the frame _again_, the icon briefly
appears, the deiconify animation appears, _then_ the frame contents are
mapped correctly and the frame works fine.  You can iconify this frame
again and again and observe exactly the same behavior.  It's not until
you actually delete the frame (with C-x 5 0 or whatever) that it will
stop.

I just had another odd thing happen; after a recapture I couldn't send
my Emacs frame to the back anymore.  I'll try to clarify this one.

Hmm, good point!  I thought it was FvwmScript but I can't see any .cpp,
.cxx, .c++, or .C files anywhere in FVWM anymore.

Maybe we don't need a C++ compiler anymore?  That would be _way_ cool!
Can anyone think of a reason we need one?
