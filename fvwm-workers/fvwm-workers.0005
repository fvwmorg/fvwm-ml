I can confirm this with current CVS and using sloppy focus as well, my
guess is that fvwm gets the leave notify from netscape when the menu
pops up but never gets the enter notify when it goes away.  I can't
recall who was looking at event code last, so if no one responds with an
idea I'll start looking.

	I definitely think it should.

Dominik --

	Would you add this to the TODO? I'm working on the fix right
now...after getting over the shock of doing my first update since
February (gasp! - many fvwm2rc changes needed).

Mike --

	What I'm doing shouldn't clash with any module changes to make them use
the ConfigWinPacket struct. My change will be confined to
module_interface.c, where the data I stuffed into the packet is just
plain wrong.

	...or so I thought. It turns out that when the layer was added to the
info displayed by FvwmIdent (change to CONFIGARGSNEW in
module_interface.c), the change wasn't reflected in vpacket.h, so I'll
have to add that. The layer was stuck in the old dummy field where the
pre-GSFR flags used to go, which we had left just to preserve the
alignment of the other fields.

Yes, I've seen that. I started patching over the weekend and when I
got to FvwmIdent, I just pointed the layer to cfgpacket->dummy --
still, it's trivial to get this right by renaming the value layer, I
suppose... So far, no one even cares what it's called, AFAIK.

	Oh, as soon as we start using named fields instead of body[x], people
will care. (Well, I will, anyway.)

	I just committed the fix to Jeremie's problem (I hope), which
incidentally replaces the cfgpacket->dummy field with a field called
layer, so your patch will need to be adjusted.

Hi, I just commited changes to FvwmIconMan and FvwmIdent to convert
them to using ConfigWinPacket structs when reading config/add packets.
Could someone let me know what you think? If things look generally
okay (specifically in FvwmIdent, since FvwmIconMan is really a one-off
in so many ways), I'll go ahead and continue converting things.

So I've had a chance to look at your patch and I guess you've decided
to use a wrapper. But now I've got a question, since FvwmCommand[S].c
has proven a bit more complicated to convert. I see that you've dealt
with dumping an int into a long's space in the outbound packet, but
won't this break the alignment of ConfigWinPacket when orienting its
structure against a *body?

Anyway, FvwmCommandS.c spits packets back out onto its own pipe using
hard-coded values, measured in sizeof(long) units. I'm trying to
figure out how best to do this. I suppose I could always just hard
code the new size in long's (27? 25 struct members, but flags appears
to be 3 long?), but was hoping for something a little more "correct."
Would the rather ugly expression:

sizeof(struct ConfigWinPacket) * sizeof(size_t) / sizeof(long)

be correct? Would something like this be in any way preferable to just
hardcoding the correct number of longs?

Ugh. Has anyone ever noticed that on a 32-bit architecture, the
machine's talking in 4-letter words ;>

Err, never mind. I was confused and thought that there were int's in
the ConfigWinPacket struct. And so I've answered my other question as
well.

I use Style "*" ActivePlacement. If I activate the FvwmAnimate module,
then
I get non-interactive window placement.
If I then kill the Animate process, then the interactive window placement
comes back.

What focus policy do you use?  What kind of key bindings fail
to work, window specific or root key bindings?  Please give an
example.

 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [fixed; there is a new style and the behaviour is a bit more intuitive]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.

 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]

 55) FvwmGtk can't be killed with 'KillModule'.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.

     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will

 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.
 74) To fix: icons are not preserved over a Quit - Start for fvwm

     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set
     is changed (*FvwmPagerColorset).
109) FvwmIconMan titles don't seem to work.
111) Fix position hints not working with menus invoked
     from a menu like this: 'addtomenu foo foo menu foo root c c'
112) Fix desk flipping with
       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.
135) FvwmWinList doesn't handle negative geometries properly
     with TitleAtBottom.

     within a function?
     [nope; enhanced Refresh/RefreshWindow instead]

I use "style * clicktofocus" and never deviate from that. Given that
then context when I cause an unmap of a Motif window from its menu
falls to root, that's the context where my keybindings fail. But I
have plenty of "a" context bindings that do not work.

Your questions spurred me to look at this some more and I accidentally
found something that's probably useful... If I, for example, use
Netscape and then open a second window using Meta-N, then create a
third window from *either* one using Meta-N again, if I close the
third window from a menu and move the mouse into the frame of the
window that "created" the third window, it receives focus and my
keybindings start working again.

So, it looks like something's broken in the window destroy/unmap that
failes to return focus to the prior window in the stacking chain. It's
probably being caused because the menu closes its parent *before* it
unmaps/destroys itself, so when Fvwm attempts to return focus to the
menu's parent, it returns to a void context -- a window that's already
been deleted/unmapped... Or something like that. I can look deeper,
but it's been a while since I looked at core fvwm code and it'll take
me a while to figure anything out. Anyone see anything useful here to
figure this problem out?

Most likely I was the last one looking, but I'm not too
eager to do it myself (look at the to do list and you know
what I mean).  With FvwmDebug I see that a non-fvwm managed
window gets the focus during the operation, so that's why
the window looses focus in the modules.  I'd rather not try
to understand focus events, though :-)

'ActivePlacement' is not enough to enforce interactive placement.
You have to use the DumbPlacement style also.  Otherwise windows
are only placed interactively if the 'Smart' placement algorithm
fails.

  Style "*" ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

Does this solve your problem?  If not, please send me your
complete fvwm config file.

Hi all,

I just committed some minor enhancements to the Move and
Resize commands and a new condition 'MovedButtons3'.  All
this stuff is marked with an ifdef.  I know it's really not
the time to add new features, but the changes are very small
and add a lot of flexibility:

 - Move syntax enhanced: a '-' tells fvwm to not change the
   coordinate (x or y), e.g.

     # move window to top of screen
     Move - 0
     
 - Resize: '0' tells fvwm not to change the dimension (vertical
     or horizontal), e.g.

     # resize horizontally
     Resize 80c 0

 - Resize: takes negative sizes (interpreted as
     screen size - given size), e.g.

     # resize to screen height minus 64 pixels
     Resize - -64p

 - Resize: bottomright or br option allows to place the bottom
     right corner instead of specifying a new size.

     # resize so that bottom right corner is in the corner of the screen
     Resize bottomright -0 -0

 - New command MoveResize does what Resize and Move do, but in
     a single step (reduces flickering).

     MoveResize 80c 24c +10p +10p

 - A new condition MovedButton3 was added: when a window motion
     is finished by a button 3 press, this flag is set.  This
     allows to call a function for newly mapped windows with
     ActivePlacement + DubPlacement.  This function can then
     e.g. resize the window to the bottom of the screen, e.g.

       Style * ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

       *FvwmEventPassID
       *FvwmEventadd_window GrowDownFunc
       AddToFunc StartFunction
       + I FvwmEvent

       AddToFunc GrowDownFunc
       + I windowid $0 (XTerm MovedButton3) Resize bottomright - -0p

With these changes we can make quite a few people happy (there
were several questions/enhancement requests that can be solved
with these enhancements).  I still recognize that we are in
feature freeze and I don't want to force this.  If anybody
objects against these changes or - as always - I don't get two
votes for them, I'll remove them again (i.e. undefine the
ifdef).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Brad, have you seen this?  I bet my right arm that this is
the same as the one that Gregory reported.  It really seems
that fvwm gets FocusIn events wrong somehow.  I don't see
how this makes root bindings stop working, but it does for
me too.

>118) Investigate "FvwmPager & StaysOnTop" bug (#543).
>     [reported by Nadim Shaikli <nadim.shaikli@intel.com>]

I finally realized that my FvwmButtons is supposed to be
StaysOnTop/Layer 6 and positioned above everything else on my desktop.
This isn't always the case. I've since figured out that it's probably
the same thing as this bug. Here's how I can reproduce it.

Use an app to create a transient (it's probably easier if you use
DecorateTransient). The transient is mapped *above* windows in a
higher layer. I've seen this with transients created by Netscape and
editres (to verify this isn't toolkit specific). Now, if you raise
some other StaysPut/Layer 4 window it will raise above the transient,
and hence above Layer 6 window. Raise enough windows and the stack
will leave the Layer 6 window *on bottom*. Then you can only correct
the problem by clicking in the Layer 6 window or explicitly raising
it, at which point it reassumes its proper position in the stacking
order.

I reproduced these results using ClickToFocus,
ClickToFocusPassesClick, ClickToFocusRaisesOff. GrabFocus and
GrabFocusTransient are on. I raise windows by clicking the title which
raises.

Have we reached a decision on this one yet? When last I saw anything
about this there were three proposals on the table:

a) rerun fvwmSelect() in My_XNextEvent() whenever we know that the
   descriptor states have changed.
b) replace pipes with AF_UNIX sockets so that we can send "UNLOCK"
   messages as "out of band" data.
c) implement our own "out of band" mechanism on the existing pipes
   (somehow).

All of these are non-trivial, although some are more non-trivial than
others. What do people think? Personally, I think that (b) is
potentially the easiest to code by replacing pipe() with
socketpair(). Sockets are as much descriptors as are pipes, so the
code should not break. However, I believe that sockets are slower than
pipes. (a) strikes me as more work to code, but keeps the existing
pipe system almost completely intact. The extra call to fvwmSelect()
can be positioned so that we only do when we need it. I can't really
comment on (c); I am worried about effort and portability in this
case.

Cheers,
Chris.

It's also necessary for the way WriteToFile works. It will replace a
section in a file marked as above. The magic number is the process id
and is there so that a script can have more than one WriteToFile. The
man page doesn't explain this.  I don't think we can change it much
(maybe remove the blank lines) without breaking existing scripts.  We
could introduce another command called AppendToFile which would simply
append the line. It would be up to the script to empty the file first if
needed.

Cheers,
Tim.

I think (c) is the least risky. It's not unexpected out of band
communication, it just getting the UNLOCK message without processing the
command the module has buffered up in it's output.  It needs a queue
(only one, not one per module) of messages that is emptied in
My_XNextEvent before the select (so that buffered messages are processed
in order).  In the bit of code that waits for the UNLOCK message if a
different message is read it is added to the end of the queue and the
UNLOCK message is waited for again (with a big timeout please). I'm not
sure what the structure of queue items would have to be, probably a
string for the message plus the module id and context (and a pointer to
the next queue item).

Cheers,
Tim.

Maybe we'd want a generic thing for this.. so you can do the same with

The syntax "bottomright" is like the IconFill arguments (2 words):

This fails in the current CVS, i.e. "Next (xclock) Resize 100p 0"
results
in a 100x1 xclock.

Since the size arguments come before the position shouldn't the command
be called ResizeMove or the arguments switched?

My vote is for them.

Unless I'm missing something, why isn't the same syntax used here?  I
prefer the "-", so shouldn't this be "Resize: '-' tells fvwm not to
change the dimension"?

I realize that resize with a "0" is silly, nevertheless I think
consistency in syntax is more important.

I don't like this one, at least for this release.  Performance is
absolutely crucial when speaking of WM modules, not to mention that
every UNIX under the sun has reasonable pipes, but we might have to do
some funky stuff, configure-wise, to support sockets.  They're pretty
standard so maybe not, but...

I like this one _but_ I recall someone mentioned using signals for this;
I think we should avoid that approach if possible.  Trying to handle
signals _and_ deal with writing to pipes can lead to lots of annoying,
non-trivial code to make it portable.  There are issues as to which
system calls are interruptable, which ones are interrupted by default,
etc.  Yuck.

Adding another out-of-band "unlock pipe" such as Tim mentions seems
viable, but I'm not sure how much work it is.

The args for Resize line up with the behavior of Maximize.
Unfortunately, Maximize can't be made to line up with Move. All in all
I'd say it works out okay.

	Start an xclock, place it with button 2 and try to resize.

I can confirm this as well, and I built from sratch just to double check.

I had the same thoughts as Paul on the syntax but otherwise count me as
in favor.

So I'm somewhat stuck trying to convert FvwmCommand and FvwmDebug
because both had the ability to display all the flags in their output
stream. I'm not sure how to make them read the new window_flags
structure without a lot of tedious code. FvwmCommand used to ouput a
line per flag member (if -i >1 and -F == 2) but this was easy because
it would just iterate over the flags ulong checking bits one by one.
FvwmDebug used to display the flags ulong as a hex representation.

I'm not sure that this is something we want anymore. If it is, the
FvwmCommand case is easy enough to handle, but involves lots of use of
the flag testing macros and lots of code. The FvwmDebug case is still
hard for me because I don't know of a way to treat a struct of
bitfields as an aggregate that doesn't cause compiler whining. I guess
I could change this behavior in FvwmDebug to something that is more
workable.

Anyway, has anyone got any ideas on how to proceed here?

	There really isn't any alternative: within the new flags structure C
doesn't allow you to make assumptions about the ordering of bytes within
a word, or words within the aggregate structure (it's now longer than a
long int on 32-bit boxen), or even the ordering of bits within a byte.

	It's a trade-off. The majority of the code that references the flags is
easier to read and to maintain with the new structure.

	There isn't; and if someone thinks of a way, chances are it'll Do the
Wrong Thing.

	As a side note, the reason these modules weren't caught during the GSFR
is that they used these low-level techniques to reference the flags.
Therefore they never caused any compiler errors when the old defines
were removed, and we overlooked them. We fixed what whined, and missed a
few things. I'm glad you're making the effort to go through all the
modules. It's tedious (yeah, you noticed that too, huh?), but needed.


Cheers,
Bob

Well, fair enough. I've added the code to FvwmCommand and all in all,
it wasn't too painful. The wonders of a good editor with a semi-robust
regex library... I'll commit my work on FvwmCommand pretty soon.

I thought so. So now I have a bit of a dilemma. There's no way to
mimic the old FvwmDebug behavior WRT flags. I could add a complete
flagging approach, but that would perhaps be overkill? 64 lines of
output per M_ADD_WINDOW/M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet is pretty
excessive, no? Perhaps it could be made a runtime option like in
FvwmCommand. Or perhaps even by passing the arg as part of the module
name. I.e., Module FvwmDebug displays no flag data; Module
FvwmDebugVerbose displays full flag data. Anyway, I very much doubt
FvwmDebug is of use to anyone besides fvwm-workers. Perhaps even an
#ifdef would suffice.

Anyway, beyond my basic ConfigWinPacket conversion in FvwmDebug, I'm
contemplating the following other changes, which I've already made: 1)
merge list_{add|configure} and list_old_{add|configure} into single
functions... No reason for all that duplicate code, IMHO; 2) Can pass
an output file name as argv[7] rather than being forced to accept
output to stderr. Of course, then you can't use module aliasing.

Yeah, I've noticed that. But it's actually not that bad. And it gets
me more familiar with things without requiring too much intelligence
on my part... ;>

I was wondering if you could add a "Pause <seconds>" or
a "WaitLastProcess" function that would (like Wait) stall
the execution of a parent function for synchronizing launched
(maybe non-X) apps.

Kev.

You can experiment with "PipeRead `sleep 10`" to get a pause.
Also, if I understand your request correctly, you can use PipeRead in the
first place, instead of Exec, to launch your non-interactive application
to be syncronized with. Redirect stdout to /dev/null if needed.

I hope this solves your problem.

Mikhael.

Maybe in the next unstable series (after 2.4).

It is possible in the developement versions. You can use a configurable
script fvwm-menu-directory that is installed together with the man page.

The first one is a pretty frequent request. I don't know where things
stand with it.

The second request has already been done. Take a look at
fvwm-menu-directory (it even has a manpage).

Sigh! Sometimes I think we're talking about different window
managers :-/  Of course I don't see anything of what you describe.
The bug is known for over a year though:  Somehow the stacking
ring gets out of order.  I had almost forgotten the problem
since nobody complained about it for a long time, but what you
say proves its still there.  I'd be very grateful if you can
strip down your config to the minimum necessary to demonstrate
the bug and provide detailed instruction how to get there from
the moment fvwm starts up.  You're probably right that layers
and transients are the crucial factors.  Perhaps the transients
have a different layer than their transientfor windows?  BTW,
which layers does FvwmIdent report for the three windows
(FvwmButtons, the transient and the transientfor)?

They can't be switched easily because the resize arguments
have to be parsed before the move arguments.  How about
a less confusing name, like 'Geometry' or 'WindowGeometry'?

Subject: changing layers of existing windows?

From: Michael Han <mikehan@best.com>

Am I unable to change a window's layer after it's been created/mapped?
Or perhaps I should rephrase that. I create an xterm in a bare X
session (no xinit ran). I use it to start fvwm2 from an empty rcfile.
I launch FvwmConsole and enter the commands:

Key F1 A N Module FvwmIdent
Style XTerm Layer 5

FvwmIdent displays the layer of both windows (both of which have the
Class XTerm) set to 4 (default). I start another xterm. Its layer is
5. It acts like a layer 5 window, while the two pre-existing windows
behave as if they were not layer 5 (old windows cannot be raised above
the new).

So I ask, can a window's layer be changed after it's been created? Is
this a bug?

I verified that the layers are correct via FvwmIdent. Here goes with
the process I follow:

1) Start fvwm2 from the following rcfile <<EOF
Style xterm Layer 5
Module FvwmConsole
Key F1 A N Module FvwmIdent
EOF
2) Start an xterm from the root menu
3) Start editres from xterm
4) Get Tree from somewhere in editres and pick any part of the widget
tree, so you can the "Show Resource Box"
5) The box is a transient in Layer 4 (hit F1 to confirm this)
6) Move FvwmConsole (which currently should be Layer 4) to overlap the
editres transient (I think you want to make sure it doesn't overlap
the xterm)
7) Raise FvwmConsole by clicking the title
8) Move FvwmConsole to overlap the xterm (should be Layer 5)
9) FvwmConsole should be placed above the xterm

I'm pretty much positive that this is caused by the transient. It's
strange to me that both editres (a core X11 app) and Netscape
transients demonstrate the same behavior.

The only strange thing about my X environment is that it's XFree86-4.0
as built from the FreeBSD ports tree. But I think this problem
predates my XFree upgrade (I upgraded this past weekend). Please tell
me that you can reproduce this...

Yup, checking for IS_MAPPED is sufficient.  I'll commit a fix.

Well, I hadn't expected so much feedback to my patch.  Thanks
for all the support.  Apart from the (now fixed) bug with
'0' args to a resize, there are several open syntax/naming
issues:

 1) Is there a better name for the 'bottomright' option?

 2) A better (less confusing) name for MoveResize. Suggestions:
     - ResizeMove (reflects order of arguments)
     - WindowGeometry
     - Geometry
     - SetGeometry

    I'll change the name to ResizeMove for now...

 3) Consistent naming of 'do not modify' arguments.  Currently
    Move uses '-', Resize uses '0' or '-' if bottomright is
    used (and don't ask about MoveResize).  Since the times
    of cryptic arguments like '-' and '0' have hopefully passed,
    I suggest 'keep' in both cases instead.  Although it's
    slightly more work to parse, you can understand it easily.

 4) I don't think 'MovedButton3' is a good name for the new
    condition, but I couldn't find a better one. Something
    like
      'InteractiveMoveOrInitialPlacementFinishedByButton3Press'
    would be clearer :-)

I suggest writing a perl script to generate the necessary code.
In fact I was already thinking about something like this.  What
I really need in my daily work is a way to dump window structures,
the Scr structure, the stack ring and a window list to stderr
without adapting the code every time one of these structures
changes.  Printing flags would be just a subset.

I think a startup option is enough.

No.  what if we ask somebody to provide us the output and (s)he
hasn't compiled it in?

Cleaning up duplicate code is always a good idea.
BTW, why are there *two* modules that print the same information,
i.e. Fvwm debug and FvwmCommand with the -m option?  I suggest
the following changes:

 a) Remove the -m option from FvwmCommand.
 b) Remove all module specific code from FvwmCommand.
    FvwmCommand can simply be an executable that is
    called from the command line only (e.g. FvwmCommand.bin)
 c) Write a wrapper script ("FvwmCommand") that acts as a module
    but throws away the module specific arguments and calls
    FvwmCommand.bin
 d) Move all packet printing code to FvwmDebug.

What purpose would that serve?  With any decent shell you can
easily redirect stderr into a file:

  $ FvwmCommand 'my_fvwm_func' 2> .FvwmCommand.log

BTW, why should anybody use an alias? There are no module
options that FvwmCommand or FvwmCommandS use.

I'm happy that you see it this way.  If we hadn't so many
people that are familiar with the module interface I'd have
to learn it myself :-)

Yup, with the 'Layer' command.  I ran into the same problem a few
hours ago.  This command is probably a legacy to the times when
you needed to 'Recapture' to apply styles.

> Is this a bug?

Maybe we should remove the Layer command before 2.4.  It was
introduced with 2.3.0, so it hasn't ever been part of any
stable release.  If we put it in 2.4, we'll never get rid of
it again.  Applying layer style changes is a bit tricky, but
I can do it.  What do the others think?

Bye

Ah... I forgot to look for a builtin, and assumed a Style would do it
all.

Well, it's like Style Sticky v. Stick... I think it's perfectly
alright to have both.

But I'm still a bit confused. Style Layer doesn't apply immediately.
It requires a Recapture. Is this intentional?

First of all, thanks for great window manager. I've been using various
flavours of fvwm for years, and every time when I try some other WM, I
come back to fvwm, because I like it better. Just like one of my
friends said about KDE: 'Yeah, it's great, looking nice, etc, but
won't beat well configured fvwm'

I have some requests for new features.

1) (most important for me)
  Minimize-function, which have parameters how to minimize: iconify,
or just set window height to zero, leaving titlebar there. 


2) I like to place my windows manually, but not some stupid
netcape-popups (transients). I'd like to have setting 'place windows
manually, keep popups with their parent'

3) Related to previous, would be nice if those tnasients would get
focus automatically, if their parent is focused

4) Possibility to select multiple windows for moving together. For
example olvwm haves rubberband for selecting windows. 

Once more, thank's for great WM!

Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.88.47)


Hello,

It would be nice if Fvwm had the following feature: LockFocus.
Suppose we have the following in our configuration file:

Mouse 0 3 N LockFocus

Then clicking on the appropriate window button would toggle the LockFocus
function on and off. When a particular window's LockFocus function is on 
other windows cannot gain the focus. Thus while cutting can still be
performed on other windows all pasting and typing automatically drops into
the LockFocus'ed window. Hence we do not have to keep on switching the
focus
for this kind of operation.

There are then two ways to turn LockFocus off:

(1) We turn the LockFocused's window focus off explicitly (e.g. by
clicking
    on the appropriate window button).
(2) We enable LockFocus on another window (which disables LockFocus on the
    previously LockFocus'ed window).

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

Very good. It is now possible to implement the original MaximizeFullScreen
example without RecaptureWindow. Still there is an unrelated problem when
restoring the original title/border/handle style settings, which is
currently impossible to do without hardcoding. Probably this can be
solved later together with individual window styles.

All good enhancements. Does any other WM have such flexibility? :)

Actually this is not quite a hack, but a fix of a broken behavior, when
non raise/lower actions are ignored for already raised/lowered windows.
I cleaned up comments and enabled this fix with your correction.
I think, the current detection in FvwmAuto is acceptably good, it works as
expected in most cases, and can be reversed by specifying another name.

> * Fixed FvwmWinList placement w/ TitleAtBottom and negative y geometry.

Yes, it works correctly now.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Paul,

what is the status of this bug report?  I have never seen this myself.
If this is still reproducible, can you please add it to Jitterbug?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

     [reported on 3-Jun-1999 by Rob Urban <urban@spielwiese.de>]
     [still unreproducible; remove from the list?]
 16) Try to fix the 'netscape stuck on page' problem.
     [reported on 17-May-1999 by <jason@sdf.lonestar.org>]
 17) Fix the bug that causes icons to lose management (bug #352).
     [couldn't reproduce this yet; can anybody who has netcool
     event manager try it?]
 32) Several applications are reported to not resize well under fvwm
     (Datek's "Streamer", CodeWarrior).
     [optional]
107) "Recapture" while an icon is focused takes several seconds.
     [reported by Mikhael; confirmed by Dominik]
110) Running two FvwmAuto modules at one freezes fvwm.
     [reported by Olivier on 15-Apr-2000]
     [problem identified but not solved]
116) Fix problem that can cause long icon titles to be expanded
     although the pointer is not over it.
     [reported by Mikhael]
117) Investigate icons disappearing if icon changes while on a
     different desk.
     [reported by Julian Gilbey/David Cunningham on 16-Mar-2000]
118) Investigate "FvwmPager & StaysOnTop" bug (#543).
     [reported by Nadim Shaikli <nadim.shaikli@intel.com>]
     [in progress, reproduced by Mike Han]
119) MaxSwallow does not work in FvwmWharf e.g. with
     'xload -g 50x50'.
     [reported by Dominik]

     gaps after page switching (with IconBox).

     [confirmed by Dominik (hard to reproduce)]
121) Investigate FvwmPager core dump.
     [reported by Wing Tung Leung <tg@skynet.be> on 20-Feb-2000]
122) Investigate FvwmButtons panel problem.
     [reported by Robert H. Ford II <rhford2@lucent.com> on 18-Feb-2000]
123) Bug #378
124) Bug #477
125) Bug #479
126) Bug #489
127) Bug #511
128) Bug #564
129) Bug #560
130) Fix bounds error with 'DestroyStyle *' in
     update_window_color_hi_style().

     [not reproduced yet]
132) Tru64 sizeof(unsigned long) problem

140) Remove "Layer" command?  Instead, the "Layer" styles
     can be applied immediately w/o Recapture.
141) Remove "MoveSmoothness" command?  I wrote it back when
     window motion was very jerky due to excessive network
     traffic, but I guess it's not very useful.

143) Bug #603 (TaskBar bugs): investigate and possibly fix.
144) Bug #604 (ActivePlacements doesn't work if FvwmAnimate

     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has
     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]
 22) Investigate bug #290. (windows cannot be raised over others sometimes).
     [mail thread from April; confirmed by me (Dominik)]
     [fixed; there is a new style and the behaviour is a bit more intuitive]
 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
 24) Investigate bug #314.
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)
     [fixed; only in 2.2.2, caused by missing X error handler]
 26) Investigate bug #315. (Recapture doesn't work perfectly for changing the
     default decor).
     [mainly a documentation problem; man page was updated]
 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
 28) Investigate FvemEvent core dumps.
     [fixed in 2.2.3, no bug in 2.3.4]
 29) Fix the pager bugs I reported recently.

 31) 'Maximize grow grow' works only on the current page.
 37) Fix interaction of moving with autoraising icon titles.
 38) Investigate bug #389. (StartsOnDesk does not work)
     [configuration problem, added a warning to the code]
 39) Investigate bug #390

 41) Fix hanging fvwm when moving GNOME menu bars (bug #395).
 42) Get bitmap icons working again.
 43) Several pager bugs (bug #379).
 44) Fix TaskBar crash caused by latest patch in RemoveButton().
 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.
 51) Fix constraining the window size when a window is maximized or
     larger than MaxWindowSize when mapped.
 52) Allow to resize in client resize increment steps.
 53) Decide what to do with overlapping moved icons.
     [will be ignored]

 55) FvwmGtk can't be killed with 'KillModule'.
 56) Mini icons may overlap menu titles.

     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.
 66) Fix ddd problems.

 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a

 74) To fix: icons are not preserved over a Quit - Start for fvwm
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.

 79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?
     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.
 98) Allow using colours from colour sets in fvwm commands.
 99) Make HilightColors command colour set aware.
100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set
     is changed (*FvwmPagerColorset).
109) FvwmIconMan titles don't seem to work.
111) Fix position hints not working with menus invoked
     from a menu like this: 'addtomenu foo foo menu foo root c c'
112) Fix desk flipping with
       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.
135) FvwmWinList doesn't handle negative geometries properly
     with TitleAtBottom.
136) Implement a FlushUpdates command to apply style changes
     within a function?
     [nope; enhanced Refresh/RefreshWindow instead]
137) Bug #550 (FvwmAuto raises after 'lower')

Ugh, of course.  Can you please *document* this behaviour in

Nope.  I think this is the one you gave me all the hints on
and eventually I tracked it down.

Around   the same  time I  was   complaining about getting interactive
placement for  off screen windows.  I subsequently  found out that was
documented behavior for ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage.
I changed to RandomPlacement for things I start on other pages.

Fvwm is working 100% for me.

I believe, this problem is not for 2.4. Here it is since you ask.

# -------------------------------------------------------------
Key F11 W SC MaximizeFullScreen
Key F12 W SC UnMaximizeFullScreen

DestroyFunc MaximizeFullScreen
AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
+ I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
+ I WindowId "$w" RefreshWindow
+ I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

DestroyFunc UnMaximizeFullScreen
AddToFunc   UnMaximizeFullScreen
+ I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
+ I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5
# =============================================================

As you can see, the last line is hard-coded, you can't just restore the
previous state for title/handle/border. Possible solution: to add UnStyle
command (or DestroyStyleOptions), undoing last style entries having
specified style options. But giving the current merging, this can work
only for Style on individual windows, i.e. [Un]Style (WindowId $w) ...

Regards,
Mikhael.

Try this function:

  AddToFunc MyMinimize
  + "i" $0

and call it with "MyMinimize WindowShade" or "MyMinimize Iconify".
I don't see why this should be better that calling Iconify or
WindowShade directly.

Well, that's only a question of the proper style.  I think all
netscape popups have a '_popup' in their resource name, so you
should be able to say

  Style "*" ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement
  Style "*_popup" RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
 
(the order of these statements does matter).

Try out the GrabFocusTransient style (available in the latest betas).

But making a window sticky is something you frequently use
on individual windows while changing the layer is probably
really a style reference.

Yes, I think so.  Every style is applied during a Recapture.

Gack! Um, why would you want to do that?  I guess that's the
case for each and every style that does not simply toggle a
flag.

I was just going to ask.  You reported some problems with
xemacs back then.  Something about fvwm not capturing the
xemacs frame and something else about icons.  If you say
100%, does this mean these problems are gone too?

	Hmmm...I think I'd be more likely to want to apply it on the fly to an
individual window that I suddenly decided I wanted to raise above a
bunch of others that were in a higher layer. I think that's very much
analogous to the Stick command.

No luck.  I'm still thining about how to best debug this.
The best solution would be if you could do it without any
further help :-)  Can you attach a debugger to your fvwm
and single step through the code?  I guess there must be
something wrong in stack.c, but I don't know where.  It's
probably a good idea to write a function that prints the
stack ring and use it often throughout the code, then
every so often verify if the stack ring is still okay.
Something like

  fprintf(stderr,"current stack ring:\n");
  for (t=Scr.FvwmRoot.stack_next;t!=&Scr.FvwmRoot;t=t->stack_next)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"  window: '%s', layer %d\n", t->name, t->layer);
  }

And put a

  fprintf(stderr,"ef: '%s'\n", Action);

at the start of ExecuteFunction() to see what function is going
to be executed.  To get a debugger attached to fvwm, start a second
X server and run fvwm on it, then fire up the debugger from your
first X server.  I run the second X server from a menu with

  exec xinit /bin/sleep 100000 -- :1

Then run fvwm with -d :1.

Perhaps.  I think the use model for the layers is to apply
them to a specific kind of window (e.g. a clock that stays in
the background or a panel that stays on top).  Well, I'm
planning to make styles applicable to individual windows
after 2.4.  We'll definitely not need a layer command then
anymore (neither a stick command).

I'll give this a try this weekend.

In the meantime, I've been thinking about this problem and I
remembered a something that maybe is related. Long ago in the distant
past there was a bug in fvwm that I remember whining about. The
problem was that transients for StaysOnTop windows would map and then
immediately fall beneath their parents as the parent was raised above
the transient. Ring any bells? I'm wondering if what I'm seeing is
fallout from the fix... Anyway, I'll try to dig deeper with this
problem and the other one I reported (focus goes nowhere on
menu-invoked destroy of motif windows until an EnterNotify is given
to the last window to have focus).

Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.88.47)


There seems to be a bug in parameter expansion:

The string '$$2' should be expanded to '$2' but Fvwm seems to first expand
it to '$2' and then to the actual value of the function parameter $2
making it impossible to produce a literal '$2'.

For example:

AddToFunc MyFunc "I" Exec echo 111 222 333 | /bin/awk  '{ print $$2 }' >
myfile

should execute:

echo 111 222 333 | /bin/awk '{ print $2 }' > myfile

Thus I should get

$ cat myfile
222

but instead I get

$ cat myfile
111 222 333

     I came across a very strange problem.
     I am running fvwm (1.2r/2.2.4) window manager. I just opened two xterm
windows and typed "date 050411002000" in the prompt to set the date and
time. I moved the mouse to other xterm window and clicked (focus is set to
"clicktofocus" in .fvwmrc). The focus is not coming to the second xtrem
window. It was coming after a long time or sometime not. In this case, I
have to restart X. Sometimes the focus is there when issue "date
050411002000" command for the first time. when I say again second time
"date 050411002000", the focus is lost. Instead of second xterm, run some
other application which uses colors, The color becomes black and white.

    The samething I tried with mwm. It is working fine.

When compiling fvwm-2.3.16, I used the following configure command:

(Line broken up for readability)

CC=cc CFLAGS="-O4" ./configure
	--with-xpm-library=/freeware/lib/libXpm.a

The ending configuration report came out (note ReadLine message):

Configuration:

I noted a line above with an asterisk, which I repeat (wrapping it in
the process) below:

configure:2860:  cc -o conftest -O4 conftest.c -lreadline
    /freeware/lib/libreadline.a -ltermcap 1>&5

In other words, configure is attempting to use "-lreadline" and
"/freeware/lib/libreadline.a" in the same line.  This is plain wrong!
I want readline to be taken from /freeware/lib/libreadline.a and not
from any other library.

I think I have found a workaround (setting LDFLAGS manually), but this
appears to be a bug in the configure script.

I just tried and I can't reproduce it.  IIRC someone committed a fix
relatively shortly after I sent the email (a few days).  I haven't seen

Sure, but I don't see how this is any better than the simpler approach
of doing the select, processing all the FDs which have changed, then
looping and doing another select.

  dv> I'm not sure how select() works exactly.

It's pretty trivial: you invoke it with a set of FDs you want to wait
for; as soon as data is ready in any one or more of them (or you
timeout, if you set one) select() returns, and bits are set for each of
the FDs with data ready.

In a robust, efficient implementation you'd then process each of the
ready FDs in the set, then loop back around to the select to wait for
more data.  There's no requirement that you _do_ process all that data
(select will just return immediately if one of the FDs in the set has
data when you invoke it, of course) and there's no requirement that you
always select with the same set of FDs; you can change them before every
call if you like.

"Waiting" here, of course, is time spent hanging out in the kernel so
your process is completely idle and not consuming any CPU resources.

These functions implement Alt-Enter in some known OS (this was a request
from someone). But unlike this OS, where all windows have the same decors,
fvwm can have windows with and without titlebar/handle/border. After
S-C-F11 & S-C-F12 you should get the original decors (not toggle, undo).

Do you have a better solution? Actually, I think, an idea with undo-able
Style commands (using UndoableStyle, disallowing merging, and UndoStyle)
is good by itself. It can be used, for example, by a simple interface for
applying individual window styles with a possibility to try and cancel.
An alternative implementation of UndoStyle can be StoreStyle, RestoreStyle.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

It would be really nice if the errors reported by
fvwm2 in the .xsession-errors file came with line
numbers for quickly identifying sources of error.
This would be especially useful for debugging large
and highly customized configuration fies.

Thanks,

Neil

The style code was no written to be undo-able, you know.  You are right,
we don't want to think about this before 2.4 :-)

Belive it or not, it happens for me too (2.3.17, i.e. latest development
code.  I'll investigate what's going on.

Rooting around in sunsolve, I found this ancient bugreport:

Make gives error "Too many rules defined for target xxx" when the target
name is the same as a make include file name which is under SCCS control.

Which is dated 5 Jun 1994, #1037634. Yes, you probably need a sunsolve
login to view the report.

It looks like it fits the description, so I'm guessing you have an
file named screen.h under SCCS control. Uh, Sun doesn't appear to
propose any kind of fix for this error. My earlier suggestion of gmake
is probably going to get hit by an error, too. I don't really know
what to do about this.

Why would gmake report this error?  It doesn't have this bug (it
probably has _other_ bugs, but not _this_ bug :).

Anyway, I've forgotten what little I once knew about SCCS, but you must
have some environment variable set or something to the SCCS root if it's
finding files under SCCS.  You should be able to keep it from finding
any files under SCCS easily, if this is indeed the problem.

Well, I'm not really certain that it's to be classified a bug, unless
it's a bug in the default rules used by make. My assumption is that
the default make rules that support automagic SCCS (ISTR RCS support
is also automagic with some make(1)s) will always be confused by the
presence of a file named in this way, and that it is, as a result, not
a bug but a feature... ;>

But I suppose that somehow hiding the presence of the SCCS stuff is
the way to go. I just don't know a thing about SCCS, so wouldn't know
how to do that. Hopefully Ali knows, since he is the one (apparently)
using SCCS.

You need to understand how fvwm parses its configuration file.
When you run fvwm withour arguments, it executes the command

  Read <config file>

where <config file> is .fvwm2rc or (if this doesn't exist
system.fvwm2rc).  If you preprocess the config file you
run it with "-cmd FvwmM4/FvwmCpp $HOME/.fvwm2rc".  I.e.

  Read <config file>

is replaced by

  FvwmM4 <config file>

FvwmM4/Cpp work exactly like Read, except that they run
the preprocessor over the file before passing it to fvwm.
Thus, if FvwmM4 is invoked in the config file, you can't
use it to preprocess the config file anymore because that
step has already passed.

Since you simply put "FvwmM4" in the config file, the
module simply didn't know which file to parse.  Had you
used

  FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc

this would have started an endless loop because the file
would have been parsed again *from the start*, not from
behind the FvwmM4 command.

In short:

You can use the preprocessor modules from within the config
file or a menu to parse *other* files:

.fvwm2rc:
--------------------------
# parse sub config files
FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.styles
FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.menustyles
Read .fvwm2rc.modules

# menus
AddToMenu RootMenu
+ "Reset styles" FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.styles
...
--------------------------

Bye

 58) DeskTopSize is not honoured upon a restart (the old one is reused).
     [use Restart --dont-preserve-state]
 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]
 60) Make MaxWindowSize a style (don't release a command that will
     change anyway).
 61) Get SidecPics working again.
 63) Fix stacking order in pager.
 64) Install the new web pages.
 65) Fix "maximize true ..." when a window is already maximized.
 66) Fix ddd problems.
     [fixed as far as possible; bug reported to ddd list]
 67) Add a Windoze95 like screenshot to the web page.
 68) Investigate 'Xlib: sequence lost' message.
     [went away with a newer snapshot]
 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.
 70) Fix resize. On one hand it's not nice that you can drag the window
     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.
 72) Finish implementing colour sets for modules.
     [item split up]
 73) Remove 'panel' feature from FvwmButtons and re-implement it in a
     less disruptive way.
 74) To fix: icons are not preserved over a Quit - Start for fvwm
 75) Implement colour sets in FvwmWharf.
 76) Implement colour sets in FvwmTaskBar.
 77) Implement colour sets in menu styles.
 78) Implement colour sets in window styles.
     [only colours used yet]
 79) Implement colour sets in FvwmConsole?
     [rejected]
 80) Implement colour sets in FvwmScript
 81) Change the way in which fvwm 'posts' menus with a click.
 82) Introduce a 'transient' option for FvwmButtons. This is needed
     to replicate the old panel behaviour.
 83) Fix FvwmIconMan crashes introduced by colour set support(?)
     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.
     [future enhancement]
 86) Finish code for setting backgrounds of other applications with
     colour sets.
 87) Describe what to do for colour set support in the module docs.
 88) Investigate 'pager out of sync' problem
     [fixed]
 89) Make FvwmScript use the same visual as fvwm (prerequisite for 80)
 91) Fix Xpm version problem (bug #463).
 93) Finish 'CREATING PANELS' section in FvwmButtons man page.
 96) Make flat titlestyle work again.
 97) Rewrite FvwmTheme 'Colorset' syntax ala MenuStyle.

100) Remove I18N patches since author seems to have lost interest
     in finishing the patch.
     [leave it in, started to rewrite patch in a better way]
101) Finish current work on style changes w/o recapture in a
     consistent way. This doesn't necessarily mean that the
     feature has to be complete before 2.4.
102) Patch 'UseDecor' and 'UseStyle' styles and various ...Style
     commands to apply without a recapture.
     [finished except UseStyle]
103) Add recent bug reports to to-do list.
104) Fix FvwmCommandS core dumps on X server shutdown.
108) FvwmPager desk separators are not updated if their colour set
     is changed (*FvwmPagerColorset).
109) FvwmIconMan titles don't seem to work.
111) Fix position hints not working with menus invoked
     from a menu like this: 'addtomenu foo foo menu foo root c c'
112) Fix desk flipping with
       shade-iconify-move_to_other_page-deiconify-unshade
     (and equivalent bug with maximize instead of shade).
113) FvwmForm sets no class/resource.
114) FvwmIdent sets no class/resource.
115) FvwmWharf sets no class/resource.
131) Sticky windows move to the top in the pager view if the desk is
     changed.
135) FvwmWinList doesn't handle negative geometries properly
     with TitleAtBottom.

     within a function?

Here's another one of your bug lists.  Let's see if we
agree on the status of the items.  As far as I know, all
of them are either resolved or on the to do list:

> 1) PlaceAgain is really broken (giant coordinates).

fixed

> 2) Canceling of icon move shows canseling, but does not really cancel.

fixed

> 3) "All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow" while an icon is focused
>    takes several seconds.

on to-do list
 
> 4) 'Menu mymenu This +NUM +NUM' in submenus crashes fvwm.
 
fixed

> 5) Position hints 'Menu' and 'Item' in submenus seem incorrect.

fixed

> 6) Title not in the menu top does not respect top VerticalTitleSpacing.

fixed

> 7) Create 2 xterms, execute "Pick All ($r) Iconify" in the root menu.
>    One of icons (of the last focused xterm) has expanded title.
>    If you bind this menu to decorations - no bug, but if it's in sub-Menu
>    of the bound menu the bug is shown again. Works without Pick if bound.

on to-do list
 
> 8) FvwmWharf and FvwmIdent do not set resource class and name.

done
 
> 9) Redudant space in WindowList's geometry. Is there a reason for this?
 
fixed

> 10) --disable-session in configure and list SESSION support in --version.
 
done

> 11) $n, $c, $r in functions are expanded without escaping for names with
>     a single quote inside, i.e. you get 'it's', which is incorrect.

done

Mikhael,

I'd like to look through this old pager bug list you reported
and find out what to do with each of the items:

Dominik Vogt wrote:

> Please hack this as an enhancement request into Jitterbug.

I just had a look at the code.  It *does not* default to
desk 0 but to the currently active desk number (but unlike
'*' the shown desk remains the same if you switch desks.
If we removed this functionality we would need a syntax
change.  I'm unwilling to do that for the sake of simplicity.

I think that one was fixed afterwards, right?

I suggest to leave it this way.

Put on to-do list.

I'd not make any change unless pager starts taking keyboard input.

Enhancement request (post 2.4).

No fix (hack into Jitterbug).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
--------

Fixed:
 2, 9

Do nothing about:
 1, 3, 5 (not a bug), 8 (xterm bug)

Put on to-do list:
 4

Enhancement requests (hack into Jitterbug):
 6

Document in Jitterbug/FAQ/...:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We need to reach an agreement on these items asap so that I can
finalise the to-do list.

Mike, is that still an issue?  We'd definitely have to fix it before 2.4.

I tried some things such as:

"FvwmM4 /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc"

/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc"

but when I restart I get a totally different configuration menu than the
one I set up. My config file /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc has no M4 stuff
in it (yet) and hence should not be modified upon restarting.

The following works fine but no M4 stuff can be preprocessed this way:

+              "Restart Fvwm2" Restart /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 -cmd "Read
/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc"

BTW, all three mouse buttons pop up a builtin menu when I
restart with -cmd "FvwmM4 /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc"

The relevant .xsession-errors are:

stdin: is not a tty

and

NONE:0: m4: ERROR: EOF in string
NONE:0: m4: ERROR: EOF in string
NONE:0: m4: ERROR: EOF in string


Thanks,

Neil

This part worries me; were you considering using a pipe for this
queue, or an IPC message queue (ulp!), or an in-memory linked list
creation or something? I think that we need to be able to block and
consume no CPU while we're waiting for our UNLOCK message. Now we can
block OK on an empty pipe, but then if we receive a message and it
isn't the one we want then we can't write the message back because
that would make our pipe readable again. This would give us a very
CPU-intensive loop.

The portability / interruptibility considerations of using IPC message
queues make me shudder - you can't select() on an IPC message queue,
for instance. The queue also wouldn't necessarily get cleaned up
automatically if FVWM core-dumped (never happen, I'm sure ... ;-)),
meaning that the user would have to do that him/herself. Hoewever, on
the plus-side, at least with message queues you could ask to receive
*only* UNLOCK type messages, regardless of what else might be on the
queue. 

If we used an in-memory linked-list kind of queue then I can't see any
other way of blocking except calling sleep(). This would affect FVWM's
responsiveness because we wouldn't be able to "wake-up" when data
arrived unless we used signals.

Can you elaborate on any of this, please Tim / Paul (PDS) / anyone ?

Cheers,
Chris.

No problem, it was more a suggestion than a bug report.

Yes and no. The original suggestion was to handle BalloonYOffset as offset
from window borders, currenty it is handled as gap height. I have a
trivial patch (adding -1 and +1 in two places), which does this. I.e. if
you specify offset 1 or -1 there is no gap.

I can apply it if you agree. Otherwise we leave this as it is.

I'm Tim meant an in-memory queue, maintained by FVWM.  When messages we
don't want are received from the pipe they're pushed onto this queue;
then My_XNextEvent() (I guess) would read from that queue first, before
going back to selecting on the FDs.

I'm not quite sure what you mean here.  I agree that Tim's thoughts need
a little more fleshing out, but I see no reason offhand why what he
proposes wouldn't work.

I can see two possible ways to do this, either or both of which might be
silly (I'm really not as familiar with the intricacies of module
messaging as I should be).

 1) We introduce one new pipe, solely for UNLOCK messages.  That same
    pipe would be given to all modules.  The UNLOCK message would have to
    have some indication of what module sent it.  This change the module
    invocation interface, of course.

    Now fvwm can select on just that pipe when it wants to wait for
    UNLOCK, without reading any other messages.  We have a real
    out-of-band queue, and we don't have to create an in-memory queue
    since we won't be reading "normal" messages at all.

    Issues: if we want to wait for certain UNLOCKs we may still need a
    queue of "other" UNLOCKs we got while waiting for the one we
    wanted.  I don't know exactly what's needed here.

    Issue 2: the possibility of deadlock is very real here.  Anyone
    using sync would have to tread very carefully to ensure they will
    always process the LOCK and respond with an UNLOCK without needing
    to wait on the normal, inband messaging.

 2) We have an in-memory queue of messages; when we're waiting for an
    UNLOCK we read the normal message queues, but if we don't get an
    UNLOCK we stuff the message we did get onto the internal queue.
    Then the function that reads messages will read that queue, if it
    exists, first and process messages in it before it does any select()
    to get more messages.

No, this was fixed about a week after I reported it. I think that
Brad found the fix? Or was it Tim?

This solved the problem.
I now consider this a documentation bug.

Without Animate, ActivePlacement is sufficient to enforce interactive placement
on my system. I never mentioned smart/dumb/random placement in the .fvwm2rc file
before now.

>From the man page:

              RandomPlacement causes windows which would normally
              require user placement to be  automatically  placed
              in ever-so-slightly random locations.  For the best

                        late 20th century                      55

FVWM(2.xx)                                             FVWM(2.xx)

              of all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and
              SmartPlacement.

              SmartPlacement  causes windows which would normally
              require user placement to be  automatically  placed
              in  a  smart location - a location in which they do
              not overlap any other windows on the screen.  If no
              such position can be found user placement or random
              placement (if specified) will be used  as  a  fall-
              back  method.   For the best of all possible worlds
              use both RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement.

Note that ActivePlacement and DumbPlacement are never specifically defined. It's
easy to misinterpret this to mean that there are three possible behaviors:
ActivePlacement, RandomPlacement, and SmartPlacement, which falls back on random
when stumped.

I would be happy to write a paragraph for the man page which covers this.

Would you guys like that?
Should I send diffs?

I was referring to FvwmDebug here. Based on my understanding of how
modules get started, you can't do things like output redirects when
you start a module, hence it needs to be handled otherwise, no? As far
as aliasing goes, I see no reason anyone would use it -- I only
mention it because it's fairly standard behavior for modules to
support argv[6] as an alias.

I'm not sure I understand what you propose. FvwmCommandS still has to
run, right? If we throw away the listening capability in FvwmCommand,
what you'll end up with, basically, is a wrapper that knows how to
talk to the file descriptors that FvwmCommandS sets up. We could
conceivably make it a single pipe that's one way into FvwmCommandS to
simplify further. I see no reason to continue to support FvwmCommand's
debug features, but I'm not sure what else you're proposing.

I just rebuilt and was running FVWM with no configuration to do some
testing when I discovered that parameter expansion seems to be broken.
When I use the builtin binding for Mouse 1 in title I get a message
back that $0 isn't a recognized command. I take it that parameter
expansion is broken?

[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command '$0'

To be exact.

Hi, 
I Accidentally issued this command in FvwmConsole:

BorderStyle ActiveUp TiledPixmap blobby-blue.xpm
and got this error:
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> unknown style ctiveUp: (null)
                                               ^^--No A!
but, in my systems error console I get:
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> unknown style ActiveUp: ActiveUp
TiledPixmap blobby-blue.xpm

I thought it was wierd that there is a missing 'A' in the first one. So
I send this.

Thanks,
sa

How strange. I cannot reproduce this error... Hmm... What OS/hardware
are you on (`uname -a` please). Are you sure you're running
FvwmConsole from today's CVS (i.e. is your ModulePath correctly
detecting the FvwmConsole you installed)?

Did you notice that FvwmCommand itself can be started as a module?
Usually you start it from the command line and then it talks with
FvwmCommandS.  But if you start it as a module with '-m' it talks
to fvwm directly to dump module packets.  This is exactly what
FvwmDebug does, i.e. duplicate code.

Yep, I only have FvwmConsole installed in one place
/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.17/FvwmConsole.
...
I fooled around some more and got some more weird stuff. Again the
errors sent to my system console look normal.

? I don't see where in the code it can do that. When I try it it just
complains that it has no FDs and exits. Which is perfectly alright, I
think. Can FvwmCommand be invoked as a module? I thought there was a
strict separation: FvwmCommandS must start and must be started as a
module. FvwmCommand must be invoked at the commandline and talk to
FvwmCommandS...

In any event, I'm all for stripping out all the code in FvwmCommand
except that which is used for sending messages to fvwm via an existing
FvwmCommandS.

I don't know if this works.  There was something about a
race condition when you move directly from the mini window
into the balloon window without moving over another window.
I'm not against applying it, but double check if the race
condition shows up (the balloon window will start to flicker).

Well, then consider it a workaround.

Sorry, you're right, I must have been looking at the wrong source file.
FvwmCommande can *not* be invoked as a module.

I just updated on my work machine after three weeks, and now I can't
compile FvwmGtk anymore:

  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../..  -I/usr/X11R6/include \

  FvwmGtk.c:29: gnome.h: No such file or directory

from FvwmGtk.c:

  #ifdef NEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H
  #include <gnome.h>
  #else

Any ideas why NEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H suddenly is defined?
BTW, I configured with "./configure" - no options.

fvwm does not define NEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H, my guess is it is generated by
gnome-config --cflags. Or by other *-config --cflags, I can't test.

Both gnome-config and gnome.h are parts of the same package, IIUC,
Do you have the first and no the second?

Mikhael.

At least neither gnome-config nor gtk-config generate these.

What two packets do you mean?  BTW, I didn't change the setup on this

If 'gnome-config --cflags gnorba gnomeui' does not produce this -D,
I give up for now.

I didn't mention 2 packets anywhere. :-) I mean, both files
gnome-config and gnome.h are parts of one package: gnome-libs-devel (RH)
or gnlibsd (SuSE). If you have gnome-config, you should have gnome.h
in /usr/include or /opt/gnome/include.

Could you try running FvwmDebug? It should output errors to stderr,
giving you two copies of each error on fvwm's stderr. I'm trying to
figure out if this is a problem with the module interface on your
machine or something specific in FvwmConsole. I see something that
looks like it might be suspect, but I'm not sure. BTW, do you happen
to know if byte-ordering on PPC differs from x86? I believe it does.

yeh PPC, byte ordering is different, I'm not really sure of the
difference, but its byte ordering is called big-endian. 

Here is some FvwmDebug stuff,
***in FvwmConsole:

BorderStyle foobar
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> unknown style oobar: (null)

***from FvwmDebug

So I'm poking around in the module interface trying to figure out what
might be going on with the problem reported by sa@space.itacs.to
(strange output of errors in FvwmConsole and FvwmDebug). While I was
looking at fvwm/module_interface.c (make_named_packet) I notice the
line:

*len = FvwmPacketHeaderSize + num + (strlen(name) / sizeof(unsigned
long)) + 1;

In which len is to be the number of ulongs in the packet... Wouldn't
this truncate chars if the string failed to align on ulong boundaries?
Or am I getting confused? Basically, shouldn't the above be:

*len = FvwmPacketHeaderSize + num +
       (strlen(name) / sizeof(unsigned long)) +
       (strlen(name) % sizeof(unsigned long)) ? 1 : 0) + 1;

Unfortunately, I don't think this has any relevance to the problem I'm
trying to figure out, but it just struck me as odd.

No, I don't have gnome.h (otherwise I wouldn't get the error

This means that if you have an integer value (4 bytes), e.g.
0x12345678, this is stored as 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 in memory
while the order is 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 in little endian (or
the other way round, I can never remember which is which).

This all looks seriously broken.  Are you using 2.2.x or one
of the 2.3.x betas?

No that calculation is correct:

  strlen    bytes to store string    ulongs
  0                1                   1
  1                2                   1
  2                3                   1
  3                4                   1
  4                5                   2
  5                6                   2
  ...              ...                 ...

I think you forgot to consider the byte for the terminating zero
and the '+1' at the end of the line.

Yeah, I always get this confused too. The core question I was trying
to answer was whether the byte ordering differs between x86 and ppc. I
figured a byte-ordering problem could result in the kind of problem
being reported, since we pack chars into the body, which are ulongs...

These are actually okay. The 'style' tokens are supposed to be present
in the fvwm_msg() calls in the functions referenced. Well, perhaps I
should say that that's the way the code generates the message
currently. Whether anyone thinks that's what they're supposed to do is
a separate matter... And the unknown packet types are M_ERROR packets.
I foolishly advised him to run FvwmDebug, forgetting that handling for
M_ERROR packets is one of the improvements I've made locally that
hasn't been committed in CVS... Oops. Anyway, I sent a patch so we can
see what FvwmDebug shows with these errors. We should get an idea if
the problem is systematically related to the module interface or if
its something funny about FvwmCommand.

He reports using CVS as of two days ago.

Hello,
I've got a lot of problems with "expansion of command".
In particular I've got the following core dump:

Core was generated by `fvwm2'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Erreur de segmentation..

I've never heard of anything like this, but if Sun's make is looking
at some SCCS data,  unsetting $SCCS would help.

In ksh:

unset SCCS

'bottomright' and 'br' are ok with me.

This should be an action, so either the first or the last.
If you don't like ResizeMove, I'd suggest SetGeometry, like:

	Exec  xterm    -geometry 80x40+60+20
	Next (xterm) SetGeometry 80 40 60 20

Let it be 'keep'.

I suggest 'PlacedByMouse3'.

Okay, so after going around with this a bit, here's my proposal for
FvwmDebug. Changed features:

1) optional -v flag for verbose packet output
2) optional filename arg to direct output, since shell redirection
doesn't appear to be an option when invoking a module

A lot of cleanup to support more packet types (including M_ERROR).
Streamline the packet handlers by handling packet types with the same
general contents with a single function, rather a unique function per
packet type... i.e., rather than separate functions for M_ADD_WINDOW
and M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW, you get a single function that handles either.
If that sounds okay, I'll go ahead and commit what I have.

That should be the last module to be converted to ConfigWinPacket
bodies.

Unfortunately that doesn't hit the spot exactly.  The flag is
set also when you used 'Move' and finished it with button 3.
But it's still better than MovedButton3.

Does that mean I can close the 'Tru64' bug report then?

Hi, I've fixed my problem, it was in fvwm_msg(), I was reading
vsprintf's man page and came across this snipet.

-- nout = vsprintf(str,format,varlist);
-- ...
-- After a call to "vsprintf", the "varlist" variable should be assumed
-- to be in an undefined state. If you want to use "varlist" again, you
-- must call "va_end" to clean up, then "va_start" to reinitialize it.

anyways this psuedo patch fixes my problems. (mabey a va_end should be
added too?)

thanks,
sa

I haven't tested with the latest CVS in a week or 2.  (Too busy.)

This morning I find simple arg substitution is broken. These commands:

DestroyFunc Ftest
AddToFunc Ftest I Exec echo "args $0 $1"
Ftest a b

print "/bin/ksh" on my console.

I  assume this is the  reason the built-in  Meta-Tab window list isn't
working either.

Uh, oh, I guess we'll have to use configure the v*printf functions
and provide a private replacement then?

I don't think so.  I think this must be assumed for all types of
functions that take variadic arguments.  At least, my close reading of
the Solaris man page for vsprintf, while it's not so blunt, seems to
imply the same.

Certainly it's true in the C standard that once you walk through
argument lists with va_arg(), you must run va_end() and then va_start()
again before you can restart the walk.  It's not clear (to me) from the
standard whether that holds true if you invoke a function that calls the
va_arg() for you, but I see no reason to assume that it isn't.  For
example, the type of va_list is opaque and could _very_ well be a pointer
to a structure; then passing that pointer to a sub-function which uses
va_arg() would change the contents of the structure for the parent
function as well.

Anyway, it certainly can't hurt anything to program defensively here
even in situations where it's not necessary, so we can just do that; we
don't need configure checks for this (writing that--bleah! :).

E.g., this patch.  I can commit it, unless I missed something.

I see this sort of thing all the time.

Wouldn't it be better to provide a more feature-rich, configurable
debugging library for FVWM so we could just _leave_ all that debugging
stuff in there, but people wouldn't normally see it?

I have a macro-ized (so it evals to nothing if you want to compile out
debugging) little debugging library (one .c and one .h) which provides a
standard format for messages that include filename/linenumber
information, a "debugging level" feature that lets you classify
debugging messages so you can choose a level of verbosity, etc. that I'd
be happy to contribute.  You can set the level either from within the
code or via environment variables, and output can be written to stderr
or to a logfile.

It's not perfect: for example, you can't classify debugging messages by
"area" (as in print only the debugging messages associated with module
messages).  But, I think it's better than adding/removing printfs all
the time :)

If anyone is interested I can throw it in.

Hm, I don't know if I'd actually use it (I don't have to think when
throwing in a fprintf).  What I'd definitely need though is a
mechanism to filter out only messages used to debug a specific
problem.  E.g. each printf gets an 'id' and I can specify to
print out only messages with a certain id.

I read the Linux man page and I can find nothing implying this

Go ahead.  There are several more files that use v*printf.
I didn't check if they need patching, though.

My thoughts too, there already is the DBUG macro. I keep it off because
turning it on produces too much.  Maybe if the function called byt the
DBUG macro had a filter controllable at run time it would be more
useful. It would be nice if the macro knew the name of the function it
was called from too.

It's designed to be just as simple as that, if not moreso (you don't
need to specify a FILE* like you do with fprintf() :).

To add debugging message to the "basic" level, you use:

 DB(("This is some message, with string %s", str));

Except for the extra ()'s, it's just like a printf.  For a different
level of debugging you have to give the level, as well:

 DBL(5, ("This is some special message, with value %ld", myval));

That could be done, but would require more interface of course.

That's where levels come in handy.

Of course, if you put your stuff at level 9 then you get the rest of the
level 9 stuff, which sucks.  That's why I said some kind of "code area
selection" would be a good enhancement.

  tp> It would be nice if the macro knew the name of the function it was

My version does print the function name, if you compile with GCC--note
that there is no way in standard C89 to derive the function name, except
by setting it somehow.  GCC provides an extension that does this, and my
debugging library does take advantage of that (if you don't use GCC the
library still works, but no function name is printed).

In C99 they introduced a FUNCNAME (that's not what it's called, but I
forget) but unfortunately it's a variable instead of a preprocessor
constant string, like GCC's.  GCC's is better.  But, the way I use it,
it actually doesn't matter.  Of course, I don't know of any C99
compilers yet so that point is moot :).

It's simple to do that; what's a pain is deciding which macros belong in
which filtered section.  The only way to do that is either on a
per-filename or per-function name basis, or in the debug invocation
itself.

If all you want is per-file or per-function (in GCC), you can simply use
grep or whatever on the output since it's all automatically added for
you.  The output format of a debugging function is well-defined and
contains all the info you need to do intelligent searching, even if the
output is pretty voluminous.

The Linux printf() man page says almost nothing about the v* versions at
all.  I don't think it's a limitation, per se.  You should check in the
man page for va_start/va_arg/va_end; that man page will _clearly_ state
that to re-walk the arguments after walking them once, you must va_end,
then va_start again.

<flip flip flip> Ah.  I just checked the C standard, and the rule is
actually quite well-defined about this.  I should have done so in the
first place.

Section 4.8 "Variable Arguments <stdarg.h>" (p 123, lines 11-15)

  ...
    If access to the varying arguments is desired, the called function
    shall declare an object (referred to as <ap> in this section) having
    type <va_list>.  The object <ap> may be passed as an argument to
    another function; if that function invokes the <va_arg> macro with
    parameter <ap>, the value of <ap> in the calling function is
    indeterminate and shall be passed to the <va_end> macro prior to any
    further reference to <ap>.
  ...

Pretty clear :).  Note this is the original ANSI C standard, not the
renumbered ISO version.

  dv> Go ahead.  There are several more files that use v*printf.
  dv> I didn't check if they need patching, though.

The only places where there are problems is when you walk the arg list
_twice_.  Then you need to end/re-start between the two walks.

We only need to block while waiting for the UNLOCK message which can be
done with select. Any messages that come in while waiting are put on the
queue.  The queue is emptied as soon as the current function finishes
and any X-events processed.

Here's a patch for the current CVS. It doesn't break anything for me but
then again I can't reproduce the problem we are on about (I've deleted
the email detailing it). Could someone who can reproduce the hang try
this please? There are some printf's in the queue filling/emptying part.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hello,
Unfortunately, it seems that the patch does not fix the double FvwmAuto
hang (just start 2 FvwmAuto 200 Raise and play with auto raise between
two windows). I've got the following to my stderr (after starting the second
FvwmAuto and moving between two windows):

Adding 'Silent Raise' to command queue
Executing 'Silent Raise' from command queue
Adding 'Silent Raise' to command queue
Executing 'Silent Raise' from command queue
Adding 'Silent Raise' to command queue
Executing 'Silent Raise' from command queue
Adding 'Silent Raise' to command queue
Executing 'Silent Raise' from command queue
Adding 'Silent Raise' to command queue

Then fvwm hang and never execute the Silent Raise of the queue ...

All very well, but what if you're passing va_list arguments around as
function parameters until finally printing them out with vfprintf()?

eg

void
foo(const char *msg, va_list ap)
{
  /* walk the argument list in vfprintf */
  vfprintf(file1, msg, ap);

  /* this is now probably illegal!! */
  vfprintf(file2, msg, ap);
}

void
print_message(const char *msg, ...)
{
  va_list  ap;
  va_start(msg, ap);
  foo(msg, ap);
  va_end(ap);
}


I don't see any way of calling va_start again from within foo(). Looks
like a minefield.

I think you can, but because someone (Olivier?) has confirmed that
Bob's work on the module interface fixed the problem.

I guess we should check for the existence of gnome.h if

  $ gnome-config --cflags gnorba gnomeui

Returns

  -DNEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H

If this is not given, FvwmGtk will fail to compile.  Configure should
catch that case before it happens.  Furthermore configure should have
a test program that checks if the header files included by gnome.h
are present on the system (gdk_imlib.h).

I remembered what it was that made me think of a queue. It's the fact
that fvwm rememebers what pipe have data ready for too long.  Here's a
patch on the patch that fixes it for me:

*** events.c.orig       Thu May 11 15:10:30 2000
--- events.c    Thu May 11 15:10:57 2000
***************

        if ((readPipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)) {
          if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
            DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
!           HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL, False);
        } else {
            DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
            KillModule(i);
--- 2258,2264 ----
        if ((readPipes[i] >= 0) && FD_ISSET(readPipes[i], &in_fdset)) {
          if (read(readPipes[i], &targetWindow, sizeof(Window)) > 0) {
            DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling HandleModuleInput");
!           HandleModuleInput(targetWindow, i, NULL, True);
        } else {
            DBUG("My_XNextEvent","calling KillModule");
            KillModule(i);

Sorry it's not an attachment but it only one line.  It makes fvwm read
all the module commands into the queue before processing them.  If this
fixes it for you should I commit this?

Cheers,
Tim.

     [no fix? or should we rather break 'xterm +ai'?]
 21) Fix the bug with eterm and transparent background (I think rxvt has

 45) Remove the web pages from the distribution.
 46) Titlebars should not inherit the pixmap from the border style.
 47) Verify the TaskBar clock update problem.
     [given up; I think I could reproduce the problem - it was a
     configuration mistake, but the reporter didn't care to answer
     if my suggestion helped; Dominik]
 49) Implement a 'H'old trigger for complex functions.
 50) Implement a 'ButtonGeometry' option for FvwmButtons.

 59) Get Raise/Lower of transients straight.
     [duplicate of item 54]

     change anyway).

 69) Fix window moving. Several people have reported that moving windows
     is slow or the windows don't follow the pointer well. This is really
     a big problem.

     border off screen, on the other hand it doesn't hurt if the shadow
     of the border is not on screen.
 71) Fix drawing of window titles.

     [doesn't happen anymore]
 84) Implement colour sets in FvwmBacker.
 85) Add 'geometry' panel option in FvwmButtons.
     I think it's not worth the effort because it's similarly
     complicated as the menu position hints if I want to do it right.
     I can't see an easy solution that does something useful fast.

Tim, FvwmIconMan still does very strange things when using
transparent colour sets in the background (see config below).
It works fine if swallowed by FvwmButtons, but if it's a
child of the root window it never redraws properly
(screenshot attached).  Can you look into this?  I don't
have any time to debug transparency right now.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

A bit more testing reveals that MY_XNextEvent() is the only place that
queueing should happen. The original patch enabled queueing in the
sending of synchronous messages which is wrong, if you use FvwmIconMan
and use it to animate Iconification the queueing leads to the animation
being too late (IconMan sends a "SendToModule Animate..." command which
should be processed before proceeding). I've taken the queueing out here
and tested it for lock ups with four FvwmAuto's and it works OK.

I've also had a go at speeding up module input processing by removing
the checks for "FINISHED_STARTUP" and "UNLOCK" on each command sent by
each module.  I've changed these  comands to "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" and
"NOP UNLOCK" so that when modules send them and fvwm isn't looking for
them you don't get an error message.

And I've removed the checking for "KILLME" on every message by adding a
library function SendQuitNotification() that uses the continuation field
in the module-fvwm protocol, this only affects FvwmForm I think.

I've had it going for a day now (wow! serious testing eh!), should I
commit this?

Cheers,
Tim.

This crashes fvwm:

  Style * iconfont
  Style * iconfont 5x7

I.e. the crash happens if the icon font is first unset
and then set again.

I vote put it in.  We've needed something like this for a long time.
It's either that or leave the multi-FvwmAuto lock bug in for 2.4 and
wait until 2.5 for this fix, but I don't think we should do that.

BTW, is there any docs on the process for module messaging?  If so, it
would be A Good Thing if those docs were updated to describe this.  If
not, we probably really should write some someday :)

This error almost invariably means your compiler is not installed
correctly, or you're not invoking configure so that it can detect your
compiler correctly.

This is especially common on Solaris.

 1) Read the INSTALL.fvwm file for a discussion of this common problem.

 2) Run configure with the --without-cxx option, to avoid trying to find
    a C++ compiler.

 3) If it still fails, examine the config.log file to see what's going
    on where it fails, and try posting that information, along with
    specific version information about your compiler and other details
    you think might be relevant.

  f> Examining the directory, a file 'core' was found:

  f> -rw-------   1 [xxx] other      72204 May 12 12:35 core

  f> bash-2.03$ file core
  f> core:           ELF 32-bit MSB core file SPARC Version 1, from 'conftest'

This makes it even more likely that your compiler isn't installed
correctly.

Why torture yourself, if you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it.

Same.

The link to the icon distribution is right
on the main page.  I think we are all set.

Doesn't sound like its worth worrying about.

As I remember, this came up because I was running fvwm remotely
and getting really long fvwm startup times.  (I still do.)

We tried a cache but it didn't seem to help.  When I did some traces
it didn't really look like color allocation was the problem anyway.
I haven't taken the time to did any deeper.  Right now I suspect
that its an Exceed problem anyway.  If I could just find a Linux
VPN client for a Contivity machine this whole problem would go away.

With the colorset feature, I think this may not be an issue anyway.
(I haven't changed to colorsets yet.)

Since I haven't actually identified any fvwm problem,  I vote that we
forget about this until I come up with something solid.

Dominik, you didn't answer this message. Do you see any problems with
FvwmWharf? I was never be able to reproduce your problem except once when
there was sleep(60). I did other small fixes to the code and the man page.

I am sure we should close the entry 119.
BTW, I also tested the original report (about wmppp and asmon applications
being too wide on MaxSwallow), and it works correctly with the current CVS.

Mikhael.

This means that m4 (not fvwm's tool) having problems processing your
system.fvwm2rc. You should have backquote and then code 255 in this file.
There is nothing fvwm can do if your input file can't be processed by m4.

Woops. If small windows are at the bottom, left or right, the pager
behaves just fine, but if they are at the top, the bug is still here.

I think this command can be removed when individual styles will be
implemented, since it will be possible to emulate the current Layer
command using Pick + Style in window context.

I understand arguments to remove it now, but it will be hard to impossible
to change window layers dynamically in 2.4 without it.

I use MoveSmoothness 1, but with my XFree86 I can't see any difference
between opaque move with MoveSmoothness 1 and with MoveSmoothness 222.
So as for me, you can remove it.

Here is how it is possible to reproduce it in another way.
Move an icon (it is focused), but then cancel Move with Escape,
the icon is now not focused, but still has long title, which will stay.

--------

Another bug. After your last ResizeOpaque/MoveResize commit (I suppose),
Move of icons is always Outline, not Opaque.

--------

Here is another problem. I think that starting from BorderColorset commit
(and there was Style commit on this day too), when you (opaquely) move
over another window, its border flicks a lot.

Mikhael.

Uh, actually I *did* answer, but apparently the mail got lost :-/
For me, it I try to swallow a 'xload -g 50x50', the window is
swallowed at first, but then immediately unswallowed again.  Same
with a xemacs window.  This happens so fast that you can't even see
that the window is swallowed at first.  I had to step through the
code to notice it.

Well, there are older bugs still open I still hope to fix
some day :-)  But I guess it's not relevant for 2.4.

That's what I think.  I'll remove this item.

Um, at the *top*?  I thought this could only be a problem on
a bottom or right page boundary.  BTW, I don't see a problem
on any page boundary.

Okay, it's 1 vs. 3 now.  I'll leave it in.

This will only make a difference if you have a sloooooooow connection
to the X server.  But I could never actually test it because I can't
slow down my machines enough to make it kick in :-)  I'll remove the
command.

Excellent!  With this information it should be much easier to fix.

Oops.  Fixed in a minute.

Please provide more details (which commit exactly; config example).

I just tried it again, but it does not happen anymore.  If it ever
shows up again I will write a bug report.

Items with highest priority / most severe problems:

 - Is #48 finished? (win95-like config file)
 - Verify if #150 is really fixed.
 - #158 (IS_NAME_CHANGED flag) Mikhael?
 - What should we do with #128 (bug #564)?  Can fvwm do anything
   about the window that receives the selection?
 - Do we want to set up bzip2 tarballs (#12)?  We'd have to put
   links on the downloads page then.  Definitely saves a lot of
   space (compressed with bzip2 -9):
     fvwm-2.3.16.tar.gz:  1533662 bytes
     fvwm-2.3.16.tar.bz2: 1188684 bytes

Hello,

It would be handy to have an fvwm function that can be invoked through
a menu that toggles on and off all key bindings. This is useful in the
situation when one wants to test a new application but does not know
which key bindings the application makes use of / and or whether the
application's key bindings work as desired. Having to commenting out
every single keybinding from the .fvwm2rc and restarting can be tedious
at times and a menu function for toggling all key bindings on and off
would be much handier.

Thanks,

Neil

Subject: stacking chain
Date: Sat, 13 May 2000 08:50:24 -0700
From: Michael Han <mikehan@best.com>
Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

Hi, I've been trying to track down the problem I occassionally see
with the stacking chain getting out of order, allowing transients to
be raised above windows in layers higher than themselves. I could use
some help understanding what's supposed to happen in
RaiseOrLowerWindow().

Basically, add_window.c's AddWindow() calls
postition_new_window_in_stack_ring() after pushing the window on top
of the stack. This results in a RaiseOrLowerWindow(), which seems to
be where something's not working properly. Following the code in
RaiseOrLowerWindow, I'm having trouble figuring out why transients
should do anything *but* sit on top of the stack regardless of layers,
assuming that no_movement gets set. Or am I saying the wrong thing
here? Should a transient always cause no_movement to be False?

Since I'm having trouble reproducing the correct behavior, I'm not
sure what the flow through RaiseOrLowerWindow() is supposed to look
like. In case anyone's interested, what I'm seeing is that a transient
gets added and placed on top of the stack. A recursive
RaiseOrLowerWindow occurs, but no_movement is getting set True,
meaning that the bulk of the code in RaiseOrLowerWindow never
executes, including the portions that would appear to be responsible
for making sure the raised window falls to the top of its layer
instead of hanging around at the top of the stack.

Any pointers?

Ok, I can see this on any page boundary. But your current page should be
in the direction of the small windows (i.e. if you put them on the top,
your current page coordinate Y should be less then the original).
And this only happens with small windows (3 pixels), not bigger ones.

I am posting 2 images, the same windows, but different current pages.
The first is correct. On the second you can see white & red windows that
are mainly on the wrong page, other windows are sticky (they are correct).

I can reproduce this with any config, the minimal rc file is:

	OpaqueMoveSize 100

Borders of underlying windows are redrawn a lot when you Move over them.
I don't remember seeing this before the time near to middle April.
I can't test this for now, so I may be wrong on the time.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It took me a while to figure out that the recursive
RaiseOrLowerWindow() kicked off on the transient window's transientfor
is where the magic supposed to happen. But the trouble seems to be
that must_move_transients() somehow gets fooled into thinking it
needn't move the transient, while RaiseOrLowerWindow() is executing
for the transientfor parent. I think this is what happens:

Three windows: xterm(layer 5); FvwmConsole(layer 4); editres(layer 4);
creating a transient for editres named xt(layer 4):

If the chain is: xt; xterm; editres; FvwmConsole; upon entry into
RaiseOrLowerWindow() you'll recurse into RaiseOrLowerWindow(editres)
and when must_move_transients() gets called:

1) the first window is the transient, which sets *found_transient;
2) the next window is xterm, in a higher layer, giving continue;
3) the next window is editres, which unsets scanning_above_window
4) the next window is FvwmConsole, which triggers no action
5) the loop breaks, returning False

But if the chain is: xt; xterm; FvwmConsole; editres; this is the
procedure:

1) the first window is the transient, which sets *found_transient;
2) the next window is xterm, in a higher layer, giving continue;
3) the next window is FvwmConsole, which triggers the final condition,
returning True

The stacking chain logic is fairly opaque to me. I'm not sure how best
to fix the problem. I'm guessing that maybe some sort of sanity check
that actually keeps track of whether transients have been found above
the higher-layer windows is necessary.

Here's a patch to do that. It seems minimally correct, though I'm not
positive that layers must be unsigned values, since the data type is
int... Still, if that's the case (and I've always understood things
this way), it's safe to temporarily leave the layer set to -1 as a
guarantee that no real layer has been set yet.

Yeah, there's the documentation in the fvwm-web module. It looks like
someone ought to update these docs to reflect the way synchronous
operation is working.

I think I've identified the problem. I'm not sure I've provided a
reasonable fix (not sure if it breaks something else).

I've discovered that this is no longer a problem... Huh? I have no
idea how/why it got fixed.

Unfortunately this *is* still a problem. If there's a root cause that
associates the two, something's now fixed 138 without addressing
145... I suspect that motif defines something naughty. That or there's
some breakage in FVWM's MWM hints.

Did anyone ever duplicate this? I've used 'Style * ClickToFocus' for
years without ever seeing a problem of this sort.

See 118 above.

I have tried to debug this off-line by giving Elliot instructions
what to do and we could narrow down the place where it happens,
but didn't get much farther thatn this.  It still happens to him.

Okay, if I understand this correctly, RaiseOrLowerWindow ends up with

  do_move_transients = False
  found_transient = True

==> no_movement = True

I think the reason is that the RaiseOrLowerWindow() function is called
by the recursion although the stack ring is currently out of order
(because of the transient being placed at the beginning of the stack
ring although there are windows in higher layers behind it).  Then,
moust_move_transients wrongly assumes that transients are placed
properly in the stack ring.  If this theory is correct, it should be
possible to fix the problem by giving the RaiseOrLowerWindow function
a 'currently_adding_a_new_window' flag and disabling recursion in this
case.

Mike, I've committed an experimental 'fix'.  Can you test it, please?

Bye

Finally I can reproduce the problem too.  It only happens all of the
following conditions are met:

 1) The style StackTransientParent is set for the new transient.
 2) Either RaiseTransient or LowerTransient is set for the parent
    window.
 3) There is a window on a higher layer.

E.g.

  Style * RaiseTransient, StackTransientParent
  Style xterm layer 5

will do.  Your analysis was quite correct, Mike - good work.  Now
let's see if my patch works...

--- three minutes later ---

Yup, it does (I guess yours does too, Mike).  Now let's see if it
does the right thing...

--- ten minutes later ---

Nope, it doesn't.  Now it fails to raise the parent window when
a new transient is mapped.

--- thirty minutes later ---

Okay, I got it straigt now.  Basically the fix works like this:
RaiseOrLowerWindow() has a new parameter 'is_new_window'.  New
windows are simply raised/lowered without doing all the fancy
stuff in must_move_transients() or in the recursion.  Then,
further down, if the new window is transient and has set
STACK_TRANSIENT_PARENT, RaiseOrLowerWindow() calls itself, now
with is_new_window unset.  This duplicate call makes sure that
the parent is positioned properly below the new transient.

Thanks for the excellent analysis of the problem, Mike.  It
made fixing the problem child's play.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I can still see it.  Something weird is happening with the keyboard
focus.  With the SloppyFocus feature of the pager I can even make
the window gain focus when I *leave* the window.

I still suspect it is somehow related to 138/145.

Tim, as far as I can see the module command queue is working
well except for one thing.  When a module sends a command
it is put in the queue.  Then, after the event loop has
cleaned up all pending events, My_XNextEvent finally reaches
line 2148:

  ExecuteCommandQueue();

Some of the commands that are executed trigger new X events,
but the function continues until it reaches the select call:

  if (fvwmSelect(fd_width, &in_fdset, &out_fdset, 0, timeoutP) > 0) {

Now we have X events pending, but fvwm hangs in the select()
call and waits for module input.  I have made a patch that
simply exits Mx_XNextEvent() if the command queue was not
empty in ExecuteCommandQueue().  This seems to fix the problem.

What I do not understand is why select() hangs at all.  The
x_fd is part of the in_fdset, but still it does not trigger the
select() call - even though there are pending events.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Probably a good idea. But I have no much comments about it for now.
I would like if you proceed this idea further and show how this can be
used in practice. Also if you write a script (I know you doing something
with gimp-lib), which implements some clean API for this idea (parameters
--create-gtkrc or simialar), we could add it as fvwm-themes-converter.

P.S. I am still working on the next version. Sorry for the delay.

I  believe   a   while  ago  we  had   some    discussion  about Motif
highlights/shadows.

If you check out http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif  you will see that
they've just released the source code to Motif (including MWM) for use
in OpenSource OSs.

It looks like they will eventually make it completely opensource.

I'm not sure if we can look at the algorithms and use them or not
under the current terms.  After 2.4 it might make some sense to
look into it.

Yes, these are requirements, but they are also default settings (well,
1 and 2 are). At least, they seem to be on my machine.

I'm still seeing problems if I create transients for a window already
at the top of the layer. Looking over your patches, I don't see why
this isn't working on my machine. But it's been a long day of
struggling with crappy software, so I'll wait a while before thinking
about this again.

Anyway, I'm glad you can reproduce the problem now. I was beginning to
think that I made a mistake upgrading to XFree86 4.0.

There is no XFlush() after ExecuteModuleCommand(). XPending() does an
XFlush() if there is nothing in the X event queue so your fix of
re-entering My_XNextEvent() works by running the first XPending() again.

I'll have another look at My_XNextEvent() and see if I can streamline it
a bit.

Tim.

Double Doh! It's an XPending that's missing after the
ExecuteModuleCommand().  There's already an XFlush() before the select
but if ExecuteModuleCommand() runs an X command that needs a server
response (like XGetGeometry()) there will be XEvents waiting in the X
queue. The select will block until a new event turns up.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hm, if I understand that correctly, if I change this code:

  if (ExecuteCommandQueue())
  {
    return 0;
  }

to this:

  if (ExecuteCommandQueue())
  {
    XPending(dpy);
  }

It should work too.  Right?  Unfortunately that is not the case,
not even if I add 'Xsync(dpy, 0);' after the XPending() call.
I really don't understand why the select() does not return when 
new events are pending.

BTW, you can easily verify it yourself if you use the

  *FvwmPagerSloppyFocus

option.  Simply point at an unfocused window in the pager.  It
will gain focus only after you *leave* the window, not when you
enter it.

When I wrote the patch I was a bit worried that the double raise
of new transients might cause them to be buried under their
transientfor window if the FlipTransient style is activated.

[testing...]

Um, and that's exactly what happens :(  Try using

  style * fliptransient, raisetransient, stacktransientparent
  style * lowertransient, clicktofocus

Then open netscape and e.g. the preferences transient.  I'll
make another patch.

it should be 
  if (ExecuteCommandQueue())
  {
    if (XPending(dpy)
    {
      XNextEvent(dpy,event);
      StashEventTime(event);
      return 1;
    }
  }

This is a duplicate of the code before the ExecuteCommandQueue(). Now
that module command queueing only happens in My_XNextEvent it is
possible to move the ExecuteCommandQueue to happen after the select()
rather than before. The queue only gets command added to it after the
select and is immediately emptied.  I've committed this change. I've
also added an extra test for X events after the select as a tune up.

Cheers,
Tim.

Tim, I am not sure I understand your latest patch correctly.
Isn't is now the other way round: queued commands won't be
executed unless a new X event comes in?  I.e. if a module
issues a command that gets queued, but no X event follows,
the select() will not trigger ExecuteCommandQueue()?  I have
no time to try this out right now.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

:-(  No way to fix that.  The FlipTransient style really does
not work acceptably, and I don't see a way how to make it work.
It works only in a very limited set of configurations.  I think
it might be best to simply remove it before people start using
it.

Nope. The module command queue is always empty when the routine is
entered, if there are no X events queued up select() is called which
blocks until something happens (X event or module command arrives).
After any module commands are put in the queue the commands in the queue
is emptied. There is no way to exit the routine without an empty module
command queue. A simplified version of the routine follows:

int MyXNextEvent()
{
  if (XPending())
  {
    get next event
    return 1
  }

  select(all_inputs and all_outputs)

  for all modules
  {
    if (input from module ready)
    {
      add module command to queue
    }
    if (output to module ready)
    {
      write message to module
    }
  }

  execute all the modules commands from the queue

  if (XPending())
  {
    get next event
    return 1
  }

  return 0
}

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm assuming there's a case that my proposed patch didn't adequately
cover? For the default configurations, it was getting things correct.
Incidentally, after sending it to the list, I rewrote it because what
I sent to the list was stupid: instead, it stores only a Bool
out_of_order, and in the comparison to see if the chain got broken, it
does a:

      if ((q->stack_next != &Scr.FvwmRoot) &&
          (q->layer < q->stack_next->layer))

Then it just returns the out_of_order flag if it manages to make its
way to the end of the function's block.

Well, I don't know what to do about FlipTransient.

I use:

For me it is finished. However, I think that it will be good that
others test it and edit it (I'm ready to fix any bug).

I am not so sure that the OLD_BUGGY_WINDOW_PLACEMENT was so buggy.
It was buggy relatively TitleAtBottom and also this "old" code is
relatively complex but there are reasons for such complexity: the
*FvwmWinListShowCurrentDesk config option and the fact that WinList
can unmap itself if there are no windows which have to be represented
in it.
Examples: 
- use *FvwmWinListShowCurrentDesk (and say witha geometry of
+0-0) and switch between desks with and without windows which have to 
be represented in WinList (e.g., start winlist on a desk without window
and go to a desk with windows), then the position of the winlist is not 
fixed to +0-0.
- with or without *FvwmWinListShowCurrentDesk (with border width > 0). 
Start winlist so that no windows have to go into it, then map a windows ...

Others WinList bugs:
- WinList can be resized, but this is not supported.
- Sticky window are not taken in acount in a good way with
*FvwmWinListShowCurrentDesk
- If you use (One) FvwmAnimate, Style * Icon and winlist with
*FvwmWinListNoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate
Then, we have two animations: one for the icon and one for
the winlist (same bug in IconMan and IconBox).

Maybe I can help on some points.

Of course.  In the first case, fvwm looks for a command named
"Module FvwmWinList" (without the double quotes) which does not
exist.  In my eyes fvwm's behaviour is correct.  I guess before
my fix this may have worked, but that was not intended.

Some or all of them may already be fixed.  I could verify that
in some setups the code tries to access a mailbox if 'None'
was specified (depending on the order of the options in the
config file).  I have already fixed this one.

Sorry, I didn't even try out your patch.  I tried to find out
why the broken call of must_move_transients() was made in the
first place and came to the conslusion that the code failed to
handle the case when new windows trigger the recursion.  I tried
to fix the root cause rather than the symptom.

Well, in the end your patch is much simpler.

I guess the FlipTransient bug is not a new one.  I'm sure it was
there before.  The problem here is *not* that the new window triggers
a double raise.  What happens is that a second raise is triggered
when you release the mouse button in netscape's 'Edit' menu over
'Preferences'.  Well, I can't describe it properly, but

 1) FlipTransient does not work as expected anyway (e.g. if you
    pree on the title to move a window)
 2) I have no idea how to code FlipTransient correctly.
 3) It causes other strange effects in some setups.
 
==> We should remove it before 2.4, i.e. before it can make
    its way into any stable release.

But like this we lost a functionality and I do not see what
we win. Moreover, now, I do not understand the logic in var
expansion: for me expansion have to be done and then fvwm have
to work as usual.

Let us give an example of use of this "old" functionality.
I've used this functionality in sample-95 with the function:

AddToFunc   SetBackground
# kill a possible Backer runing
+ I killModule FvwmBacker
# set the background
+ I $0
# save our state
+ I Exec echo "AddToFunc StartFunction I $0" > $FVWM_USERDIR/.start-Background

typical use is:

SetBackground FvwmBacker
SetBackground 'Exec exec xsetroot -solid Red1'
SetBackground 'Exec exec bggen blue magenta | xv -root -quit'
SetBackground 'Exec exec bggen black red yellow black grey60 | xv -root -quit'
SetBackground 'Exec exec xlock -nice 10 -inroot -mode braid'

Of course now except the first (and even it is natural for me to
use SetBackgroud 'Module FvwmBacker') nothing work!
How to fix this? by replacing "+ I $0" by "+ I $0 $1 ... $9"
and remove the above ' (and even the 4th command will not 
work as expected) ? Replacing "+ I $0" by + I PipeRead "echo $0"
work but this seems to me really crazy.

I imagine that there are other fixes and if the old functionality
does not reappear I will fix sample-95 ...

Maybe we should implement the shell's $*.

Then you could have:

  ...
 + I Exec echo "AddToFunc StartFunction I $*" > $FVWM_USERDIR/.start-Background
  ...

 SetBackground FvwmBacker
 SetBackground Exec exec xsetroot -solid Red1
 SetBackground Exec exec bggen blue magenta | xv -root -quit
 SetBackground Exec exec bggen black red yellow black grey60 | xv -root -quit
 SetBackground Exec exec xlock -nice 10 -inroot -mode braid

and have it DTRT.

Hello,
I convert all the TaskBar code to the GSFR for fixing
some minor bug and for simplicity.
My life will be simpler if I can remove the TaskBar
Swallow code. It does not work and it is not documented.
Any objection ?
Olivier

Yes, we should have it regardless of other issues.
And $@ (quoting every parameter, not only separating) would be nice too.

This only fixes simple cases, when you need one multiple-word parameter,
but still with your suggestion there is no way to emulate:

  SetBackground "Exec xsetroot -solid Red1" "Exec xv -root -quit b.jpg"

(and the function will decide which one to use accourding to the state).
Note, this functionality worked for a long time. This is not a theoretical
discussion, we use complex functions, like this, in fvwm-themes a lot.

I agree with Olivier, parameters should be expanded, like in shell, before
command execution. If one wants to treat a parameter in the first place
specially like it is done now (for a short time), he can use quotes, "$0".

Mikhael.

Actually, $@ == $*.  You have to write "$@" (with quotes) to get the
special behavior.  Don't ask me.

I'm not very clear on this.  How does this expand now, in the new way?

I think it would be useful if someone wrote down exactly how these used
to work, and how they work now.  Or, at least how they work now.  The
man page just says they expand to the positional params but doesn't say
how quoting the parameters is handled.  Am I missing this somewhere?

Then, we can talk about how to handle this case.  Quoting and parameter
expansion is actually pretty tricky to get right so it's both usable and
useful, in my experience.

Yes, this is the sensible approach, when you have a sense of what's
*supposed* to happen ;> Seriously though, I haven't given this problem
a whole lot of thought, but it seems to me that in essence,
RaiseOrLowerWindow() wants to raise top level windows, which seems a
valid approach to handle stacking.

Having observed above that I think RaiseOrLowerWindow() wants to raise
toplevels, not transients, I don't find it terribly surprising that
FlipTransient causes a lot of trouble. It would be very difficult for
new windows not to get caught in FlipTransient logic.

I have no real comment on jettisoning FlipTransient. I don't use it.

Depends on the function definition, suppose: AddToFunc SetBackground I $1

This will work differently in the new and the old ways. If you put quotes
around $1, it will work the same, but it will never DTRT in the new way.

You should write many example functions to understand all issues.
There is a "compile" time line processing (actually 2, in ExecuteFunction
and one is in AddToFunction) and a run time processing (ExecuteFunction).
I think, a user who wants/needs to understand can do it by "try and see".
Here is how $0 - $9 are expanded in functions (only 10 args supported).

The old way was exactly like shell does. Just substitude all $0 - $9 found
anywhere in the function line at run time and execute the processed line.

The new way is that you know at compile time (function definition time)
how the function line will be divided into parameters (quoted words) and
you have no way to change this at run time.

The old and new ways work the same if you don't pass parameters with
spaces and quotes inside (i.e. for most of simple functions).

Example function line:

+ I $0$1 "$2 $3" $4;$5 $6

The new way: there will be 4 words in the expanded line.
The old way: (I, like shell, respect my user, not restrict), my guess -
4 words, but may be 1 or 20, I can't say anything before seeing $0 - $6.

While one can find the new way good, it is in fact limited enough.
The whole point is that it is easy to emulate the new way using the
old one (add quotes and don't pass 'str"ing'), but not vice versus.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

Some modules have to react to some style change
(e.g., TaskBar, WinList, IconMan and IconMan have
to react to a Style "*" Icon command). Some times
fvwm2 send immediately to the modules the style change 
via the GSFR in a CONFIGURE_WINDOW message.
However, in some case no such message are send. Here
the cases which cause problems on my current work:
- A Icon/NoIcon change (for forbidding a double/non animation
after a Style * Icon/NoIcon command).
- A WindowListSkip/WindowListHit change (for that the modules
respect the UseListSkip config command).

So, I have added a new update_win (update.h) flags: 
do_update_modules_flags
which is set to true if needed in check_window_style_change (style.c)
so that apply_window_updates (update.c) can do in this case a BroadcastConfig(M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW,t)

Dominik, Any objections for such a change?

Olivier

Hi, I tried your setup script, It is very nice. I especially like the
menus. But I have found two typos. When it asks what your prefered 
file manager is, I believe Midnight-Commander is spelled wrong. And 
in the Window Ops menu there is an extra "&" in a menu item...

I did think that you could use *FvwmWinListNoIconAction to call a
function that did the following:

*FvwmAnimateEffect Frame
SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7
*FvwmAnimateEffect None

so that the animation to the icon wouldn't be shown but it seems that
FvwmAnimate exits when "*FvwmAnimateEffect None" is given. I'm not sure
why this is the case, it may be a bug.

Cheers,
Tim.

It was done on purpose, here's what I was thinking:

     *FvwmAnimateEffect mode
          Tells  FvwmAnimate  which  animation  effect  to   use.
          Currently  the effects are :  Frame, Lines, Flip, Turn,
          Zoom3D, Twist Random, and None.  None is  normally  set
          in  the  configuration  file,  in-case  FvwmAnimate  is
          started automatically, but an individual  user  doesn't
          want it running.


So, you want to be able to animate to the winlist, iconbox, or iconman
but not to the icon, but you do want icons.

Looks like it needs:

*FvwmAnimateIconifyAnimate Off|On

or something like that...

I can reproduce this now.  The hack I did originally only works for 1x1
desktopsize, i.e. it stuffs up with pages.  I'll do something to it.

This will happen by default unless you set "Style * BackingStore" and
our server support backing store. It would not be easy to prevent the
flickering.

Subject: color repainting under MWMBorder, BorderWidth 1, NoHandles

Full_Name: 
Version: 2.2.4
CVS_Date: 
OS: solaris 7, irix 6.5
X_Server: 
Submission from: (NULL) (206.222.228.181)


this bug is easiest to reproduce with this in your .fvwm2rc:

   Style "xload"  MWMBorder, BorderWidth 1, NoHandles, NoTitle
   Style "xclock" MWMBorder, BorderWidth 1, NoHandles, NoTitle
   OpaqueMoveSize 50

start xload and/or xclock.
drag an xterm around with the mouse.
whenever the xterm passes over the border of the xload/xclock,
it leaves some markings behind on the xload/xclock border.
in other words, borders are not re-drawn correctly under these settings:

if you scroll the virtual desktop so that the xload/xclock get
scrolled off the screen, and then scroll back, the xload/xclock
borders get re-drawn as if they were assigned a BorderWidth 0 style.

in other words, borders are not re-drawn correctly under these settings:

   MWMBorder, BorderWidth 1, NoHandles

the OpaqueMoveSize and NoTitle are not really necessary,
but they help make things more apparent.

Thanks for all the effort of fvwm developer team,

I am not subscribing the ML's, and I don't know if I am right to send this
report here, but I would like to try.

Now I am trying fvwm-2.3.17, and I am glad that it works right in both
maximizing and shading at the same time, but found that the color
control relating MWMButtons is not correctly working.

>From the old days, MWM* style is my favourite, and current setup in my
~/.fvwm2rc is:

ButtonStyle 2 5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 16 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0 \
         80x80@0  70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1
ButtonStyle All -- Flat
         <snip>
Style "*"           MWMBorder,MWMButtons,MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride

but at least the MWMButtons is not working correctly.  My rightmost button
(my maximizer button: Button 2 ?) does not keep track with my color
settings if the window is maximized.  In my case, assuming a title
and button styles like this:

TitleStyle ActiveUp Vgradient 24 #666666 #999999 -- flat
TitleStyle ActiveDown Vgradient 24 #555555 #999999  -- flat
TitleStyle Inactive Vgradient 24 #11236b #03092b -- flat
ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle flat

the rightmost button of active window is light gray (perhaps #999999)
and has no gradient, while that of inactive window turns into dark
gray (perhaps #555555, even if the intended color for inactive window
should be dark blue sort of Vgradient #11236b #03092b).

The color control of the button is correct if the relevant window is
in non-maximized state (including the Vgradient), and shape control is
just perfect even when maximized (only the color control is not working).

I have a screen shot of the malfunctioning button, and if you can't reproduce
the symptom, I would try to publish the image as one of the screen shot in
my dired-dd page (http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~pi9s-nnb/dired-dd-home.html).

The same .fvwm2rc setup is working correctly in fvwm-2.2.2 and 2.2.4.

My temporary fix is removing the MWMButtons mnemonic in the setup.
I can't take time to look the src at all yet, sorry.

Sincerely,

PS.

But the man page says (same for iconbox, iconman and taskbar):

        *FvwmWinListNoIconAction action
              Tells  FvwmWinList  to  do  action is when a NoIcon
              style window is iconified or de-iconified. ...

So, with the current spec. the double animation (winlist + icon) is
a bug. However, we may want to change this spec. Personally I like
the current spec because it is "automatic", you can ask by default
to the modules to animate and when you switch between Icon and NoIcon
the animation switch too.
Also, I'm not against something like: 
 
> Looks like it needs:
> 
> *FvwmAnimateIconifyAnimate Off|On
> 
> or something like that...

But we have to change the name of the module config command
or add an other command and modify FvwmAnimate. On the other
hand it is not very difficult to respect the current spec.
I've recently do it for the taskbar and I think that I can
do it for the others "application managers". 
Any way, we need a fixed spec. to go to 2.4, and this is the
only important thing in IMHO. 
So, I suggest to do not change the spec. but I'm personally
not against a change if the proposal came with the code 
proposition :)

It does look like a bug. FvwmWinList should not do the NoIconAction if
there is an icon, there is a test (IS_ICON_SUPRESSED(x)) that seems to
be not working. Actually what is happening is that switching between
Icons and NoIcons isn't getting communicated to a running FvwmWinList.
If you restart FvwmWinList it works properly.

What happens when you do a 'Style * Icon'? I guess that fvwm should send
a configure packet for each window and that FvwmWinList should update
its structures.

Cheers,
Tim.

You need to tell fvwm2 WHICH button is the Maximize button.  Check your fvwm2
manual page and look for the description of the ButtonStyle keyword...
specifically, the MwmDecorMaximize hint.

I just noticed the same behavior in FvwmIconMan, I'll take the blame
here since I put the Animate support in IconMan. Mine is for a different reason though I'm not checking IS_ICON_SUPPRESSED so  once you get the

I'm not sure when this started.  I see it with the current CVS.

I'm using mouse focus.

Start X3270.  Click on the keyboard symbol in the upper right corner.
This opens keyboard window.
Even though the mouse remains in the main window, the frame of the
keyboard window is highlighted.

If I then hit the keyboard shortcut for iconify, only the keyboard window
iconifies.  (Both windows should iconify.)  Focus goes to the icon
even though the mouse is in the main window.

With  mouse focus, entering  the icon,  (not the  icon title) does not
highlight the  title.   If  you  then   enter  the title,    the title
highlights  and expands.   Moving back  into   the icon unexpands  the
title, and leaves the title highlighted.

Exmh shows a different problem.  Clicking  on the icon (not the title)
doesn't  deiconify  the icon.   (This   works for   my  other  icons.)
Clicking on the icon title works as it should.  I think exmh generates
its own icon image.

Submission from: (NULL) (212.38.224.119)


When running Dual-head display (:0.0 & :0.1) fvwm work's fine, but there is
one 
some things which are not optimally working:

- If I move my mouse from :0.0 to :0.1, and try to change virtual page with

keyboard (ctrl-arrow), page changed in :0.0 unless I enter my mouse to some
window in 
:0.1 to get focus to it. I have sloppy focus. Looks like sloppy focus
behaves 
sloppy also in root-windows...

- There is mess with FvwmCommand, since there is two fvwm's running

- Is there good support to have different settings for :0.1, I don't want
to have all
init programs in both displays

Hi,

it seems to me, like some change in fvwm during the last months
caused, that clients can no longer resize their windows when
these are maximized.

Actually, the only client where I encounter this problem is gimp.
Gimp has a function named "shrink-wrap" that tries to resize the
window to the current image size. With recent versions of fvwm,
this doesn't work anymore, when the window is maximized. Gimp
obviously thinks, that the resize succeeded and redraws the image
in the upper left corner with the scrollbars around it, but the
window just stays maximized and doesn't change its size.

I am not sure, which fvwm-version introduced this behavior
change, I only can tell that it was between fvwm 2.2.2 and
2.3.11. Is it a bug or just a new feature, that I don't
understand? Is there any way, to get the old behavior back?

Regards,
                Peter

Isn't this the normal behaviour? I can reproduce the same with the
Netscape Mail window and the "Save as" dialog box using SloppyFocus. The
dialog box pops up in the center after selecting it in the menu or
pressing the shortcut Alt+S and gets focus while my pointer stays on the
main window. The dialog box is a modal one.

Tung

Hmm, good question.

With fvwm 2.2.4, the main x3270 window stays highlighted,
not the keyboard window.

I don't think the little keyboard window is  grabbing focus, since its
not meant to  be used thru the keyboard,  it has some buttons to click
on.  I'll take a look and see if I can understand what x3270 is doing.

The symptom I reported with exmh (not being able  to click on the body
of the icon) is present in 2.2.4 also.

FvwmCommand's list_new_page function reports the wrong y co-ordinate.
Code reads:

fvwm's multihead support is known to have some trouble, since none of
the core developers has access to a multihead display, AFAIK. Though
if you have some time, we might be able to make some improvements.
Short-term, perhaps if you created two separate .fvwm2rc files, named
.fvwm2rc0:0 and .fvwm2rc0:1 and invoked fvwm from your session
manager/Xclients/whatever with exec fvwm2 -f .fvwm2rc$DISPLAY? To fix
your problem with FvwmCommand, one instance has to be invoked to use a
differently-named set of FIFOs via the -f option.

Fellow workers, I did a little research into Xinerama, but I'm having
a lot of trouble digging up information about how it works. Does
anyone have any resources? The xc/ source tree for X11R6.4 doesn't
appear to contain *any* documentation relating to Xinerama. Does
anyone even know if you have 0:0 & 0:1 with Xinerama? I should be able
to throw together a test for this in the future, since I have
XFree86-4 and a multi-head video card now.

Sorry, forgot. Without Xinerama, traditional approach.

Yeah, sure I can try to help you. Response-time won't be optimal, but
something like one new version tested / day wouldn't be too bad for
me. 

Everything works fine

I'm using debian packaged fvwm, and they have bit different approch to
config files: system haves fvwmrc, which is calling user and local
administrator provided stub files. Idea is to give user possibility to
get atomatical updates to menus, etc. Debian haves all (at least most)
programs you install automatically having menu entry. 

I solved problem by using entries like this: (line splitted)

+ "I" Exec exec sh -c 'case  $DISPLAY in *:0.1 | *:1*) xsetroot -solid
\#2f5b5b ;; *) xv -rmode -root -quit -random
/usr/share/enlightenment/themes/BrushedMetal-Tigert/backgrounds/images/*
;; esac'

(You can see enlightenment haves something useful: backdrops :-)

Ok, thanks.

With xinerama you have only :0.0, or that's what I think (tested
once). Fvwm behaves really strange way with it. Some ascii craphics:


---------------    ------------------
| Secondary   |    | Primary        | 
| 1280x960    |    | 1400x1050      | 
|             |    |                | 
|             |    |                | 
|             |    |                | 
|             |    | Z              | 
---------------    ------------------
 
Fvwm thinks my display is from upper left corner of secondary display
to place marked with Z! Probably something like this:

- It get's resolution, and get's primary displays size 1400x1050. So,
we have coordinates from 0,0 -> 1400,1050. And bottom right corner
happens to be on Primary display, because secondary is smaller. With
two equally-sized (in pixels) displays, display sitting on the right
would be un-usable....

Anyway, Xinerama is not usable for me, because both displays have to
be same depth, and with 2M mem secondary display must be 8 bit.

> I should be able to throw together a test for this in the future,

I might be wrong, but XFree-4.0 doesn't support multihead-video cards,
but it supports multiple normal pci/agp video cards. I have i740-agp and
ATI-rageII-pci cards, and it works. Not fine, in power-up I have to
change secondary card as primary, get boot prompt, go back to bios and
change primary back to be primary. That's only way I found to get both
cards properly initialized (= properly working).

And can't use more than 2M mem from my secondary card. :-(

I think you should get best results if you have two Matrox (Millenium
or whatever) cards installed to your system. Don't hesitate to ask me
if you are experimenting with it, and don't get it working. Do you
want to get my XF86Config?

I just came upon a most charming masterpiece of C code.  Is
anybody able to understand what it actually does?  (Except
core dumping of course).

    char *foo[1] = { "bar" };
    sprintf(foo[0], "%x", 123);

:-)

Is this the fix for the screwed up tips drawing that was

Gee, I'm really bad with these.

Using  Sun's compiler, this  only core dumps when  I use -xstrconst to
compile.  I think gcc has a  simpilar option, but  I'm not sure of the
gcc default.

The first  line   sets up a   1  entry array of  character   pointers,
initializing the first entry to point to the string constant "bar".

The second line uses the format string  "%x" to change the integer 123
to the string "7b".  It then copies the 7b to  the location pointed to
by the first entry in  the foo array.  This is  where the string "bar"
used to be.

x3270 creates the keyboard popup with:

  XtPopup(shell, XtGrabNone);

Since it has set XtGrabNone, I can't see how its correct for fvwm
to give focus to the popup window.

Just some information.

A while ago we had some discussions about applications moving windows
and getting them where they want them.

X3270 seems to have the problem solved.

If you create an x3270 window, then add they keyboard popup, then
move the main window, the popup follows along quite nicely.

Heres the logic:

After placing the window:

  XtAppAddTimeOut(appcontext, 250, measure_move, 0);

In measure move:

measure_move(closure, id)
XtPointer closure;
XtIntervalId *id;
{
  Position x, y;
  XtVaGetValues(keypad_shell, XtNx, &x, XtNy, &y, NULL);
  if (x != kmove_x || y != kmove_y) {
    if (kmove_x - x < 0 && kmove_y - y < 0) {
      /*
       * The window manager shifts by exactly the decoration
       * size (mwm, olwm).
       */
      wa_mode = WA_ALL;
    } else {
      /*
       * The window manager shifts by something less than the
       * decoration size (twm).
       */
      wa_mode = WA_PARTIAL;
      XtVaSetValues(keypad_shell,
          XtNx,
        x + decor_width + (decor_width - (kmove_x - x)),
          XtNy,
        y + decor_height + (decor_height - (kmove_y - y)),
          NULL);
    }
  } else {
    /*
     * The window manager leaves the window exactly where we
     * asked (fvwm).
     */
    XtVaSetValues(keypad_shell,
        XtNx, x + decor_width,
        XtNy, y + decor_height,
        NULL);
    wa_mode = WA_NONE;
  }
}

It then uses "wa_mode" to adjust the window position.

As I think we discovered, the underlying problem is that there doesn't
appear to be any clear standard for this.  If we can believe X3270,
there seem to be at least 3 different things that window managers will
do.

You could do this. Or perhaps you could do something like:

Read .fvwm2rc-head-$DISPLAY

and place head-specific commands there. Of course, I'm not sure that
Read will do variable substitutions... In any event, yes, calling out
to a shell will definitely do the trick.

Yes, when fvwm2 queries the display for the screen size, it isn't
aware that it can be asking about multiple rectangles. My guess is
that if you place Screen "Secondary" RightOf Primary, things would at
least be usable. But, yes, I suspect your problem is the result of the
{Height|Width}OfScreen() function returning the Primary screen's size,
but +0+0 being located on the Secondary Screen.

I've got what I think would be a working config if it weren't for the
fact that my second display head is on the unusable second VGA-out of
my Matrox G400. Still, I guess I could always rip my old Millenium II
8MB out of my Linux box, or something. FVWM would, I think, profit
from better multi-head and/or Xinerama support.

Fellow workers, how much trouble is it going to cause for the screen
to be non-rectangular? I've got the bad feeling that the math involved
in a lot of places like CleverPlacement just got a lot harder.

Helo.

I hadn't updated cvs since february and when I just did, I had no
settings.. So I started to dig in why it failed..

My main fvwm2rc just reads a bunch of other files, all with relative
paths (.X/fvwm2/foo) .. with the new FVWM_USERDIR pointing at
$HOME/.fvwm I know why it failed.. I can accept that..

So I thought "Ok, I'll change it to Read $HOME/.X/fvwm2/... " .. but
that didn't work.. it didn't expand $HOME .. I haven't had a look at the
parsing code, but how hard would it be to expand $HOME into what it is?

I'd like not to hard code paths since people are copying my settings to
the right and left and it's best if they run their own copy...

I have fixed this.  You can now safely start one FvwmCommandS
daemons on each screen.

I really don't understand why FvwmCommand does not use the
DISPLAY in the pipe names.  According to the code it should
do that.  The same happens if you start multiple X servers
and switch between them with Ctrl-Alt-Fn.  Both instances
of FvwmCommandS use the same pipes :-(  This should really
be handled by the module itself.  Any ideas why the code
in FvwmCommandS.c does not work?

Hm, I'll have to try that.  Somewhere in the 4.0 documentation I
found a comment that they still have big trouble with multi head.
The reason was that the second video card isn't initialised.  They
mentioned that multi head usually works with two Matrox cards.  I
finally gave up trying.  Perhaps I can get multihead running with
that hint.  I don't know if a multi head video card will work.

Well, finding a store that still sells Matrox PCI cards is a
bit difficult... :-(

Hey, I can't believe it.  It took me and a colleague about
twenty minutes to understand that.  The first line looks
simple at first, but if your name is not Kernighan or Ritchie
it can give you a headache 8-)

The default is 'dump core'.  I think it's always a good idea - this
way you notice right from the start when your constants are overwritten.

I tried out x3270, and right on the first five attempts this logic
failed to work properly :-)  Often, the keyboard window ends about 10
to 20 pixels far up on the screen:

In some 2.3.x release, the style option

  Style * GrabFocusTransient

was made the default.  Since then, all new transients will
automagically get the focus.  The 'keyboard' window does
take keyboard focus as any other window and is a transient
of the main window.  To fix it, either use

  Style * GrabFocusTransientOff

or make the x3270 transient window 'NeverFocus':

  Style <proper_style_name> NeverFocus

[Sorry for the duplicate reply that will arrive in a day or two :-)
The mail system at my workplace is freaking out again.]

You're an optimist.  I can't believe we can ever properly handle
this situation.  (Did you notice I'm a pessimist).

None at all.  I was just going to commit a patch when I saw your
mail.  Try '$[HOME] with your next update.

Yep!
It seems that there are problem with kde and gnome image path as well
with starting FvwmGtk. Can fvwm-themes-config do the following:

[component]
file=settings/gnome/system-menu
name=System Menu
default=1
choice+file=disabled
choice.name=Disabled
choice+file=gtk-menu
choice.name=Gtk Menu
choice.config+start-stop+=FvwmGtk
choice.config+requires+=settings/gnome/start:fvwmgtk     <----
choice+file=fvwm-menu
choice.name=Fvwm Menu

I.e can we require some cached component to be read? Of course
such a component have to be read only once but more than one
component can ask for it. Also, it seems that 
choice.config+start-stop+=
does not work?
Ok, I know that fvwm-themes-config is under developpement and that
may be I've to do the above, but it is difficult to understand
it. There are very few comments in the code and no *.cfg spec :)
Any way I've begin to play a litle bit with the "themes.cfg" and the
stuff seems powerfull :o)

No, but I will apply a patch that was send to me by
Gregory A. Shimansky for fixing this problems.

I asked whether Read should specially support $HOME, noone answered.
Probably it is not good to encourage user to count from ~, not ~/.fvwm.
In your case, instead of changing any rc, you can just execute:

	ln -s $HOME/.X $HOME/.fvwm/.X

Even more, for me 'Read $HOME/.X/fvwm2/...' for every included file is
also hard-coding. I had the following in my queue of things to implement:
special vars $. and $~. It seems that Dominik implemented $[HOME], so the
second is not really needed now, but the first is needed for many things.

So you will be able to put all your files in one directory and Read only
the main include, all other files are read from the main one like:

  Read $./include1     # $. is substituted with "/home/stric/.X/fvwm2"
  Read $./include2     # - the directory of this rc file

Other usages, which are also impossible without hard-coding:

  *FvwmEvent add_window $./sounds/add_window.au
  ImagePath $./images:+
  Exec exec xv -root -rmode 2 -quit $./images/myimage.jpg

Now you can move or rename your .X/fvwm2 directory to anywhere, you only
need to change one place - Read of the main include, and everything will
still work as expected. As you can guess this is required for themes.

I will implement $. soon (small patch) unless there are any objections.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It's a feature.  Clients are not allowed to resize maximized
windows by design.  The theory behind this is that if the
user maximizes a window he does not want the application to
override his/her choice.  BTW, this should have been the same
with 2.2.x and earlier versions.  The code to prevent resizing
was there, but obviously it didn't work properly.

I already coded a workaround for a similar problem with xterm.
You should not see the screwed up gimp window with the latest
beta release (2.3.18).  Can you please send a bug report to
the gimp folks?  According to the ICCCM2, applications must not
assume that the window manager gives them the geometry they want,
but this is what gimp is doing.

Of course we might also code a new style option that allows
the user to choose between both alternatives (resizing or
not resizing)

Dan, can you try to debug this?  I can't see it here.  The only
hint I have is that my change for the focus-lost-when-entering-root
problem may be part of the cause.

Try replacing

    if(Event.xcrossing.window == Scr.Root
      /* domivogt (16-May-2000): added this test because somehow fvwm sometimes
       * get a LeaveNotify on the root window although it is single screen. */
      && Scr.NumberOfScreens > 1)
    {

with

    if(Event.xcrossing.window == Scr.Root)
    {

(events.c, around line 1617)

Bye

The answer is very easy: some time in the past (in the 2.3.x betas)
we made "GrabFocusTransient" the default behaviour.  From
ConfigFvwmDefaults:

  # Default styles
  Style * GrabFocusTransient

The keyboard window *is* a transient, and since it accepts the focus
like any other window fvwm happy focuses it when it's created.  The
solution is to disable this style explicitly in the config file:

  Style * GrabFocusTransientOff

Submission from: (NULL) (130.149.146.103)


Hi,

it seems to me, like some change in fvwm during the last months
caused, that clients can no longer resize their windows when
these are maximized.

Actually, the only client where I encounter this problem is gimp.
Gimp has a function named "shrink-wrap" that tries to resize the
window to the current image size. With recent versions of fvwm,
this doesn't work anymore, when the window is maximized. Gimp
obviously thinks, that the resize succeeded and redraws the image
in the upper left corner with the scrollbars around it, but the
window just stays maximized and doesn't change its size.

I am not sure, which fvwm-version introduced this behavior
change, I only can tell that it was between fvwm 2.2.2 and
2.3.11. Is it a bug or just a new feature, that I don't
understand? Is there any way, to get the old behavior back?

To reproduce:
1.) Start Gimp (version 1.1.x)
2.) Push the "maximize" button on the image window's title bar 
    (or whatever else you have bound to invoke fvwm's maximize)
3.) In the image window's context menu, call "View/Shrink Wrap"

Regards,
                Peter

Fvwm 2.3.18 crashes with arithmetic exception, when  
"program specified resize increment" hint is equal to 0

xinc and yinc values should be checked against zero at least in
constrain_size() (geometry.c:346)

Hi,

it seems to me, like some change in fvwm during the last months
caused, that clients can no longer resize their windows when
these are maximized.

Actually, the only client where I encounter this problem is gimp.
Gimp has a function named "shrink-wrap" that tries to resize the
window to the current image size. With recent versions of fvwm,
this doesn't work anymore, when the window is maximized. Gimp
obviously thinks, that the resize succeeded and redraws the image
in the upper left corner with the scrollbars around it, but the
window just stays maximized and doesn't change its size.

I am not sure, which fvwm-version introduced this behavior
change, I only can tell that it was between fvwm 2.2.2 and
2.3.11. Is it a bug or just a new feature, that I don't
understand? Is there any way, to get the old behavior back?

To reproduce:
1) start gimp (1.1.x)
2) load some image
3) push the maximize button on the image window's titlebar
   (or whatever else you have bound to fvwm's maximize function)
4) in the image window's context menu, call "View/Shrink wrap"

Regards,
                Peter

Uh, yes.  For some reason the code accepted a size_inc of 0
in some cases.  I think that was a fix for the warnings that
are generated in GetWindowSizeHints() (add_window.c).  I'll
apply a patch.

Thanks, that "fixes" it.

I guess we did this because we didn't want to rely on the application
doing a grab when they pop-up a transient.  I can see how it can be
helpful.

X3270 is one case where moving the focus doesn't make any sense.
Its pretty confusing since the popup re-routes all the keystrokes
back to the main window.  I didn't understand what was going on
since I could type in the main window, but when I hit the iconify
key, fvwm saw it and iconified the popup.

I see we haven't mentioned this in docs/ANNOUNCE,  I'll try to think
up some words.

Fooling with Lenience didn't have any affect.

Other Things:
=============

I'll try to get to the Exmh icon as soon as I can.

I can do the Purify thing but if someone else wants to jump in
feel free.

I do observe the same behavior with X3270 not quite getting the
transient placement right when you move the main window.
Still I thought the interesting thing is the application allowing
for 3 different window managers.  Sounds like something that should
be addressed in ICCCM3 (if there is such a thing).

... [reason: fvwm ignores resize requests from maximized windows]

I think it *might* be necessary that we 'fix' that before
2.4 to keep backwards compatibility.  A style option could
control this:

  Style * ResizeMaximized Program

or

  Style * ResizeMaximized off

In the first case a program is allowed to resize its maximized
windows, in the second it isn't.  The code for this is fairly
simple.  Apart from all the stuff that has to bew done for new
styles, a few lines in HandleConfigureNotify() have to be
changed plus a similar patch for size_inc changes.

Should we do this or not?  I have not made up my mind yet.
The patch should be small enough - so it isn't a big issue,
but if I continue writing more and more new features it
might take a long time before 2.4 is ready.

--

The reason for the peculiar syntax is that I have a future
enhancement in mind:

  Style * ResizeMaximized User

or

  Style * ResizeMaximized User Program

This would allow the user to resize a maximized window
without resetting the 'maximized' state.  The use model
I have in mind is this:

  1) You have a normal terminal window and want to see
     more lines, but don't want to maximize it - either
     because the window would become too big or because
     to maximize it vertically you would have to press
     one or more modifier keys.
  2) Instead you grab the window border and start resizing,
     but with e.g. button 2 or a modifier pressed.  This would
     immediately set the maximized flag (we'll need something
     like 'maximize on keep keep' too) and then start resizing.
  3) You can simply unmaximize the window to restore the old
     geometry.

Personally I run into this problem very often.  Fvwm is not
as comfortable as it could be.  The patches to implement this
are probably non-trivial.  The whole resizing code assumes
it's resizing the frame.  So this is definitely a post-2.4
enhancement.

That didn't seem to help.  I get the same symptoms.

The code you  had me  modify was in  HandleLeaveNotify.   I would have
guessed  the problem with  the title not   highlighting had more to do
with enter notify.  (I haven't figured out how this works yet.)

These symptoms are related to applications that create their own icons.
Would you happen to know where fvwm becomes aware of these icons?

Does this fix the bug you reported with a transparent iconman?

About line 177 of icons.c there is a multi-way if-else construct that
chooses between and fvwm supplied pixmap, a client suplied pixmap and a
client supllied icon window.

I purified the current CVS as of yesterday.  Ran with my normal config.
Brought up FvwmTalk and ran:

Style Style1 IconBox 500x0+185+950 
... (10 times)
Style * UseStyle Style1

No complaints from Purify.

Using the menus gave me:
