The last status of this bug is that we're waiting to hear back from
the user who was going to try the latest version. Given that he hasn't
written back, and that I've downloaded the latest version, 4.3.5, and
run it without producing the described bug, I'd guess it's a bug in
xpp of some sort.

In looking at the todo-3.0 list, I started thinking that maybe another
change to consider might be adding tool tip code to the fvwm library.
I'm not sure if Ric's pager balloon code is sufficiently generic to be
recycled easily, but I was thinking that we have a nice implementation
of tool tips in FvwmPager, and it might be nice to extend the code to
other places, like native window decorations, FvwmIconMan and
FvwmButtons. Good idea? Bad idea?

Hi, so there's still a problem with the stacking ring code in fvwm
(latest CVS). The problem is specific to the following:

Style * StackTransientParent
Style * RaiseTransient
1 window of higher layer
1 window at the top of the default (4) layer, creating a transient

What happens:

The transient maps on top of the higher-layer window

What really happens:

The transient maps and is dropped at the head of the ring.
Then RaiseOrLowerWindow() adjusts its ring position behind the window
on the higher layer.
RaiseOrLowerWindow() recalls itself on the transient's parent, which
correctly determines that the stacking ring is perfectly in order
RaiseOrLowerWindow() for the transientfor calls itself again.
The innermost (there are three total) RaiseOrLowerWindow() returns
having done nothing.
The transientfor RaiseOrLowerWindow() does nothing
The outermost RaiseOrLowerWindow, which was invoked is_new_window &&
!allow_recursion explicitly returns immediately after the second
RaiseOrLowerWindow() returns

At no point does XRestackWindows() or BroadcastRestack() get invoked.
So while the stacking ring is perfectly correct, the ring and the
window state desynchronize... The RaiseOrLowerWindow() logic is
getting fairly complex, and I'm not sure what the proper fix is
here. I'll think on it some more assuming no one else can suggest a
fix.

Also, I'm noticing that upon restart, the stacking ring may not be
correctly synchronized with the correct or existing window stacking
order. It takes a few explicit raises to get the stacking order
correct. I added some code to dump the stack ring upon restart, at the
head of RaiseOrLowerWindow(). Here's its output after a restart:

Current ring:
        60000d : xterm (on layer 5)
        80001c : editres (on layer 4)

I guess, a good user of such tip tools may become FvwmDecor (without tips
on titlebars/buttons/borders it may be difficult to understand bindings).
More on my wish list. There should be added a timeout to tip tools. And a
multiline support in tips ("%n" or similar). Modules with non-automatical
tip tool contents (FvwmButtons, FvwmDecor) should accept messages to
dynamically set a new tip text.

BTW, we use colorset'd xmessage to replace tip tools in fvwm-themes. ;)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hm, I'll simply write a function that re-synchronizes the stacking
order in X from the stack ring...

Yes, that seems to fix things.

Duh. It's probably got something to do with the fact that I'm only
checking the ring at entry time... Let's assume that the ring is in
the correct state, synchronous with the window order, when it *leaves*
RaiseOrLowerWindow()... I think it's all working now.

Mikhael, I never got a reply from you on this one, but if I remember
correctly Tim said something about backing store.  If this problem is
of any relevance, please try if backing store helps (either enable it
for individual windows or the X server or both).

Hi Neil,

can you provide some instructions how I can reproduce this

do.

I don't think it can be related to backing store, it is a +1/-1 issue.
You can find my answer in this thread (you even answered that message), or

Oops, wrong bug. The bug with jerky movement was about flickering
titles. Anyway, any new information on the one quoted above? I can't
reproduce it.

Hi!

This is going to be a little bit compicated but here is an accurate 
description of how to reproduce the problem. (Sorry but I could not
think of another way to simulate the SIGWINCH propagation bug).

Step 1: Grab a copy of my configuration file at:
<http://www.math.mun.ca/~nzanella/computing/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc>

Step 2: Ensure you have expect installed on your system as:
/usr/bin/expect
If not then change the path under the AutoTelnet function to
/usr/local/bin/expect or wherever you have expect installed.
You can get expect from <http://expect.nist.gov/>.

Step 3:
Suppose you have ssh access to a machine called host.a.b.net
and that your username and password for myhost are
myusername and mypassword. Edit a file called
~/.private/.auth/.a.b.net containing the lines:
myusername mypassword

Step 4:
Change the line:

Key G A M AutoTelnet "Garfield" "134.153.1.1" ".cs.mun.ca"

to

Key G A M AutoTelnet "myhost" "myip" ".a.b.net"

Step 5:

Restart

Step 6:

Press Alt-G and launch pine or something on the remote terminal
and resize to see the SIGWINCH bug:SIGWINCH is not propagated
upon resize.

Note 1: If you use menu bindings then instead of Key bindings
then the SIGWINCH is propagated properly.

Note 2: If you use ssh instead of telnet then do the above with
AutoSsh instead of AutoTelnet.

This should reproduce the bug,

Sorry about the length of this description but SIGWINCH stuff
can often turn out to be this long.

Thanks a lot,

Neil

Hrm. I can't reproduce any of this (I don't have Exmh though). Can
you send me a minimal config for the first problem? I think the second
one might be the 'icons lose management' problem on the to-do list.
Given that we have another report that icons get lost when switching
desks all this might be more serious than it looks at first. I'd like
to clean this up before the release if at all possible.

Bye

I can reproduce this with a 1 line .fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1 I A Iconify

I Get  get  the first symptom  with contool  and x3270.  (Both  create
their own  icons.)   Moving the pointer into   the icon  image doesn't
highlight the icon title.  Once you move into the icon title, the icon
title  expands, and highlights.  Moving  from the  icon title into the
icon image unexpands   the  icon title,  but  leaves  the  icon  title
highlighted.  (Its inconsistent.)

Exmh acts the same way, except, no matter  what you do, mouse button 1
on the  icon  image  doesn't deiconify.   Exmh   goes  thru  a lengthy
startup.  If you iconify  it during its startup,  for a while there is
no icon   image, just an icon  title.   The image  appears later.  I'm
guessing when fvwm sees the icon image created later, it doesn't think
its an icon.

Hello,

I would like to make a second suggestion for an enhancement to
hide windows from the FvwmPager. A command like FvwmPagerHideAll
would act like FvwmPagerHide except for its argument would be a
Style option. For example:

FvwmHideAll Sticky

would prevent all Sticky windows from appearing on the FvwmPager
whereas

FvwmPagerHideAll StaysOnTop, StaysOnBottom

would prevent all StaysOnTop and StaysOnBottom applications from
appearing on the FvwmPager.

Thanks,

Neil

Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.88.47)


Hello,

It would be nice if there were a style option called TransmitClick.
What this would do is the following: there are many applications
which the user never needs to click on such as xclocks in the
background or other things. With something like

Style xclock TransmitClick

clicking on the xclock application passes the click onto whatever lies
below it whether it be another window or the root window. As an
application
of TransmitClick imagine having an xterm as large as the whole desktop or
even better a transparent eterm in the background displaying diagnostic
messages while we can still get the menus to pop up by clicking in the
root
window.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

As I understand it the situation with Xinerama really looks like this:

 ---------------    ------------------
 | Secondary   |    | Primary        | 
 | 1280x960    |    | 1400x1050      | 
 |             |    |                | 
 |             |    |                | 
 ---------------    |                | 
                    |                | 
                    ------------------
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    "dead" space


The X server reports itself as being a rectangle with dimensions
2680x1050 on display :0.0. The only issue is that windows getting
into the dead space (0,961) -> (1280,1050) will not be visible.

Maybe one solution would be to allow the definition of DeadBoxes,
analagous to IconBoxes, and have placement algorithms skip
those areas.

FWIW, I am running a 3200x1200 Xinerama display with identical
cards (i.e. no dead spaces) and fvwm2 with no problems.

These worked on 2.3.16 but broke after that.

ClickToFocus mode
Must click twice into a window for it to get focus.
Styles ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/ClickToFocusPassesClick have same
behavior.

(xview) mailtool up/down arrows no longer work in header window.
It'll do something on the 1st arrow key hit....then ignored.

-----------

mouse over root takes away focus for ClickToFocus

This bug has always been broken, but a patch exists and is only half
implemented.

the missing patch to events.c ...

change the appropriate line to add the NumberOfScreens check.

Hello,

  I have some menus that used to be displayed correctly in fvwm 2.2 that now
have a very narrow witdh. For example:

AddToMenu RootMenu
+ "*butterfly.32.xpm*" Title
+ "*lock.32.xpm*"      Exec  xscreensaver-command -lock
+ "*butterfly.32.xpm*" Exec  xscreensaver-command -activate
+ "*utilities.32.xpm*" Popup Utilities
+ "*tools.32.xpm*"     Popup Tools
+ ""                   Nop
+ "*dead.32.xpm*"      Popup Quit-Verify

This creates a menu that does not even contain the whole icons. If I add one
menu item that is mainly a string, then the menu width respects (that's
correct) the width of the string. Furthermore, the submenu triangle can't be
seen, it is hidden under the pixmaps.
If the menu title is a string wider than the menu pixmap only elements, then
the pixmaps are rendered correctly. If it is smaller, then the menu has the
strings width, whatever the pixmaps width is.

Is that actually a problem in fvwm2 ? Note that my icons are 32x32 icons.

Another information/question: when I use SidePic, the side pixmap is not
tiled. I tried to use a 'TiledPixmap' option before the pixmap name, but it
failed. Is it supposed to be tiled vertically or not ? Wouldn't it be
interesting that it would be ? I have some big menus (Modules list for
example) that are bigger than the xpm, and furthermore, it would allow using
smaller xpm for sidepic.

Last one: in the manual page, I can read "You can use the same options for
MenuFace as for the ButtonStyle". I've tried to play with that (with
activeup/activedown/...) in order to have the selected menu item hilighted
with a different pixmap than the menu background but I didn't succeed. Is
there a way for doing that or was I dreaming ?

Thanks!

Jeremie Petit.

Hm, exactly as I had understood it.  But it isn't jerky at all
on my machine.  The only thing that is not smooth is my mouse
movement (because it's so fast).

Well, doesn't sound exactly like a show stopper for 2.4 :-)

I use a similar config (WRT focus policy) and am up-to-date from CVS.
I haven't ever experienced the problems you report. Could you forward
your config for further examination? Can you reproduce the problem
with a very minimal config? I'm wondering whether you maybe use
FvwmAuto or FvwmEvent or something too.

After much playing around w/ .fvwmrc, i figured out the culprit.

xterm must be running.

2.3.17 and up requires an xterm to be running for these bugs not to happen.

I normally dont run xterm.

Your description is right. Whether it is a bug or a feature depends on how
you see it (what to respect, label, icon, or both). Probably a bug, but
for your menu it is easy to solve if you use '%', not '*'.

No, it is not supposed to be tiled. For now at least. If the menu height
is smaller, the side pixmap is stripped, if it is larger, the void space
is filled with the color, specified using: "MenuName@side.xpm@^blue^".

The man page should be read: "as for the ButtonStyle _style_ definitions".
ButtonStyle's _state_ (and _flags_ as well) can't be applied to menus.

As of now, it is only possible to specify a background of the whole menu.
For the selected (active) item you can only specify solid color (and 3d
shading colors using ActiveColorset).

Mikhael.

Hmm, my config runs fine without xterms. My circulate function is
almost identical to yours, so I'm curious what else I might do to
reproduce the problem you're having. I have no unusual problems with
focus, and haven't had anything major like this since some very bad
betas.

Ah! I had to add Xview to my system, but once I did I started to see
problems with focus. They were partially mitigated by the addition of
the recommended:

Style * OLDecor, Lenience

but not entirely. There are still problems with XView apps. You've
noticed the section in the manpage about OpenLook/XView stuff?

Well, what *are* the problems with focus? For me they all went
away by using 'Lenience'.

Ah, right. Circulation and focus transfer seem to work okay, except
that the Xview window itself doesn't appear to actually get focussed.
By FVWM's reckoning (decoration state, IconMan button states, etc.)
the Xview window (cmdtool in this case) has focus, but it won't
necessarily take keyboard input unless the pointer is positioned
inside the Xview window. This works reasonably for the MouseFocus case
but will be broken with SloppyFocus and ClickToFocus. I would guess
this is the root cause for todo item #148. At least in the MouseFocus
case, things seem to work properly. However, cmdtool apparently wants
to show the window's focus state by modifying the cursor. This visual
hint does not seem to work reliably, as keyboard input may be accepted
by cmdtool while the cursor's state would indicate that input is not
accepted.

My guess is that Xview isn't really designed to work with focus models
except plain old MouseFocus, and that Xview has the unfortunate
tendency to have windows manage focus themselves, rather than allowing
the wm do the job it's supposed to do. All in all, I suspect that
these are inherent failings in the toolkit itself, rather than any
kind of failure on FVWM's part to correctly honor OpenLook/Xview
hinting, etc.

Of course. Xview applications set (incorrect) hints that indicate
that they want to manage focus themselves. Fvwm can't do much to
force them to accept keyboard focus if they don't want to. I guess
these apps ignore the focus if the cursor is not inside them.

Please note that these problems are reported for _xview_.

I'm using fvwm-2.3.19 with a .fvwm2rc which I hardly adapted from
2.2.4. I'm running on Solaris 2.6 == SunOS5.6 on SPARC/UltraSPARC. I
too am havin problems with xview programs.

My config (in terms of FvwmAuto/FvwmEvent):

$ egrep -i -C1 "fvwm(auto|event)" ~/.fvwm2rc
AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmButtons
+                         "I" Module FvwmAuto 750
+                         "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
--
AddToFunc RestartFunction "I" Module FvwmButtons
+                         "I" Module FvwmAuto 750
+                         "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
--
+                       "Background"    Module  FvwmBacker
+                       "AutoRaise"     Module  FvwmAuto 200 Raise Nop
+                       "Stop AutoRaise" KillModule FvwmAuto
+                       ""              Nop

So, at least until fvwm-2.2.4, my window focus followed the mouse, and
windows were raised automagically after 750ms. Apart from some very
peculiar behavior in general (windows which I throw to the bottom using
RaiseLower sometimes come to the top again immediately), xview windows
are a PITA. It isn't even recognized that the mouse is over them until
I clock on them. (The window from below raises itself to the top!) The
window which had the previous focus stays focussed when moving the
mouse to an adjacent xview window, as if the mouse were over the root
window. (The windows under the xview window _don't_ raise themselves
then.)

I'd be glad to send my full config, and try a minimal one if you
compose it for me.

Greetings,
Moritz, almost back to 2.2.4   ;->

Well, folks, it's time for my occasional vacation.  This time I'm off to
London for a few days and then to Norway again for a couple of weeks.

While in Norway I'll have some Internet access, so if, say, the CVS server
blows up I have a good chance of fixing it in a reasonable amount of time.
The lists will be going pretty much on autopilot while I'm gone.  This
hasn't been a real problem in the past.

I'll be back in early August.

Alright I can't be going insane, well its possible but not related to the following.

Running current CVS with a just few xterms the stacking order seems to get confused.  A simple example is this

Where the window on the left may be two windows stacked ruffly on top
of each other.  If I raiselower the left window, lets say it is on the
bottom.  It might raise itself infront of the bottom most right window
but no both of them.  A second raiselower sends it to the bottom.  I
have raiselower bound to a keystroke.  Executing just raise or lower
works as expected.  I verified that all windows are in the same layer.
None of the xterms in question are sticky.  Any thoughts? Any sympathy?
Has work fine gotten to me and I'm imagining this?

Put this line in your config file and all your problems will
hopefully go away:

  Style * Lenience

This strange behaviour is not fvwm's fault.  All XView windows
are *specifically requesting* this funny behaviour according
to the ICCCM2 which describes client/windowmanager interaction.
In other words: all XView applications violate the spec. They
tell the window manager 'please do not give me focus, I will
take it myself', but then still expect the window manager to
give them focus.

Hmm, I don't usually use RaiseLower, so I didn't notice. But I just
tried it out, and when issuing RaiseLower on a window on the bottom of
its layer, the window stays on the bottom. I see it flash like it's
raising, but then it falls back to the bottom. After then next
RaiseLower it comes up front and then behaves correctly for subsequent
RaiseLower's. I wonder what happened. I'll poke around.

We have --enable-gnome/--disable-gnome and --with-gnome/--without-gnome.
My first thought was to remove one of them. But in fact we have two
independent gnome supports. And yes, this may be somewhat confusing.

1) FVWM is mostly GNOME compliant, i.e. it supports gnome window manager
hints. This is now on. I see no reason why this should fail for anyone,
because there is no external files, everything in internal gnome.[ch].
The reasons to give --disable-gnome may be size or fvwm-2.2 simulation.

2) FvwmGtk can be compiled against gnome libs or only gtk libs. Which one
to use is determined in configure time by trying to compile a small gnome
program. To disable this check --with-gnome=no can be specified.

I tested several combinations for configure and everything was ok for me.
I turned gnome supports on by default due to Dominik's request and since
(maybe naively) I hope it is safe. Let's wait for a daily snapshot build.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is going back a bit, but I just stumbled across something
interesting...

Could you take a look at:

http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.faq.html#setup_resize

and see if anything in there is helpful? At the very least, before
entering any full-screen apps, etc., could you play with 'stty -a' and
compare the results you get for starting your term in various ways,
before and after resizing?

When I start up my xterm + expect script with a _keyboard_ binding
things behave abnormally:

(after the connection)
stty -a | head -n 1
speed 9600 baud; rows 24; columns 76; (rows and columns are correct)

(then I resize)
stty -a | head -n 1
speed 9600 baud; rows 0; columns 0;
(wrong! the same happens if I maximize)

On the other hand...
when I start up my xterm + expect script from a _menu_ binding
the outpus of stty -a | head -n 1 is always correct even after
I resize or maximize the xterm.

stty -a | head -n 1
speed 9600 baud; rows 24; columns 76; (correct)
(resize)
stty -a | head -n 1
speed 9600 baud; rows 17; columns 75; (correct)
(maximize)
stty -a | head -n 1
speed 9600 baud; rows 28; columns 76; (correct)

And if I start up my  xterm + expect script from an _FvwmButtons Button_
then the behavior is also correct (same as above).

Ah. So sced is having trouble with initial *placement*. There are lots
of apps that are badly behaved WRT placement. Are you using the
NoPPosition style? If not, give it a whirl.

Ok, I try the patch it works find (need just one change for
using the fvwm libs malloc).
I suggest to apply it. We may consider that it is a bug fix 
patch (1 pixel line for the motion is not enought under certain
config).

Some objections ?
