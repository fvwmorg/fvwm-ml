Hi,

I was working on a new module when I realized I believe that it
doesn't seem to make sense to pass a pointer from fvwm2 to the module
since the virtual address spaces are different (I think so, but
confirm?).  Some packets send a pointer to the FvwmWindow.

It would be nice for a module to be able to get to the pixmap / mini
pixmap icon ID's for a window (not *window* ids, which are already
passed).  Anyone think this would be a decent addition / replacement
for some of the existing CONFIGURE_WINDOW fields?

Regards,
Andrew

Is a 2.1.0 release still planned?  If so, what is the time frame.  Just
curious... I know how busy things can get! :-)

I have a new patch, tbsp8 available.  First, it adds a new borderstyle
flag which supplements the HiddenHandles, NoInset (with this, you can
nearly duplicate fvwm95 look).  Also, *much* more code can now be
compiled out.  

Then, there is a new thing.  In response to people wanting different
"looks," there is a compile-time option to add code for general style
tagging which can be applied with the Style command to particular
windows.  Although it uses the Style command, it doesn't use a style
flag (but because of this even the *new* MiniIcons patch won't
patch... Brady? :) As a compile time option you can also disable the
use of multistyles (add/button/title styles).

After a lot of sweat here, with this, you have this new ability for
fvwm-2.0.43:

AddToLook CustomLook1
+ <button/border/titlestyle/hilight color command>
+ <etc.>
Style "-CustomLook1-" UseLook CustomLook1,HandleWidth 1,NoButton 2

AddToLook CustomLook2
+ <button/border/titlestyle/hilight color command>
+ <etc.>
Style "-CustomLook2-" UseLook CustomLook2,HandleWidth 4

Then you can do:

Style "*rxvt*" UseStyle -CustomLook1-
Style "*xterm*" UseStyle -CustomLook2-

I played around briefly and in about 10 minutes had an xterm which
look similar to NeXT and an rxvt which looked like W95 and a Netscape
which looked mwm, but the idea is that you can compile in USELOOK
support even without pixmap buttons/titlebars/borders/gradients and
at least use it to define window classes.

Here is an excerpt from the patched Fvwm.tmpl:

 * -DPIXMAP_TITLEBARS		!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 * 
 * Allows use of the styled title-bars using the TitleStyle 
 * command in a similar fashion to the ButtonStyle command.
 * If Xpm support and PIXMAP_BUTTONS is compiled in,
 * then you can also use pixmaps on title-bars.
 *
 *
 * -DBORDERSTYLE		!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * This compiles in support for different border styles using 
 * the BorderStyle command. See the man page entries for BorderStyle 
 * for detailed usage information.
 *
 *
 * -DGRADIENTS			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * Compiles in support for the use of both horizontal and 
 * vertical, linear and nonlinear gradients for buttons and 
 * title-bars. See the man page button style entries for
 * HGradient and VGradient for more information.
 *
 *
 * -DMULTISTYLE			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * Allows the use of stacked styles for buttons and title-bars.
 * There is a slight memory penalty for each stacked style
 * over the default ones. See AddButtonStyle and AddTitleStyle 
 * for more information.
 *
 * 
 * -DUSELOOK			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 * 
 * Allows the creation of tagged looks, any of which can be
 * assigned to a window using the UseLook Style command.  To create
 * "look" definitions, see the man page entries for AddToLook 
 * and DestroyLook.  There is a slight memory penalty for each added
 * look, probably at least 10k (more or less depending on previous
 * compile setings and individual styles).

Well, I think that all this might finially be enough to keep people
happy for a little while, including me since it can all be compiled
out too. :)

I was wondering if you could give me a hand merging your latest stuff
in?  I have an earlier version in there (+ the first mini icons patch
from Brady) before you started going crazy, and I don't want to try
and rip it out and then put the new stuff in (none of the patches will
work either due to the number of other things I have in there).

I have a couple of minor things that I need to finish up to get
'2.0.44-almost' out to the workers list, and I was wondering if you
could merge your stuff into that after I announce it and mail me the
resulting patch?

Actually, might be better if I gave it to you first, then put
'2.0.44-almost' out with your latest stuff in there so the workers
list could bang on it first.  That is, if you have the time & the will
to do this.

Hopefully I'll have '2.0.44-almost' ready in a day or two, but
unfortunately I'm getting sick again so minor delays may have to
happen again...

Thanks,
Chuck

Well, I just sent a note to the workers list about the status of
2.0.44, and I hope to get 2.1.0 out just a few weeks after that gets
out there (containing bug fixes and very minor enhancements only).

That's the current "plan", anyways.

This would be fine, and desirable.

Chuck, please don't try to merge it in yourself.  It would be needless
work on your end.

Note there are a few minor (but annoying to users) bugs in tbsp8, but
I am aware of them.  I actually want to remerge the entire thing since
I can make some changes the the define names (to make more sense) and
fix some bugs along the way.  Then I can make a non-public patch line
for people here to bang on, to iron out the remaining bugs.

At *that* point I want to present you with something that will merge
in nicely and so you can merge it on a test tree first to see the
changes.

    Charles> Hopefully I'll have '2.0.44-almost' ready in a day or

Uh oh :(.  We're all rooting for you :).  It has gotten cold and icy
recently. Your health is a bigger concern than a minor delay, so don't
worry :).

Andrew

Well, the borderstyle/uselook patch is actually starting to work now
(still needs a bit more refining here)....

The next patch will have a revised define naming scheme for
OPTION_DEFINES (also, code ifdef's will be cleaner).  It will also
allow you to also compile out support for Vector buttons, which are
the *standard* fvwm2 buttons (with a note about being "standard"), if
you are inclined to do so (saves a bit 'o mem).

Please see if the following revised scheme makes sense, since it's
*easily* changed at this point in time.  If you want to suggest
something, do so.

 * -DVECTOR_BUTTONS
 *
 * Allows use of drawn coordinate-list type buttons.  This button type
 * is considered "standard," so it is recommended that you leave it
 * untouched.  However, if you don't use them at all you will save a
 * small amount if memory per "look" you define with AddToLook (see
 * -DUSELOOK below).  See the man page entry for "Vector" for usage
 * information.
 * 
 * 
 * -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS
 *
 * Allows use of pixmap buttons.  You must have Xpm support to use
 * this.  Compatibility with the old definition format is preserved.
 * See the man page button style entry for Pixmap for usage
 * information.
 *
 *
 * -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS
 *
 * Allows the use of gradient buttons.  Support for both horizontal
 * and vertical, linear and nonlinear gradients is included.  See the
 * man page button style entries for HGradient and VGradient for usage
 * information.
 *
 *
 * -DMULTISTYLE
 *
 * Allows the use of stacked styles for buttons and title-bars.  There
 * is a slight memory penalty for each stacked style over the default
 * ones. See AddButtonStyle and AddTitleStyle for usage information.
 *
 * 
 * -DEXTENDED_TITLESTYLE
 * 
 * Allows use of the styled title-bars using the TitleStyle command in
 * a similar fashion to the ButtonStyle command.  Defining this
 * enables the use of all the valid button styles on a title-bar.
 *
 *
 * -DBORDERSTYLE
 *
 * This compiles in support for the BorderStyle command.  Unlike the
 * extended TitleStyle command, not all styles are available.  See the

 * 
 * Allows the creation of tagged appearances, any of which can be
 * assigned to a window using the UseLook Style flag.  To create

I've put tbsp9 on the WWW page.  Many cleanups, but notable changes
are:

 - revised OPTION_DEFINES, almost no dependencies.. I've compiled
soley with -DBORDERSTYLE to obtain just HiddenHandles (no pixmap
borders either :).. all button styles (VECTOR, PIXMAP and GRADIENT)
are independent, as well as EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE, BORDERSTYLE,
MULTISTYLE and USEDECOR (i've not tested to many combinations though)

- Vector (standard) button style can be compiled out, reducing size if
you never use them...

- the name UseLook was making me sick (since "look" is also a verb :),
so it's been completely renamed to Decor instead of Look (i.e.,
UseDecor, AddToDecor)

- ChangeDecor to change a window's decor dynamically (i.e. put it on
ChangeDecor MyLook on a menu, select it and click on a window.. voila
:).. this might be useful for tagging windows or a module which edits
styles

- UpdateDecor is a new fvwm2 function (for both -DUSEDECOR and not) to
update button/title/border styles, since all button/title/border
functions do not update anymore (useful for a module that edits
styles).. it can also update only a single decor definition

- can compile PIXMAP_BUTTONS without Xpm support (although the first
few times I tried, CachePicture didn't seem to return a bitmap, not
sure why).. If you compile without VECTOR, PIXMAP or GRADIENT buttons,
all you get are Simple and Solid buttons now :)

- BorderStyle Pixmap style changed to TiledPixmap for symmetry

I didn't see mention of this in in the mail archive, so here goes.

I'm using fvwm-2.0.43 on linux, and my PixmapPath line keeps getting
longer and longer...  If it's 255 characters or longer, fvwm refuses
to start, but doesn't give a reason why.  No, I didn't look at the
source code.  Yes, I did play around with the line to figure out the
line length limit.

If this bug has already been identified, please ignore this message!

This is due to text size limit in module communiction function 
HandleModuleInput. In your case, the module reading initial config file 
is killed by fvwm.

It may handle more than 255 chars if you re-compile after changing maximum
string size and related conditional statements in HandleModuleInput in
module.c under fvwm directory.

This should be near the last of the BorderStyle/UseDecor patches.

The only changes are:

 - consolidated parse code

 - can now compile-out ActiveDown and/or Inactive button states
    to save memory

  A month ago I posted a (really) dirty patch to put a background
pixmap on FvwmButtons. Now that I've read the sources :), here is a
much cleaner one.

You just have to put the FvwmButtonsIconBack option:

*FvwmButtonsIconBack <pixmap>

If anybody has a better name for this option... :)

Note that the BackIcon(...) option for buttons or containers doesn't
work anymore (they don't work in jarl's version either).

You can also get this patch here:

"Real Soon Now" :)

Actually, it is getting close.  I have some more minor things to
finish, then Andrew Veliath (who has a few more finals to take over
the next few days) has agreed to merge his latest Borderstyle patch (I
couldn't keep up with his changes) into my current development version
which will become 2.0.44-almost, which I will then give to the workers
mailing list for pre release testing.

Then shortly after that I'll release 2.0.44 (ideally, less than a
week).

Then a few weeks later I'd like to get 2.1.0 out (will only be bug
fixes and minor updates).

Chuck

ps - this prompted me to add another FAQ question:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

34) When will fvwm release X.Y.Z be ready?

A: This is always a difficult question to answer.  I work on fvwm in
   my rather nebulous and semi-mythical "spare time", therefore I
   usually can't provide an exact answer for this, since my time
   estimates for it are often wrong/changing.

   "Real Soon Now" is one of my favorite responses when they are
   getting close, but then, who is to say what "close" means? :)

   Never fear though, as they will keep coming...  I do try to post
   periodic status reports to the mailing lists, so you could search
   the archives at any point in time to see if I've made any reports
   lately.
