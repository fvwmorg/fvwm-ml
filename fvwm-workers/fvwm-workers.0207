I recall that now under certain situation fvwm or a module
needs to perform some strings conversions. At present time
the conversions are performed each time you draw the string.

Here some examples (when you need conversion):
(1) you have a menu encoded in UTF-8 and to display this menu in
the good way you use an iso10646-1 (core) font. To be able to display
the menu, fvwm should convert the menu labels into a (XChar2b *) struct
in USC-2 encoding [1].
(2)  you have a menu encoded in UTF-8 and want to use an iso8859-1
(core) font, so you indicate to fvwm that the StringEncoding is UTF-8.
To be able to display the menu, fvwm converts (using iconv) the menu
labels from UTF-8 to iso8859-1.
(3) xft font leads to various conversion. Basically if your locale
charset is not iso8859-1, fvwm should convert into USC-2.
(4) bidi conversions are some times needed

So if we do not want to perform some str conversions each time we
draw a string we should keep the result of the conversions in memory.

The point of this mail is that I'm not sure that we should do
that and I would like to have some advice. I've made some
experimentation so that we can take a decision. It is clear
that the advantage of keeping the result of the conversion
is to speed up the code and to save some CPU. The disadvantage
is that more memory is used and that some special work should be
done when the font change (or at least when the string/font encoding
change).

I've (partially) implemented this "keep in memory converted
string" idea on my machine by introducing a new struct

typedef struct
{
	char *str;                  /* this original string */
	char *e_str;                /* the encoded string or str */
	XChar2b *str_2b;            /* the encoded string or NULL */
	int e_len;                  /* lenght of the encoded string */
	unsigned is_encoded : 1;
} FlocaleString;

and by replacing all the (char *)str which should be displayed by
fvwm by such a structure. The first time an FlocaleString should be
displayed conversions are performed (if needed) and the next times
we do not needed to do any conversion (if the font change the encoded
part of the structure is freed and is_encoded is set to zero). 
I've fully implemented this in menus.
 
So my first test is to start fvwm with fvwm-themes and to use an
iso10646-1 font for the menus. Then, pop up all the fvwm-themes
root menus with depth =< 2 (I've two generated menus: kde3 menu
and the xlock menus).
At start up the new code uses ~ 44 Kb of additional memory, at the end
of the test it uses ~ 136 Kb of additional memory. This does not seem
dramatic. On the other hands I see no visible difference.

My second test is about speed up. I've wrote an "hello world" program
using libfvwm.a. Each times you click on the window it draws 1000
times a given string with a given fvwm font using the functions of
the libs.

Here some results (I've a 256Mhz AMD k6 processor :o( )

(a) An iso-10646-1 core font and an UTF-8 strings of 240 characters
(repetition of "test ιθ" in UTF-8, so the converted string is of length
< 240):
1000 drawing take 0.25 sec with the new code
1000 drawing take 0.50 sec with the current code

(b) An iso8859-15 core font with StringEncoding=iso8859-15 and the
same UTF-8 string as (a):
1000 drawing take 1.5 sec with the new code
1000 drawing take 1.7 sec with the current code

(c) the same test  but replace iso8859-15 with iso8859-1
1000 drawing take 0.20 sec with the new code
1000 drawing take 0.30 sec with the current code

(d) An iso8859-15 core font with an ascii strings of 240 characters
(non conversion):
1000 drawing take 0.34 sec with both code

(e) An iso8859-1 core font with the same string than (d)
(non conversion):
1000 drawing take 0.28 sec with both code

(f) Drawing with an xft font a "locale" string of length 240 (needs
a conversion from conversion iso8859-15 to USC-2 here).
1000 drawing take 4.63 sec with the new code
1000 drawing take 5.00 sec with the current code

For me the result of the test (b) vs the result of test (c) was
totally mysterious ... As my locale charset is iso8859-15
(b) use a FontSet as (c) use a FontStruct. (d) and (e) show that
Xmb drawing is slow when you have a alternation of ascii and non
ascii characters and not so slow if it is not the case.

So, the conclusion is that the new code is a bit faster, but nothing
visible or important. Other factors than conversion seems more
important [2] and any way the Xmb* functions do a lot of conversions
each times. The additional memory seems to me not very important too.

So, I do not know what to do. Some suggestions?

Regards, Olivier


Note: [1]
typedef struct {
    unsigned char byte1;
    unsigned char byte2;
} XChar2b;

[2] It seems that some part of the Xlib i18n code is broken.
In fact I begun to work on this subject one week ago. But I
spent a lot of time on the Xlib code... The first thing is that
there are memory leaks in XCreateFontSet/XFreeFontSet (a FontStruct
is not freed at some point + other minor leaks). So the fvwm-2.4.x
memory problems with --enable-multibyte is not fvwm fault but Xlib fault.
These memory leaks are less visible in the 2.5.x series because we
have a font cache. I've sent a patch to the XFree team that fixes the
leaks but I get no feedback yet. Moreover, it seems that too many
FontStruct is loaded when you create a FontSet so I think that the
Xmb* functions can be speed up. Basically, the Xlib i18n code needs
a clean up.

I have a FvwmPager swallowed in FvwmButtons on-top panel.
If i move a window using middle mouse button dragging in pager,
the window will bo moved correctly but disapear from the pager
and also from the IconManager for that page.
If I then move the window by dragging it directly, it will appear again
in both Pager and IconMan.

During the time the window is missing in pager, its geometry is like:
(correct width)x(correct height)+(correct x)+(correct y+1703936).
Note that 1703936 is quite round number :-), 26*2^16

I'm not entirely sure which commit did this. But I just updated from cvs
and now I find the WindowOps menus (I use fvwm-themes) are now no longer
bound to any window but float freely. Also since I have TitleAtLeft and
TitleAtRight options in that menu, I now have to click on the window I
want to apply that style to. Is this the intention now?

Full_Name: SivaramaKrishnan Nageswaran
Version: 2.5.2
CVS_Date: 
OS: Redhat 7.1
X_Server: Xfree 86 version 4.0.3
Submission from: (NULL) (192.11.226.116)


When I open rxvt - either using "rxvt" command or 
"rxvt -fn 10x20 -bg Black -fg White&", I'm not able to see the left most
character in the terminal.

This is how it looks like,
10:51:08][nsiva@nsiva]:~>

rather than
[10:51:08][nsiva@nsiva]:~>

I need to got to the next desktop to get this refreshed.

Is there any patch available for this?

What was exactly a problem so changing the existing behaviour is needed?

This breaks application menus in FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar etc.

Yes, I am aware of this. I can submit a patch so that a backout could be
commited, although after seeing both spelling versions in the man-pages
my intention was to keep the all of the man-pages consistent. Any
spelling is fine with me.

I've fixed that one.  You don't need tho enable debug messages
anyway.  It's a relic of the past that may eventually be removed
completely.  It suggests that it provides some useful information,
but it doesn't.  Not even to the developers.

So the window disappears from the modules, but is still visible on
the desktop?

If the window is still visible, its real y coordinate can not have
this value.  How did you find out the geometry?

You're right.  The CONFIGARGSNE table is broken.  It should list
the data length for title_thickness and boundary_width.  I'll
commit a fix.

 - FvwmButtons invokes a menu
 - Menu invokes FvwmIdent

==> FvwmButtons was automatically selected as FvwmIdent's target.

I'm not sure what broke it.  Perhaps the change should be made in
module_interface.c, not in the menu code.

It happens every time w/ the last Flocale.c commit.  All data

broken.

I guess you should rather ask this question at the rxvt site.

When I read this strange description (FvwmButtons unlike FvwmIconMan and
FvwmTaskBar does not set a window context) I immediately thought about
some global variable used instead of a window context passed by a module.
Good you don't use it anymore, seems like a correct fix. Although I can't
test it right now; you say it dumps core anyway.

Now when menus respect a window context (I think it's good), we need a way
to throw it out. "Any" would be ok, but it requires at least one window.
Should we add a new prefix-like unconditional command "NoContext"?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Anyway, I've made a quick patch that copes with the simple
situation that the base size changes while the window is being
resized.  Next, someone will write an app that resizes itself
while being resized %-P  Really, I'd expect a bit more
thoughfulness at least from the programmers of a GUI library.

Full_Name: Wesley Tanaka
Version: 2.2.5
CVS_Date: 
OS: RedHat 7.2
X_Server: XFree86 version: 4.1.0
Submission from: (NULL) (209.246.29.222)


I am using comicscartoon from the sharefonts package
<ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/contrib/noarch/noarch/sharefonts-0.10-9.noarch.rpm>
as my titlebar font by including the following line:

WindowFont "-*-comicscartoon-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

in my .fvwm2rc file.

In fvwm2 version 2.2.4, the font was displayed correctly.  However, when I
upgraded to version 2.2.5, the font was instead silently replaced with a
different font.

The comicscartoon font was still loaded on my system -- when I tried to do
an xfontsel -pattern "-*-comicscartoon-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

the correct font displayed in the window.

Steps to reproduce:

1) install sharefonts package from
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/contrib/noarch/noarch/sharefonts-0.10-9.noarch.rpm
2) install fvwm2 2.2.4  from
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.1/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/fvwm2-2.2.4-9.i386.rpm
3) add WindowFont "-*-comicscartoon-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
to .fvwm2rc
4) run fvwm2
5) the font is correctly displayed
6) install fvwm2 2.2.5 from
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.2/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/fvwm2-2.2.5-4.i386.rpm
8) restart fvwm2
9) the font has been replaced with a different font

expected behavior: comicscartoon font is displayed in the titlebars of
windows
actual behavior: some other font is displayed instead

Actually, how did you get a core dump if you could not even compile
fvwm?  The stack trace in the bug report isn't very helpful.  The
executable has no debug symbols.  When you compile again, please
do not strip the executable and fetch a stack trace again.

P.S.: Please no fvwm related mail to my private address.  I

Forget about the debug stuff in the distribution.  It's not
helpful for anything else but running a few sanify checks before a
release.

Did you install the new fvwm with

  $ make install

?  Are you sure the correct executable is being executed?  It it
in your shell PATH?  If you compiled with just "make", the
executable *has* debug information.  When gdb does not display any
useful information that means that either the executable that was
run has no debug info or gdb did not find the sources.

Yes, that's what the old code up to 2.3.23 was doing.  It's not
very nice to block the mouse completely in this case, but it seems
necessary here.  I have restored the old way for this special
case.

Since update wait's for all events of a certain type to be processed, this =
cannot be a timing problem. I have to repeat, this does work under other wi=

With current cvs if I issue the following command in an FvwmConsole...

Style * Font "shadow=2 3 SE:xft:Luxi Mono:Bold:pixelsize=14"

...then click on an FvwmButtons to invoke any menu it causes fvwm to
restart. The above command also resets all window styles such as
TitleAtLeft etc...

Is the command wrong? Or is it a bug?

Mikhael, I found this code snippet in FvwmEvent.c:

  /* migo (19-Aug-2000): synchronize on M_DESTROY_WINDOW */
  SetSyncMask(fd, M_DESTROY_WINDOW);

I believe this causes fvwm and FvwmEvent to freeze sometimes when
the pointer is grabbed and windows are spawned and killed really
fast.  The best way to reproduce this is to enable the "autoraise"
config I posted in another thread, then open any gtk application
(e.g. gedit) and tear out its menu or tool bar.  Drag it around
(using the button on the menu bar, not the window title) so that
it's repeatedly swallowed by the gedit window and spit out again.
Sometimes it takes only two seconds until FvwmEvent and fvwm have
a deadlock, sometimes I can drag it around for five minutes
without any problems.

I still don't understand the circumstances that lead to the
deadlock.  Any additional debug code (frpintfs, efence, etc.)
dramatically reduces the probability of this happening, so its
certainly a race condition somewhere.  If you can help with this
problem, please do.

By the way, what was that patch good for in the first place?

P.S.:  It may be a problem with packets that are not sent
completely.  I notice this effect in the past with FvwmConsole.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

There was one bug report (saying that the destroy_window behaviour
changed since 2.2.4) that I fixed (in both FvwmEvent and PositiveWrite):

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0008/msg00011.html
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0008/msg00133.html

If you know a better fix, do it.
I don't think I will have a time for FvwmEvent debugging this/next week.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Don't use current cvs.  There is a core dump in Flocale.c for me.
If you downgrade that file to the version from two days ago it
works fine.

Okay, this is why busy modules using synchronized messages can run
into a deadlock with fvwm:  take for example FvwmEvent with the
sync'ed M_DESTROY_WINDOW message.

1) When a lot of things are going on on the desktop (many X events
   are coming in), fvwm handles all of them and puts the module
   messages into the module queues (PositiveWrite()).
2) Now that we have a long message queue for our module, an event
   arrives that triggers a synchronized module message.  In the
   case of FvwmEvent, a dying window triggers a M_DESTROY_WINDOW
   message.
3) The new message is added to the queue via PositiveWrite().
   Afterwards, fvwm looks at the packet type and sees that the
   module requested synchronized transmission and goes into the
   part dealing with synchronization.
4) Next, "FlushMessageQueue(module)" is called.  This function
   spits the data into the module pipe at full speed - and because
   the queue is so large, it pipe gets finally full and the next
   write() call returns EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN.
5) FlushMessageQueue stops writing data and simply returns.

Result: fvwm entered the sync'ed code branch and waits for the
   unlock message from the module.  But because the pipe is full,
   the M_DESTROY_WINDOW message that needed synchronization in the
   first place is never sent.  The module simply waits for further
   input that never comes since fvwm waits for the unlock message.

What do we do about this?

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I tried to fix it by adding another fvwmSelect call in
FlushMessageQueues() that waits for the write pipe to accept
further input.  I'm not sure if I've done this right.  Could
someone with a better knowledge of pipe communication please take
a look at the patch?  I'm quite sure the select call is correct,
but I'm not sure that how the code reats to errors is right and
that it's ok to always retry writing.

Please upgrade to the latest stable fvwm release (2.4.8).  We have
done a lot of work related to the parsing of fonts.  You should
not encounter this problem anymore.  If the problem persits,
please report back.

Yes, it was some confusion between several globals.  Recently I
removed the "Context" global - and that triggered it.  The problem:
There are (were) two pairs of vars that describe the context:
the parameters "fw" and "context" and the globals "Fw" and
"Context".  Usually, I belive, not always, the [Cc]ontext bit
overrides the [Ff]w bit.  In other words: if context is C_ROOT and
fw is a valid window, the window is ignored.  The menu code had a
place (menu_func()) where Fw was taken as a fallback when fw ==
NULL.  Somehow the Fw was used as the context window, although
context must have been C_ROOT.  I'd immediately throw out the last
dangerous global (Fw), but I don't understand well enough how it
works.  If I do something wrong, we'll likely get a number of
core dumps.  Sigh, this is all so confusing.  You always regret
when you use globals just to save the effort of passing the
context data around.

That's fixed now.

I don't know.  Is it really necessary?  I'm swamped in old bug
reports right now, so I'd be grateful if you can take care of it.

It seems that TK applications don't know where they are on the
screen right after they are mapped.  TK tries to map the menus
adjacent to the menu bar and fails because of the internal screwed
up idea of its position.  I've committed a workaround in both, the
stable and the development branch (simply send a ConfigureNotify
event with the correct window position to the application).  This
should be fixed in TK and/or tkdiff.  Could you please file a bug
report there?

Bye

I am glad to hear it.  Don't hesitate to ask on the mailing list
should you encounter any problems with the transition from 2.2
to 2.4.

Full_Name: Yin Wang
Version: 2.5.2, 2.4.8
CVS_Date: 
OS: Redhat Linux 7.2
X_Server: XFree86-SVGA 4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (211.159.89.237)


Hi,

  I've beening using my fvwm 2.5.2 and 2.4.8 with Xfree 86 on a Linux
machine.

  All goes well with XFree86 4.1, but when change to 4.2, loaded with "xtt"
(Xwindow True Type) module, when the windows with "old style" scrollbar on
the left, such as xterm, FvwmConsole appear, all the moving operation of
the windows will be delayed, that is, they don't move with the mouse
motion, but they move some time later! There is quiet a few seconds between
your operation and the window movement, and in that period you can't do any
window operation!

  I think this is probably a fvwm bug. Because xterm moves freely with
other Window Managers with xtt loaded on XFree86 4.2.

  I hope this will be fixed soon.

Have you tried the latest snapshot?  It has a patch for the
problem, but I can test it only on i386 machines.

Yes.
I've backported changes in fvwm/module_interface.c
and lib/vpacket.h to my 2.5.2 and it works perfectly.

Thanks much for fvwm, the best window manager ever!

All,
   Thanks for the help. As you said, it's the problem with rxvt only. I
was using 2.7.5 version of rxvt and when I upgraded that to 2.7.8 - I
was not facing that problem.

Thanks for the help!!!
Regards
Siva

I actually installed 2.4.7 from the Sourceforge RPM. I encountered some
minor problems with it, and went back (this was just this morning, after I
posted my question). I guess it would be inconsiderate of me to mention
that, without mentioning what they were, so here goes.

I was somewhat disappointed that I couldn't install the RPM without first
obtaining libstroke. I know a lot of people consider it to be really
nifty, but at some point I just get tired of having to intall yet another
piece of software I'll never use on my system, to be able to get something
else I do use. I don't mean that to sound like a criticism, and I hope
that should I decide to build from source, that --disable=libstroke, or
it's equivalent, is an option. But at the moment, I'm not going to
download the tarball for the sake of making that discovery - I have very
limited network bandwidth. I have to admit though, that it's pretty
unlikely that I'll build from source.

There is a difference in the way menus are drawn. I don't know if it's a
bug. I looked through the 2.4.7 NEWS file for any mentions of menu changes
that sounded like what I was seeing, and didn't see any.

MenuStyle * FVWM
MenuStyle * Foreground seashell, Background DarkSlateGrey
MenuStyle * Greyed DarkSlateBlue
MenuStyle * Font -adobe-utopia-medium-r-*-*-19-*-100-100-*-*-iso8859-*
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 4 \
	DarkSlateGrey 10 \
	DarkSlateGrey 58 \
	SlateBlue 22 \
	DarkSlateGrey 10 black
MenuStyle * SidePic /home/jbaer/images/sideflash.xpm

MenuStyle msmaug FVWM
MenuStyle msmaug Foreground seashell, Background DarkSlateGrey
MenuStyle msmaug Greyed DarkSlateBlue
MenuStyle msmaug Font
-adobe-utopia-medium-r-*-*-19-*-100-100-*-*-iso8859-* MenuStyle msmaug
MenuFace DGradient 128 4 \	DarkSlateGrey 10 \
	DarkSlateGrey 58 \
	SlateBlue 22 \
	DarkSlateGrey 10 black
MenuStyle msmaug SidePic /home/jbaer/images/dgreen_grad.xpm

A menu of style msmaug has a vertical bar, the width of the pixmap, the
color DarkSlateGrey, running along the left side, while other menus don't.
I realize my responsibility as a user is to provide good bug reports, but
please understand that at the moment, there are very good reasons why I'm
not able to do so. My apologies. dgreen_grad.xpm is transparent, except
for some greek letters running vertically. I don't imagine it matters that
they're greek - any 5 letter word would do, or any arrangement of
non-transparent pixels for that matter. At any rate, I like the way this
looks in 2.2, but not in 2.4. I should be able to easily reproduce it at a
later time. How much later, I can't say just now.

And, 2.4.7 apparently has problems with swallowing xdaliclock:

*FvwmButtons(2x1 Swallow xdaliclock 'Exec /usr/local/bin/xclock')

 -- /usr/local/bin/xclock --

  xdaliclock -24 -noseconds -visual best \
    -memory low -bg deepolive -fg palegold \
    -font -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-15-*-100-100-*-*-*-* \
    -geometry 60x20 &

I wish I could supply you with more info. Perhaps you can reproduce it?
Maybe on a restart.

Ah. Or should I say, "Ach!". I clearly had my brain looking for something
more complex. Thank you for the assistance.

A nifty little trick. ;-)

I try to keep things simple. My second favourite window manager is WMX.

Thank you for your kind reply.

Aha!  As I said, you're having a path problem.  You installed to
/usr/local, but when you ran gdb it used
/opt/fvwm/fvwm-2.5.2/fvwm/fvwm.  I repeat:  are you *sure* that
/usr/local/bin/fvwm is run and not /opt/fvwm/fvwm-2.5.2/fvwm/fvwm?

That looks as if the SIGSEGV happens before fvwm is even started.
Please throw away the whole source tree, compile and install from
scratch and delete the core file.  If the problem persists, run
fvwm from gdb:

  $ gdb /usr/local/bin/fvwm
  (gdb) break main
  (gdb) run

If is doesn't reach the breakpoint, something must have gone very
wrong at compilation time.  If it does run into the breakpoint,
please single step throgh the code to find out where it crashes.

Check the INSTALL.fvwm file and the output of configure.  But this
should never happen anyway.

Just a note to say that according to the release notes contained within
RedHat 8.0 (beta 3), fvwm2 is one of the packages that are no longer
being distributed with the operating system.

This is the first that I have seen this.  Just wanted to pass on the
information.

A couple of bugs with the recent pager changes:
1) *FvwmPager: BalloonYOffset -1
   This is legal and means the balloon is above the pager window. 
FvwmPager is now complaining about this and changing it to +3

2) *FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 2
   The colorset isn't being stretched to fill the window. Colorset 2 is 
VGradient 100 #006400 #008b00. It looks like the colorset is being 
shrunk to fit the default size of the pager but FvwmButtons stretches 
FvwmPager when it swallows it and the new size doesn't take.

Cheers,
Tim.

This does not work as you should specify the % of the tinting
and it is natural to have different  tinting % for fg, bg, ...etc.
We can add a new cmd

EffectSet 123 fg blue 30, bg red 50, PixmapTint black 10, IconTint black 10, \
        fg_text 80

The advantage is that one EffectSet can be used for multiple colorset. The
disadvantage come from updating problems: at "startup" there is no pbs,
you define EffectSet 123 and after colorset 234 which use Effect 123 when
the main colorset pixmap is created. But now if you want to change
the pixmap of the colorset 234 and its tint you should do

Effectset 123 PixmapTint white 10 # -> we should update the main pixmap of
                                     colorset 123 (and maybe others) and
                                     send it to the modules
Colorset 234 Pixmap New.xpm     # -> update and send again ...

So it seems we should have two "EffectSet" command: EffectSet (just the
definition of the tints and alpha's) and EffectSetAndUpdate (tint/alpha
def + update all the colorset which use the tint set).
IMHO, I think that just having bgTint, fgTint, shTint, hiTint,
PixmapTint and IconTint _into_ the Colorset command is a simple
and good solution. So if there is no "strong" vote for EffectSet
and  EffectSetAndUpdate I will implement tinting this way.

In addition of tint I would like to implement user defined alpha-blending
and Add*Pixmap. We already have fg_alpha (maybe this should be fgAlpha),
and I would like to have:

  PixmapAlpha percent # apply the pixmap with a fading effect
                      # determined by percent
  IconAlpha   percent # the same thing for the contextual (mini-)icon

Finally I think it will be good to be able to add _one_ pixmap:

Extra{,Tiled,Aspect}Pixmap image_file

(together with ExtraPixmapTint and ExtraPixmapAlpha)

Mikhael suggests to use Alpha*Pixmap in the place of Extra*Pixmap,
but I think that "Alpha" will be confusing. Also Mikhael
suggests to use an other syntax by using "Image" in the place
of "Pixmap" everywhere. I am not sure we should change the
syntax (even with back compatibility).

So, may I go?

Olivier

Hi Jason,

Andre sent me a copy of the message he received.  It says it was
relayed by a blacklisted server - which seems to be the company's
main customer mail server.  Since Andre told me he received the
mail via fvwm-workers, my copy of the mail must have been blocked
by our own spam filters.  Now I'm curious why my normal messages
don't get blocked...  Ah!  They are sent ovy a different mail
server.  So, I think you can ignore this problem for now (unless
of course you have an idea what I can do about it).

I still think it's not a good idea to overload colour sets with
too many parameters.  The solution you propose (and I think it's
the one I had originally in mind) has one major flaw:  If the
EffectSet is a subordinate part of a colour set, you still have to
define different colour sets for each effect:  Let's assume there
are two buttons that share the same colours, but different
effects.  You need

  Button A
    - colour set A
       - effect set A

  Button B
    - colour set B
       - effect set B

But colour sets A and B are identical (except for the effect set
pointer).  It would be better to separate them:

           Button A
  colour set A - effect set A
  ...

(BTW, I wouldn't call it EffectSet - it suggests it's a set of
items of similar types.  But it's actually just a definition of
one (complex) effect.)

Eventually, I'd like to have a structure that defines "GUI
objects" as a combination of

  - colours to draw various parts
  - the object to draw in the foreground (e.g. text or a picture)
  - the object to draw in the background
  - a relief definition
  - position information of the previous three objects
  - effect definitions

How about this hierarchy of objects:

  gui_object
  - relief_object
    - size and position
    - raised/sunk/flat/...
    - fill pattern
  - fore_object
    - size and position
    - text
      - font
    - graphics
    - effects
  - back_object
    see above
  - colours

Our current colour set would be promoted to gui objects with the
colour and grpahics definitions moved into subordinate structures.
For example,

  Colorset 1 fg red, bg green, Pixmap foo.xpm

would become:

  NewColorSet 1 fg red, bg green
  GfxObject 1 Pixmap foo.xpm
  GuiObject BackGfxObject 1, NewColorSet 1

In addition, this can be used to not just define module
backgorounds, but individual elements of the graphics.  Here's a
hypothetical config for FvwmButtons:

  # general button drawing colours
  NewColorSet 1 fg black, bg gray
  # module background
  GfxObject 1 BGradient 128 blue red
  # button background
  GfxObject 2 ParentRelative
  # button foregrounds
  GfxEffects 1 Tint red, Tintpct 50
  GfxObject 3 Pixmap move.xpm, Effects 1
  GfxObject 4 Pixmap resize.xpm, Text "bla", \
    Font lucidasanstypewriter-12, TextBelowIcon
  # GUI objects
  GuiObject 1 NewColorSet 1, BackGfxObject 1
  GuiObject 1 NewColorSet 1, BackGfxObject 2, ForeGfxObject 3
  GuiObject 1 NewColorSet 1, BackGfxObject 2, ForeGfxObject 4
  
etc.  I don't suggest implementing something like this now, but
whatever we do now, it should not require to rewrite the syntax
completely if we ever move to the "GuiObject" approach.

Hm, just think of the possibilities:  90% of the module drawing
code moved into a single library; the looks of all module elements
(buttons, reliefs, background, shape, etc. configurable at run
time with only the code to call the library routines when anything
changes); module configuration lines reduce to

  *FvwmPager: MainGuiObject 1
  *FvwmPager: WindowGuiObject 2
  *FvwmPager: HilightGuiObject 3
  *FvwmIconMan: MainGuiObject 1
  *FvwmButtons: MainGuiObject 1
  *FvwmButtons: (GuiObject 101)
  *FvwmButtons: (GuiObject 102)
  ...

replacing dozens of individual module options.

(I'm aware that the above is vastly inconsistent and won't work
out of the box).

To summarize the abouve:  yes.  Do whatever you think is best, but
try to encapsulate the functionality as good as possible so that
it may be taken out en-bloc one day.

I think an effect (tint, alpha) should be only a filter, that only affects
(until disabled) the corresponding properties, and does not change them.
In the future we may add something like DissolveEffect that transfers an
effect to a colorset permanently, but this is not important for now.

But I don't think Effectset is really needed,

Agree, so Effectset may be emulated using a function.

  AddToFunc ApplyColorsetEffect
  + I Colorset $0 fgTint blue 30, bgTint red 50, IconTint black 10, ...

  AddToFunc ResetColorsetEffect
  + I Colorset $0 *Tint, *Alpha

The last 2 special names with asterisk are shortcuts, they may be used to
set the same tint or alpha effect parameters to all relevant properties,
or to reset them.

I think that properties <property>Tint and <property>Alpha should be reset
automatically when <property> is changed, either directly or inderectly.

I am not sure what hiTint and shTint are good for. They should use bgTing.

We already changed the colorset syntax by removing FvwmTheme.
I suggest to use the word Image for the same reason that we once renamed
PixmapPath to ImagePath, now fvwm even supports xbm and png, not just xpm.

I think you agree that 3 existing properties (TiledPixmap, AspectPixmap
and Pixmap) are not really 3 but 1, every one disables an other.
And you suggest to have one PixmapAlpha, not separate alphas for all 3.
So instead of duplicating these properties to ExtraPixmap and having 6,
I suggest to have only 2 properties:

  Image and SecondImage (or ExtraImage)

And accordingly:

  ImageAlpha and SecondImageAlpha

> So, may I go?

I would say, yes, after we come to an agreement about names. :)

Mikhael.

PixmapPath was *not* renamed to ImagePath.  The reason for the new
name was to merge the two separate paths (IconPath and PixmapPath)
into a single one.

Pixmap is the name of the internal X picture object, not the name
of the image file format.  Whatever the image is loaded from, X
still uses Pixmaps internally.  I see no naming conflict here.

I know, a proposed PicturePath was renamed to ImagePath.

This option requires a file (in one or another image format, that is
searched in ImagePath) and should be named accourdingly IMHO.

Strictly speaking an xbm bitmap is not pixmap, it requires 2 colors as
parameters to be a pixmap.

Png image is not strictly speaking a pixmap as well, it contains more
information like alpha blending that is actually used in colorsets.

These are my reasons to rename "Pixmap file" to "Image file" in colorsets.

Mikhael.

The 'gradient' bug seems to be related to a much nastier bug. I reduced
my RC file to the following 3 lines:
    MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 2 grey50 50 grey95 50 grey50
    AddToFunc StartFunction 
    + "I" Module FvwmPager

This is what happens: the second time i want to popup the start menu,
the only thing that gets drawn is the grey box of the menu, and Fvwm
hangs. I can still move my mousepointer, but can't get any focus of any
window (which is probably because the menu crashed, but is still 'open')

Removing any of the lines of the config files make the problem disappear
(however, removing FvwmPager doesnt solve the fact that gradients
sometimes appear, and sometimes they don').

I am using a CVS version of fvwm i checked out yesterday, and running 
XFree 4.2.0. But if i recall correctly, the bug appeared in the latest
development version of fvwm too. 
Should i file a bug report ? Do you need any extra information ?

thanks,
Remko

There is no timeout, but a bug.  I've committed a fix already

Hi,

There seems to be a problem in the drawing of menus. The problem is as follows:
I have a grey/white DGradient as a background of my menus. When i use FreeType
fonts as my menu font, the gradient doesnt show at all, i only get a
plain grey background.
I tried to trace the problem, and stumbled upon some code in menuitem.c. 
In menuitem_paint(), there is a piece of code
     ...
     else if ( xft_redraw || ... ) {
         ...
         XClearArea(...)
     }
When i comment the XClearArea (or the xft_redraw condition), the
gradient does show. I've never programmed with Xlibs before, so i don't
really know how the XClearArea works, so maybe someone can help me find
out what could be going wrong ?

thanks,
Remko

The XClearArea() call erases the foreground of the window so that
the window backgorund shines through.  The reason why this doesn't
work with b and d gradients is that they are drawn on the window
*foreground* (unlike all other types of gradients).  That happens
only with the

  MenuFace B/DGradient ...

options.  If you instead define a colorset with the gradient and
then set

  MenuFace Colorset ...

it works as expected.

Olivier:  I guess you added that XClearArea() call.  Do you know
of any other places in the menu code where you added similar
calls?  We should continue to support direct gradient drawing
since they look a lot better this way (less blocky).

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Or maybe we should not?  All the Xft, tinting and alpha rendering
stuff is going to become very complex, just because of these two
gradient types.

Dominik wanted to say here:

  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6

Hmm, I didn't know they use 2 different methods.

Maybe solid color blocks in colorset gradients should be placed depending
on the gradient type? Placing them in a rectangular grid is only good for
{H,V,S}Gradient.

Mikhael.

But the text may become ugly. With xft we cannot draw text onto a given
text as the drawing procedure take in account what is under the text
which is drawn.

I do not think that there is an other place in the menu code
where I added such clearing. I was not award that B/DGradient
is drawn on the foreground. 

But what about redrawing the relevant part of the gradient
in this case: in the place of the XClearArea put (around
line 404 of menuitems.c (+ do paint_menu_gradient_background
global (menus.c + menus.h) and pass mr in some way to
menuitem_paint).

		if (xft_redraw && !ST_HAS_MENU_CSET(ms) && 
		    ST_FACE(ms).type == GradientMenu &&
		    (ST_FACE(ms).gradient_type == D_GRADIENT ||
		     ST_FACE(ms).gradient_type == B_GRADIENT))
		{
			XEvent e;

			e.xexpose.x = MDIM_ITEM_X_OFFSET(*dim);
			e.xexpose.y = y_offset + d;
			e.xexpose.width = MDIM_ITEM_WIDTH(*dim);
			e.xexpose.height = y_height + relief_thickness - d;
			paint_menu_gradient_background(mr, &e);
                                                       ^^pbs
		}
		else
		{
			XClearArea(
				dpy, mpip->w, MDIM_ITEM_X_OFFSET(*dim),
				y_offset + d, MDIM_ITEM_WIDTH(*dim),
				y_height + relief_thickness - d,
				0);
		}

Anyway, maybe the good solution is to paint the _all_ menu into
the background (with the selected item drawn on an additional
window). This will supress all flickering which come from
xft redrawing ...

I couldn't remember either until I debugged the problem Remko
reported yesterday.

They are not really placed

Not always.  In a window title, B and D gradients would look
almost exactly like HGradient if the lines were always drawn at
45 degrees.  In rectangles with a more even aspect ratio (menus
for example), the old way looks a bit better.

[snip]

I now remember why we are drawing in the foreground.  It's not
because of the looks but because a potentially huge pixmap has to
be kept in XServer memory.  I'm unwilling to add a lot of
additional code just for the benefit of the old B/DGradient
implementation.  Should we just document that a few features do
not work with the old gradient code?

Yes, but maybe the algorithm of enlarging a gradient rectangle should be
different than just granulation.

Well, TitleStyle does this itself without colorsets, so it is impossible
currently to compare these 2 methods in titles.

Of course keeping only 45 degrees like in non-colorset gradients is bad.
Here is another formula for stretching DGradient that I had in mind
when wrote the original message, it is none of the existing two:

	get_color_index(x, y, size_x, size_y, colors_num)
	{
		(x / size_x + y / size_y) * colors_num / 2
	}

This should produce something like:

  11111....333
  111....3333:
  1....3333:::
  ...3333::::5
  .3333::::555
  333::::55555

Compare with the existing ones:

  1111....3333
  1111....3333
  ....3333::::
  ....3333::::
  3333::::5555
  3333::::5555

and:

  111....3333:
  11....3333::
  1....3333:::
  ....3333::::
  ...3333::::5
  ..3333::::55

That's what the menu code is doing.

I don't see that this is used anywhere although this is the most logical.

This is what menu gradients do as well.

Try

  MenuStyle * MenuFace BGradient 3 red green

and you'll see it clear as day.

Only when using colour sets, not with the native menu code.

Yes, I see it clear as day that 45 degrees used, not 30 as in my formula.

No, this is what native menu DGradient does, not colorsets.
Unless we use different fvwm-s of course. :)

No, I think we use different fonts in mutt.  The first one exactly
looks like 45 degrees and the last one like 60 degrees. :-)

This is nice. I think the way colorsets are stretched at the moment is a 
result of trying too hard to keep the code small. The existing code 
stretches the gradient horizontally to the window width
and then stretches the resulting intermediate pixmap vertically to fit 
the window height. This reuses the horizontal and vertical streching 
code used for HGradients and VGradients. There's no reason not to add 
your algorithm in for colorsets that need to be streched both ways. It 
would help all the gradients (apart from V & H) become less blocky.

The code to change is in CreateStretchPixmap() in libs/Graphics.c. It 
currently does a CreateStretchXPixmap() followed by a 
CreateStretchYPixmap().

The downside is performance for large areas and I'm not sure if it would 
be an improvement for colorsets that use a small pixmap file as a 
non-tiled background (but they look bad anyway)

Hmm, Tetris! Maybe we could create a game in Fvwm using FvwmForm/Script 
to capture keystrokes and fire off Colorset definitions 8-).

Cheers,

As the fix is simple and does not change a lot of code, I've
fixed old D/BGradient with xft fonts.

1) This is a pretty old problem, all others are new.
FvwmEvent executing a function on add_window does not work fine with a
transient pager, a pager beeps after 4 seconds. Try this minimal config:

  *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window CheckWindow
  AddToFunc CheckWindow I Next ("does not matter here") something
  FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow

  # press Ctrl-Mouse2
  Mouse 2 A C  FvwmPager -transient
  Mouse 2 A SC FvwmPager -transient 0 3

2) With the current cvs it is easy to get more than one pager label
higlighted in a multi-desk pager, see the first screenshot.

3) I also experience drawing problems of the current page, like on the
screenshot, but I can't say whether the problem in FvwmPager or colorsets.
This is with the fvwm-themes cvs. If you can't find a possible problem
from the screenshots, forget it until I have a time to reduce the config.

I send 2 images: pager-1 is bad, pager-2 is the same pager after resizing
it (and canceling using Esc), it is is fully correct.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not really a bug.  And it isn't the pager that beeps, it's fvwm.
The transient pager grabs the pointer.  This is necessary so that
the pager is closed reliably.  At the same time, FvwmEvent
executes a complex function - which also needs to grab the
pointer.  Since FvwmPager is faster, fvwm can't grab and beeps.
As it is practically impossible to find out if a function needs to
grab the pointer or not, I see no way out of this.  We'd have to
find a reliable way to detect a button press/release outside the
pager window without grabbing the pointer.

Fixed.

I'll wait.

Here is a minimal config that recovers the problem that is on screenshots.
I think you have lightsky.png (try: locate lightsky.png) but any other
image is just good.

  *FvwmPager-Desker: Colorset * 14
  *FvwmPager-Desker: HilightColorset * 15

  Colorset 14 fg white, bg rgb:90/67/64
  Colorset 15 fg rgb:ff/ff/da, bg average, \
    Pixmap $[HOME]/.fvwm/themes/current/images/background/lightsky.png

  EdgeScroll 0 0      # good for this test. Why is this not a default?
  Style Fvwm* Sticky  # just to make FvwmConsole and FvwmPager sticky
  FvwmPager FvwmPager-Desker 0 3

Only the current page on the first desk is highlited. On other desks
it looks like transparent that is not refreshed, i.e. if you move or
delete any window you will see its trace like on the first screenshot.
At least with my XFree86-4.2.0.

If I resize a pager, the current page subwindow in the pager is refreshed
well, but not on different desks (all 4 behave independently).

If I reissue the same Colorset 15 line for the second time in FvwmConsole,
the problem in the running pager (but not in new pagers) is corrected,
until a pager is resized (then the pixmap on other desks is not resized).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

I've implemented a new color limit method. It goes at follow:

- At startup if color limitation is needed, a color table is
created (in fact allocated).
Various color tables are tried. The first (best) color table
is chosen: given a color table, the code tries to allocate
all the element of the table, if one allocation fail the
allocated colors are freed and the next table is tested.
The color tables contain 256, 216, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 2
colors respectively. The color tables come from imlib2.

- Color limit is applied to *all* colors in the following way:
for gradient and "pixmap" the color table is used. For the others
colors (e.g., fg, bg, ...etc colorset or simple colors for menus,
window title, modules ...), first the code tries to allocate the
color and if this fail, then the color is taken from the color
table.

The main advantage of this method is that color allocations
never fail. So, you do not have "all" the colors replaced
by the black color if you use too much colors when running
with depth <= 8. An other important difference is that
color limit is applied to gradients. There are performance
issue too.

The disadvantage is that the ColorLimit cmd is obsolete: the
color limit should be defined before the first color is
allocated so it is difficult to use an fvwm config cmd to
define it. Also it is not clear (for me) if it is possible to
jump between the color tables at running time. So I've used a
env variable: FVWM_COLORLIMIT (and I'will add an option to fvwm
if we decide to use the new method) which overrides the default
color limit (256 if the depth <= 8, no limit if not). But,
I hope that the color tables are good enough and that specifying
a color limit is not really needed.

Also the "colorset cmd" ReadWriteColors is also obsolete
for similar reason (it is broken in 2.5.x since a few weeks).
Again you should set FVWM_READWRITE_COLORS to 1 to enable
read-write colors.

In fact, my main concern is "does the new method work on
any hardware?". So, please test with the various depth
(<= 8) that your X driver support. There is a debugging
message (at fvwm startup) which tells you which color
table is used.
I can run my driver with depth 8, I get the 216 color table
(and I can enforce color tables 2, 8, 16 but not the others).
Now I can run fvwm-themes with depth 8 with a not too bad
result. Gradient are no pretty, but to fix this we should
implement a kind of dithering for gradient (dithering for
large pixmap will be good too).

I've not removed the  "old" code. To get it you should:
#define USE_OLD_COLOR_LIMIT_METHODE
in config.h (sorry for the ending "E" :o)
I will remove it if there are no objection with the new
code.

Regards, Olivier

This is probably started after the rxvt/aterm copying workaround commit.
Regardless of whether this is related or not, I think rxvt bugs are better
to be fixed in rxvt, not in fvwm, it is not a closed product.

I can always reproduce this with no config (MouseFocus) or SloppyFocus.
Place 2 xterms or rxvts like this:

           _________ 
          |         |
          |         |
    ______|         |
   |   abc|    B    |
   |      |         |
   |      |_________|
   |    A    |
   |         |
   |_________|

or this:

           _________
          |         |
          |         |
   _______|__       |
   |   abcde | B    |
   |         |      |
   |         |______|
   |    A    |
   |         |
   |_________|

Now, Raise/Lower B several times (for this bug to work it is important
that B is the last dealt window before you start copying in A).
Using mouse button 1, copy text "abc" and continue with a pointer to the
right, so it ends up in B. Release the mouse button. B is not focused.
The same happens if you drag some url from browser (A) to xterm (B).

Regards,
Mikhael.

No I don't think that is the cause.  If it were, you would get the
wait cursor after half a second.  It's either that the button
grabs on the window are not correct, or HandleEnterNotify() does
something wrong.  And the internal window list is probably
involved too.

I find it much easier to reproduce.  I just open two overlapping
xterms, then click-drag from A to B and from B to A.  One of the
two directions always fails as long as I don't pass over a third
window (in which case the working and failing directions swap).

If Fvwm allocates 216 colors, that leaves 40 for other
purposes.  Thats no good.

I've had to use 8 bit color in the past.

Any application that takes the approach you have Fvwm taking
ruins the color map for everything else.

Not for me. As I said, one of the two windows should be the last dealt
window. If some third window (even on another desk) was last Raise'd,
your instructions do not work.

No problem.  Usually, people send screenshots to one of the
mailing lists and one of the others takes care of adding them to
our website.  I'll send this mail to fvwm-workers too (hoping that
one of the others takes care of your screenshot).

Fixed.  The Enter/LeaveNotify code got confused about which window
has last lost the pointer due to a pointer grab.

First, note that we can steel limit the colors by using the
FVWM_COLORLIMIT env variable (and an option, maybe, in the
future).  Maybe we may choose to change the default to 64 if
depth <= 8, I am not sure.  But, when I run my Xserver with depth
8 (and fvwm allocate these 216 colors) I *cannot* reproduce any
problems, I can run netscape, xv, gimp, any gtk/gnome apps, any
kde apps ..etc without any problems.  With the old method (with
any ColorLimit setting) what happen is that fvwm looks ugly (a
lot of colors simply become black and I've to choose very
carefully my fvwm colorset so that this does not happen) and the
other apps work in the same (good) way. If I limit the colors
with the new method, then fvwm is less pretty (but no noisy black
colors) and the other apps work again the same way.  One point is
that the 216 colors is a good palette and color allocation
succeed for all the colors.

So my question is:
"How I/you can reproduce a problem with the new method?"
(I do not say this is not possible).

The old method reduce colors in the good way only for xpm.  Now I
think we need to reduce colors for png, tinting and gradient.
Moreover, the most important thing concerning colors with a
pseudo color visual is that color allocation MUST never fail. I
do not see an other method that this color table method.

You may be being helped by your graphics card/Xserver. If your setup 
allows other colormaps to be active without deactivating the root 
colormap then it could be that netscape etc have allocated a private 
colormap and you don't notice. Other people on less advanced hardware will.

It could be that your apps are sophisticated enough to cope with low 
availability of colors. There are plenty of ancient CAD applications 
around that fall over in a big heap if they don't get every color they 
ask for.

Instead of allocating colors you can query the colormap and find a close 
match to the one you want and just use it. I'm not sure if it's possible 
to find out if  a color cell is allocated to another client or not so it 
may be that picking color cells like this leaves you exposed to the 
color of the cell changing. Maybe allocing the color of the cell (rather 
than the original color) would fix the cell color.

Cheers,
Tim.

In my current setup, I have a background image limited to
using 48 colors.  With FVWM allocating 216 colors and
48 colors in the background, that leaves no colors for
applications.

I don't know why you aren't seeing a problem.

I would not expect to be able to use tinting or
gradients on an 8 bit display.

To make this work, you'd have to change the X server.

In Windows, they make this work by rebalancing the color map.
When the user allocates a new color, Windows looks at everything on
the screen and adjusts the color map to get as close as possible.

What Dan and Tim say is that there is old hardware and old applications
that cause a lot of color problems.

What Olivier says is that on modern hardware and with modern applications
FVWM looks better using a new colormap table method (no black colors for
new colors anymore). And he wants to keep an FVWM color limit centrally.

So maybe a solution is to find the correct condition to activate one or
another code. Or just leave it the way it is now, but print a warning on
the ColorLimit command saying it is now replaced with $FVWM_COLOR_LIMIT.

It may be not an option for a user. For example, he uses someone else's
configuration (fvwm-themes), or his own configuration from another
hardware. He may expect the same config automagically to look tolerably
well even on another hardware.

Of course, I myself don't run neither 8bpp nor old hardware, so ignore my
comments if they make no sence.

Mikhael.

I've somehow managed to nuke the ParentalRelativity in the pager,
but I don't exactly understand what I have to do to make it work.
Try

  Colorset 38 transparent
  style * ParentalRelativity
  *FvwmPager: Colorset *38
  FvwmPager * *

Then shade and undhade the pager.

Bye

I'm still loking for a reliable way to get a good contrast between
text and a random background picture.  The best I've come up with
yet is:

  colorset 27 transparent, fg white, fgsh black
  menustyle * menucolorset 27
  menustyle * font "Shadow=1 n s e w nw ne sw se:lucidasanstypewriter-14"

A black halo is drawn around the the white text.  But the halo is
still too thin to give a good contrast.  If it were possible to
extend the halo to a size of 2 it would be much more readable.
Look at this:

  .......
  .......
  .......
  ...x...
  .......
  .......
  .......

The X in the center marks the upper left pixel of the text.  The
shadow (size 1) is drawn eight times at these offsets:

  .......
  .......
  ..ooo..
  ..o.o..
  ..ooo..
  .......
  .......

With size 2 it is drawn like this:

  .......
  .o.o.o.
  ..ooo..
  .oo.oo.
  ..ooo..
  .o.o.o.
  .......

But I need this:

  .......
  .ooooo.
  .ooooo.
  .oo.oo.
  .ooooo.
  .ooooo.
  .......

Any chance you get around to implement something like this,
Olivier?  All that would be needed is another "direction" option
"center" and a loop drawing the shadows:

  for (x = -size; x <= size; x++)
  {
    for (y = -size; y <= size; y++)
    {
      if (x < -offset || x > offset || y < -offset || y > offset)
      {
        draw_shadow_at(x, y);
      }
    }
  }

Bye

Never heard of multiple 8 bit color maps except some references
to overlay planes, but I don't know much about them.

Framemaker refuses to start if it can't get the colors it
wants.  I have to run other locally developed apps that do the
same thing.

I'm not sure what "modern hardware" means.
8 bit colormaps aren't modern.

Having the window manager take almost all of a scarce resource

I can't say I like the last option.
In my opinion, the old way works.

If you remember the mini-themes package I posted a while back,
it used cpp to eliminate the gradients in 8 bit environments.
Shouldn't fvwm-themes be doing something similar?

I've coped with 8 bit for years and years.
The ColorLimit command helped a whole lot getting icons under control
and making Fvwm attractive.

I admit, I finally gave up, mainly because my Sun hardware wouldn't
go to 1600x1200 and I now use Linux for my home and work desktop.

The users I support at work are still mostly on 8 bit hardware.

You might want to ask on the fvwm list if anyone is using this.

Some of the themes are specially built to have a small number of colors.
This may be finished when the currently included icon set 48x48-general
(it may be disabled in configuration) is replaced with 48x48-infox that
uses 15 colors in 84 icons. Together with mini icons (the included icon
set 16x16-kde uses 44 colors in 84 icons), background, modules and other
colors the default look should use no more than 100 colors. If colors@cde
and NoIcon used, there are 50 colors at most. ColorLimit is not required.

It is ugly to add a preprocessing code every time gradient or png used.
It would be much nicer if FVWM automatically handle this if possible.

Just like currently on black and white 1bpp displays all colors (at least
colorsets) automatically look more or less readable, they are replaced
with the predefined bitmaps.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Note that the old ColorLimit code used at most 61 colors.
Its unlikely all 61 would get used.
More importantly, the color allocation was heavily biased toward
"named" colors.  The idea was that the named colors would most likely
be chosen by other applications or users.  In effect, a lot less
than 61 colors were used by Fvwm, leaving lots of colors available.

Most of my icons are created by myself or my coworkers for new
systems we acquire.  We normally do some Google searches using
the system name for the new system and find an image we like.
For this, colorlimiting is a big help.

> It is ugly to add a preprocessing code every time gradient or png used.

It looked to me like png's were already being colorlimited.
Only gradients had to be avoided.
Gradients aren't going to work on 8 bit color without some
really good dithering.

Even with dithering, I have my doubts.

In the function FlocaleRotateDrawString(), two GCs are created and
destroyed in each call, but the GC veriables are declared static.
Were they supposed to be created only once?

What it seems to happen is that, under depth 8, XFree (or at least the
2 Xserver that I can run on my laptop) allocate a color table at
startup of 244 colors. So there are only 12 free colors in the
colormap. This seems very few, but it seems to me that this is a very
reasonable way to implement sharded colors: there is no reason for a
client to take all the colors for itself and the X server decides for
all the clients almost all the colors.

I think that I've no problems with netscape et al. probably because
either the XFree color table is good or the apps take in account
XAllocColor failure in the good way (also, fortunately, the 216 colors
table that fvwm gives to me is a subset of the XFree table).

I am curious about what the others X implementation do.

There are not only these old apps and Framemaker ... there are also
fvwm. I can have color allocation failure (and so noisy black)
colors with a config file which use very few colors.

Yes, I think that this should work. But I do not think that this solve
the pbs I see with color limitation.

With XFree we can "ruins the color map" with 13 colors (see my answer
to Tim). And in fact the 216 colors are a subset of the 244 colors
given by the server itself, so here the 216 table allocate no new
colors (but this is maybe/probably a coincidence).  Note that you can
steel reduce the nbr of color with the "new" (or tmp) method:

  env FVWM_COLORLIMIT=16 fvwm.

This is just a problem about default ("old" method use ~60 colors I
think). But I think that the problems is more complex than a number of
colors. You can allocate 13 colors and ruin your colormap and you can
allocate 216 one's without touching to any free one's (and the new
table with 16 colors really allocate more colors than the 216
table). In fact I try to use an other method because I get problems
with the "old" fvwm color table when I use it as is for reducing
colors for png and tinting (work fine with xpm as the xpm lib make a
part of the job). So in fact, if I well understand, what fvwm have to
do is to not allocate new colors if the number of free colors is <=
a given configurable number. I think this possible to implement, but
this is complicated and maybe slow.

Because I think that the installed colormap is good and the
apps I use are not broken.

But tinting work pretty well here in depth 8 and without Xrender.
About gradient I am agree, but I think this is because our
method to build gradien is weak. Here a Black to White Vgradient
with two colors:

  BBBBBBBBB
  BWBWBBBBB
  BBBBBWBWB
  BBWBWBWBB
  BWBWBWBWB
  WBWBWBWBW
  WWBWBWBWW
  WWWWWBWBW
  WBWBWWWWW
  WWWWWWWWW

I think that the method Tim suggest (take the closest color in the
colormap) should work not so bad. The color table method do that in a
certain sens.

I have implemented this.  Try the following with a colourful
background image:

  colorset 27 transparent, fg white, fgsh black
  menustyle * menucolorset 27
  menustyle * font "Shadow=3 c:lucidasanstypewriter-14"

I don't think those 244 colors you see are allocated.
Thats the default state of the colormap.
If you attempted to use one of those colorcells,
they would change as soon as another app allocated a color
that happened to use that cell.

Using the colormap program I sent you, if the cell is allocated,
you'll see a slash thru it when you press "s".

I don't know what kind of apps you are running, but
there needs to be a lot of free colors in the colormap,
or our users are going to have problems.
I guarantee it.
Before colorlimiting was implemented, we had
frequent reports of color allocation problems.
We still do when a user starts Netscape without -install,
although 8bit color is getting rarer.

Most X servers pre-allocate black and white, (2 colors).

I still say tinting and gradients aren't going to work.

I didn't try png, but it looked like you had png working.

Tony,

  Is your desktop really 3200x1200 or is there something wrong
with that screenshot?

I postponed this reply, and now it seems to be too late. Anyway, I am
posting it, because I think it is a more general solution than the special
"center" direction (by the way we already have "all", do we need both?).

Some time ago I wrote that I would disable shade size greater than 1 with
more then one direction (i.e. force size 1 if there are more than 1
direction), because it looks unnaturally bad.

I think there may be added support for sizes 2+ with multiple directions
using this simple algorithm. If the current 8 directions are encoded using
one bit per direction, bits 12346 currently produce ugly:

  .......   .......   o..o..o
  .......   .o.o.o.   .o.o.o.
  ..ooo..   ..ooo..   ..ooo..
  ...xo..   ...xoo.   ...xooo
  ...o...   ...o...   ...o...
  .......   ...o...   ...o...
  .......   .......   ...o...

But they may produce instead a bit more natural:

  .......   .......   ooooooo
  .......   .ooooo.   .oooooo
  ..ooo..   ..oooo.   ..ooooo
  ...xo..   ...xoo.   ...xooo
  ...o...   ...o...   ...o...
  .......   ...o...   ...o...
  .......   .......   ...o...

For each of 8 pairs of bits (i, i+1), if both are set then in addition to
2 shadow pixels drawn in each iteraction, all pixels between them are
drawn too. If size=N and offset=0 this is N-1 additional line pixels.

This may also get rid of this diagonal problem (when specifying "r br").

    "br"     (old)     (new)
  .......   .......   .......
  ....x..   ....xoo   ....xoo
  ...x.o.   ...xooo   ...xooo
  ..x.o.o   ..xoo.o   ..xoooo
  ...o.o.   ...o.o.   ...ooo.
  ....o..   ....o..   ....o..


So all three "n s e w nw ne sw se", "all" and "center" would be the same.

Currently "all" works like "center", but the code suggests that it should
work like "n s e w nw ne sw se", not "center". I don't know why it is.

Starting from yesterday xft fonts with shadow are very slow.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, "all" was always slow with xft. Now it is slower, because
it draws more text, but this is not a new problem. Try "3 all".
It is probably possible to draw on the background, especially for menus.

Hi there,

Yesterday I realized a reproducable crash of fvwm 2.5.2 and X when
using a menu which is created by fvwm-menu-directory:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
AddToFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory I PipeRead "fvwm-menu-directory \
  --icon-dir=mini_filesystems.folder.xpm \
  --icon-file=mini_filesystems.File.xpm  \
  --icon-app=mini_filesystems.exec.xpm $1 --exec-file=jed --dir=$0"

DestroyMenu myFileBrowserMenu
AddToMenu myFileBrowserMenu "File Browser" Title
+ MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ "Files"       Popup $[HOME]
+ "Files (All)" Popup $[HOME] "--all"

fvwm does not crash immediately. When using the menu above repeatedly
and using other menus between them it crashes. I could reproduce this
behavior several times.

I used gdb to see where the crash comes from. The output of gdb which
contains the stack trace after the crash is attached to this mail.

Yes, a bug.

Well, "all" doesn't provide the effect "center" does.  Now that we
have the latter, "all" is pointless.  I think I'll remove it.

I fail to see what multiple directions are good for in the first
place.  Why would I have a N+S or a S+SE+E shadow?

Well, feel free to give it a shot.  It's quite easy to do.  In
FlocaleGetShadowTextPosition, the code handing "center" scans the
grid of pixels around the origin for positions where a shadow
pixel has to be drawn.  All you need to do is modify this code to
handle the normal directions and the merging between adjacent
directions.  There is one pitfall:  since a "center" shadow is
symmetrical, I didn't handle text rotation.

Because "all" includes "center" at the moment.

> Starting from yesterday xft fonts with shadow are very slow.

Any shadows or just the ones using "all"?  If this happens only
with "all", see above.  If not, please add a debug statement
around line 437 in Fft.c:

fprintf(stderr, "\n");
  while (FlocaleGetShadowTextPosition(&xt, &yt, &gstp_args))
  {
fprintf(stderr, "fftds: fgstp returned %d %d\n", xt, yt);
    DrawStringFunc(fftdraw, &fft_fgsh, uf, xt, yt, str, len);
  }

I don't have a working Xft library.

Okay, don't worry about it, I'll make them persisten.  I'm working
on Flocale.c anyway right now.

Hello!

Recently I've upgraded to fvwm 2.4.6 from don't-remember-what older version.
I noticed a change in behavior of ClickToFocus style which I didn't like.
I like a window to be raised and given a focus when I click inside a window
but not necessarily so when I click on window frame, title, etc.
For example, I'd like following settings to work properly:

AddToFunc Select-Window		"I"	Focus
+				"I"	Raise

Mouse	1	T	N	Select-Window
Mouse	1	T	M	Focus

See, my preferences could be perfectly described by mouse bindings
if ClickToFocusRaises feature didn't get in the way. Unconditionally
raising a window after click on its decorations thus seems to
be the bad thing.  I fixed this for myself with the following patch:

       }
       if (do_regrab_buttons)
 	focus_grab_buttons(Tmp_win, (Tmp_win == get_focus_window()));

It seems to me that with minor modification it can be applied to HEAD.
Hope this helps.

We are still experimenting, but it seems that in some cases (white fg,
lucidasanstypewriter-14, offset 0) S+SW or SE+S+SW looks better than SW.
But not with the old way of handling of sizes greater than 1.

Yes, with "all" shadow texts were printed twice. It is fixed now.

It is still impossibly slow with wide menus and "Shadow=2 center:xft...".

I think I've already fixed this one in poost-2.5.2 CVS.  Could
you please try a current snapshot?

Of course I used the program you send to me :o). If I start my Xserver
with just an xterm the "colormap" program says me that I've only 12
free colors. After that I made an other check to see the effect of the
"new" palette. I computed the number of free colors before and after
the "new" palette are allocated.  Again I get only 12 free colors
before any colors are allocated, the number of free colors after the
allocation of the palette depends on the palette.  With the 216
palette I still get 12 free colors as with the palette with 16 colors
I get only 4 free colors!

Why you do not trust me? I run my Xserver with depth 8 and I get no
problems with all the app I can run (including "netscape -no-install").

Not my XFree-4.2 Xserver (with the neomagic or vesa driver).

AHHHHHH, I manage to run my old XFree-3.3.6 Xserver. Yes, in this case
only 2 colors is pre-allocated (black and white) and I can see the
netscape problems, gimp-1.2 and gtk+ 2 automatically use a private
colormap, and I see others various problems. If I use the 64 colors
palette I cannot see a lot of problems, but I am agree that allocating
64 colors at fvwm startup is not a very good idea.

Tinting works fine here with XFree-4.2. With XFree-3.3 and 64 colors
it may works or not this depends on the image and tint.  Of course
gradient are ugly in both case (but never fully black).

I get problems with png as I get color allocation failure in the "old"
color table. The "old" color limit works fine with xpm and go into 2
steps one done by fvwm the other one done by libXpm: the original
color name is replaced by fvwm by a color name in the table which
gives the closest color. Then, libXpm load the xpm by allowing a color
closeness of 40000, so I think that if the allocation of the reduced
color name fail libXpm try others colors until color allocation
succeed. So I think that with ColorLimit x, libXpm does not allocate
more than x colors but these x colors may be different than the x
first colors of the table.

When I implement color reduction for png I do it in one step: libpng
gives me rgb colors and I take the closest colors in the table. But I
get XAllocColor failure with the KDE icons set if I not use something
like ColorLimit 9. I also get AllocColor failure with tinting and ewmh
icons which use the same simple color limitation than png. Also with
XFree-4.2 you can get fvwm AllocColor failure even if a few colors are
used. So with XFree-4.2 you get very good result if you can found a
big color table which is a subset of the pre-allocated color
table. Also it seems that color limitation should be applied
everywhere (even for title, menu and module simple colors or fg, bg,
hi, sh colorset), if we do not want to use the 12 free colors.

So it seems that XFree-4.x used a drastically different method than
the others X implementation.

I will try to found a 3rd method which works with all X server.

I trust you, I just never heard of an X Server that supported
8 bit that way.

I've done some Google searches and I still don't know whats
going on.

Is there some clue in the output from xdpyinfo?

Does you card allow multiple colormaps to be used at once?

Since you seem to have some new kind of 8 bit X Server,
I think your changes are good if you can find a way to
turn them on for this new X Server.

Sorry for my ignorance.

Then "Mouse       1       T       M       Focus" will not work as expected.
Let me restate, I want to customize window rasing on per-binding basis.

A number of files in the libs directory, in FvwmPager and
FvwmScript are using the alloca() function to allocate temporary
memory.  With the drop-in version of alloca() that autoconf
provides, you have to regularly call alloca(0) to collect the
garbage from previous alloca() calls and free the memory.  In
other words:  on a platform without a good alloca()
implementation (according to the autoconf man page any platform
without gcc except AIX) most modules leak memory like hell if
the wrong features are used.  We have alloca() without alloca(0)
in:

  libs/Bindings.c
  libs/FBidi.c
  libs/Graphics.c
  libs/Module.c
  libs/PictureImageLoader.c
  modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c
  modules/FvwmScript/script.c

I suggest we refrain from using alloca() in the library to prevent
module memory leaking.  FvwmPager and FvwmScript have to be fixed
in any case.

Bye

Full_Name: Ben Mathews
Version: 2.4.6
CVS_Date: 
OS: Red Hat Linux
X_Server: 4.2
Submission from: (NULL) (68.69.149.235)


In the section of the FVWMButton documentation that deals with the Pixmap
command, there is a statement that is kind of ambigious.

It says:
Specifies a background pixmap to use. Specify "none" for a transparent
background.

To me, it is unclear if "none" should be with or without the quotes.  It
only works without the quotes, but as it is written, it appears to me that
it should be with the quotes.  I realize that an experienced fvwm user
would probably know that it should be without the quotes, but we're not all
experienced fvmw users!

I suggest that it should be changed to:
Specifies a background pixmap to use. Specify "none" (without the quotation
marks) for a transparent background.

Thanks guys!

You don't need to patch the sources for this, the functionality is
already there:

  Style * ClickToFocusRaisesOff
  Mouse 1 T N Raise

Read the same statement without the quotes again to understand
why they are there.  Without the double quotes, it means that the
pixmap name has to be omitted.

It could be that Oliviers Xserver has standard colormaps created on it 
(by some startup script). They are created by xstdcmap I think, I'm not 
sure how to query the server for them but if they are there they will 
use up lots of color cells and many applications will use them. If this 
is the case maybe we should think about getting fvwm to support them.

Cheers,
Tim.

	Maybe Olivier has a Matrox card, which supports two visuals
simultaneously (24+8 overlay mode)?  But the RENDER extension, which
steals most of the colormap cells in 4.2, isn't loaded in overlay mode.

	Olivier, which hardware do you use?  AFAIR, there was some
graphics hardware from either DEC, SGI or HP, which allowed to use several
hardware colormaps in 8-bit mode (in fact that was a kind of overlay), but
I didn't know that PCs also support this feature, so I'm very curious.

Sorry, this obviously will work. I meant to say that with settings above,
clicking inside a window will not raise it.

Yes.  Although I can't think of any fvwm-2.x release that provided
the functionality you want, I'm thinking about how to do this.
Maybe two new focus policies would do: ManualFocus (never focus a
window except when the user sets focus on his own with a function)
and ClickClientWindowToFocus which works like ClickToFocus but
ignores clicks on the decorations.

That would be great. And before it's implemented I will use my patch. :)

Hey Bob! You're back!  Nice to see you again.  :-)

BTW, if the problem you fixed with CascadePlacement exists in
2.4.x, please make a patch for that too.  Although it's been
released over a year ago, we're still applying all bug fixes in
the stable branch too (don't forget to add an entry in the NEWS
for each change in the stable version).

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

In the best tradition of the "great style flag rewrite" I'm now
planning the "great focus policy rewrite" (GFPR) :-)  I'd like to
introduce a whole lot of new options to fine tune focus policies.
These may become sub options of a new "FocusPolicy" style instead
of independent styles:

Acquiring and releasing focus:

 1) Focus when pointer enters window
 2) Unfocus when pointer leaves window
 3) Focus when unfocused and client window clicked
 4) Focus when unfocused and decorations clicked
 5) Focus programmatically (with Focus or FlipFocus command)
 6) Focus when application graps the focus.

Overriding application specified focus model:

 7) Lenience

Raising windows:

 8a) Raise when client window is clicked
 8b) Raise when client window is clicked and window is unfocused
 9a) Raise when decorations are clicked
 9b) Raise when decorations are clicked and window is unfocused

Recyclicng raise/focus clicks:

 10) Pass focus clicks to application
 11) Pass raise clicks to application
 12) Allow bindings on focus clicks
 13) Allow bindings on raise clicks

Configuring the buttons to use:

 14) Buttons to use for raise/focus clicks
 15) Modifiers to use for raise/focus clicks

Currently,

  MouseFocus   = 1 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 12 + 13
  SloppyFocus  = 1 + 5 + 6 + 12 + 13
  ClickToFocus = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 12 + 13
  NeverFocus   = (forbid all)
  Lenience     = 7

  ClickToFocusClickRaises = 8b + 9b
  <other>FocusClickRaises = 8a + 9a
  ...PassesClick = 10 + 11

The old styles can be translated to sets of other options.  New
proposed focus policies:

  ManualFocus  = 5 + 6 + ...
  ClickClientFocus = ClickToFocus - 4

Also, I suppose to add 3 and 4 to MouseFocus and Sloppy focus for
the (unavoidable) situations where you end up with the pointer
over and unfocused window.

All this not only allows a lot more flexibility for specific
windows.  It also simplifies the code in HandeButtonPress()
because we don't have to distinguish between abstract focus
policies anymore.  Instead the switches can be made on a
per-feature basis.

Do you have additional suggestions?  Did I miss anything that
could be added (I left out auto raising when the pointer enters a
window on purpose).

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

What about when windows are created, mapped or generally change state or 
do you think FvwmEvent is the way to handle this?

	Good to be back. I hope I can be more active than I've been over the past year!

	It most likely does. I suspect that it was introduced with migo's "huge window"
placement fix (2002-06-05). If that was back-ported to the stable branch, then
we'll need to fix it there too. As soon as I figure out how to check out the
2.4.x branch, I'll take a look.


Cheers,
Bob

	Whew! I sense another round of grab code rewriting in the offing. Maybe this'll
make the code a bit easier to follow and debug, and we can finally squash the
old MouseFocus - MouseFocusClickRaises - doubleclick bug that I had to give up
on last year. (It still exists, by the way, but the current versions of xfm and
moxfm have my patches to work around it, and I don't know of any other common
apps that have the problem. But I still have my old test programs.)


Cheers,
Bob

THe original author of the mwm hints code seems to have thought it
is a good idea to ignore this hint.  In decorations.c, function
check_if_function_allowed() I found this:

    case F_MOVE:
      /* Move is a funny hint. Keeps it out of the menu, but you're
       * still allowed to move. */
      if((!(t->functions & MWM_FUNC_MOVE))&&menu_string)
	return 0;
      break;

I'll fix that.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I forgot one important 'feature':  maintenance of the window list 
when a window is created or destroyed.  This depends on the focus
policy right now, but I don't know exactly how it works.  What
options do we need?

No, I don't think FvwmEvent is the way to handle anything.  It's
just plain buggy.  Well, not really, but it's so slow that it
regularly freezes fvwm itself or other modules if it's really
used.  In the long term, it should go into the fvwm core.  But for
now, it should suffice.

In general, we may not want to make a specific solution for state
changes in regard to focus policy.  As you proposed for the
"Style" rewrite, removing the distinction between window style and
state already requires triggering arbitrary actions on state
changes.  If this is ever implemented we'll get the focus policy
part for free.

Sure :-)  I still sometimes end up with windows that don't have
the grab as they should.  Just give me a chance to rewrite the
focus code - then we can take a close look at grabbing again.

Yes, I know.  We had a discussion about some problem your last fix
introduced right before your wife was in the hospital.  I disabled
that patch later because I saw no immediate fix.  It's still in
the code, though (focus.c, focus_grab_buttons() and MoveFocus()).

You don't need to record small bug fixes in the NEWS of the
development branch.  But it's mandatory in the stable branch so
that the users can judge if they need or want a new stable
release.

Why not just replace 14 and 15 with 8=off, 9=off, 12=on, 13=on and real
Mouse bindings that do Focus or Raise or both?

I already do this. I.e. my Alt-Mouse2 RaiseLowers. Mouse6 Raises, Mouse7
slowly RaiseLowers (6 and 7 is the second wheel).

I don't think many people will benefit the new mixed possibilities.
But the code will be more clean after you touch it, I am sure.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, that is very desirable.  How about this:

  FocusClick 1 w m raise-and-focus

FocusClick is roughly doing the same as Mouse, but kept separately
for the special treatment it needs.  We'd have to grab the mouse/
modifier combination from the binding only so that other clicks
get passed to the client without interference from fvwm.  I'm not
sure about the function that is triggered.  Raising and focusing
can't just be run from a complex function (or as a built in
command) because the client gets confused.

I have tried it today with fvwm-snap-20020723 but still the same. I
open the file menu looking through a couple of directories and switch

I can't reproduce the problem.  Please try to reduce your config

It is good to hear that it is reproducible outside of my computer.

Thanks for the hints. I like the Xnest program it is quite funny to
see a fvwm running inside of fvwm ;-) 
Debugging is much easier that way as well.

That's the point. Meanwhile I found three positions in file menus.c
where a segmentation fault occured. But this posititions are not the
reason for the memory corruption. 

However I have to stop here since at the moment I am quite busy with
my study, so I can't help finding this little bug. Hopefully in
september I will have more time to work on some patches.  For me I
have disabled the dynamic menu since I hardly used it.

I've seen two yet.  They have in common that an invalid menu style
is accessed, for example via (from paint_menu()):

  MenuStyle *ms = MR_STYLE(mr);

This expands to

  MenuStyle *ms = mr->ms->s;

That's right two occured in function 

static void paint_menu(
       MenuRoot *mr, XEvent *pevent, FvwmWindow *fw)
[line 4056 im menus.c]

one in line 4063:

      int bw = MST_BORDER_WIDTH(mr); 

another in line 4117:

      if ((MST_FACE(mr).type != SolidMenu &&
           MST_FACE(mr).type != SimpleMenu &&
           !MST_HAS_MENU_CSET(mr)) ||

In both cases *mr is involved.  I am quite sure that I checked if the
pointer mr or its subpointers were NULL before accessing it to prevent
the seg fault. This check was passed but the seg fault did still
occur. Maybe one of the pointer is not NULL but points to an invalid
segment (However this can happen). I will do a double check of this
test tonight or tommorow.

The third one occured in another function in menus.c. Unfortunately I
can't remember where it was. Maybe it happens again.

If you look closely you can see that mr->ms->s is involved in all
cases (the static part of the menu style).  Mikhael posted a
similar core dumps a few weeks ago.  In his and one of the similar
crashes I got, the contents of mr->ms had been overwritten with
random data, so mr->ms->s pointed to a random location.

Sounds to me like a needle in a haystack ;-)

I played a little bit around and found the three locations
below where a seg fault occured. Meanwhile I am well trained in
provoking one of the seg faults ;-)
I am not that sure anymore that they have a common source. I inserted
some debug statements in menus.c in function paint_menu to see the
locations of the pointer which may cause the violation. The pointers
are printed out three times to see if they were changed inside the
function. 

To understand the following lines here is the printf-command:
fprintf(stderr,"1. mr = %d %d %d\n",(mr),(mr->s),(mr->s->ms));
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. location and output

menus.c:4064
  int bw = MST_BORDER_WIDTH(mr);

1. mr = 135959280 135978328 135139680
2. mr = 135959280 135978328 135139680
3. mr = 135959280 135978328 135139680
1. mr = 135312000 135316008 135139680
2. mr = 135312000 135316008 135139680
3. mr = 135312000 135316008 135139680
1. mr = 135959280 135960248 209
                            ^^^
This case is clear. The pointer mr->s->ms points to nirvana. This is
the case you described, Dominik.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. location and output

menus.c:4141
  if ((MST_FACE(mr).type != SolidMenu &&
3. mr = 135843984 135749536 135139680
1. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680
2. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680
3. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680
1. mr = 135843984 135749536 135139680
1. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680
2. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680
3. mr = 135836320 135836336 135139680

The last debug statement was printed out shortly before the seg fault
occured. But all pointers seem to be normal :-| Actually no idea what
happend here.
This case happens most times.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. location and output

menuitem.c:320
  y_offset = MI_Y_OFFSET(mi);

This statement is called from the position where the previous seg
fault occured. So it may go away if the reason for the previous seg
fault is found.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Any further ideas?

Usually Purify is good at finding those needles.

If I knew what Fvwm features you were exercising, I might
find some time to do a Solaris build and Purify run.
I need config file statements, and actions to perform.

I am not sure if purify can help here.

Original message: 
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0207/msg00373.html

The is a memory violation in function paint_menu which is file menus.c
about line 4100. This violation occurs randomly, which doesn't make it
easier ;-), when using  dynamic  menus  together  with  mutliple  menu
styles.  As  far as we found out yet there are two lines in paint_menu
where a voilation occurs. Those two may or may not caused by the  same
problem.  Common is both locations that the pointer sequence mr->s->ms
is accessed. In my last  mail  I  posted  the  values  of  this  three
pointers  shortly  before the crash. The second case I described shows
that the contents of mr->s->ms point to a wrong location. 
The first case I described seems a little bit  odd  to  me  since  the
three pointers seem to have proper values. 

Even I had a look  in  menus.h  where  the  struct  MenuRootStatic  is
described.  In  this  stucture there is a declaration Pixel sideColor;
before  the  declaration  MenuStyle  *ms;.  If  the  pointer  *ms   is
overwritten by accident it may be done by a overflow in this sideColor
variable. To check this one could insert a char array between the  two
declaration  and  watch  this.  If  this is the case the overflow will
affect the char array which otherwise should  be  never  accessed.  If
nothing  comes  out  in  this  case  today  I will probably do this at
weekend.

So, please post the responsible config file and describe exactly
what you are doing to provoke it.  Since exposing a menu is part
of one of the core dumps, the problem may even be related *where*
you open the menus (they bounce off the right side and may overlap
their grandparents).  Running Purify does not make much sense
without this information.  The only info I have is that dynamic
menus (MissingSubmenuFunc) and multiple menu styles are involved.
It may be necessary that the autogenerated menus destroy
themselves after use.

Look closely:  it's not the mr->s->ms pointer that was trashed.
The mr->s pointer changed between the two invocations.  This must
not happen unless the menu style was changed.

Could be an attempt to access freed memory.

So, more evidence for some code overwriting random data?

Yes.  Scatter these debug statements all over the
MenuInteraction() function.  We might be able to hunt down the
statement that overwrites the mr->s pointer this way.  I'll commit
a debug patch for this shortly.

I thought you have reproduced the crash already. I am at the
university now and I don't have the responsible config here. I will
post it together with a description tonight or tommorow.

So I do not change menu styles. But the pointer mr->s changes
frequently and 135960248 seems to be a proper value. I will have a
double check of this.

That would be an explanation.  According to my experience one can
access freed memory without a segfault. An often made programmer
mistake is to access memory which was alloced locally by a function
and freed after its return. This happens to work in most cases.

I will do some further checks. Maybe I am lucky ;-)

They have all one thing in common:  they are triggered
asynchronously by an expose event.  Somehow I managed to delete
the menu structure while the X server still stored the connection
between the structure and the window.  When an expose event
arrived, fvwm queried the X server for an associated menu
structure and got the address of the deleted one.  This was caused
by some funny interaction between the Display used to create the
menu and the one that created the context.  I'm puzzled how this
could happen:

  XDestroyWindow(menu_display, menu_window, ...);
  XFlush(menu_display);
  XDeleteContext(normal_display, menu_context, ...);
  ...
  (Expose event arrives)
  XFindContext(normal_diplay, event_window, ...);

So, the XFindContext after the XDeleteContext returned the already
deleted context.  It seems that those two calls are not strictly
serialized on the server.

I have committed a fix along with a lot of temporary debug code
that creates a core dump when an inconsistent menu structure is
detected.

I have to correct myself:  It must *never* happen.  The 's' bit is
not the menu style but the static part of the menu structure.
This is never changed while the menu exists.

Even moreso because the memory often gets allocated again almost
instantly and is filled with new data.

(with my bugfix, I hope).  Before the fix, the crash could be
provoked like this:

 1) Open the root menu.
 2) Open a directory menu from the root menu.
 3) Hierarchically open submenus of the directory menu until one
    of these menus overlaps a different directory menu.
 4) Move the pointer back to the root menu without passing over
    any other menu (this can be tricky).

=> The submenus are closed and destroyed.  The partially hidden
   menu gets an Expose event - after it was destroyed.
=> Boom!

I can't use any Key, there is no way to have any Shortcut.
I've tried a lot of .fvwm2rc files with differnt bindings but nothing was
helping. Also i restarted first all the Servers, and also the complete
system.
Using KDE i can use Keyboad Shortcuts

>From the fvwm FAQ:

---------------------------- snip -------------------------
0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse
     bindings stop working.  What can I do?

A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See
   Q 5.5 for more details.

--

5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.  You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings.  With XFree86 and fvwm version 2.4.0 or above, the
   right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key, Mouse or
   PointerKey commands in your configuration file and the number
   of modifiers you want to ignore.  If you do not have a
   lightning fast machine or very few bindings you should not
   ignore more than two modifiers.  So do not ignore scroll-lock
   if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server.  The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard
   map.  Pressing these keys has no effect then.  To re-add them
   try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by
   xmodmap.  Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command
   for further details.  If you disable the CapsLock key in your
   keyboard map in this way, you can speed up fvwm a bit by
   removing the Lock modifier from the list of ignored modifiers:

     IgnoreModifiers

Hi,

I've finally got around to port my beloved configuration (as described
in http://ezine.daemonnews.org/199902/fvwm.html plus some newer
developments) from fvwm1 to fvwm2 and in progress I've done I thing
that I think may be worthy inclusion into some of the sample configuration
files. 

It's a Windows-like implementation of Alt-Tab: when pressing Alt-Tab
once at a time, the focus will alternate between two windows, when
pressing Alt-Tab multiple times the focus will switch sequentially
between windows. The implementation is:

AddToFunc SetFocus
    + I WindowId $0 Focus
    + I FlipFocus 
    + I WindowList Root c c NoGeometry SelectOnRelease Alt_L CurrentDesk

AddToFunc PrevNext
    + I Next (CurrentDesk AcceptsFocus) Function SetFocus $w

AddToFunc TabForward
    + I Prev (CurrentDesk AcceptsFocus) Function PrevNext

Key Tab     A   M   Function TabForward


The idea in a nutshell is that the new window is taken from the
bottom of the list and brought to the top, and the old current window
is sent to the bottom of the list. So when WindowList is called, the
window at the top of the list (the default choice) is already the new one,
and you don't have to press Tab again to get to the next window.
And since normally the windows at the top and the bottom are exchanged,
pressing Alt-Tab once at a time will alternate between them.

-SB

I think you have found it already. Just in case I put the config on
the net http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/download/fvwm2rc_menu_problem
My desciption is would have been similar to the one you gave below.

The problem with this is that it can't be canceled by pressed Esc to
return to the window that was focused at the time of Alt-Tab.

Anyway, in 2.5.2 (and partially in 2.4.8, remove IconifiedAtEnd) the
following emulates the Windows behaviour better if anyone likes it:

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk, NoGeometry, CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd

Well, you can always press Alt-Tab once more and switch back.

Yes, I did not read the man page carefully enough. Thanks! Ah, I see
why I could have not noticed it: I've started fith fvwm 2.3.21 and I think
this option was not there.
