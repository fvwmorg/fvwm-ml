(2) Is probably related to the new expose handling.  If in 2.3.22
the hilight/shadow colours were not reverted and the colour in
said theme did not change, then 2.3.22 was buggy.

This may be related to the following problem. If it will not be fixed by
fixing the next one, I will provide a minimal rc file for this problem too.

Here is a minimal rc file to reproduce incorrect borders on (Re)capture.
You may save it in ~/.fvwm/test/7 and then: Restart fvwm2 -f test/7
I hope you may reproduce this, otherwise I will send scrrenshots.


ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme
# any color may be used instead of rgb:B0/00/00, for example: navy
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 3 fg white, bg rgb:B0/00/00
Style "*" BorderColorset 3

# BTW, for some reason the following All does not remove old windows
All (Test*) Close
Exec xterm -name Test1 -g 80x12+300+0
Wait Test1
Exec xterm -name Test2 -g 80x12+500+200
Wait Test2
FvwmConsole -g +200+500

# All unfocussed windows now have incorrect hilight border colors.
# If there are old mapped window they may be captured correctly...

# This fixes border colors of one of the window
All (Test2) WindowShade 
All (Test2) WindowShade

# This makes the borders buggy again
All (Test2) RecaptureWindow

No, the hilight/shadow colors in 2.3.22 were correct for extreme colors.
Now - not always. The shadow color can't be lighter than the hilight one.
And not only this, they are almost the same in this case.

  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 6 bg Blue3
  Echo $v bg=$[bg.cs6] hi=$[hilight.cs6] sh=$[shadow.cs6]

[FVWM][Echo]:  2.3.22 compiled on...
	bg=rgb:0000/0000/cdcd hi=rgb:7f7f/7f7f/e6e6 sh=rgb:4c4c/4c4c/dcdc

[FVWM][Echo]:  2.3.29 compiled on...

No, you are wrong.  The shadow colour *can* be lighter than the
hilight colour.  This was always intended by the calculation
algorithm.

Well, that's a real problem.  The reversed hilight colour should
be 60% darker than the shadow colour.  I see it's caused by a
typo: GetShadowOrHilightColor was called with PCT_LIGHT_BOTTOM
as second *and* third parameter.  The third one should have been
PCT_LIGHT_TOP.

Uh, and well, the second parameter should have been PCT_DARK_TOP
in the first place and the third parameter when calculating the
shadowe colour should have been PCT_LIGHT_BOTTOM.

Well, you're right that the colours have changed between 2.3.22
and 2.3.29, but I still think the reversed look was intended in
the first place.  So, I'll revert back to the 2.3.22 calculations,
but are these the correct ones?

Yes, you are right.  Switching resolutions is no problem for fvwm
because the root window size does not change.

Could you please try this with the latest beta realease and see if
the problem persists?  If it does, can you provide the config
files for vnc and fvwm so I can try to reproduce this?

Does this happen with other applications too?  

Is this 'NCD' free software so I can get it for my system?

THanks for the report.  Since the FvwmConfig module has already
been removed from the distribution in the 2.3.x beta versions, we
will probably not fix this anymore.

Paul, I tried this with 2.7.3 and 2.7.5 and do not see this
problem.  I couldn't find a 2.7.4 tarball anywhere, though.  Does
if still happen with 2.7.5?

Anyway, I'll remove this from the 2.4 to do list.  The problem is
not serious enough to delay the release any longer.

Bye

The to do list has shrunk to only a few items with no bugs left to
fix:

 173) Reword panel description in FvwmButtons man page.

   How far did you get yet, Dan?

 62) Write a new announcement.

   Last thing to do.

 92) Test session management restart code.

   Still not assigned , I think.

 95) Test new panel implementation in FvwmButtons.

   I think Mikhael volunteered, but Dan is also working on this
   item.

 bug #697 (keyboard focus with vnc/NCD)

   Not important enough to delay the release.

So, on my part there is nothing left to do, but I'd help with the
remaining items, of course.  I'll build a new beta release today
so that my latest fixes can be tested.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I wasn't really  trying to create test cases.   I was mainly concerned
with the document.

Mikhael, if you can't do this, I could try to go further.

Ok, final 2.3.29 is already buggy... But this is true for any release. :)

Run top, popup menu, select any item. See how fvwm2 + X eat all CPU.
I can reproduce this consistently with a default menustyle.
There is no problem if PopupDelay 0 is used.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can, but at this point I prefer to fish general bugs than create test
cases, so please go further.

:-)

Did I say that was the final release?

I'm in no particular hurry to get the release out the door.

And what is the relation to the busy cursor patch? I'll look into that
later.

As usual, we will all decide. :)

This is in the ANNOUNCE file:

  All fvwm user configurations should be moved to $HOME/.fvwm
  directory; Read command supports $HOME/.fvwm by default, but not $HOME.

I don't think  the "but not  $HOME" part is  correct.  Isn't this more
correct:

Fvwm user configurations can be moved to a subdirectory  in $HOME.  If
the $HOME/.fvwm directory  is  present, fvwm will  read  configuration
data from it instead of $HOME.

A good sense tells that the shadow color can never be lighter than the
hilight one, otherwise a raised box would look sunk. I think this is true
for the original motif calculations, at least this is what I get with:

  Netscape*background:                    rgb:e4/d2/c0
  ! Comment GTK-like colors to get the default motif ones:
  !   topShadowColor = rgb:b7/a8/9a, bottomShadowColor = rgb:7d/73/6a
  ! As you can guess, I like the GTK-like ones.
  !Netscape*topShadowColor:               rgb:f8/f7/f6
  !Netscape*bottomShadowColor:            rgb:b1/93/75

Can you give an example when the shadow (it's named bottomShadow in motif)
color is lighter then the hilight one in our previous calculations?

You didn't really reverted back. The light and dark parameters are
reversed, so the following fix is needed (please do it):

   return GetShadowOrHiliteColor(
-    background, PCT_DARK_BOTTOM, PCT_LIGHT_BOTTOM, DARKNESS_FACTOR);
+    background, PCT_LIGHT_BOTTOM, PCT_DARK_BOTTOM, DARKNESS_FACTOR);

   return GetShadowOrHiliteColor(
-    background, PCT_DARK_TOP, PCT_LIGHT_TOP, BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR);
+    background, PCT_LIGHT_TOP, PCT_DARK_TOP, BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR);

With this patch applied, the first problem in this thread is fixed.
The second problem is already fixed, thank you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

By "final 2.3.29" I meant fvwm-2.3.29, as opposed to "pre-2.3.29" or
"cvs 2.3.29".

There is no any relation to the busy cursor.

Maybe "busy wait" is not the right term, but this is how my CS teachers
called this situation - CPU is used when not needed.

Both descriptions are correct. Rewording may help of course. You added the
first part before semicolon. I felt that this is not quite good, .fvwm2rc
only should be moved if there are relative Read's in it, because Read does
not searches in $HOME now, thus I added the second part. Do you prefer:

  It is not required, but it is suggested to move the user's .fvwm2rc and
  other related data into $HOME/.fvwm directory, because Read command and
  some modules search in $HOME/.fvwm (or $FVWM_USERDIR), but not in $HOME.

BTW, $FVWM_USERDIR directory is always present, since FVWM creates it.

Mikhael.

Howdy all,

Anyone of you following the WM discussion taking place here,

http://www.advogato.org/article/248.html

BTW: Anyone up-keeping freshmeat.net's fvwm Comments section (look towards 
the bottom section of the page) ?

http://freshmeat.net/projects/fvwm

Just thought I'd mention these links since they might be good opportunities 
to plug :-) fvwm2

Keep up the great work.

I think  the man page  needs  some work  in  this area.  I've  put the
example you posted into the man page which  helps a lot, but I haven't
committed it yet.

This doesn't seem to work:

DestroyFunc W
AddToFunc W I Exec xterm -name $0 -g 10x10-20000-2000

DestroyModuleConfig FButt: *
*FButt: Geometry +300+300
*FButt: ButtonGeometry 32x32
*FButt: Back gray
*FButt: Fore white
*FButt: BoxSize smart
*FButt: Columns 2
*FButt: Rows 2
*FButt: (Panel(up,    indicator) bu "W bu")
*FButt: (Panel(right, indicator) br "W br")
*FButt: (Panel(left,  indicator) bl "W bl")
*FButt: (Panel(down,  indicator) bd "W bd")

Module FvwmButtons FButt

DestroyFunc Operate
AddToFunc Operate
 + I Next (FvwmButtons) WarpToWindow 20p 20p
 + I FakeClick Depth 3 press 1 wait 3000 release 1

Operate

The FvwmButtons part works, but when I issue "Operate"
theres no reaction from FvwmButtons.  At depth 2 I pop up
a root button 1 menu, but at 3, I'd expect FvwmButtons to
react but it doesn't.

I never thought there are still X servers without the shape
extension.  I'll commit a fix in a few moments.

I've made a pass over the ANNOUNCE file and sorted the items.
However, there is a *lot* missing.  I have dumped a full list of
new features since 2.2.x to the top of the file.  Please have a
look at this list so we can decide which things are important
enough to mention.  Also, some things are gone in 2.4 which has to
be mentioned (some modules and commands).

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I'd rather stop thinking about this now :-)  I hate all these
colour calculations.  Why can't our users stick with flat
decorations?  :-)

The FakeClick command is really not meant for users, just for the
developers.  If you can rephrase the description in a better way,
feel free to do so.  As a mathmatician I have an intuitive
knowledge of how to phrase simple facts in a complicated manner.

I'd use (FButt) instead.

  Depth 1 = root window
  Depth 2 = frame window
  Depth 3 = parent window
  Depth 4 = client window
  ...
  Depth infinity = whatever lowest level window the pointer in in.

Events propagate upward as usual.

The event mask in the fake_click() function was wrong.  I have
fixed this and it should work now.  You have to be extra careful
when using FakeClick in combination with modules.  Fvwm does not
properly process events in a FakeClick script, so you should never
put more than one click plus one release in a single line.
Multiple click/release sequences lead to weird race conditions in
the swallowing/panel code between fvwm and FvwmButtons.  One
effect I saw was FvwmButtons complaining that the panel was
swallowed by someone else or fvwm not decorating the panel.

These things tend to vary with the context, but I think in this case
the former is always correct:

Fvwm 2.4 modules are not backward compatible with Fvwm version 2.2.x.

I'm sure there are rules for this, but I never could make any sense
out of even the simplest discussions of grammar.  What works for me
is what "looks" or "sounds" right.

I believe that the distinction here is that backward is a direction or
noun whereas backwards is an adverb indicating a direction.
Fvwm modules may not be backward compatible, but each step of their
development is another step that forwards the ultimate goals of the
developers.  ;)

dict forwards ; dict backwords 

Hope this helps.

A long while  back we "fixed" command lookup  in functions.c by making
the table of functions contain all lower case function names.

Looking thru FvwmCommand I see that parts of FvwmCommand expect
the old mixed case function names.  For example, scripts/test1.pl
expects to be able to issue the command "Desk" but it now has to
issue "desk".

I guess we could add an unused column to the table in functions.c
to get the old behavior back...

Description:

When making clean, the script modules/FvwmScript/Scripts/FvwmScript-Setup95
doesn't get removed. When re-configuring fvwm with a different --prefix
FvwmScript-Setup95 still points to the old prefix for fvwm-script-setup95.pl.
The Setup95 doesn't work correctly anymore when installing with the new prefix.

Repeat-By:

make install
make [dist]clean
[ rm -fr previous/fvwm/installation ]
configure --prefix=/different/prefix
make install
Run the Setup95 script from fvwm menu

Fix:

Add a "rm -f FvwmScript-Setup95" to the appropriate clean targets in
Makefile.[in|am].

If the windowlist overflows the More... entry in the
menu does not open another menu to show the rest of the entries but 
instead it gives an error message "No such menu Desk:".
This is because whitespaces are not allowed in menunames.

This patch fixes it.

I'll be the first to admit that this is an ugly hack to get the thing
to work but it works. Use it however you like or write a better one.
A correct fix would be to truly allow whitespaces in menunames. But
that was a bit too much work for my taste.

When I log in both xload and xapm seems to get wrong hints, and they
resize themselves too big for their respective buttons. This happens
after i use a 'GotoPage 1.0' and back again. This problem seems to be
introduced in 2.2.26, 2.2.25 have no problems with my config-files.

If I kill xapm or xload after logging in they will resize themselves 
to their buttons just fine. They also resize fine if I do a 'restart 
fvwm2'.

Here is my FvwmButtons configuration (well, most of it).

I hadn't seen it before.  Seems pretty silly to me, yet another
person wanting to write his own window manager.

I updated the release section for 2.2.5.
Looks like anyone can enter a comment, but I couldn't figure out how.
(Not that I had a comment to enter.)

I've made a proper fix that will show up in the next beta release.

I don't know.  It's easy to adapt the perl scripts that we supply,
but that won't help people who have written their own perl scripts
and are still using the old spelling.  Is this really relevant?

I don't see a problem with your configuration, but on the other
hand I don't understand what exactly you are doing when you see
this.  Please step by step instructions so that I can see if this
happens for me too.  Furthermore, screenshots of your button bar
might help.

Actually, with all lowercase names  for the fvwm functions, its pretty
hopeless.  Too  many of our commands clash  with Perl functions, (like
"next","close","exec").

Of  course its possible to rewrite  Perl stuff just doing system calls
to FvwmCommand, but its  not as pretty  or natural  as the mixed  case
solution.

I thought a simple macro to define commands might be ok, we could replace:

  {"addtofunc",    add_item_to_func, F_ADDFUNC,              FUNC_ADD_TO},
  {"addtomenu",    add_item_to_menu, F_ADDMENU,              0},

with

FD(AddToFunc,"addtofunc",add_item_to_func,F_ADDFUNC,FUNC_ADD_TO)
FD(AddToMenu,"addtomenu",add_item_to_menu,F_ADDMENU,0)

or we could rename the functions to make the second column usable.
We'd need to do some kind of trick with "+" and "function".

I switched to  using the shell  interface for the FvwmButton tests  so
its not an immediate problem for me.

If you want to drop the FvwmCommand.pm stuff, thats OK too, but
someone, somewhere might be using it.

redundancy.

 - Plaese try upgrading to 2.3.29.  Does this help?

 - Does this happen with all windows or only certain ones?

 - If it's only Gimp windows, which Gimp version do you have?
   Please include a step by step description how I can open such
   a window.

There is the same problem with FvwmCommand.sh, like the commands
"function", "wait", "exec", "echo".

Probably a good idea if we want to continue with FvwmConsole.{pm,sh}.

I myself don't think either FvwmCommand.sh or FvwmCommand.pm are useful.
They may be ok for simple cases, but for more complex ones it is much
better to open once a pipe to FvwmCommand/FvwmConsole and write to pipe.

I really don't see a point to have perl (or shell) function without any
parameter checking and with quoting/spacing/escaping problems. Consider:

  Current ("My Window", !iconified) Move 10p 20p

Which is more understandable, the one using FvwmCommand.pm:

  current('("My Window",', '!iconified)', 'Move', '10p', '20p');

or simply:

  system("FvwmCommand", q{Current ("My Window", !iconified) Move 10p 20p});

or maybe just:

  sub fvwm ($) { system("FvwmCommand", $_[0]); }

  fvwm q{Current ("My Window", !iconified) Move 10p 20p};
  fvwm q{Exec exec xmessage 'Try the same using "FvwmCommand.pm"'};

I would not recomment using FvwmCommand.sh or FvwmCommand.pm, there are
better methods using FvwmCommand directly. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

If you run fvwm-themes, the following commands bring some GUI's,
which, when pressing their first button, cause core dumps:

  FvwmScript FvwmScript-ColorSelector
  FvwmForm FvwmForm-ThemeSettings

The logic to apply colorsets to items in the item linklist
was assuming that all items have a "DrawTable" (color).
Selections get item entries but they don't display anything.

I don't use Colorsets, but I think its fixed.

Not in the present form. Make a Perl extension of FvwmCommand.c, then
functions in FvwmCommand could be directly called from Perl without
separate process. Don't know if it is worthwhile, though.

Well we could with:

   {"addtofunc",  CMD_AddToFunc, F_ADDFUNC, FUNC_ADD_TO},
   {"addtomenu",  CMD_AddToMenu, F_ADDMENU, 0},

The advantage here is that there is less redundancy, and all functions
that implement commands would have a common naming scheme ("CMD_").
It might make navigating and reading the source code easier too.

I agree, but the cost of keeping this working seems pretty small.
After we decide on a solution or decide to drop the feature,
I can make the change although I'm going to finish the FvwmButtons tests
first and that may still take a while.

The fvwm2 man page states:

Man: fvwm2>    By default the  "WindowListFunc" looks like this:
Man: fvwm2>
Man: fvwm2>                   AddToFunc WindowListFunc
Man: fvwm2>                    + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
Man: fvwm2>                    + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
Man: fvwm2>                    + I WindowId $0 Raise
Man: fvwm2>                    + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p

But unless I add this to my ~/.fvwm2rc, the WindowListFunc doesn't
seem to work like advertised in the man page. I.e. when I don't
add this to my ~/.fvwm2rc, open the WindowList and click on
an item in the WindowList, the window does not deiconify, does not
get focus, does not raise and the mouse pointer does not warp
to the window either.

So it looks like the default for WindowListFunc is empty now.

Is this on purpose (then the man page should be updated) or is this a
bug?

Did you move fvwm around after you installed it?

When you configure fvwm, it creates a file named ConfigFvwmDefaults
in /usr/local/share/fvwm (or something like that), that contains
the function definition.
Fvwm then tries to read that file during startup.

Hi Dominik,

First,

> Is this 'NCD' free software so I can get it for my system?

No, I'm referring to an NCD terminal, a sort of "dumb" terminal that supports X.  They seem to be popular for connecting to big Sun Sparc servers with.

> Does this happen with other applications too?  

No, it seems to be very specific to vncviewer in full-screen mode.

> Could you please try this with the latest beta realease and see if
> the problem persists?  If it does, can you provide the config
> files for vnc and fvwm so I can try to reproduce this?

Okay, I've tried using the latest beta and the problem persists.  Obviously since you don't have an NCD terminal you won't be able to reproduce the exact problem I had.  However, I found another situation that causes problems.  I modified by .tcshrc so that when tcsh is run in an xterm from my .xsession, it starts VNC automatically.  I found that, sometimes, I'd have VNC not respond to input at all after this startup, and this occured when the xterm had been raised over the top of my vncviewer.  This seemed to happen because of some timing issues with fvwm starting after the vncviewer had gone full-screen.  I basically put a "sleep 1" before calling vncviewer so that fvwm has started up before I start it and that fixed it.  The reason I mention this is that it might be a way for you to reproduce the problem without having to have an NCD terminal :)

I do wonder if there are other ways of screwing this up, though - maybe if I just make an xterm come up over the top of the vncviewer it'll screw up the session.  I'll try this and get back to you, as it'd be much easier for you than logging in and out.  I can't do this unless I'm at work (and I can't send you my .fvwm2rc either).

Thanks for your reply,
David

To make one thing clear in the first place:  This is a *bug* in
the JDK.  This works with mwm because mwm has a hack to detect and
handle the broken window hints that Java produces.

After a window has been placed initially, fvwm does not prevent
the application from moving around its own windows.  This is
probably what happens here.  Since Java tries to be its own window
manager but does this miserably, windows often appear at strange
positions.

xv has badly broken window placement and window position hint
code.  I tried to understand what it does once, but the code is so
weird and complex that I see no chance to write a fix.  You should
report this to the xv developers.  BTW, xv-3.10a works properly
for me.

Another bug that should be reported to the gimp developers.  If
position hints are set correctly, the window will appear at the
right spot on the screen.  How do I start gfig?

What you see is a race contidion between fvwm and the forte
windows.  Let it suffice to say that forte and fvwm disagree where
the window should be placed, and for some reason forte tells fvwm
its geometry again and again.  This can often lead to windows
crawling off screen (xv is another one of these applications that
don't want the window manager to have the final say about its
position).  This usually indicates a violation of the ICCCM2
specifications.

Well, if someone feels able to debug FvwmScript, feel free.  I
don't.

Hi,
	I'm not actually a developer, but I fixed a little bug in FvwmGtk which
I thought I should tell the contributers about.

FvwmGtk/exand.c:101
changed the body of the for-loop to read:

	if (*r->s) {
	    strcat (res, r->s);
	    free (r->s);
	}
	next = r->next;
	free (r);

This way blank strings aren't freed.

Hope this helps someone. (I'm not on the mailing list. To contact me use my address.)

You are right, I missed the ConfigFvwmDefaults file, I forgot
it in the %file list when creating the rpm-package.

Thank you very much, now everything works normally.

The support for Asian languages is also very nice.

Well, with a challenge like that, who can resist.

It would help if I spoke French.  Any volunteers to supply an
French to English patch?

The problem seems to be the zero in x11base.  I searched for
straight assignments, and things using &x11base.  The only thing I
see is:

  x11base=(X11base*) safecalloc(1,sizeof(X11base));

at line 956 in main().

Clearly the program has gone beyond that since its entered MainLoop().

I'd have to guess that theres a wild pointer in there somewhere.
I can Purify it if I get the script definition.

I have to say, this is a pretty amazing piece of code.

This script is part of fvwm-themes distrib you can start it via
Fvwm Configuration -> Utilities -> Colors selector 
I do not get a core dump, the core dump is produced by a machine
which run BSD I think.

I will make some translation when I will have some times. I will
try to help debugging too. It seems that there are problems also
with multibyte enabled.

Any report on how fvwm-themes work on Solaris is welcome :o)

FYI, "make rpm-dist" creates correct rpm file.

This is what I though too (BSD specific), but the report in this thread is
done on my linux machine (both core dumps). No Multibyte charset support.
The second (FvwmForm) core dump is fixed.

It seems you use 2.3.23-2.3.27 version. I think I have fixed this core
dump in 2.3.28 by patching recursive_replace instead.

OK. But with 'UsePPosition' you can use at least the IBM JDK with Fvwm2.

AFAIK, there hasn't been any xv development since end of 1994.

I have the same version.

Yes, you're right -- I was using 2.3.25. I didn't notice that change in the
2.3.29 files, so I just changed the version I already had.
Thank you very much.

	N.B. I used `FvwmCommand "read /u/phippst/.fvwm2rc"' but I don't think
	that is what triggers this.
	
Repeat-By:
	Here's the contents of /u/phippst/.fvwm2rc:

DestroyMenu ResizeMenu
AddToMenu ResizeMenu
+ "Which way Jim?" Title
+ %prog/space/xtrek_fed_e.xbm%" 7" my_resize_dir 0 0

	It used to contain a lot more but a binary search resulted in this,
	you may have to read this file several times to get a core dump.
	xtrek_fed_e.xbm is from the AIcons package but I would guess that any
	bitmap will do.

Fix:
	It seems like a malloc corruption, something being freed twice or old
	pointers being copied. I think the clue is in the fact that it only
	happens with bitmaps.

Sorry to say that Purify doesn't help.  It core dumps but heres all I get:

NPR: Null pointer read:
  * This is occurring while in:
	strlen         [rtlib.o]
	SendToScript   [Instructions.c:1395]

That looks like the same thing gdb gives us.

I'm starting to appreciate the difficulty.
Somethings fishy, in my case, x11base is not zero.


Anyway, during testing I managed to core dump fvwm using the Themes
menus.  I think was popping up a menu 3 levels deep and missed with
a click.  It gives me a stack like this:

In fact the core dump is not really generated by FvwmScript it is
generated by the script which contains a programming error.
I am sorry it was a stupid error. In general, FvwmScript does not
make a lot of consistancy test in the Script. E.g., if you
call a Widget which does not exists FvwmScript will core dump.
So, in fact the core dump above is not a bug but a feature.

Sorry, Olivier

The $0 is not properly quoted. Use

  + I DestroyDecor $$$$0
  + I AddToDecor $$$$0

instead.

For me this happens only if I paste above lines into an
FvwmConsole window.  If I write this into a file and execute it
with "read filename" everything works fine (qith the $0 fix).
There seems to be a weird race condition between the two
FvwmConsole processes.  Sometimes, the "AddToFunc InitializeDecor"
is not sent to fvwm at all and thus the function does not exist
when it is called.  Copying these lines into my .fvwm2rc file
resolves the problem because FvwmConsole is not involved anymore.

2) Open an FvwmConsole window.

3) Type "read bug" into that window.

4) Put the first three lines of the file into the cut buffer.

     DestroyFunc InitializeDecor
     AddToFunc InitializeDecor
     + I DestroyDecor $0

   Be sure to include the newlines.

5) Paste all lines at once into the Fvwmconsole window.

6) Repeat steps 3 to 5 until error messages show up:

     [FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> Command can not be added to a decor; executing command now: 'I DestroyDecor'
     ...

   This may take a few attempts until it shows up.

The reason for the error message is that the
"AddToFunc InitializeDecor" line was sent from FvwmConsoleC to
FvwmConsole, but FvwmConsole never received that line and thus
never sent it to fvwm.  Therefore fvwm is still adding things to
the AtermDecor from the pass through the read command.

The corresponding code from FvwmConsoleC looks like this (around
line 103):

	  /* send the command including null to the server */
	  send( s, cmd, strlen(cmd)+1, 0 );

The problem goes away if I add a usleep(1) before the send():

	  /* send the command including null to the server */
	  usleep(1);
	  send( s, cmd, strlen(cmd)+1, 0 );

Of course this is not a proper fix, but I don't have a clue whet
the problem is in the first place.  Help!

Ah, yes.  I forgot to check if mi is not NULL before accessing it.
Consider this fixed.

If I only could lay my hands on the mwm source code to see how

Theat can't be true.  My xv supports the png format which does not
exist for long now.

Oops, I misread what you wrote.  I see the same with said window.
xv does some funny calculations of its window position.  These
were specifically written for a few window managers.  I remember a
comment in the xv sources that said something like "this will break
with other window managers".  In the end xv does several things
that violate the ICCCM2 severely:  It calculates the position it
wants to use and tries to guess the size of the window manager
decorations, but fails utterly.  Thus the requested position is
screwed up.  Furthermore it forces the window manager to use the
broken hint by claiming that this was 'user specified'.
Therefore, not even "style xv* nopposition" helps.

In the future I may write a "nousposition" style to work around
this, but overall xv's window handling is so completely broken
that it will probably never run nicely with fvwm and most other
window managers (because 'fixing' this would imply to break the
placement of many other applications).

Okay, I see.  It's the same problem as with xv.  The window wants
to be placed at +x-0 but requests 'NorthWest' gravity instead of
South gravity which would be correct.  Please report this to the
developers.  All they have to do is to create the window with
"SouthGravity" or "SouthWestGravity" and everything will work
fine.

At least you can use "style gfig nopposition" here.

BTW, the same fix would work for xv, but in addition the
decoration guessing code had to be taken out.

No, it was even simpler.  This code frees the colours allocated
for xpm files (Picture.c):

  if (p->alloc_pixels != NULL)
  {
    if (p->nalloc_pixels != 0)
    {
      XFreeColors(dpy, Pcmap, p->alloc_pixels, p->nalloc_pixels, 0);
    }
    free(p->alloc_pixels);
  }

But p->alloc_pixels was never initialised for xmb bitmaps and thus
contained a random pointer.  Fixed.

You can download mwm.  The only restriction is that you can only use
it with a free operating system.

Finding out how Java detects that its running under mwm is easy.
Using our "BugOpts ModalityIsEvil" accomplishes that.

The problem is, once you convince Java that its running under mwm
fvwm has to really act like mwm or Java crashes.  I'm still trying
to figure out what behavior of mwm Java is sensitive to.

Hi

This didn't happened with version 2.3.28. It is reproducible. When I start
xmms with the singit! plugin, which displays the text to the song fvwm2
coredumps and kills X. I don't use gnome.

If you need more info, I am happy to help

I see.  I think I have fixed this.  Please try the next snapshot

Hmm, thats interesting.

I've been mystified  by  by the  FvwmButtons   panel tests I've   been
running.  I've had to  insert sleeps all over the  place and run  with
the "-s" (slow) option.  Of course my connection to fvwm is slow and
I have to work from home for a while longer.

Would you mind running the button tests?

I'm just interested in how many of each of the 4 windows slide out in
the 2 tests.

These are the things I noticed so far about the tests:

Test 1 issues:
UseTitle doesn't put anything in button, button doesn't operate
Padding makes indicator disappear
Noborder test needs a window with no border.

Test 2 issue:
The "down" button with 1 step doesn't draw anything.

I haven't rerun yet with this change.

That's because the panel parsing code does not recognise the
'padding' option.  I guess you wanted to use this line:

  FC '*FButt: (Padding 2, Panel(down,  indicator) bd "W bd")'

instead of

  FC '*FButt: (Panel(down,  indicator, padding 2) bd "W bd")'

I've fixed that in the script and made some modifications so it
works better (for me).  With all these changes, the test completes
without any problems.

The change does not affect panels, only swallowed windows.

Your syntax can't be used if the script is run under "perl -w" (the only
correct way) and/or if the command has tabs, like in menu items.

I am not against if you implement FvwmCommand.pm natively in perl with
only one exported function fvwm() or FvwmCommands().

But I think we should simply replace FvwmCommand.pm with the code like:

	BEGIN { open(FVWMCOMMAND, "| FvwmCommand -c") || die; }
	END { close(FVWMCOMMAND); }
	sub FvwmCommands (@) { foreach (@_) { print FVWMCOMMAND "$_\n"; } }
	1;

So perl scripts may look like:

	use FvwmCommand;
	FvwmCommands q{
		Current ("My Window", !iconified) Move 10p 20p
		Exec exec xmessage 'Try with the current "FvwmCommand.pm"'
	};
	FvwmCommands "Beep", "All (XTerm) Iconify $toggle", "Beep";

If there are no objections, I can do this.

It is probably worth to use -S to open a separate FvwmCommandS for every
script, but FvwmCommandS should support aliases to do it correctly (so it
can be stopped independantly of FvwmCommandS's for other scripts).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am now running fvwm-snap-20010310 and it still persists.
Basically the same gdb backtrace.

If I compile with --disable-gnome, everything is fine. Maybe I
should do that.

Nope, just use the next snapshot.  The snapshots are generated
only once per day, so you have to wait up to 24 hours to be sure
you get a certain patch.  My changes have not made it into the
0310 snapshot.

There was some registration form to download it, but it appears you
can just shortcircuit to the FTP site:
ftp://ftp.opengroup.org/pub/openmotif/
I'm grabbing the full 17MB tar, but the whole tree appears to be
expanded, including mwm here:
ftp://ftp.opengroup.org/pub/openmotif/R2.1.30/motif/clients/mwm/

Are you having problems with your browser, possibly with frames?

On the left there is a frame, the second line is downloads.
You have to register then you should be able to download it.

I noticed there is a problem in the colour allocation of menus and
probably other parts of fvwm.  With this config:

  MenuStyle * Foreground $[fg.cs0], Background $[bg.cs0]

The GetColor call will return the Pixel structures from colour set
0 without allocating any colour cells.  If the same line is issued
again, XFreeColors() is called for these colour cells and then
GetColor() is called again, returning the same colour cell again
and so on.  I'm not sure what will happen.  Probably nothing
because fvwm never allocated this colour cell - it was allocated
by FvwmTheme.  But I am not sure about the effects - fvwm might
even crash.

Bye

[x] this is WEIRD!
[x] this doesn't work either

sorry, dominik, this didn't work. 

wouldn't it be useful to add a new feature like

IncludeDecor <Decorname>

to be used within AddToDecor-Statements?

thanks

No, the logic requires simply $0 here. And it works. Try, for example:

DestroyFunc InitializeMyFunc
AddToFunc   InitializeMyFunc
+ I DestroyFunc $0    
+ I AddToFunc   $0
+ I + I Exec exec xmessage test

InitializeMyFunc MyFunc
MyFunc

I can't reproduce this. It works with or without "Function" for me.
Andre, maybe you use InitializeDecor prior to its definition?

Sorry, I don't like such quasi automatical replaces. Also this idea to
help grep here is like to remove all comments except for GPL headers so we
can grep '/*' to find all GPL headers.

You changed:

  * INSTALL: this is not our file, why should we change it?
  * FAQ: so html converting tool should be changed (it worked with ====)
  * fvwm-menu-*.1: they are generated by perl, so ==== will return anyway
  * other files where ==== were used to distinguish from ---- lines

For detection of cvs conflicts, I would suggest this command:

  find . -type f -exec grep -l '<<<<<<' \{\} \;

I like very much your other commits, but not this one. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

In a function, the pixel value is converted to a string before
using it.  From functions.c (expand_extended_var):

    case 0:
      /* fg.cs */
      pixel = Colorset[cs].fg;
      break;
    ...
    return pixel_to_color_string(dpy, Pcmap, pixel, target, False);

> so wouldn't the MenuStyle line above alloc the pixels it needs?

Yes and no.  If the "$[fg.cs<n>]" string is expanded before the
MenuStyle command is executed, there is no problem.  But if the
string is quoted so that it is used as the colour name, GetColor
does the substitution with the described limitation.  As far as I
remember this is intended for use by modules which will suffer
from the same problem as the menu code.

Yes.  Currectly I guess that colours may be corrupted.  Consider
this:

 - Server running with 256 colours
 - Colour x is used in a colour set and allocated by FvwmTheme.
 - Same colour x is allocated exactly once by fvwm.
 - Issue "MenuStyle * $$[fg.cs0]"
 - Issue "MenuStyle * $$[fg.cs0]" again

The second MenuStyle command will free colour x which is still in
use somewhere else, for example in window titles.  If the colour
set changes now, the colour cell used in window hilighting will
change, right?

----------------------------- snip ----------------------------
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 fg rgb:1234/5678/9abc

Maybe the fix is for GetColor to alloc the color.

Generated scripts for FvwmTalk, FvwmTile and FvwmCascade are not updated,
if the modules directory is changed by configure. FvwmTile and FvwmCascade
could be deleted, as the note in Makefile.am says, but if not, following
patch or something equivalent should be put in:

(Note that web form breaks line, so the patch is not clean.)

The old machine that hosts the FVWM CVS repository and mailing lists is
being decommissioned.  Thus I will be moving those services to a new
machine tonight.

The IP address of the CVS server will change from 129.7.3.5 to
129.7.128.13, but the name will remain as cvs.fvwm.org.  It will take time
for the DNS to catch up with the change, though, so you may have to
hardwire the IP for a time if you need to access the repository in the
interim.  The lists will still be reachable @fvwm.org as usual.  The old
addresses @hpc.uh.edu will be iffy for a while.

Once the DNS catches up, everything should be back to normal although (of
course) Murphy will always have his wrench ready to throw into the works.
I'm going to try and make this transition go as smoothly as possible.

I will be making this change at 8PM CST today.

It's 10:40 AM GMT+1 now:

  $ cvs -d :pserver:domivogt@129.7.128.13:/home/cvs/fvwm login
  (Logging in to domivogt@129.7.128.13)
  CVS password: 
  cvs [login aborted]: recv() from server 129.7.128.13: EOF

In other words: I can't reach CVS at the moment, even with an IP
address instead of the hostname.

Bye

I see the problem, but I can't fix it without CVS access.  In the
case statement below around line 900, remove the line

  tmp = tmp->next;

in the three cases and it will work again.

Setting ToggledActiveUp style for Title causes the title to use wrong style
(ActiveDown or ToggleActiveDown, didn't test/read code). Even though the
Title does not need Toggled styles, these are copied for buttons, so the
Toggled styles need not be specified for Stick/WindowsShade/Maximize
buttons separately (and three times).

@$^%$#%.  It looks like hosts.allow is stopping access even though it
shouldn't be.  Of course it works fine here.  I'll figure how to turn it
off.

Can you try again?

I think I've pretty well covered the FvwmButtons panel logic.
These are the remaining issues:

1. When I ask for an animation with 1 step, the window doesn't appear.

2. In test 3, I tried placing windows relative to the module.  One of
the 2 upper corner panels doesn't seem to be placed correctly.
I placed the one on the left at "Module top - window_width"
and the one on the right at "Module top + window_width".
One is near the module corner and the other isn't.

3. In test 3, the bottom row panels seem to first appear somewhere
inside the Module, then move to the edge and animate.  Sliding in
works fine.

I don't see this problem here.

I think this is correct. The panel appears indeed one panel
width right from the left side of the module window, just as you
requested.  I guess you wanted to specify "Module top +module
width" not "+window width".  The correct spec is

  Module top 100 0

That was actually a bug in fvwm's ConfigureReuquest handler.  If
an application called XMoveResizeWindow() but did not change the
x/y coordinates, only the size, fvwm treated this as if it had
simply called XResizeWindow().  This is not quite correct.  If
a window with SouthEast gravity is resized, , the top left corner
moves, but should not if the window was told with XMRW() to stay
in place.

I just noticed these comments in the test script:

  # Root right 0 50 put brl down a page in the middle. isn't that 100?
  # This goes to the bottom right.  why?
  FC '*FButt: (Panel(left,  '"$base"' Root right 0 0) brl "W brl")'

  # This ends up on the left bottom, -10p off screen, 20p up from the bottom
  FC '*FButt: (Panel(right, '"$base"' Root right -5p -100p) brr "W brr")'

The reason why this works unexpected is: for left/right sliding
direction, the left/right panel position is not legal, according
to the man page.  Only top/bottom are allowed.  However, the
parsing code simply treast top exactly the same as left and bottom
exactly the same as right.  Instead it should issue an error
message.

Jason, either you just made cvs so smart, its making changes on

Also the From address isn't right.

What address would be right?

Maybe the probem is that the To: and the Reply-To: don't match up.
The headers I get look like:

From: cvs@malifon.math.uh.edu
To: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
Reply-To: fvwm-workers@math.uh.edu

The problem I have is that if I reply to "all" using mh-e, I used to get:

To: fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu

Now I get:

To: fvwm-workers@math.uh.edu
cc: fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

Hmm.  I think something along the way is rewriting it.  The loginfo script
never even used the From: header I specified, so I've fixed that.  But I'm
specifying To and Reply-To identically.

That's bothersome.  It would be nice if your MUA just respected Reply-To:,

fix it.  It may take me a few commits to get it going.

Actually, I noticed more strange things: For the first style, the bug
exists, but not for the second similar style. Try following:

Emacs gets ActiveDown style for ActiveUp, but xterm does not.

(So the toggled styles are defined for title so that I do not have to
define the styles for every toggled button; see below.)

Still fails for me.

I just tried again.  When I click the button, I don't see anything.
I just moved a window over the area where the panel should be, I have
an area of the screen that doesn't refresh, parts of the window I moved
over the area are left behind.  I tried using rxvt instead of xterm,
same problem.

Hm.  Could you debug FvwmButtons?  I guess it's best to set a
breakpoint into the SlideWindow() function in libs/WinMagic.c
and then single step through the loop and see what happens.

This is a problem:

2000-02-04  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

	* FAQ:
	removed references to old GlobalOpts command

The GlobalOpts was present in the 2.2.x official releases.
It shouldn't have been removed.

I'm not quites sure what I did in this commit, but I think I
simply rewrote all examples using the GlobalOpts command to
reflect the new syntax.  Or is there something else you have
in mind?

The GlobalOpts command still exists, but using it is dicouraged
and generates some warning messages.

The FAQ has to be correct for all current releases.
Someone on comp.windows.x was asking why

Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

doesn't work for 2.2.4.  He pointed out that the FAQ on our web
site said it works for all releases later than 2.0.46.

I think the other references to GlobalOpts should have remained
but I haven't checked yet.


I know you asked for feedback on the ANNOUNCE file.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.  I sort of like the large
announcement.  It more accurately reflects the amount of work
that went into the release.

Should the FAQ reflect all past releases?  The problem is that
only the current FAQ is placed on the web pages, right?  Shouldn't
we instead put the FAQ for all supported stable releases and the
latest development release there?  This way we won't have to keep
track of the peculiarities of past releases.

No problem, that can wait.  Finishing the tests was more
important.  BTW, do you consider the FvwmButtons tests finished?

Dear FVWM experts,

I want to report a small thing I've noticed since some time, since when I
started using

Style FvwmPager      NeverFocus
Style FvwmButtons    NeverFocus

for my Buttons and Pager. As many others I'm using the Pager as a map to
move around from a desk/page to another one with just a mouse click of
button 1.

Now, under conditions that I've found I'm not able to reproduce, from time
to time the mouse click instead of telling the Pager to ask Fvwm to move
the current desk/page to the one I've selected, just pass 'through' the Pager
and goes to the root window, opening my root menu bounded to mouse button 1.

Sometimes this happens when I've many windows opened on the current desk.

After closing the root menu, the second click always works.

It looks like this happens only if I move the mouse over the Pager and
click, and not if I move the mouse over the Pager, wait a bit and then
click.

I've seen this both on my Linux (RH 7.0++, XFree 4.0.2a) and on Digital
True64, using always the latest version from CVS.

Please let me know if you need more informations.

Thanks a lot for the great work.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hello,

When you select an item in FvwmScript List the colors of this item
is changed:
- before my previous commit the background is changed to the shadow
  color and it seems that some times (depending on the colors and on the
  hardware) the result is that you more or less do not see anymore the text.
- I've changed the above by using the hilight colors in the place of the 
  shadow one and this seems very better.
- An other possibility is to invert the bg and fg colors, but the result is
   less pretty. Maybe it will be more prudent to use this solution
   (an avantage of the 2 previous solutions is that we can configure
    this color change).
     
So, the question is which solutions to use?
If one want to test between the two above solutions just go to Windget/List.c
and comment/uncomment the lines 159-165/168-173

Olivier

Here is a list of known remaining SM problems.
I think some of them are features, they are not critical for 2.4.0.
But the ones marked by '-' at the end could probably be fixed.
Tell me if you want me to explain/investigate something more deeply.

* SaveSession/QuitSession don't work in xsm, I don't know what to do.
Works satisfactory with gnome-session. It is documented in the man page.

* There is an old known problem with swallowed windows, they multiply
on every start. The solution is not to use swallowing button bars,
or, maybe, to use session aware programs (xload and xclock are not)
and mark them "Restart never" if possible.

Teoretically using Swallow(UseOld,NoClose) should help, but it does not
(probably because FvwmButtons starts before old xload/xclock).
It even produces walking windows before reswalowing on restart,
see other entries. They appear for 5 seconds and then are swallowed.

I thought about a new Swallow(AllowOnlyOne) option especially for SM,
which kills all application instances except for one.

* Some freeze of 5 seconds on Restart with some configurations, supposedly
with Swallow(UseOld,NoClose). I didn't have time to investigate this.

* I can't find whether it is possible to define application priorities in
xsm. GNOME deskguide_applet is started before fvwm, so it pop ups a window
"No GNOME compliant WM" every time. There are priorities in gnome-session.

* xsm sometimes exits with no core when clicking on "Client List".
This sometimes is autosolved, but sometimes is not. The solution is
to delete this session and start a new one... I can't debug xsm.

* If a new FVWM crashes while restarting in SM, a session manager will
try to start FVWM forever. FVWM itself asks for this. Probably there is
nothing to do about this.

* If state file is not used on Restart (because version don't match or
not found), windows without -geometry walk. On fvwm's Quit the client
windows remain in the same positions, not in the frame possitions.
I would like to know why is it.

- All windows on the not current desks become iconic after Restart.
Seems that I can reproduce this consistently with xsm.

- I can still get incorrect IS_NAME_CHANGED 0 when saving a window state.
The debug output on the matching time is:

        win(xterm, XTerm, xterm, 0)
[0]     mat(xterm, XTerm, migo@sparta, 0)

when it should be:

        win(xterm, XTerm, xterm, 0)
[1]     mat(xterm, XTerm, migo@sparta, 1)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Swapping the background and foreground is safe, you can be guaranteed
that the colors will contrast.

The other option is to make the colors for selected lines configurable.

I don't think anyone would want to read thru more than one FAQ.

I think the tests are complete.  They don't test all of FvwmButtons,
just the Panel feature.

I just have to look into the "steps 1" issue.

Well, I thought people would read the FAQ that belongs to the the
version they are using.  The GlobalOpts issue isn't hard to fix,
but what about the hints in section 7?  It contains long config
examples that may become obsolete over time.  Won't keeping
different examples for multiple versions bloat the FAQ
unnecessarily?

And what about solutions that only work for a specific version or
later, like the IgnoreModifiers command?

    BTW, I have a similar problem with Fvwm 2.3.28 under XFree86 3.x: when
using the mouse-zoom feature of xdvi, when clicking very fast the second
click often pops up a root-window menu.

    To reproduce: run xdvi with some file (assuming RedHat 6.x:
"xdvi /usr/share/texmf/doc/amstex/amsguide.dvi" will do), and double click
the 3rd button very fast.  At some moment, probably when zoom window is
going to be popped down but hadn't yet, the mouse event reaches the root
window and pops up a 3rd button menu.

    What is strange is that the click happens over the xdvi window itself,
and it should go there, not to the root.

    1st and 2nd buttons zoom should probably also have this effect, but
don't -- maybe because those windows are very small and human simply can't
click fast enough even on a Pentium166 (strange, since 3rd button has this
effect even on PIII-800).  If memory serves me right, this bug (?) existed
way back in Fvwm 1.24 under XFree 2.x, and on my old 486DX2/66 1st and 2nd
buttons also had it.

    The thing doesn't happen under XFree86 4.0.2, but 4.x has much better
speed/scheduling characteristics anyway.

This works perfectly for me.

This looks correct to me. You probably wanted to place the top
right panel at "Module left + Module width" not at
"Module left + Window width".  The calculations always seem to be

matches the documentation?

I'll fix that one.

4. In the first test, the panel of the top right button has no
fvwm window decorations for me.

I prefer the current fix, not inverse colors. I think we may postpone this
problem and add a new "selected item" colorset support in FvwmScript later.

Hmm, any hints on what to look for?

I see it go thru SlideWindow and it calls

XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, x, y, g_w, g_h);
XMapWindow(dpy, win);
XMapSubwindows(dpy, win);
XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, x, y, w, h);

In that order.

The geometry args look OK on the MoveResize calls.

And the window still does not appear?  What happens if you add an
XSynchronize() call?

Can you see the window in the output of "xwininfo -root -tree"?

Is the HandleMapRequest() function in events.c ever called?

It might help to run fvwm in an XNest or on a second X server and
single step it in a second debugger.

I belive I fixed all of these.  I am sure about the xdvi thing and
I think FvwmPager and FvwmButtons suffer from the same problem,
but I can't make it happen here.  Can you please try again with
tomorrow's snapshot or current CVS code?

BTW, you can increase the probability of the xdvi problem happening
by giving your X server something to do.  Open a big xterm window
and type "while true; do ls; done" into the shell.  If necessary
create more windows doing the same.

Unfortunately I can't confirm any of this.  I tried this by
reading in the the configs you sent with "read" from a file in a
running session with my normal config and with an empty config and
it does not happen here.

I see.  I have made some patches that may or may not affect this
problem and added some debug output to the sources.  Please
download tomorrow's snapshot and see if the problem goes away.
FvwmButtons will generate some outpout on the console (all lines
beginnig with +++).  If the problem persists, plese send me this
output.

Since we got no reply to this, perhaps someone else can tell me
where to find this 'gimp plugin config window'.

Right, no window appears.

The same thing happens.  After I added that, I could then see
that the indicator seems to be redrawn twice after an animation.

Yes.  In fact, if I click on the area of the screen where the window
is supposed to be, xwininfo prints the information for the window.

Yes it is.

I can single step it but it seems to do everything right except
make the window visible.  Right now, I'm only able to try this
with Exceed.  Perhaps fvwm isn't doing anything wrong, it might
be some kind of server thing.

I don't really see how the logic for one step is much different
than the logic for 2 steps.

> Okay, I've tried using the latest beta and the problem persists.  Obviously since you don't have an NCD terminal you won't be able to reproduce the exact problem I had.  However, I found another situation that causes problems.  I modified by .tcshrc so that when tcsh is run in an xterm from my .xsession, it starts VNC automatically.  I found that, sometimes, I'd have VNC not respond to input at all after this startup, and this occured when the xterm had been raised over the top of my vncviewer.  This seemed to happen because of some timing issues with fvwm starting after the vncviewer had gone full-screen.  I basically put a "sleep 1" before calling vncviewer so that fvwm has started up before I start it and that fixed it.  The reason I mention this is that it might be a way for you to reproduce the problem without having to have an NCD terminal :)
> 
> I do wonder if there are other ways of screwing this up, though - maybe if I just make an xterm come up over the top of the vncviewer it'll screw up the session.  I'll try this and get back to you, as it'd be much easier for you than logging in and out.  I can't do this unless I'm at work (and I can't send you my .fvwm2rc either).

There is another way to make that happen.  Actually, all one has
to do is to take away the keyboard focus from the fullscreen vnc
window (which is an override redirect window which means that the
window manager knows nothing about it).  Fvwm will never give the
keyvboard focus to an override redirect window, so you are stuck
with the full screen vnc window without the input focus.

For example:

1) Use this in your fvwm config on the original server:

    Style * ClickToFocus
    Module FvwmCommandS

2) Open any window on the original server.

3) Start the vnc server.

4) Start the vncviewer in full screen mode on the vnc server.

5) Open a shell window in the vnc session.

6) Type this into the shell:

     export DISPLAY=<display>; FvwmCommand "next focus"

   (where display is the value of the DISPLAY variable on the
   original X server).

This will give the focus to a window on the original X server and
leave the vnc session stranded without keyboard input.

--

I don't see a clean way to cope with this situation inside fvwm.
Vnc explicitly requests that a long term window (its "root"
window) has the override redirect attribute which means that the
window manager basically does not know about it.  First of all,
this is a violation of the ICCCM2 specifications which demand
that only short lived windows use override redirect.  Next, vnc
does not grab the X server as it should do if it expects
continuous input from the X server.  For example, a message
window on the underlying X server might pop up and take away the
focus from vnc.  There are even applications that take the focus
on their own, even without a window manager.

This is really a bug in vnc that may show up depending on the
configuration on the underlying window manager and the running
applications.  The right fix would be to grab the X server for vnc
as soon as it enters full screen mode by calling XGrabServer().

Window managers are not supposed to manage override redirect
windows and doing so would be very hard.  Even if fvwm would
remember from which override redirect window it had taken the
focus, it would have no indication if the window still existed at
the moment fvwm tried to return the focus.  Well, it could check
the window id, but the window might already have died and been
replaced with a new window with the same id.

Please report this bug to the vnc developers.

The

  *FvwmPagerSolidSeparators

resource tells the pager to use solid page separators.  If you
remove that line from your config file, the separators are dashed,
but they will still be buried below windows.

That looks as if the libs directory was not properly built.

The deocors' contents are the same, and it still happens only for
xterms and not for other windows?  That is odd.  Are you
absolutely sure that everything was built, installed and started
correctly?  Such weirdness usually indicates that parts of fvwm do
not fit together - e.g. fvwm was linked with an outdated fvwmlib.
I can't think of anything else that explains why the ActiveDown
style could be used.  According to the code it will never be used
without a button press.

I have added a debug statement to borders.c at line 400.  If the
problem persists after a fresh checkout and rebuild, pay attention
to the output it generates.  As far as I understood, the buggy
windows get ActiveDown style as soon as the pointer enters the
window.  If the ActiveDown style is really used, the debug
statement would generate some output at this moment.

The fvwm24_convert script does not handle the new placement style
names yet.  Also, some of the GlobalOpts options are not
converted.  The conversion tables are in the man page, but
implementing them will be tricky because there is no one to one
mapping between the new styles/globalopts.

I'd do this myself, but I have never written a perl script.

Bye

Which commands are you referring to?
It looks like we have SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, etc.

I thought I got them all, which options do you mean?

Note that options that didn't change name like
WindowShadeShrinks, just get converted without being explicitly listed
in the script.

I'm still at the beginner stage, I use the man pages
quite a bit as I write.  I'd say its certainly worth learning.
I find that I get to a certain point with sed, awk, or sh and it becomes
clear that something better is needed.  Perl usually does the job.

The first hint I have is never try to understand that bootstrap
stuff you sometimes find at the top of the file.

  Style ... MinOverlapPlacement
  Style ... ManualPlacement
  Style ... TileManualPlacement

and so on.  Here is the conversion table from the man page:

  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart
  Style * SmartPlacement

I'm not sure how we can possibly convert from mutliple old style
names into a single new style name without building the whole
syntax of the file into the script.  The problem is that the
styles may appear on separate lines or even in functions, or
menus that define functions that define menus that define
functions and so on.

Ah, okay, I missed that point.  But still, some options are
converted incorrectly to the old style names, e.g.

  GlobalOpts ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

is converted to

  Style * ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

but should be converted to

  Style * ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

Ah, with zsh I rarely see a need for a more complex language.
It's so powerful! :-)

Actually, now it uses black/black for instead of ActiveUp. Black was
used this morning, too, but not earlier this week.

Here's debug output (when pressed):

// active down usedpw = 0x01000042, w = 0x01000042, has_focus = 1, toggled = 0

For another window (with correct title decoration):

// active down usedpw = 0x0100004e, w = 0x0100004e, has_focus = 1, toggled = 0

It seems that the ActiveDown style is not actually used.  Perhaps
there is some memory corruption going on?  Do you have a memory
debugger like insure or purify handy to check this?  If not, could
you try efence or dmalloc instead (configure with --enable-efence
or --enable-dmalloc)?

Yes, but not today. I have already coded whole day.

Unfortunately I'm rather busy next week, so I cannot promise any date.

I don't see anything like this is 2.2.5.

The conversion script is primarily for users moving from a 2.2.x official
release to a 2.4.x official release.  Users using beta releases are
supposed to be able to handle the changes themselves.

> and so on.  Here is the conversion table from the man page:

This one seems to be handled.  It doesn't check for SmartPlacement,
but it does do the conversion of SmartPlacementIsReallySmart.

>   Global SmartPlacementIsNormal
>   Style * SmartPlacement
> becomes
>   Style * SmartPlacement, CleverPlacementOff

Theres another place in the man page where is shows:

GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsNormal
  -->
Style * TileCascadePlacement

The script converts it to SmartPlacement, so the man page
must have shown that at one time.

The script was written by copying the man page into the script
and making changes.

Oh, I see now, first the GlobalOpts are shown as being converted
to Styles, and now some of the placement styles are changed too.

I changed it to convert SmartPlacementIsNormal to TileCascadePlacement.

I could set up something that attempted to
recognize back to back commands, and only write out the
the new command when something else intervened, but I think
some of the stuff you are concerned with appeared during betas.
I don't think we have to worry about that stuff.

Hm, the log looks good.  What is the exact size of the buttons
that contain the applications with the wrong size (in pixels)?
And please post the output of "xwininfo -tree" (click on the
button bar).

Bye

The container is 70x20, the size of xapm and xload seems to be
68x18 in fvwm2-2.3.25.

Here is this output both for the ok 2.3.25 version and for the broken

Please note that the 1 child of both xload and xapm has a different size than 
their parents in the broken version. In 2.3.25 the sizes are the same. The 
difference in size seems to be consistent with what I actually see on the 
screen.

Hi !

after my morning CVS update, fvwm2 crashes on my Alpha.

Using gdb and -debug I have:

[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> Module switch 1, about to exec: '# BUTTON
Setup'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> Module switch 1, about to exec: '#'
[FVWM][ReadSubFunc]: <<DEBUG>> Module switch 1, about to exec: ''

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Error accessing memory address 0x11fffdbd0: No such file or directory.
(gdb)

Commenting out all the ButtonStyle(s) avoids the crash.

I don't have problems on Linux (where I have the same ButtonStyle(s)).

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hello,

  this is not a solution but a light correction to the name of the OS: it's
Tru64, and not True64 (there's no 'e') (but it's not because it's not a true
64bits OS ;))

  Cheers,

	Jeremie

Interesting.  The applications seem to somehow miss that they are
resized by FvwmButtons.  Perhaps more waiting, flushing X queues
and XSync'ing will help.

I've made another small patch that may help.

Hm, gcc did not detect a syntax error in this definition:

  static char *button_states[BS_MaxButtonState] =
  {
    "ActiveUp",
    "ActiveDown",
    "Inactive",
    "ToggledActiveUp",
    "ToggledActiveDown",
    "ToggledInactive",      <-- note the excess comma
  };

There should have been another NULL element in the array.  Anyway,
the core dump is fixed.

Bye

FWIW, that's not a syntax error; it's legal to have a trailing comma.

There would be a NULL entry if BS_MaxButtonState allowed for it.

enum ButtonState
{
  BS_All = -1,
  BS_ActiveUp,
  BS_ActiveDown,
  BS_Inactive,
  BS_ToggledActiveUp,
  BS_ToggledActiveDown,
  BS_ToggledInactive,

Couldn't this be done as an option to the command, or is it
too difficult to find the pid of xsm?

Hm, where is the problem?  Will this happen too if you put

into your config file?

That sounds like one of these obnoxious pointer grabbing issues.
Could you give me some instructions how to set up xsm and a config
file that shows the problem?

Doh.  I wouldn't spend much time into this but rather document it
as a known problem.

Hm.

We could compare the file's read time vs it's modification time
and delete the file if these differ.  Of course this opens a new
can of worms, but xsm will at least not loop forever.

Can you give me a hint how this can happen?  I vaguely remember
hacking up some test for this, but I don't know what exactly has
to happen to trigger that.

That's because the ICCCM2 demands that clients with unmapped
frames are unmapped too.  It explicitly states that these windows
look as if they were iconified to the application.  Perhaps it
would be better to back out these patches since nobody seems to
take this part of the ICCCM2 seriously.  There is a related
problem with some applications thinking they have been iconified
when they are unmapped because of a desk switch.

How?  Is there any reliable way to cause this?  Try to add a debug
message at all places where this flag is set.

Hm.  The test uses xterms, so pressing ctrl-button1 on the place
where the window is supposed to be may bring up an xterm menu.
Does fvwm ever get a MapNotify event on the window?  I.e. is the
frame window ever mapped?

So, what happens if you add usleeps and XSync's everywhere in this
code:

      XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, x, y, g_w, g_h);
      if (!is_mapped)
      {
	XMapWindow(dpy, win);
	XMapSubwindows(dpy, win);
	is_mapped = True;
      }

E.g.:

      XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, x, y, g_w, g_h);
      if (steps == 1) {
        XSync(dpy, 0);
        usleep(100000);
      }
      if (!is_mapped)
      {
	XMapWindow(dpy, win);
	XMapSubwindows(dpy, win);
        if (steps == 1) {
          XSync(dpy, 0);
          usleep(500000);
        }
	is_mapped = True;
      }
      if (steps == 1) {
        XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, win, x, y, g_w, g_h);
        XSync(dpy, 0);
      }

Does this or a subset of this help?

Bye

It doesn't.

As best I can tell, yes.  Since I can't use Xnest, I'm using
Exceed telnet to run gdb.  Since I only have one pointer, moving
the pointer into the telnet window causes map notifies for an override
redirect window, but I also see it get a MapNotify event and do:

  XMapSubwindows(dpy, Tmp_win->frame);
  XMapSubwindows(dpy, Tmp_win->decor_w);

When I click on the arrow.

No.

I used FvwmCommand to issue a Recapture and the window appeared.

I read about XMapWindow and XMapSubWindow and it seemed like using
both was overkill so I took out the XMapWindow.  It didn't fix
the problem, but the other slide out panels worked fine.
Maybe the XMapWindow should be removed.

I did a RecaptureWindow from FvwmCommand and clicked in the center of
the area where the window should be and I noticed something funny.
First the xterm window appeared and then the Fvwm frame appeared.
The odd thing is, my xterm backgrounds are black, and I noticed a
yellow border around the window.  I remembered seeing that with twm
so I looked in my x resources and sure enough, I have:

XTerm*BorderColor:	yellow
XTerm*borderColor:	yellow

Is it correct for Fvwm to be covering up the xterm border?

My XMapWindow man page says:

     If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for
     it are remembered, the X server tiles the window with its
     background.

(This sounds like whats happening.)

     If the window's background is undefined, the
     existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
     generates zero or more Expose events.  If backing-store was
     maintained while the window was unmapped, no Expose events
     are generated.  If backing-store will now be maintained, a
     full-window exposure is always generated.  Otherwise, only
     visible regions may be reported.  Similar tiling and expo-
     sure take place for any newly viewable inferiors.

     If the window is an InputOutput window, XMapWindow generates
     Expose events on each InputOutput window that it causes to
     be displayed.  If the client maps and paints the window and
     if the client begins processing events, the window is
     painted twice.  To avoid this, first ask for Expose events
     and then map the window, so the client processes input
     events as usual.  The event list will include Expose for
     each window that has appeared on the screen. The client's
     normal response to an Expose event should be to repaint the
     window.  This method usually leads to simpler programs and
     to proper interaction with window managers.

I don't understand how to ask for expose events before we map
the window.

So fvwm has properly swallowed and mapped the window, but did not
get any Expose events or the server ignored any drawing requests.
There are several ways to try to force a redraw:

 - Move another window across it (with "Style * backingstoreoff").

 - Give it Focus via FvwmCommand:

     next (bd) Focus

 - Refresh the window with the RefreshWindow command.

Hm.  The man page does not state that XMapSubwindows() will map
the parent window too:

       The XMapSubwindows function maps all subwindows for a
       specified window in top-to-bottom stacking order.  The X
       server generates Expose events on each newly displayed
       window.  This may be much more efficient than mapping many
       windows one at a time because the server needs to perform
       much of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather
       than for each window.

When fvwm captures a window it sets the window's border width to
zero because it provides its own border.  This is pretty standard
among window managers.

You can't.  In my eyes that's one major shortcomings of X.  You
can't reliably draw into unviewable windows either.

Yes, I wrote this, it would be nice if someone confirm the xsm part.

I don't know how to find the pid of xsm even if it runs locally.

There is a code that parses session manager pid from $SESSION_MANAGER,
which looks like "local/sparta:/tmp/.ICE-unix/2725,tcp/sparta:1050";
the pid is 2725. But sending signals may only work if xsm and fvwm are
run on the same machine by the same user. I may only imagine what happens
if they are run on different machines and how $SESSION_MANAGER looks.

It does not matter what fvwm does. xsm will start xclock/xload just
because they were running when a session was previously saved. So, if
FvwmButtons is started first there will be 2 (then 3) xclocks/xloads.

My suggested Swallow(AllowOnlyOne) only closes all other instances of
xclock/xload, but does not solve the problem that they are started twice
(once by FvwmButtons and once by xsm).

Please ignore this problem.

I tested using my old config and using fvwm-themes. I noticed that it runs
with fvwm-themes much better. By examining my old config I have found:

  *FvwmThemeColorset 15 YGradient 2400 2 blue 50 green 50 blue

Since fvwm and FvwmThemes behave as on process there is a freeze here.

----

As for setting up xsm, just run it instead of fvwm in .xinitrc.
It is also suggested to export SESSION_MANAGER_NAME=xsm to enable fvwm
workaround of xsm bug (I don't know about a better way to detect xsm).

Also I suggest to create ~/.xsmstartup with 2 lines, smproxy and
exec xterm (or exec fvwm2 -f myrc). I didn't test without smproxy running.

After you start xsm, choose "Fail Safe" start, open any applications you
want, don't forget fvwm, then press "Checkpoint", and name your session.

This really makes xsm useless (at least my version from XFree86-4.0.1).

No, deleting state file will not help. xsm starts fvwm, not other way.
So if fvwm crushes before it changes its "(re)start in SM" info using XSMP
there is nothing to be done here, it will be restarted forever.
This is only a theotetical problem. The solution is to fix all crashes. :)

You may set a different static version in get_version_string() or
uncomment the previous automatic version string. Then restart to a new
fvwm with a new version string.

Ok.  I should say this is very inconvenient.
I don't really understand the mechanism, but can fvwm store a flag about
such windows and then remap them on the next start/match?

This is probably a feature after all.

The problem is that fvwm and xterm are started asynchronously, so there
are 4 cases of what fvwm sees about xterm in two runs.

Here is how it usually happens. xterm starts for the first time, it
changes its name, then fvwm is started, say for the first time. This
explains IS_NAME_CHANGED 0. Then the session is saved. On the next start
fvwm does not match this xterm entry as shown above. But now fvwm does
detect a name change and if the session is saved again, there is a hope
that for the next start fvwm will start first and xterm will match.

I withdraw this problem, since I don't see how it can be fixed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, I'm more fond of removing that whole logic altogether.
I don't like the idea of preserving more information about iconic
state over restarts because the code already fails in some
situations.

The condition in the code looks like this:

  IS_NAME_CHANGED(w) || IS_NAME_CHANGED(m) || xstreq(...)

Wouldn't this be better:

  IS_NAME_CHANGED(w) || (IS_NAME_CHANGED(m) && !IS_NAME_CHANGED(w)) || xstreq(...)

Furthermore it might be good not to set the flag in events.c if
the name did not really change when a XA_WM_NAME property notify
arrives.

These two lines look the same to me, are you sure it's what you meant?

No, what I wanted to say was that if both, m and w have the flag
set, the condition should be false, i.e.

  IS_NAME_CHANGED(w) != IS_NAME_CHANGED(m) || xstreq(...)

Depends on the reason the window changed name, if name is changed from
the $prompt shell's variable, it is better to ignore a name completely,
because it may be random. This new condition matches in even less cases
than the current one, so it will not really help with the problem above.

This is not related to my case, but I think that setting the flag is good,
so if fvwm did not get the first name change it will set it on the second.

I think the current meaning of IS_NAME_CHANGED is "application changes its
name, so we don't rely on it on matching".

Mikhael.

Fixed.  I hope that switching to desk 0, page 0 0 does not hurt
before restarting with xsm.

Ah, I misinterpreted that.  I thought the flag was set too often.
SOmehow I was thinking this was about the IS_ICON_MOVED flag.

Yes, you are right.  I'm not eager about writing any code for that
anyway.  Not with the I18N patch looking like it does right now.

Full_Name: Dmitry Bolkhovityanov
Version: 2.3.28
CVS_Date: 
OS: Linux RH6.1, 2.2.12
X_Server: XFree86 4.0.2
Submission from: (NULL) (140.221.9.192)


FvwmIdent abnormally terminates if after pressing Button2 ("reask
for a window") is pointed to itself, with "BadWindow" error and
ResourceID=<FvwmIdent's window ID>.  Probably it destroys its window
first and than tries to get info for it.

Haven't tried latest CVS yet, but last notion of FvwmIdent in ChangeLog
is 2000-05-01, so this probably doesn't matter.

You should search in ./modules/ChangeLog, not ./ChangeLog. :-)

It would be nice if the script detected the old FvwmButtons panel
syntax and printed a message that points to the section about
converting the config in the FvwmButtons man page.

I disabled said patches, so this problem should go away.  I did
not test it yet, though.

The only way I can see to detect them would be to look for:

/^[*]FvwmButtonsPanel /

But with aliases, this becomes:

/^[*]*Panel /

so I guess it could issue a warning.  What do you think?

I don't know the way you write regexps in perl, but I think this
would be the correct one:

  ^[[:space:]]*[*].*[pP][aA][nN][eE][lL]

(Are spaces before the asterisk allowed?)

That must suffice.  We can't hope to convert the config
automatically anyway.

No, no space is allowed.  Line 942, functions.c.

This makes more sense:

/^[*]\S+PANEL /i

the i after // is for case insensitive.
the // is for matching.
then * in col 1
\S is non-whitespace
+ is one or more
then "panel" in any case, followed by a space.


Ok, I admit it, I did "man perlre".

Actually, spaces *are* allowed.  Try it out:

  " *FvwmIdentFont 5x7"

works.  Don't try to understand the code :-)

              ^^^

A space is not required here.  You could image something like

  *FvwmButtons(Title foo, Panel"" foo)
                               ^^

That would make it

  /^\s*[*]\S+PANEL/i

I'll commit that change.

Since this is so common a problem, shouldn't it be described in
the FAQ?

I think a quote there is unlikely, but:

   /^\s*[*]\S+PANEL[ \t"']i

would cover it.

This is still broken in tha latest snapshots. The man page states:

Pressing  mouse  button 2 in the window restarts FvwmIdent and asks for
a new window to select.

which implies to me that the FvwmIdent window should go away while the
user picks another window. If anyone is going to fix this then could
they also make FvwmIdent change it's layer to the same layer as the
target window if the target window layer is higher than the FvwmIdent
window layer? This is to prevent FvwmIdnet windows being invisible.

Cheers,
Tim.

You could have a line like this:

  *FvwmButtons(3x1+18+0, Padding 2, \
    Panel(smooth, indicator 15) foo "exec foo")

The FvwmButtons test with 1 step works fine at work.
Its either the Exceed X server or my slow connection that causes
the problem.  Since this doesn't appear to be an fvwm problem, I think
we can consider the issue closed.

Maybe I don't understand, isn't that a new style panel definition?

I already commited a patch yesterday.  It probably did not make it
into the snapshot you got.

Done.  But the FvwmIdent Window jump multiple times above and
below the target window since there is no way to specify that
the window is created on the proper layer.

Yes, the example is wrong, but it's the same for the old syntax:

*FvwmButtons(Title Tools, \
  Panel Tools)

Maybe.  I wouldn't discuss this problem in such detail if there
had not been other reports that redraws of certain window areas
were missing under obscure circumstances.  I'd at least like to
know the cause of the problem.  If all else fails, we could still
send a synthetic Expose event to the applications (given that it
solves the problem).

This is broken recently. Consider this minimal rc file:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximize
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximize
+ M Beep  # originally: Nop
+ H Maximize 0 95
+ C Maximize 100 95
+ D Maximize 100 100

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeVertically
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeVertically
+ H Maximize 0 100
+ M Maximize 0 100
+ C Maximize 0 100

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeHorizontally
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeHorizontally
+ H Maximize 100 0
+ M Maximize 100 0
+ C Maximize 100 0

Mouse 1  4  A  FuncFvwmMaximize
Mouse 2  4  A  FuncFvwmMaximizeVertically
Mouse 3  4  A  FuncFvwmMaximizeHorizontally
# ====================================================================

"H" does not work for Mouse 1 and Mouse 2, but works for Mouse 3.
"C" does not work for Mouse 2.
These cases are ignored. Other cases work.

One more problem:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmIconifySameResource
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmIconifySameResource
+ I All ($r) Iconify $0

Mouse 2  6  A  FuncFvwmIconifySameResource on
# ====================================================================

This works (immediately on press), but a mouse release is passed to an
application below, causing (in this case) a clipboard text to be copied to
other window.

Regards,
Mikhael.

No, it's the parsing that is broken, not complex functions.  I did
not realise that '0' and '1' can not be used as toggle arguments
because they are numbers and will break the parsing patterns for
maximize and probably other commands too.

    Hi!

    When one tries to click on an "override redirect" window (such as
a tooltip), the click goes to the root window, and usually Fvwm's menu pops
up.

    Is this a desired behaviour (i.e, is it dictated by ICCCM)?

    This is kinda xfig bug -- not dangerous, but a bit annoying (or funny :).
While it is not that simple to click a tooltip window (at least without a
sleep 5; kill -STOP %1), I've met it with xmms -- pressing the playlist
[Add|dir] button in some strange place (like big/slow/etc. dir), when xmms
stalls for a while, does the thing.

P.S. This is with 2.3.28.

I have looked into converting placement styles, but I think we
should simply ignore this.  It's almost impossible to do
correctly, and since the old syntax still works, let's rather
print a message so that the user can convert it manually.  I
already coded this.

I think the only fail safe way to detect panel lines is this:

  /PANEL/i

not

  /^\s*[*]\S+PANEL/i

since otherwise we'd have to deal with backslashed newlines.
(also committed).

Bye

I spell checked, reformatted and sorted the announcement (with my
British ispell dictionary :-) ).  I like Dan's idea to leave the
whole list of changes in the announcement, so the full list of
changes is now at the end of the file.  From my point of view it's
ready for the release now.  Perhaps someone could scan through the
change lists to see if some changes should be removed from or
added to the lists of important changes at the front of the file.

Bye

I made some changes.

I didn't know you enabled recursive menus, but a test
shows that they work.  Thats this item, which I will reword:

Menus can be visible multiple times at once.

The only problem is the man page still says this:

        A menu  can  be  open
        only  once,  so  a  menu may not use itself or any of its
        predecessors as a sub-menu.

Am I missing something?


I see we removed  the FvwmConfig module, I added  FvwmPipe to the list
of removed modules.  The conversion script should warn about them.

You are right, this paragraph in the man page has to be changed.

Done.

I also added some logic to fvwm24_convert that collects
continuation lines in a buffer before looking for stuff that has
to be converted.  The drawback is that if something in a continued
line is replaced, the new line is printed as a single line.

Theres a typo "$silngle_lines" that causes bad output, but
I also get lots of extra blank lines in output.

But more important, I don't think this is a good idea.
I don't like to backslash my lines so I don't have too many,
but I dislike long lines even more.

I think the issue with "PANEL" is minor.  I'd rather over report
the problem than mess up the users config file.

Is it OK if I remove this?


Back in 2.2.x my placement options were:

  Style "*" ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement

and I've never changed them, but the script is telling me I have
to.  If there is a difference, it must be subtle, because I don't
notice it.  Is the script being too conservative?

Both fixed.

I wrote that because the conversion fails whenever the expected
command and its parameters are on different lines.  I thought it
was better to have long lines than having the script screw up the
config file.  Lines with backslashes are fairly common in
FvwmButtons configurations.  Also, there are many places in the
man pages where backslashes are use for readability.  Some of
these examples could not be converted otherwise.  Remember that
this only happens for lines that were changes.  All othe lines
are not touched.  I can't think of a proper way to handle
continued lines other than this.

Hm.  I'd rather try to hack some code to reduce the chance of
removig backslashes.  Perhaps the script could simply run twice:
During the first pass it would not touch backslashes.  This will
convert most occurances of outdated config commands.  In the
second pass it would merge continuation lines and make the changes
for the merged lines only.

All that has to be done is to make a function from the main
parsing loop that takes a parameter that tells it if it has to
merge continuation lines or not.  And the output of the first
pass has to be redirected to be the input of the second pass.
Furthermore it does not make much sense to print warnings twice,
so they could be disabeld for the first pass.

Dan, could you try to write this, please?  I don't have any
documentation about perl except man and info pages.

The idea is to remove these options in the future.  It's the same
as with the GolbalOpts command.  They are still supported, but
using them ist discouraged.

I looked at the xsm source code and it does indeed look as if xsm
does not implement that functionality (although my knowledge about
session management is verly limited).

I guess FvwmButtons has to communicate with the session manager
that these windows need not be restarted.  But let's postpone this
until after the 2.4 release.  BTW, xsm seems to restart my
xosview with the wrong command line options.  When I start it, I
only get the load, memory and paging meter, but when xsm restarts
it it gets the full set of meters :-P

You can enter "Client List" to see which xosview command line arguments
are used. I didn't get problems with preserving command lines. I run
smproxy.

Forget it, I managed to write it myself.  It's ugly, but it works.
I had to call the new sub function with global parameters because
I was unable to figure out how to use function parameters.  Feel
free to clean that up.

I obviously can't keep up with you.

The secret  to parm passing is that  the parms are in  @_, so it looks
like:

&my_sub("data", 123);

sub my_sub {
  local($data, $number) = @_;
  print "Passed data: " . $data . " number: " . $number;
}

I have menus that use

Style * UseDecor decorname

to change  the   borderstyle, titlestyle  and buttonstyle.

This used to work but doesn't now.

The logic around line 428 in add_window.c is the culprit.
I can see that the

  if (tmp_win->decor == NULL)

was added sometime between 2.3.25 and now.

Efence did not complain anything, but strange effects were noticed in
AllocLinearGradient, when it is called for the first time:
XAllocColor returns empty colors (but not 0 nor BadColor).

256         if (!XAllocColor(Pdpy, Pcmap, &c))
(gdb) n
254         c.green = (unsigned short)(g + (i * dg + 0.5));
(gdb) p c
$36 = {pixel = 0, red = 0, green = 0, blue = 0, flags = 7 '\a', pad = 0 '\000'}

dr changes to infinite.

The ChangeLog entry belonging to this patch:

  2001-02-02  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>
  
      * fvwm/add_window.c (setup_style_and_decor):
      only update the decor if none is selected yet

I can't remember the reason for that patch and it looks pretty
useless to me.  Perhaps Mikhael can remember some deatails about
this.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Here is a list of non-critical problems.

1) With SloppyFocus - focus a window, go to other page, popup a menu,
close it, the window on other page is not focused any more.

2) Previously, if ActiveDown of TitleStyle was not defined, the pixmap
defined in ActiveUp was used for ActiveDown too. Now it is not the case,
so some old configs may be broken. I suppose there is a reason for this,
if no, I think the previous (good) behaviour may be restored.

3) Shade a window, move it using Mouse 2 in the pager. Result: the window
is not actually moved on the destop, but it disappears in the pager.

4) Shade a window.
With TitleAtTop, Resize works well, starts with the current full size.
With TitleAtBottom, Resize starts (only) with incorrect y size, ignoring
any hints.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hm, I simply consider this a bug in previous versions since other
parts of the ActiveUp style have not been reused for ActiveDown.
The pixmap was simply set as the background pixmap of the button
and obviously not deleted properly for the ActiveDown style.  I'd
rather not start keeping bugs because it might affect broken
configs.

I can confirm the other three problems.

Further investigation suggests that this had something to do with
changes of the title height in decors.

    Sorry if it was already discussed, but shouldn't
resizing/zooming/scrollbaring a shaded window be forbidden, as it was back

Do you mean after your fix?

Hm.

  if (npixels < 1)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, "AllocLinearGradient: Invalid number of pixels: %d\n",
            npixels);
    return NULL;
  }
  ...
  div = (npixels == 1) ? 1 : npixels - 1;
  ...
  dr = (float)(to.red - from.red) / (float)div;

So, I don't see how dr can become infinity if to.red and from.red
are properly set.  On the other hand:

  if (!s_from || !XParseColor(Pdpy, Pcmap, s_from, &from))
    return NULL;
  if (!s_to || !XParseColor(Pdpy, Pcmap, s_to, &to))
    return NULL;

So if either to or from are not set correctly, then the
XParseColor() function is broken (?)  Can you provide more verbose
debug output?  What are the contents of the parameters?  If
the input values are correct, there must be a line in the function
at which things start to go wrong.

BTW, please post your config file, perhaps it helps to reproduce
this.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

If so, could you repeat whatever tests you did regarding decors
and title height, Mikhael?

Oh, I now remember why this check was necessary.  Consider this:

  AddToDecor foo
  + ...
  AddToDecor bar
  + ...
  Style somewindow UseDecor foo
  ChangeDecor bar
   (select one window using somewindow style)

Now there is a window using the "somewindow" style and the decor
"bar".  If anything in the style is changed, the decor will be
overridden by the decor from UseDecor.  This should be easy to
solve with another window flag that remembers if ChangeDecor
was used on a window.

Bye

XAllocColor returns null pixel values, and then sometimes r and dr
start to get weird values. I have 24/32 bit TrueColor display mode.

It works well on page (0, 0) now, but Resize of any shaded window on
other pages is now totally broken. :)

Also it would be nice if Resize of shaded TitleAtBottom windows using
the bottom border would update window position, not only size.
I.e. it should work symmetrically to Resize of shaded TitleAtTop windows
using the top border, which works correctly.

Mikhael.

The test was from vector-buttons/testbed.fvwmrc:

  Read vb/testbed.fvwmrc
  Read vb/DecorDemo1.fvwmrc
  button_demo
  Read vb/DecorDemo2.fvwmrc

I have tested this with the old "if (tmp_win->decor" line and with the
new "if (!IS_DECOR_CHANGED" and with both. I don't see differences.
(The result is funny, but you explained then why it can't work otherwise.)

So currently I don't see any problem with the updated decor code in CVS.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'd like to replace sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples with the 3 attached files.
It doesn't attempt to carry over the "sticky", "terms" or "standard" decors.
If the authors want to resubmit them, that would be ok.

This is not yet at the point that it can be installed instead of
just being an example, but its close.

Any comments?

Weird. What if you explicitly turn off optimizing compile with

  make CFLAGS="-g -Wall -Werr"

in the libs directory?

I added some debug output to Graphics.c.  To enable it, set the
DEBUG_ALG macro in line 238 to 1.  Then post the output (all lines
prepended with "***").

The other commands look good, but xosview is restarted without any
parameters.  The number of arguments in the RestartCommand section
is 1.

John Bradley the author of 'xv' has written a number of patches for xv-3.10a 
recently and is very responsive to suggestions and/or bugs.

His website -- http://www.trilon.com/xv/index.html

He can be contacted via email (its noted on the website) xvtech@trilon.com

Thought that might help; drop him a note and report this bug.

Did that... (with latest CVS sources) No more troubles. 

Then I did make clean, and re-compiled the whole stuff with -O6, and
even then the problem did not appear anymore.

(I have Debian unstable, and did dist-upgrade again today. Lots of X
library stuff was upgraded, too.)

No.  I somewhat improved the formula that calculates the colours
and that seems to hide or fix the problem now.  I didn't find a
reason for this problem though.

Content-description: Mail message body

    Hi!

    I've noticed a strange appearance of MWM-style window handles in the
current CVS version (28-Mar-2001).

    Two xv-grabbed gifs of the same window are attached, first (dcvs0328) is
from CVS version, second (dfvwm222) is from fvwm-2.2.2 (from RedHat-6.1).
The config file used is the same AnotherLevel-1.0.1-1 (*), but the problem
exists with fvwm/sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc too.

    The problem is that extra highlighted pixels are drawn, which produce
various undesired effects -- handles stick to titlebar buttons, highlight
on the top of vertical stroke of upper-right handle protrudes to normal-
colored area, etc.  On the other hand, bottom edges of right border and top-
right handle lack some highlighting, which make them look not-so-3D.

    As I understand, the miscalculation was introduced long ago, and there
are some more effects -- the gifs are of different size, CVS's being a pixel
taller and two pixels wider.

(*): AnotherLevel configs are almost stock RedHat's, with only font size
     increased from 12 to 14 and windowshade button added.

The todo list now has only four items left:

 1) Give the FvwmBUttons panel animation problem one final try to
    fix it.

      I don't think this will entail any more code changes.

 2) Finalize the announcement.

      Can be done after releasing fvwm-2.4-pre-1.

 3) Find a solution for versioning the FAQ.  Either we need
    separate FAQs on the web page or we need a way to version its
    contents.

      Can be done after releasing fvwm-2.4-pre-1.

 4) Update the release date in various man pages and other files.

      Obviously that has to be done on the day of the final
      release.

If no new evil bugs show up, the 2.3.30 release will become the
first release candidate (not counting changes in documentation).
I'll build 2.3.30 in a few minutes so that we have something that
people can test.

Bye

In DecorMwm:

  Style *         -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

must be

  Style *         Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

In inactive windows, the title buttons 2 and 4 (the two rightmost
ones) have a darker background than the other buttons.  To fix
this, replace

  +       ButtonStyle 2        5  25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
  +       ButtonStyle 4        5  45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1

with

  +       AddButtonStyle 2     5  25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
  +       AddButtonStyle 4     5  45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1

Also, I have a fix for the button looks of the DecorWin95 file.
Both files with my patches are attached.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

    Hi!

    While xineramifying Fvwm, I've encountered a few side small problems:

1. FvwmPager accepts "-transient", while FvwmWinList -- "Transient".
   Shouldn't they use the same syntax?

2. FvwmTaskBar.1 refers to "stfrtime" instead of "strftime" (just a typo).

3. FvwmTaskBar.c uses a value of "2" for its height in the AutoHide mode,
   which interferes with EdgeThickness ("2" is default).  Maybe "3" or "4"
   will be better?  (BTW, there too many "2"s in the text -- maybe
   #define/enum HIDDEN_HEIGHT nnn could be cleaner.)  And even more --
   wouldn't it be better for *FvwmTaskBarAutoHide to accept an optional
   parameter "hidden size", since on 1600x1200 displays 2 or 3 pixels is too
   small.

    BTW, FvwmTaskBar is a nightmare -- the positioning logic is spread
between many functions, along with "magic numbers" like "2" and "magic
formulae" like "ScreenHeight-win_border...".  (In fact, there are much more
problems with FvwmTaskBar, but I hope they'll disappear once I finish
concentrating all these magic in a single ConfigureGeometry().)

Well, probably.  There are so many strange and inconsistent things
in the various syntax patterns that it seems futile to start with
fixing module syntax.  I'd like to clean up all the syntax for
3.0.

To be honest I'd rather try to remove all icon management modules
except FvwmIconMan rather than fixing FvwmTaskBar.  It's written
very uncleanly and has not been maintained properly for years.
Personally I avoid value constants completely.

FvwmTaskBar *is* a nightmare.  

I'll record your comments as enhancement requests.  I won't open
that can of worms now, right before the 2.4 release.

AutoHide and Vertical Scrolling are incompatible that's all :o)
Of course, *FvwmTaskBarAutoHide hidden_size will be a
good option. Note that you can play with the border width, 
what about: Style "FvwmTaskBar" BorderWidth 10 (of course
do not fix AutoHide + Vertical Scroll).
There is also the possibility to do a manual hide by shading
the taskbar with a doubleclick on its border (the best solution
IMHO, AutoHide cause to many problems).

And FvwmIconMan will become very very complex, because every
body will want this feature and this look (where is my "TaskBar" look?
why I've to spend 3 days to configure IconMan as WinList is so easy
to configure? ...etc).  Any way, at the present time I've no opinion
on this subject.

Yes, I try to maintain the TaskBar a bit. I use it every day and I do no
see any problem if you use it in a normal way (no AutoHide with Vertical 
Scrolling, do not change the border width together with shading/move/resize
it  (with AutoHide), and there is also this Autostick "feature" and timeout
balloon etc..). Unfortunately (or fortunately) I never take the responsibility
to do a complete rewriting, but I tried to fix it "bit by bit".

Hello,

We probably do not have to take in account the followings problems,
but ...

1. Since last 15 days two times my menu definition completely
disappear (the second time just now with 2.3.30). When I go around
my root menu and popup all my submenus (to look at my mini icons)
suddenly all my menus definition go away:  The bindings are still here
but fvwm says "no menu xxx", "no menu yyy", ...  (the menus disappear
for ever when I use it).
Also it seems that the last popup before that the menu go away was not
the good submenu but one not very far from it.  I am unable to reproduce
this problem.

2. Seems that there are bad interactions between PopupDownDelayed
and animate menu. Under certain situation:
            - In a menu X popup a submenu A which cause animation
	- Go to menu A and popup a submenu B that cause animation
	- In menu A (try) to popup an other submenu C
	- before submenu B popup down the animation came back
               and the cursor fall on menu B.
I can reproduce this in fvwm-themes Themes Management menu and
going far (the problem arise more or less far from the root):
Themes Management/current/settings/GNOME/System menu
 
3. Build a menu R with two Popup one "A" with a real submenu and the
other one "B" with a non existing menu. Go to "A", the submenu popup,
then go to "B", menu "A" never PopupDown (PopupDelayed of course).
 
4. Under GNOME session : Use say a DesktopSize 2x2 and save
your session on page 2 2. When I restart the session I am again
on page 2 2 but the gmc icon are on the page on my left.
It seems that a page switching in the "same time" that a "stick"
(the gmc icon) cause the problem.

I think you underestimate what FvwmIconMan can already do.  At
present it can mimic the basic functionality of FvwmTaskBar almost
perfectly.  As far as I know it only lacks an autohide feature and
the tray with the clock and mail items.  It can also behave like
FvwmWinList or the WindowList command, except perhaps that it
lacks some of the sorting options.

On the other hand, FvwmIconMan is not written very cleanly either
and is hard to debug.

There's magic in the Makefiles that a) breaks Solaris make and b) breaks
Sun's C compiler:

The line

    DEPS_MAGIC := $(shell mkdir .deps > /dev/null 2>&1 || :)

is a GNU Make-ism.

Similarly,

    $(COMPILE) -Wp,-MD,.deps/$(*F).pp -c $<

is specific to GNU cc (the -MD part, at any rate).

Is it becoming official policy that fvwm must build with the GNU tools, or
is this simply a result of that being the only thing it's tested on?

The official policy is that you need gnumake to compile from CVS.
Snapshots and releases should not contain anything that requires gnumake.

See our web page, then Developers, the CVS, then "Before you begin".

If you build from CVS, it's well-known (and always been the case) that
you need the GNU toolset, GNU make and GCC.

This is a requirement forced by automake and autoconf.

It's expected that only developer-types are building from CVS source and
they can install the GNU suite: autoconf, automake, GCC, GNU make, perl,
GNU m4, etc.

Once a distribution is created from a developer installation (using
"make dist"), the resulting distribution tarfile will not (should not!)
contain any requirements on GNU make or GCC, or any other GNU toolset.

If you find this not to be the case, it's definitely a bug.

Oops, sorry; I knew that.  I think I simply must have gotten lucky a while
back, and just forgot about it.

I would not underestimate the Olivier's knowledge of FvwmIconMan,
FvwmWinList and FvwmTaskBar. :) He personaly has no problems to fully
configure any of these (see olicha theme), but is concerned about users.

Currently FvwmTaskBar is more like a ready-to-go FvwmButtons with the
start button + FvwmIconMan + smart mail box + clock. I can agree with
Olivier that trying to incorporate all unique features of FvwmTaskBar into
FvwmIconMan may cause a spaghetti. Removing FvwmWinList is easier.

I don't think that adding a FvwmButtons-like code to FvwmIconMan is a good
idea. So I see only 2 solutions, either to continue with FvwmTaskBar
module or replace it with a FvwmButtons sample containing among others
FvwmIconMan. The problem with the second solution is as Olivier mentioned,
a lack of the current easy configuration in one place.

I also think that when FvwmIconMan and FvwmWinList will be merged the
resulting module for managing a list of windows is better to be called
FvwmWinList, not FvwmIconMan.

Regards,
Mikhael.

    Well, while testing I used exactly that setting -- BorderWidth 10.  An=
d
this raises the second comment regarding FvwmTaskBar (well, there's a doze=
n
in my "notes" file ;):

   Also it should probably show when mouse moves to its border.  Is it
   possible for a module to get such events?  In case of SloppyFocus
   a simple reaction to FocusIn will be enough.  (BTW, Windoze taskbar
   works like this -- it wouldn't hide if it has focus.)

    In fact, the inspection of FvwmTaskBar.c shows that it would be much

So I can still notice the problem :(

Actually, it seems like allocating the first gradient always fails.
For example, the following works:

AddToDecor Foo

+       TitleStyle        ActiveDown (VGradient 10 #401515 OrangeRed3 -- flat)
+       TitleStyle        ActiveUp (VGradient 10 IndianRed4 OrangeRed -- flat)

But this does not:

AddToDecor Foo
+       TitleStyle        ActiveDown (VGradient 10 #401515 OrangeRed3 -- flat)
+       TitleStyle        ActiveUp (VGradient 10 IndianRed4 OrangeRed -- flat)

No, the window has no reliable method to detect this.

Absolutely right.  It will most likely be done some day.

Actually, it's much more simple to code in fvwm thatn in a module.
The module interface introduces a whole new class of problems that
has to do with timing of the communications between module, fvwm
and X server.  Although FvwmAuto is a very simple module it has or
had a lot of problems.

Of course.  The current plans for 3.0 would already break a lot
of syntaxes and make it very disruptive fr the users, but that is
no reason not to try to make the process easy for the users.
Perhaps it could be done as a special mode of operation a la
FvwmRearrange/FvwmTile/FvwmCascade.

I think we need to thigs: one module that manages icons (called
FvwmTheOnlyTrueIconManager ;-) ) and one module that provides gui
or button functionality (FvwmGUI?).  CUrrently, if we had to chose
from existing modules, the best choices are FvwmButtons and
FvwmIconMan.  It should be possible to implement everything else
bu using these two.  Doing so would require a major effort.

Yes of course.  I didn't say removig one of the core modules would
be easy, did I?  BUt at the moment I *believe* that fvwm needs a
major rework of syntax anyway.  At least these are my (vague)
plans for 2.3:

 - Integrate FvwmTheme into fvwm.
 - Possibly throw away some of the modules.
 - Throw away TitleStyle/ButtonStyle/BorderStyle/Decors and
   replace them by styles.
 - Vastly improve flexibility of the Style command.
 - Rewrite large parts of the syntax in a consistent way.

Whatever.  I don't really care about the name.

That's a serious problem.  I had that a few times when I cleaned
up the menu deletion code.  Somehow the menu list gets corrupted.
THe menus are still in memory but can't be found.  Please try to
find a way to reproduce this.  It probably has something to do
with dynamic menus.

Then please try that snapshot with the debug code.  In the end it
seems to be a problem of the X server that is triggered under
obscure circumstance.

Could you try XFree 4.x?

Oh, my. Now I see this "G|/|n|/|ral" instead of "Gnral".
Yes, specifying lang=fr is not enough, the 8859-1 font is needed too.
I will replace the screenshot later, sorry for everyone affected. :)

That does not happen for me, but perhaps I did not do what you
did:

 1) Start fvwm.
 2) Start gnome-session.  It complains about not running a GNOME
    compliant window manager but starts up anyway.
 3) Go to the bottom right page (1 1).
 4) Chose "Save Current Session" from the Session menu.
 5) Log out of GNOME. Fvwm is still running.
 6) Start gnome-session again.

==> The gmc icons start on the current page, i.e. (1 1).

gnome-session is a session manager like xsm; starting it inside fvwm has
no much sence. You should start it instead of fvwm and then go to panel's
menu and define fvwm2 as a window manager (FAQ #2.7). Then fvwm will be
started by gnome-session when you run gnome-session next time.

SessionInitFunction will be called instead of InitFunction.
If StartFunction is used to run modules they will be started as expected.

Session management functionality is turned off in fvwm (sm_conn = NULL)
unless fvwm is run under a session manager.
