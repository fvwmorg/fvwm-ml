I like it.  Thus far I don't see myself using it any differently than
I did the old one, but the examples are a good indication of the
improvements (I particularly like the group move, even if it is a bit
clunky and ^C is needed to kill it).  The man page needs updating,
though.  And I would recommend putting at least one of the examples in
the manual with more detailed comments.  It took me a while to figure
out how the monitoring stuff worked.

This is a bug in fvwm.  Windows of very small height cannot be
placed all the way at the bottom of a virtual desk, and windows
of very small widths can't be placed all the way to the right
of the virtual desk.  (Try "xclock -geometry 1x1+0-0".)  The fvwm2
people might want to fix this.

You can work around this by adding an extra row or column of pages to
your fvwm desktop, and just don't use them.

Ah, this is a tkgoodstuff bug.  I'll put it on my list.

Howdy all.

Wow - go away for week and a half and come back to a TON of
email...  Three days and I still haven't been able to read it all! :)

Anyways, just wanted to let you all know that I am still alive, and
yes even doing a little work on getting 2.0.46 ready finially.

In my perusal of the notes that I missed in the time I was away I've
seen several things that I'd like to respond to, but honestly I can't
right now (I haven't even finished looking over all that email yet).
Hopefully I'll remember to respond to them later... :)

It looks like I should be able to get 2.0.46 out shortly though -
within the next week, I hope.  As much as I hate saying things like
that, I figured I'd better with all the talk I saw about fvwm being
dead... :)

Hopefully things will be better from now on - I'm still dreadfully
busy, but some changes have occurred that may make it easier for me to
make more time for fvwm (again, I hope).  If this doesn't prove to be
the case, I may have to offer to pass on the torch, but I hope it
won't come to that just yet (I do like maintaining fvwm).

Chuck

OK, I've been playing with various icon managers, from fvwm2's builtin
iconbox and windowlist, to FvwmIconMan, to the task bar that fvwm95
uses, to tkgoodstuff's windowlist tool.

All of them are cool, but none do quite what I want.  I think what I
want would be most excellent (just saw Bill & Ted's again on Fox last
week :) so I'm asking if anyone can point me to something that can do
it, or is interested in modifying their particular manager to do it.

First, I have _tons_ of icons.  Most of them are of two basic types:
Emacs frames and rxvt windows.  There are some others thrown in for good
measure (ical, tkman, maybe a WWW browser, occasionally Frame, etc.)

The rxvt windows are also of a few discrete flavors: for example, we use
ClearCase at work and I have a specific ClearCase class of rxvt windows
that are set to ClearCase views.

I have so many icons they can't all be shown at once.  And I really hate
scrollbars in an icon manager; too cumbersome.

Here's what I'd like:

  * An interface like the 95 button bar where you get a button per task,
    then you click on it to raise/focus it, etc.

  * BUT!  It should be possible to define a _set_ of windows that would
    appear under one button.  Then I'd define one set for Emacs frames,
    one for ClearCase view rxvt's, etc.  And I'd get just one button no
    matter how many Emacs frames I had.

    When you picked a button that represented multiple windows, you'd
    get a popup listing each of the windows with its title (like the
    fvwm2 builtin windowlist).  Then you'd pick the one you wanted from
    that list.

  * The button bar should have an option for hiding itself, like win95
    and the new tkgoodstuff can, where it becomes a thin line against
    the edge of the screeen when the mouse moves off of it, then
    reappears when you move back over it.

  * In an ideal world, you could also define actions for each set; the
    actions would appear on the popup above the list of windows,
    separated by a line.  The actions could of course be commands, fvwm
    modules, or whatever.

    Right now I have an FvwmForm configured to start ClearCase views; it
    asks for a view name and invokes rxvt with a command to set to that
    view.

    So, for my rxvt ClearCase "set", I'd want my popup menu to be
    something like:

        .________________________.
        | New View               |
        `------------------------'
        ' psmith_view1 @ lemming `
        | psmith_view2 @ bronto  |
        | psmith_view3 @ whaler  |
        `------------------------'

    Then when "new view" was picked, my FvwmForm module is kicked off.

Anyway, you get the idea.

I _dream_ about this interface now that I've imagined it.  Can someone
help? :)

Hello,
	I have a couple of home grown patches for Fvwm 2.0.45 if anyone is
interested.

	One draws an outline around the title bar text.  I tend to use
fairly noisy title bar textures, and this makes the text infinitely more
readable.  Right now, it uses the background color for the outline, I am
working on allowing the user to specify a specific color for the outline.

	Window borders disappear now when I maximize a window.  The window
is truly maximized.

	Also, the title bar now extends for the entire width of the parent
frame, the side borders stop at the bottom of the title bar.  Also, there
is no top border (that is what the title bar is for).

	I can send screen shots if anyone is interested.

This one I like. I, too, have the same problem.

Does this affect the ability to normalize the window?

What about Style NoTitle? I have a lot of windows that have the sizing bars,
but no title bar.

Those would help visualize some of these changes...

Nope.  As long as you have a Maximize/restore button on the title bar.  I
guess I was not totally clear, the title bar is still mapped.

This is the first step in a greater plan.  The one thing that I love about
the Mac is the global title bar.  I am also writing a module that behaves
like that title bar.  It will have a label area to hold the name of the
window with the current focus, user defineable buttons and menus, somewhat
like GoodStuff, etc.  When a window gets maximized in this scheme, it
loses its title bar, and covers the entire screen except the global title
bar.

That is in the works.  When there is no title bar, there will be a top
border.

As for screen shots, I am fairly well firewalled here.  I have no external
web page that I could post them on, and I am loath to post a binary to a
list.  Lemme know, and I will mail something personally.

This one I like. I, too, have the same problem.

Does this affect the ability to normalize the window?

What about Style NoTitle? I have a lot of windows that have the sizing bars,
but no title bar.

Those would help visualize some of these changes...
