The initial rush of subscriptions have died down, so I think we can get
started.  There are currently 34 subscribers here; if even half of you are
interested in contributing to development I think we're doing pretty well.

So, Chuck, where would you like to go first?  Are we ready to start testing
the snapshot?

Oh, and what does everyone think about those distributed CVS thingies?  It
seems a bunch of development groups are thinking about going that route.
(Yes, I'd host a CVS tree, too, if someone instructs me.)

Hi all,

Is someone out there working on putting TITLE-ICON SUPOORT in FVWM?(Like
there is in FVWM95)

The reason for asking is because this is what makes the two incompatible
as far as modules.

For example, I have modified FvwmWinList in Fvwm95 to support the Title
Icons, like the TaskBar and added the ability to Reflect what is on your
CURRENT DESK only.  This will not compile on Fvwm2.

If no-one else wants to do this, and no one has big objections to it, I
could maybe do it.



This whole thing leads to the bigger issue of the Fvwm - Fvwm95 split.
Are they really that different that we cannot combine them.  NO.

Here what I see the differences are right now:

Fvwm95 has no corner decorations.  Non issue, Fvwm2 can do this already
(Handle width = 0, Border width = 5)

Fvwm95 has no inner frame shadows, to make it appear like the contents
are seting on some Tile, not inset into something.  I have found where
the inner shadows are in the code, though the outer shadows seam to be
different too.

The only thing that changes colors on Focus is the title bar.
This could some option, or specify the Focused/unfocused title bar
colors separately.

And yes the TITLE-ICONS. These are mini icons that are specified with an
application.  They replace the upper left Window menu button, and are
beside the name in FvwmTaskbar and FvwmWinList(next release).  You can
have mini-icons in Menus too.  In FvwmButtons too eventually.



Ideas, Comments.

I'd prefer a bug tracking system similar to the one Debian (one of the

Can you provide a reference?

Of course, this is all up to Chuck.  If he likes the "mailing patches" and
"make a list of bugs" approaches then that's what we'll go with.

http://www.debian.org/Bugs/

This page is the main index page, and is unfortunately huge. This is a
mirror of the master copy at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/iwj10/debian-bugs/
which is in the UK.

Quite.

I haven't used CVS before: could someone briefly summarise its salient
features?

The last thing we need is yet another split.  There have been so many
(Bowman, fvwm95, others I can't remember) and of course fvwm was a split of
its own.  A bunch of diverging development streams just slows down the
whole effort.

Now is of course not the time to try to combine development.  Now is the
time to say "enough with beta versions of fvwm2" and get it out the door.
Chuck is almost ready and we're here to do the testing on various
platforms.

After 2.0 release I think the next thing on the list is the style flag
rewrite.  Once that is finished and debugged it's time to think about
fvwm95 and new features.  I think it's premature to do anything else,
really, until a release is made and the style flags are redone.

The issue of whether or not to incorporate all of those extra goodies is up
to Chuck.  I think that generalizing things like title and border
appearance even further can't hurt and might not bloat things a bit.
Pixmaps in the title bar can't be more complex than the current system,
though I agree with Chuck that it's not fvwm's place to do any kind of
scaling or image manipulation.

They (debian developers) are probably using GNATS.

If so, yes it is possible to gnats thru a cgi-script
for example.

Unfortunately I dont use a distributed cvs repository.
My ones is accesed thru NFS instead...

	Andrew Veliath is already working on the titlebar:

	I have plenty of little pixmaps to put as title-icons :).
I'll be glad to test a patch doing this :).

Nope, it's a set of perl scripts custom-written by Ian Jackson
<ian@chiark.chu.cam.ac.uk>.  One of the scripts runs from cron
about every 30mins, and generates the web pages. No cgi is involved
anywhere. Bugs can be opened, closed, added to, reassigned, marked as
forwarded to upstream maintainer etc via email. Shortly, it will be
possible to merge bug reports.

It'll probably take me a while to get through it all...

Almost.  I've got a few more things to fix up, then it'll be ready.  I
had a martial arts seminar & some special training sessions with our
GrandMaster this weekend which ate up all my time, or it might have
been ready for today (and I might not be so sore right now).

Now, the purpose of this snapshot testing is to help reduce problems
seen with each new beta on the multitude of platforms out there, so it
(the pre beta snapshot tar file) really shouldn't be placed in the
normal distribution directory.

We should probably have a slightly different, somewhat hidden
directory for it at the ftp site.  I don't think we need to go so far
as to have a special ftp group & passwd like we do with the XEmacs
betas, but perhaps just a '.test' directory under /pub/fvwm perhaps?

I'll name the tar files slightly different too, to mark them.

I'd prefer not to.  The patches-mailed-to-the-list method works ok for
me because I can be more selective about what happens to the code,
which as you all know by now I really like to be.  It's sometimes a
pain and a bit slower, but I feel that it's ok for now.

http://www.debian.org/ should have links to the bug database.  Ian Jackson
(address should be somewhere on the WWW site) takes care of it, and runs a
handy mail interface.  It's undergoing a bit of surgery at the moment,
though.

OTOH, a bug list is good for users as well.  The archive will list both the
bug report and possible fixes.

Howdy Don.

Nope.  Or if they are it's most likely wasted effort, since I don't
think fvwm needs this and said so in the past, which is one of the
reasons that they hacked out fvwm95.

I don't mean to sound overly negative in this note, but most everyone
here already knows my reasoning.  I'll put a few here again though,
just for grins:

  - Keeping fvwm relatively lightweight and fast is a big thing for
    me.  New functionality is also good, but must be weighed against
    this to prevent bloating.  A new look provides no new
    functionality, but I am willing to bend a little sometimes, for
    example the pixmap buttons, if the code isn't too much.
  - Fvwm doesn't need to be able to look like a bunch of different
    window managers, and especially not win95 (after all, we're
    dealing with UNIX, a REAL operating system).  Granted, a lot of
    people are used to that look and feel, but I think if small
    changes can be made to fvwm to ensure that similiar keystrokes can
    be bound, that is more important and more than sufficient.
  - I don't care for anything winXX.
  - I wouldn't want to get sued by you-know-who for infringement upon
    their look and feel. :)
  - I've finially resigned myself to the fact that I can't please
    everyone, not even myself, no matter how much I'd like to.

....
Don> This whole thing leads to the bigger issue of the Fvwm - Fvwm95

Only the fact that I feel that a lot of the differences don't need to
be merged in, and that there are more important things to work on,
which again is what caused them to hack out fvwm95.

Certain concepts from fvwm95 could perhaps be adopted in fvwm though.

Well, if people want to create a new window manager based on fvwm
(like Bowman did, with a change in name and docs), that's fine.  After
all, that is how fvwm started (as you noted).  Continuously updating
one or the other to stay in sync would be a detriment though, I
believe.

I fully agree.  It's been beta way too long.

Jason> After 2.0 release I think the next thing on the list is the
Jason> style flag rewrite.

That is definitely the next thing on my plate after 2.1.0 gets
released.  I may need to make a few bugfix releases to that, but then
the next beta after that will probably be numbered 2.2.0, due to the
amount of code change needed for the style flags fixes...

Which is probably going to take a little while...

Yup.  There are only a couple of new (relatively simple) things that
are going to be in 2.0.43, and I'd like to make the one after that be
2.1.0 (nothing new over 2.0.43 but bug & doc fixes).

Don> Here what I see the differences are right now:

Don> Fvwm95 has no corner decorations.  Non issue, Fvwm2 can do this already
Don> (Handle width = 0, Border width = 5)

Actually HandleWidth means "width of border if it has handles" and
BorderWidth means "width of border if it doesn't have handles".  I
don't think that the distinction makes much sense and that it might be
better to just have one BorderWidth value.  Does anyone out there
actually use different values for these?  I guess one way to find out
would be to remove it... :)

Anyways, fvwm can do it - the style option NoHandles is actually what
you use to remove the resize handles from the windows.

This is probably only a few lines in RelieveWindow and RelieveParts,

I was thinking about making an additional option for this, since I
know some people who only change the font color to indicate focus
change, changing the title bar only might be nice too, if it doesn't
take too much code & resources to do so.  I haven't investigated this
yet.

No, it shouldn't be too bad, but that still isn't a reason to go
overboard with it.  A few of little changes can add up to a lot.  But
as I mentioned above, I am willing to look into a few of them
(probably enough to make most people happy).  Some of them would
should probably be global options instead of Style options though, to
help save on memory.  Again, investigations will occur...

Do you mean Andrew's patch for the focused & unfocused title bar
pixmaps, or the mini-icon as button one?  The former might not be too
bad, but I'm still thinking about it...

Definitely.

Well, time for me to go.

Well, if you allow title-bar buttons to be set on a per-window basis and
the winlist module can get at the buttons then you have the intended
behavior (unless I'm confused about something).  Allowing pixmaps instead
of the current vectorized buttons is just icing on the cake.

I can easily see how having some easy means of identifying what a window
contains would be useful; the icon texts for my xterms contain the current
working directory, not "XTerm".  A little icon besides that would make it a
bit easier when I have twenty windows open.

CH> No, it shouldn't be too bad, but that still isn't a reason to go

I was thinking that after you reach a certain level of complexity (piles of
window decoration parameters) it becomes worthwhile to generalize things.
Say you assign each decoration a number and instead of looking in some
bizarre variable you use an array reference.  At that point it becomes
trivial (and essentially free) to replace every hardcoded border and shadow
width with a lookup.  You lose some ease in configurability, though,
because you have to remember numbers instead of names.  Hooray for #define,
I suppose.

CH> Some of them would should probably be global options instead of Style
CH> options though, to help save on memory.

Does anyone really make some windows look vastly different than others?  I
can see having different colors, but not different border widths and
shading.

I meant that allowing pixmaps as title-bar buttons has got to be easier
than the vector-style method fvwm uses now.  Then again, the vector method
is nice because the buttons can be scaled....

All this talk of pixmaps here and pixmaps there is nice, but it is
very much icing on the cake.

I'd like to present my humble opinion of what the order of things
needing doing should be:

  1) Bug: timing problems with mouse clicks & windows sticking to
              mouse
  2) Docs need going over with fine tooth-comb
  3) Release 2.1.0

  4) Style flags rewrite
  5) Icon placement policy
  6) Module interface (SendToModule?)
  7) finer control over window decorations for fvwm95 people

In particular, 1 is quite serious for people on slow machines (that
includes me).  Chuck, didn't you say you thought you knew what the
problem was?

I have some patches to the manpages that will help with 2 (part of
what I did for the Debian package).

My primary bone of contention is the loss of 1.24r's friendly icon
handling features. I'll have a good think about how to do
user-directed icon placement policy efficiently. I still have my
original patch for this, but it's quite ugly, and is probably in need
of a re-think anyway. If modules can handle two-way communication, it
might be possible for fvwm to use an external module decide the right
place to put an icon down. As I say, this needs thought.

What's currently being discussed is 7 - which in my opinion is quite
far down the list in the priority stakes :)

Ok, since I started that talk, Ill admit that you are correct.  But note
that I am using Fvwm95(hey, no booing) now because of the icing. I would
much rather see it done correctly, though.  The list given is a good
order of priorities.

Gee, that sounds strangely like the bug I've been trying to report for a
few weeks now, but I've gotten poor response anyone.  Also, I know use
Fvwm95 so this isn't something that "they" have mucked up.  :)

Anyway. . . what architecture are you running?

Sorry - thought I had responded to that, but must not have.  I can't
reproduce it under AIX.  Forgot to try under Linux.  Anyone else out
there see this?

I can't seem to reproduce this under AIX.  I'll try under Linux
tonight.  If it's a bug that nearly everyone sees, it might need to be
before the official release instead of after.

That was a simple addition.  Already in 2.0.43 (one of the few new

I'm not sure what constitutes vastly different, but from what I've
seen of some snapshot's it's not uncommon to set a smaller borderwidth
(I use 0) for modules like FvwmButtons and FvwmIconBox.  I do this
since I generally have those windows exactly where I want them so I
don't need anything to grab onto for moves or resizes etc.  I also
remove the title bar from them.

Yes, I too have a number of windows that are sticky.  They include
xpostit, xclock, xload, xbiff, xmultibiff, timex and contool.  Also,
there are FvwmPager and FvwmWinList.  All of these have no decoration
at all.  All other windows have the same appearance, though: same
border width, same color (but different highlight color, of course).

No, you aren't confused, that's what I don't want to do.  Making the
button styles per window attributes will add quite a bit to each
window structure.  I'd rather keep that global.

Jason> Allowing pixmaps instead of the current vectorized buttons is
Jason> just icing on the cake.

Pixmaps can currently be used instead of the regular buttons, but they
are global values.

Jason> I can easily see how having some easy means of identifying what
Jason> a window contains would be useful; the icon texts for my xterms
Jason> contain the current working directory, not "XTerm".  A little
Jason> icon besides that would make it a bit easier when I have twenty
Jason> windows open.

So, perhaps a way to allow the icons to be drawn inside the icon text
box (much like the menus) could be made.  It would still be specified
as part of the style command (IconBeside/IconAbove), and after the
style flag rewrite would only require one bit to say to draw it above
the icon text or beside it.  Then you could have something like:

            Style "XTerm" Icon mini.xterm.xpm, IconBeside

or maybe:

                Style "XTerm" MiniIcon mini.xterm.xpm

to have one directive specify both (Icon <xpm> implies above, MiniIcon
<xpm> implies beside, last one specified wins).

Now, if the latter one were used, I *might* allow an extra pixmap
pointer to be stored in the window structure, so both a mini icon and
normal icon could be stored, and then *maybe* have a way in the
ButtonStyle directive to access that mini icon as one of the buttons.

I can't believe I just typed that...

But, it would allow for one per window xpm button without taking up
too much additional memory and fvwm wouldn't have to do any work to
create it.  Communicate it with the rest of the window info and
modules have access to it...

Jason> I think that generalizing things like title and border appearance

CH> No, it shouldn't be too bad, but that still isn't a reason to go

....

Perhaps, yes.  But, are piles of window decoration parameters
necessary?  That's what I was getting at.  I just want to be careful
about what's added.

CH> Some of them would should probably be global options instead of Style
CH> options though, to help save on memory.

Jason> Does anyone really make some windows look vastly different than
Jason> others?  I can see having different colors, but not different
Jason> border widths and shading.

If people want different colors, I can see people wanting different
widths and shadings too...

Jason> Pixmaps in the title bar can't be more complex than the current
Jason> system,

CH> Do you mean Andrew's patch for the focused & unfocused title bar
CH> pixmaps, or the mini-icon as button one?  The former might not be too
CH> bad, but I'm still thinking about it...

Jason> I meant that allowing pixmaps as title-bar buttons has got to
Jason> be easier than the vector-style method fvwm uses now.  Then
Jason> again, the vector method is nice because the buttons can be
Jason> scaled....

As of the current beta (2.0.42) title bar buttons can be pixmaps, just
not on a per window basis (global only).  I incorporatted Andrew's
patch for that.

BTW - I was thinking of an easier way to specify the vectors of the
normal buttons.  Something like:

  # Big square:
  ButtonStyle 2 Vectored HL(10,10,90,10) SH(90,10,90,90) SH(90,90,10,90) \
                         HL(10,90,10,10)

Where HL -> draw in Highlight color, SH -> draw in Shadow color, and
it draws in that color from x1,y1 to x2,y2 (percentage values, of
course).  Might need the number of lines specified in there too (right
after the Vectored keyword).

Of course, the old style would be available as well.

	I too have seen this, and just now tried to duplicate it,
without success. But then I looked closer at the icon title as I
moved it, and remembered that I have OpaqueResize set at 5%.
	As you might guess from my post, that is the culpret. 
After I set OpaqueResize to 0, and specified an invalid icon pixmap
(or removed the default), the icon titles vanished on cue.

Ah...  Ok, I can reproduce it now.

I'll look into fixing this for the next beta release.  Potential
fixes:

        - Icons always move opaquely (probably easiest)
        - Find out why they aren't redrawn & actually fix it

If the latter is too complex to fix right now, I'll go with the
former to tide us over.

Just wanting to report that the "KillMe" module command patch that I posted a 
while back to the fvwm list definitely solves the fvwm-race-on-tkgoodstuff-rest
arting problem, and to add a plea to incorporate it in the main release.  It 
is very small and I think obviously harmless, and it is a big deal for 
tkgoodstuff, because it allows the user to reconfigure tkgoodstuff and restart 
it without restarting fvwm.  Recall that the problem is that when a module 
leaves children when exiting, fvwm doesn't recognize that it has died, and 
races trying to write to the "full" pipe.  The fix is to let the module tell 
fvwm to kill it, rather than just exiting.  Here is the patch, in case it was 
lost in all my bug-hunting reports:

*** ../fvwm-2.0.42/fvwm/module.c	Tue Apr  2 11:53:31 1996

Thanks for considering it!

Sure, I'll put it in 2.0.43 since, as you noted, it harms nothing.
I'll also try investigating if there is a way around this without
using KillMe.

We had some interesting discussion there for a while, then it died down and
now development talk has moved back to the main list.  That's usually what
happens (it takes a few iterations to get everything moved over) but the
few user questions are getting buried there.  I'm going to send another
message to the main list to try and shift some of the development talk back
here.

I think the web page needs to be updated with the new list.  Chuck, do you
want to do it, or should I?

I've got other updates to put on there with the next beta, so I could
do it then, or you could do it now for the time being if you don't
feel it can wait a few days.

Speaking of the next beta, I'm going to try and have it ready by
tommorrow for you folks to check out.  I've just got a few more little
things to take care of for it (and little time to do so unfortunately,
but I'm going to try and set aside some time tonight).

Ready and able. I do hope that the fix will be in there so that fvwm2 will
start without a ~/.fvwm2rc file and rather fall back on the system one.

I have a user community of ~40,000 users for whom I want to make fvwm2 the
default window manager. 

If this fix is not going to be in the upcomming release, then I will need to 
examine other alternatives. For tvtwm we use m4 and do this in the .twmrc;

define(`TMPFILE', maketemp(`/tmp/m4.defines.XXXXXX'))
syscmd(`bash /local/lib/init/m4.defines >' TMPFILE)
sinclude(TMPFILE)
syscmd(`rm' TMPFILE)
#
# User setup
#
sinclude(HOME/.twm.setup)
#
# Variables
#
sinclude(/local/lib/init/twm.variables)
sinclude(/local/lib/init/twm.colors)
sinclude(/local/lib/init/twm.icons)
sinclude(HOME/.twm.variables)
#
# Bindings
#
sinclude(/local/lib/init/twm.bindings)
sinclude(HOME/.twm.bindings)
#
# Menus
#
sinclude(/local/lib/init/main.menus)
sinclude(/local/lib/init/twm.menus)
sinclude(/local/lib/init/preference.menus)
sinclude(HOME/.twm.menus)

But it would be nice if it would work even with out a .fvwm2rc file.

Thanks,
Randall

Glad to hear it, because now I am too.

I just copied the tar file to ftp.hpc.uh.edu in
/pub/fvwm/version-2/.test/ and it looks like so:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   users     542234 Jun 20 17:06 fvwm-2.0.43-almost.tar.gz

And here is the rather substantial ChangeLog entry:

======================================================================
2.0.43 (not done yet)
       1. More man page updates & Imake fixes
       2. Simple patch to help take care of some timing bugs
       3. Patch to fix resize oddities when hitting 'hard' edge
          introduced by EdgeScroll loop patch
       4. Fixed startup w/ no rc bug, plus added more defaults, so if
          started without an rc file, things should run ok
       5. Patch to fix UseStyle problem w/ BackColor
       6. More FAQ updates
       7. Created an 'extras' dir, and moved some of the existing
          modules in there (the ones that aren't being built by
          default).
       8. More potential speedups in event processing
       9.  Decoupled warp from Focus, adding WarpToWindow function.
       10. Added SendToModule builtin to send arbitrary strings to
           modules to help implement more complex dynamic module
           abilities and allow for module to module communication
       11. Put old FvwmButtons back as FvwmGoodStuff, for people who
           prefer the simpler older version (in extras dir).  Also
           made it able to be passed in the name parameter on
           invocation so it doesn't have to be symbolically linked to
           the new names any more.
       12. Adding a new module FvwmForm2 in the extras directory,
           contributed by Frederic Cordier.  Based on FvwmForm but
           completely rewritten apparently.  It uses scripts, has a
           new more complex syntax (Pascal like) and adds
           RadioButtons.  I would like to eventually combine aspects
           of the two versions (and more) to make one killer module,
           perhaps.
       13. Made fvwm_msg send errors to modules, so FvwmTalk sees them
           like it used to (and any other module that looks for
           M_ERROR in the future)
       14. Added DestroyModuleConfig, based on patch from Toshi Isogai
       15. Modules can now send module config commands to fvwm (eg
           FvwmTalk)
       16. Removed implicit Exec exec stuff for the time being, until
           I come up with a better way to do it (back to old behavior)
       17. More mini icons added and some icons removed
       18. Added "KillMe" command that modules can send to fvwm asking
           for an assisted suicide (almost called this Kevorkian :)).
           Mark Crimmins wanted this for probs with TkGoodStuff.
       19. Fixed RaiseWindow bug under some servers when no icon
           pixmap.
       20. Fixed one prob w/ FvwmAuto and menus being hidden (under
           click to focus - still needs work for other focus policies,
           but not entirely sure how to approach this yet).
       21. Added ExitFunction, to be executed on exit (before restarts
           too).  Useful for explicitly killing modules, etc.
       22. Changed behavior of '-f' to just specify config file (now
           use -cmd to perform an actual command, like -cmd 'FvwmM4
           .fvwm2rc')
       23. Updates to FvwmSaveDesk from Carsten Paeth so it should now
           actually work under 2.xx, plus some other bugfixes too I
           believe.
       24. Added PipeRead function, which executes a program and
           Read's it's output.  Useful for making dynamic menus and
           such.
       25. Security fix for FvwmM4 & FvwmCpp from Austin Donnelly
       26. Added strerror for SunOS 4.1.x
       27. Added ability to remove mouse and key bindings without
           restart (do the binding but specify '-' as the function).
           Probably needs more checking for removing mouse bindings
           from title bar buttons correctly, though.

still working on:

       -  Fixed prob w/ moving icons that don't have pixmaps if
          opaquemovesize set to low

       -  Fixed UseStyle to allow "" for styles with spaces

       -  Updates to sample rc file

       -  Fixes to FvwmConsole from Toshi Isogai
       -  FvwmDebug was missing some stuff
       -  Patch for IconGeometry placement problem from Graham Barr?
======================================================================

I'll clean up some of those last few when I get back in town Sunday
night (I won't be around to respond to mail until then), along with
whatever problems y'all catch, and hopefully get the actual 2.0.43
out sometime Monday.

Some of the things in the "still doing" section may be removed between
now and then.

RSW> I do hope that the fix will be in there so that fvwm2 will start
RSW> without a ~/.fvwm2rc file and rather fall back on the system one.

Yup - it'll now start without an rc file.  But it still doesn't look
for the system one.  I'll try and add that real quick when I get back
Sunday night, as it slipped my mind...

RSW> I have a user community of ~40,000 users for whom I want to make
RSW> fvwm2 the default window manager.

Well, that should be interesting...

Gotta go.  I should have been out of town an hour ago...

Chuck

ps - Brady, as you can see I got SendToModule & those Focus/warp
changes in there, so if you want to code up those changes to
FvwmIconMan and ship it to me by Monday, I'll see that they get in.  I
wasn't sure if you were on the workers list or not, so I figured I'd
better copy you on it.

Thanks Chuck!  Trying it out on Solaris 2.4 with gcc 2.7.2 (and hacked
Imake.tmpl) as I type...

Otherwise it builds and links fine.  Too bad I'm at home so I can't test

ChangeLog:

C>        21. Added ExitFunction, to be executed on exit (before restarts
C>            too).  Useful for explicitly killing modules, etc.

well that's a workaround.
the main reason to explicitly kill a module in ExitFunction -(modules
should normally be automatically killed on Exit of fvwm2, since
they're extensions)- is to have this ExitFunction:

AddToFunc ExitFunction
+ 	"I"	KillModule FvwmButtons
+	"I"	FvwmBanner
+	"I"	Wait FvwmBanner

where the wait is to make sure, all windows are unswallowed and redisplayed
by the X server, before the restarted new FvwmButton is initializing.
This new FvwmButton would start new copies of all swallowed programs, since
he "can't see" the old ones.

The fix would be for fvwm2 to wait (a little bit more) for the old
FvwmButton module to die, before restarting, and for FvwmButtons to
wait till all unswallowing is finished, before exiting.
This would be a little bit slower on restart, but still faster than the
Quirx with FvwmBanner & wait FvwmBanner in the ExitFunction.

Still, I can see a use for Exitfunction, aside from killing modules.




ok Jason reported the next one already
C>       26. Added strerror for SunOS 4.1.x
when compiling:

builtins.c: In function `strerror':
builtins.c:720: `errnum' undeclared (first use this function)

#if !defined(HAVE_STRERROR) || HAVE_STRERROR == 0
char *strerror(int num)
{
  extern int sys_nerr;
  extern char *sys_errlist[];

  if (num >= 0 && num < sys_nerr)
-    return(sys_errlist[errnum]);
+    return(sys_errlist[num]);
  else
    return "Unknown error number";
}
#endif

well our site is still missing the 
InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
macro :-(

our sysadmin says it's named InstallNonExec() under X11R4 (installed on the
suns here)

so either change sample.fvwmrc/Imakefile
	#if InstallSample
	-InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
	+InstallNonExec(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
	#endif

or use InstallNamedNonExec()  - defined in Fvwm.tmpl if it doesn't exist -
in sample.fvwm/Imakefile 





also the Bug I reported already twice, but nobody ever answered :-(

MANPATH is settable in Fvwm.tmpl (~ Line 278) but in Line 414 
	InstallManPage(program,$(MANDIR))
is used to install the pages.

in the generated Makefile, I find:
       DESTDIR = /XTech
	MANDIR = $(DESTDIR)/man/mann
which tries to install them globally (which is not permitted to me!)

so I see three possibilities:

1.) maybe our (X11R4) setup is ruined, if so the tell me what is wrong, please.
    Should I mail the generated Makefile here?

2.) Fvwm.tmpl messes up MANDIR & MANPATH
   (it seems to me that FvwmManPath should be FvwmManDir, and
    MANPATH should be MANDIR throughoutall of Fvwm.tmpl)

3.) MANDIR should also be configurable in Fvwm.tmpl,
   for those who want to install Fvwm binary & documentation in ~/anyname/


I think it's 2) at least all things went smooth when I did this.

cheers,

	It should be nice to add the fvwm-2.0.42.pxp8a.diff.gz patch
from Andrew Velia which corrects the bugs of the title bar button
(pixmap) of the current 2.0.42 version.
Sorry if this is already done but I didn't see it in the <changes> list.

	I don't know if the fvwm-2.0.42.tbp3a.diff.gz patch which allow
to use pixmaps in the title bar is still experimental? Maybe it could be
added to. Anyway for this one, I don't know if Andrew and Chuck feel ready
for that :).

Subject: Patch to vertically center menu text

One of the items on the fvwm2-TO.DO list is:

  - Make left justified pixmaps in menus center align vertically w/
    any text displayed?

It seems that small pixmaps are already centered with larger text, but
text is not centered with larger pixmaps.
So here is a small patch to fix the vertical alignment.

If you  install the  man pages in  a place  that  has a  "windex", the
install process does not create a new windex.

When you do create the windex (with catman -w), the windex entry looks
like:

fvwm		fvwm (1)	- F(?) Virtual Window Manager for X11

Because it says "fvwm", instead of fvwm2, "man fvwm2" does not work.

The fix is:

I don't   know if this   change is  responsible, but   a number of  my
keybindings stopped working.  Eg:

Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100
Key Down	A	C	Scroll +0   +100

They still  work when  the mouse pointer  is on  the root, but  if the
mouse  pointer   is in a window,   the  keystroke gets  passed  to the
application.  (Which is not what I want.)

FvwmDebug was not  in the package.  As  long as that was  intentional,
OK.

How about:

#ifndef InstallNonExecFile()
#define InstallNonExecFile(x,y) InstallNonExec(x,y)
endif

Will some flavor of that work?

Perhaps you could do a diff on fvwm2.0.43-almost and see if it works ok and
report back.  I'm sure that would help alot.  And perhaps a quick reminder
for over-worked Chuck <grin> where it is might make things easier?

Last I heard Andrew was advocating for the titlebar pixmaps to be a separate
patch because it is more frivolous than useful...or perhaps it was because
it only adds bloat...in some people's opinion....I don't know...if it were
a compile-time-option just like xpm and title-bar-buttons I can't see
how one could go wrong.  I'd compile it in myself...

Just some thoughts.

I have never seen a package that does this.  I would certainly hope that I
never do, as having replaced Sun's screwy man with a nice perl replacement
I don't see how it would know how to build the index files.

Sun's man again.  man -F would probably find it, but you're right; the NAME
section should match the filename.  catman complains about the mismatch.

I guess here is where we must decide.  Is 'fvwm2' forever to be the
binary used with fvwm?  Or is it a temporary measure to wean people away
from fvwm 1.xx ??

I guess when there is autoconf we can say '--name=fvwm' or '--name\fvwm2'
or something similar and it can automatically update the man pages.  Ifnot,
it can be in the Makefiles to sed the man pages or something.  Or we
can do something like that now.

I guess it wouldn't hurt me very much, as I don't use windex's, but just
thought I'd bring this up.

Ok, I have these 'automagic' makefiles that I tried to have them do things
for me.  Like uncompress, find an Imakefile, xmkmf -a, and compile....

However, that doesn't work with fvwm.  I should know by know (I do, but my
makefiles didn't) to run 'MakeMakefiles'....

Sorry if I alarmed anyone...

That's right. How about sending a mail periodically (per month or so)
to the list, including "how to unsubscribe/official Web site announce"
or whatever you wanted to include at the foot of each mail ?

Yes, I suppose I should do this.  Still, you'd be amazed at how many unsubs
are caught being sent to the main list (well, not here, but on fvwm and my
other lists).  Even though instructions are sent at the bottom of every
message.  Amazing.

MM> BTW, fvwm mailinglist archives on the web is great, what's tool is used
MM> ?

Well, um, it's uh, TMLI.  Yeah, TMLI, that's it.  The Tibbs Mailing List
Interface.  Yeah, I like that.  Actually it's the old fashioned tool: the
multi-purpose Swiss army kludge.  The messages are archived into UNIX mbox
folders by archive2.pl, which comes with Majordomo (slightly modified, of
course).  Those folders are processed by MHonArc to generate the indices
and individual message pages.  The backend search engine is Glimpse 3.0
(yes, I know 3.5 is out but this isn't broken so I'm not fixing it).  The
glue that binds this all together is a bunch of perl (5) scripts.  I
actually at one time intended to build in a subscription interface and a
means to reply to messages and then release it, but got caught up in other
things.

I have succesfully (With the following patches) compiled fvwm-2.0.43-almost
on the following platforms and X11R6.

Ultrix 4.4	cc
DU 3.2c		cc
HPUX 9.05	cc
IRIX 5.3	cc
SunOS 4.1.4	gcc
Solaris 2.5	gcc

And on the following with the vendors supplied X distribution.

DU 3.2c         cc
IRIX 5.3        cc
Solaris 2.5     gcc

I could not build it on the following with the vendors X distribution.

Ultrix 4.4	Could not find xmkmf.
HPUX 9.05	Could not find xmkmf.
SunOS 4.1.4	too man include files missing from /usr/openwin/include.
(maybe others who know these systems default X more then I can have some 
success, but I have never used these vendors X to build anything....)

Regaurding the patches:
The last couple in the modules were just to stop some compiler warnings. 
However the "colors" change in FvwmForm.c was needed on DU 3.2c.

If someone does not know how to unsubscribe from this list, then they most 
likely do not belong on it in the first place.

Drop the footer.

Here is a (merged) patch against plain 2.0.43-almost. It will make
2.0.43 more portable, and fix some bugs.

Followings is the summary of this patch. 'reported:' means that it is
already reported to fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu.

* InstallNonExecFile() macro is not defined in X11R4(?)
  (reported: <9606211401.AA23592@vta_host.auto.tuwien.ac.at>)

* 'C++FLAGS' is required for make of BSD/OS 2.x.

* Add 'sgi' defines to configure.h for IRIX, OS specific section.
  (reported: <Pine.OSF.3.91.960623011210.1985K-100000@shorty.csc.umd.edu>>

* extra/FvwmConfig/Imakefile misses 'LOCAL_LIBRARIES' definition.

* extra/FvwmConfig/FvwmDebug.c uses 'waitpid' function.
	Define 'ReapChildrenPid()' macro in extras/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.h.
	('ReapChildren()' macro is not suitable to use)

* NEWS-OS 4.x doesn't know pid_t and setvbuf().
	Define these to extras/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.h.

* <malloc.h> should NOT use in some OS (maybe warned or error).
	XXX: avoid to include <malloc.h> in extras/FvwmForm2/FvwmForm.c,
	modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.c, and modules/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan.h.

* BUGFIX: fvwm/builtin.c uses undefined variable in strerror().
  (reported: <ufaennax9hb.fsf@sina.hpc.uh.edu>)

* BUGFIX: Pixmap alignment incorrect in menu.
  (reported: <9606211527.AA26123@vta_host.auto.tuwien.ac.at>)

* Fix type mismatch warnings.
  (reported: <Pine.OSF.3.91.960623011210.1985K-100000@shorty.csc.umd.edu>)
	See modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c, modules/FvwmButtons/parse.c,
	and modules/FvwmTalk/FvwmTalk.c.

* "../../libs/fvwmlib.h" isn't included, though function GetFontOrFixed is used.
	Since function name collision exists, rename CopyString() to
	CopyNString() in modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.c.

* Manual typo fix.
	See modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.man.

* modules/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan.c uses 'sysconf' function.
	Use 'GetFdWidth' instead.

	BSD/OS 2.1 (with NIS patch)/cc (gcc 2.7.2)
	FreeBSD 2.2-960612-SNAP/cc (gcc 2.6.3)
	NEWS-OS 4.2.1a+RD/gcc 2.5.8

Note:
	2.0.43 requires 'cpp should define __DATE__ and __TIME__ macro'.
	Some old-fasioned cpp doesn't define these.

Win95, and I think Fvwm95, automatically put the submenu to the left
of the parent menu, if it doesn't fit on the right.  This is good because
if makes it much easier to use the menu at the right edge of the screen.

Any chance of getting it into the main fvwm?  If it just requires a
patch to do so, I'll be happy to try to fit in the fvwm95 code (assuming
it exists).

No no no no!
That way the people who don't know how to unsubscribe stay, continually
asking, and those who do know (whom you claim are more deserving of staying)
can go!

Hell, it's only 4 lines and down the bottom - how big is the
inconvenience?

I've been doing this, since I found fvwm2.0.39, but nobody answered my
repeated inquiries on the list.

I was given a patch for this (from Dan Espen, I believe).  I was going
to put it in, but discovered it had some bugs so decided not to for
the time being as I didn't have time to play with it.

Something of this sort will most likely make it in eventually.

At least it is reason enough to change the name of the configuration file.

Personally, I don't much care, either way, since I've already done the
conversion, but as a PR move, I think naming the binary fvwm2 and
the config file .fvwm2rc, at least by default, is the way to go so that
we can make it easier for large sites to convert gradually to fvwm2,
without having to hack things during installation -- indeed, this is what
the current situation is, unless I'm mistaken, and what it should be,
so I guess writing an overlong sentence about it really overkill, but
it does remind me about the documentation, which I haven't read in detail
for quite a while, er, where was I, oh yes, what is the status of said
documentation and has anyone read it from beginning to end to see if it
is unnecessarily redundant or has missing pieces or other troubles, although
I seem to remember Chuck saying something about doing things in that
general direction.

My English teacher would have killed me.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Someone (I deleted the mail by mistake, so I can't tell who it is, sorry)
sent me a patch that opens a submenu to the left, if it doesn't fit
to the right.  The patch was for Fvwm95, but it was really simple and I
hand-applied it to fvwm-2.0.42/fvwm/menus.c (sorry, my mirror hasn't
got the almost-43 version yet).  The diff for fvwm2 is attached.

It seems to work, but I haven't tested it very thorougly, yet.

Could this be put into the main fvwm2?  I don't know if it needs a style
option, since the old behaviour is so difficult to use.  Before or after
2.1, as you prefer.

BTW, I use MWM menus, if that matters.  (I wouldn't know.)

It isn't a very big amount of bandwidth to waste.   It is sort of 
like the FAA message at the beginning of each flight.  (no not the 
one about penuts), the reason everyone knows that their seat cushion 
can be used as a floatation device in the unlikely event of a water 
landing is because they repeat it every time you fly.

New members might be wizes as fvwm & unix programming, but might not 
have taken the time to learn majordomo.  Besides.  How many of you 
save that note that got sent to you when you subscribed. (you 
know...the one that said don't throw me out?)

It isn't going to kill us to keep it, and it'l save people who don't 
know.

Mike

p.s. besides, perhaps chuck can sell advertising space to 
corporations willing to sponsor FVWM?

Um, that was supposed to be a MIME message, but it was lacking a the
proper Mime headers.  Specifically, it had:

	Mime-version: 1.0
	Content-type: multipart/mixed ;

The second line of the Content-type header is missing.  The automatic 
copy in my sent-mail folder has:

	Mime-version: 1.0
	Content-type: multipart/mixed ;
		boundary="==_Exmh_-15188782400"

which is as it should be.  Is this a problem with the mailing list software,
or is the problem somewhere else?

Bug in the list software; it eats continuation lines in the header.  I

No smiley, so I'll assume for a second that you're serious.  Sell ad space
where?  Not as long as the lists and web pages are on "my" (i.e. the State
of Texas and the US Government's) machines.

Since the MIME attachment thingy didn't work, I'll repost (I'll try the

it was made, thanks).

It still works.  I haven't exited fvwm since I started this patched version.

Hello Chuck, Hello Mark & Mark (didn't know if you were subscribed)

I guess you all noticed the rumor about using rsynth's say command as
FvwmAudioPlayCmd.

say only gets the first word as a parameter, no matter if quotes are
used or not.

A> try the following patch
A> FvwmAudio: Line 302

A> 	      else  {
A> 		message = strtok(NULL, " \t");
A> -		sound = strtok(NULL, " \t");
A> +		sound = strtok(NULL, "\n");
	    
A> 		if (!message || !*message || !sound || !*sound)

A> this worked for me.


This always uses the whole rest of the line as parameter to the
play command (which can be any command, thus the parameter doesn't
have to be a filename).
If this is going into the release it needs to be documented.

If the release isn't changed, at least the old behaviour (ignoring the
rest of the line after the first word) needs to be documented.
Also I think in this case we should respect quoted parameters
("These were the times.au").

I  just compared  the  patch that I   submitted for menus  to the left
versus the patch from Lars Wirzenius.

My approach involved tracking the leftmost menu position to avoid ever
having one menu atop another:


                   Menu1 -> Menu 2 --+
                                     |
            Menu3 <------------------+

Lars took the simpler approach of just putting the menu to the left if
there is no room to the right:

                   Menu1 -> Menu 2 --+
                                     |
                   Menu3 <-----------+

So you can end up  with Menu3 obscuring Menu1.  This  turns out not to
be a problem because  you have to  navigate thru Menu2  to get back to
Menu1 anyway.

Everything considered, I like Lars approach much better than mine.

I have no opinion on which is better, but I think I should stress here
that I didn't write that patch!  I just converted it from something
someone else mailed me (which was, I think, meant for Fvwm95).  I'd
say who I got it from, but I deleted the mail.  (Please speak up, whoever
you are, I at least am grateful.)

in FvwmAudio.c, Myname is used before definition,
the new builtin "string" was missing,
only the first parameter was given to the play command
(using the whole line is iseful for rsynth "say" or an arbitrary command)
being there I added an error message for unknown event mappings.

The patch applied by Lars to fvwm2 was made by me, originally for fvwm95.

What do you do with the mouse? Doesn't moving the mouse over menu1 hide
menu3 (unless you are careful where you move it).

BTW: Can we make an option not to warp the mouse when the menu is at the bottom
of the screen (this was the part of fvwm95 patch, but Lars removed it).

I have investigated the problem, and can reproduce it.

I have put together a patch which fixes it (and a related problem with
the "menu" command).

However, although my fix works, it doesn 'feel' right. I am including
it here so as Chuck can see one solution to the problem, but with the
hope he'll come up with a better fix :)

Well,  thats  one of the reasons  I  like the "Marko" approach better.
You  would move the  mouse off the right of  Menu 2, and circle around
Menu 1 to get to Menu 3.

If  you don't warp the  pointer to the  top  of the  menu, and you are
using mwm menus near the bottom of the  screen, the menu could come up
with the  pointer on a submenu  line.   Did the original patch  pop up
both menus?

Actually, it seems ok for now, so I'll just go with that.  When I
start cleaning things up later, perhaps I'll think about how to
reimplement it then.

Thanks,

Howdy all.

Just a quick note to let you all know that fvwm beta 2.0.43 is just
about ready, but needs some more small cleanup, and since I'm going on
vacation in a few moments, it'll have to wait until I get back next
week.  I tried to get it all done before I left, but fell just a
little short.

I hope to get it out there to you folks shortly after I return, like
Monday, July 8th if things go well when I return, which they should.

Thank you for your patience and support.

Later,
Chuck
