I agree with this: even more important than an open development model is
an open testing model (IMO).

The fvwm-workers list is the right place to announce alpha tests.  Once
one is announced, everyone on the list who has the time and motivation
should grab and test it, and report success/failure to the author (or
even to the entire workers list).  It will be up to Brady to decide when
a release has had "enough" testing... if he doesn't feel that it has he
should goose the fvwm-workers list and get more people to check it, and
probably give an idea of what parts are light.  It's purely up to him to
decide what's "enough" testing, obviously.

Perhaps the current readership of the lists is too dispersed and needs
to be retargeted, but a simple email announcement to each list restating
its purpose and how to get on/off the one(s) you don't want to be on
should be sufficient.  Also, the "hello" messages for these lists should
be reviewed and it should be made clear that if you're not willing to
run an alpha WM, you shouldn't be on the workers list.

One thing the Perl folks have done recently is include a script as part
of their test suite that can automatically mail a "success/failure"
report, grabbing such useful info as the system type, etc.  That might
be handy.

  roae> Thank you "Brady Montz", for taking the gauntlet.

Ditto, in spades.

Hey, does anyone know what ever happened to Rob?  Is he still around on
these lists or anywhere else?

Long time no hear.

Well, I envision this group of people as people I can count on to make a
sanity check over the release (and maybe others) so that I dont' get dozens of
duplicate bug reports from the fvwm-workers list. People who are just on the
fvwm-workers list will have no such expectations on them.

Could be. I know there are at least a few people who have the energy to
properly show off their configurations given the right stage. It will require
a dedicated maintainer. I don't know if such a person exists.

Let me just say that after 2.0.47, I will be moving to a CVS code base, and
haven't decided yet how testing will work after that. Since 2.0.47 has a lot
of patches, many of which are in code which my personal setup never uses, I
certainly need a small group of testers at this time.

This new patch adds a new .fvwm2rc command, NewHilightColor (ala
HilightColor).

syntax:

NewHilightColor  (foreground) (background) (topshadow) (bottomshadow)

again, to make fvwm2 look more like  mwm here's the eleet color combo:

AddToDecor Mwm

OK, finally. 2.0.47 is almost ready. I've been using it for a few days and it
seems to work for me :-)

I've decided that I'll just release it to fvwm-workers for final testing
before announcing it to the fvwm list. 

I'd like to have a public CVS repository set up ASAP. If possible, I'd like it
set up when I release 2.0.47 (I won't hold up fvwm 2.0.47 unless I have a
solid date on when CVS will be setup). I've only used CVS in a local setting,
so it's probably best if somebody with more experience sets that up (Jason
Tibbitts volunteered I recall).

Here's my proposal:

After 2.0.47, fvwm 2.0 goes into a feature freeze. So, I'd like two source
directories, one for 2.0.*, and one for fvwm 2.3 (when 2.0.* has stabilised
I'd like to release it as 2.2 so we're matching the linux and xemacs
convention of odd minor numbers denoting stable releases. So, 2.1 will have
to be skipped). 

I'd like to able to control read/write access to each source tree. Bonus
points for a page on the website which is automatically updated to list who
has access. 

I think a good initial policy might be that only I have write access to the
"stable" code, and everybody on the fvwm-workers list having full access to
the "unstable" code. I see no reason why everything shouldn't be
world-readable. 

It would be nice if all checkins resulted in mail being sent to fvwm-workers. 

Suggestions? Comments?

Yes, that's why this list is on the earth.

Hmm, This means that current 2.0.x series (you want to name as 2.1.x,
I suppose) is still in beta phase, then named "2.2.0" when released,
and further effort for stabilization for the code will be named as "2.2.x" ?

Can we do such r/w control within the SAME module (sorry I'm novice
user of CVS/CVSup, I do NOT know it can or not)? I think it may be bad
idea that "stable" code and "unstable" code are not the same module.

BTW, Is there any plan to provide CVSup/sup service ?

You're cutting it really close.  I leave the country tomorrow and am away
for just over three weeks.  I can check in sources if I get them within the
next two hours but if problems develop...

Why would you want two separate repositories?  Why not use branching?
That's the reason branches exist.  (Note that I'm not a CVS expert and
haven't tried to do serious cross-branch merges, but that's how other much
larger projects like, say, Mozilla, egcs, Gnome, etc. work.)

I haven't the time to do anything more than the basics now; I made it clear
when I was leaving, and this doesn't give me enough time to do any custom
hacking.  A CVS repository, an account, CVSweb and anonymous rsync I can
do.  If you want anything over that then it's either going to have to wait
until I get back or it's going to have to come from someone other than me.

I'm also wondered if 2.0 and 2.3 is NOT THE SAME MODULES.

I think both are the same 'fvwm' source, so there are only ONE MODULE
is needed (maybe in src/fvwm module, and aliased to fvwm), and then
make a branch and tagged it (we can use HEAD branch for stable or
unstable branch, so we maybe do not want to make two more
branches). It is very simple, and well-known way to do :-)

I'm also not an expert of CVS/CVSup but... merge the branch(es) is
(partly in some cases) automated. However, I think there is no support
in cvs to merge the two modules, for example, src/fvwm-2.0 and
src/fvwm-2.3. If so, it seems very natual for me; why we want to merge
an apple and a banana into one fruit :-)

Dunno, nobody's ever asked for it before.  I think anonymous rsync is much
better suited for the task of letting people just copy out the source than
something layered over CVS, but if it's easy to set up then I don't mind
running it.

Of course, it still remains to be seen whether I can get the sources and
get them incorporated before I go on vacation.  Otherwise, it will have to
fall on someone else's shoulders.

You're probably right. My only experience with branching was with RCS, which
made me (perhaps irrationally) predjudiced against the whole concept. 

If we have a way of sending all commit logs to the mailing list, it shouldn't
be too hard to keep order. 

As far as modules go, if we have two "global" cvs branches, then the modules
automatically will have two branches as well, and if someone wants to compile
the 2.3 FvwmButtons with 2.2 fvwm, then they can just do two checkouts. Don't
immediately see any way to make it much easier than that. 

Should be have a CVS module for each fvwm module?

The MWMDecorMax flag doesn't quite work correctly in fvwm2 2.0.46.
It's supposed to make the button look sunk in if the window has been
maximized (fwin->flags & MAXIMIZED) and we're using MWMButtons and the
MWMDecorMax flag is set.  IE:

Style "*" MWMButtons
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax

However, this doesn't work.  The whole thing seems rather confused.

If I put no MWMDecorMax lines in, then when I maximize a window I get
buttons 2 and 3 sinking in (sunk buttons are marked with X):

 1    3                           4    2
[ ]  [X]          Title          [ ]  [X]

Button 2 sinking I can understand, since the MWMDecorMaximize flag is
set in fvwm.c:1023:ResetAllButtons().  But I'm not at all sure why 3
sinks in as well.

Changing the definition of button 4 to:

AddToDecor login
+ ButtonStyle 4 5 50x20@1 20x45@1 50x80@1 80x45@0 50x20@0 MWMDecorMax

doesn't change the behaviour of my "login" decor windows (ie it still
sinks in button 2, but not 3), but changes my "xterm" decor windows to
sink in buttons 1, 4 and 2.

Playing with !MWMDecorMax is just as confusing.

My fvwm2rc is available as /usr/doc/fvwm2/examples/and1000.fvwm2rc.gz
on most Debian Linux boxes, or I can mail it to interested people.

Alternatively, when I find the semi-mythical stockpile of round tuits
I'll have a further look myself :)

Do you have MWMFunctions style flag in addition to MWMButtons?

True.

If I get some time I'll look as well.

Here's the alpha release of 2.0.47:

ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/fvwm/fvwm-2.0.47a.tar.gz

I haven't announced this to the general fvwm list yet. I will when bug reports 
come in at an acceptably low rate.

ChangeLog:

2.0.47
        1. FAQ updates
        2. Menu code & Move fixes & enhancements based on patch from
           Greg Badros [+ some bugfixes]
        3. Added SetEnv function (also from Greg's patch)
        4. Fixed some memory leaks
        5. Cleaned up some ugly code pointed out by Peter Seebach
           (like mystrcasecmp & mystrncasecmp - are these even needed
           anyways?  Is there any system that doesn't have the non-"my"
           versions?)
        6. Builtin WindowList no longer searches for xpm's in window
           titles (patch from Greg Badros)
        7. Various compiler fixes
        8. Created textures directory, put Martin Cartwright's
           "marbles" and textures from http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/ in
           there as a start
        9. Pager balloon window patch from Ric Lister
        10. Signal handler safety patches (based on patch from Grant
            McDorman)
        11. Cleaned up and consolidated allowed function checking code
        12. Made GetTwoArguments check for 'MxN' style numbers so cmds
            like 'DeskTopSize 2x3' will work (since the man page has
            always said that is the proper syntax)
        13. Fixed some minor parsing bugs
        14. Added check to GetWindowSizeHints to compensate for bad
            aspect ratios (fixes some windows that startup HUGE)
        15. Patch to FvwmButtons to add animated panels to it (like CDE
            or Wharf) from Jui-Hsuan Joshua Feng
        16. Brady Montz <bradym@cs.arizona.edu> is the new maintainer.
        17. The Imakefile for FvwmCpp sets FVWM_CPP to CppCmd. If Imake
            is incorrectly configured, you have to override this in Fvwm.tmpl.
        18. New version of FvwmIconMan

I'm not certain about item 15. I couldn't find anything obvious in the source
code or man page about animated buttons. Does anybody know if this patch
really got applied (chuck did everything up to item 16). 

Unless I've personally told you otherwise, I'm not going to accept any patches 
other than bugfixes. The 2.0 line is now in feature freeze for the 2.2
release. This is a good time for people to send in documentation and sample
fvwm2rc's though.

The good news  is  that it compiles  and  runs fine on Solaris  2.5.1,
Sparc 10, Sun's compiler.

There is   an empty directory  named "tmp"  in the  distibution that I
don't think you wanted to be there.

This is really bad news  for me.  There is no  way I  can move off  my
patched fvwm-2.0.46  without   the  "iconboxes"  and   "colorlimiting"
patches.  I had a firm commitment from Chuck  that these patches would
be included.

What do I  have to do  to get these  patches  included in some  future
release?

I too would like to see the iconboxes patch go in.  It was only after
this patch that I actually liked the way icons wre placed.

Cheers,
Tim.

while we are at bugs ...

I have a config file which uses the FvwmIconBox module but sets the height 
of the displayed Icons to zero, so that only the lable of the ocon is
displayed.

Whenever I start an application I get the follwoing error messages on the
console ... 

Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) 
Major opcode of failed request:  53 
Resource id of failed request:  0x0

maybe someone can fix this ... (don't know about X ... sorry )

New version:

ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/fvwm/fvwm-2.0.47b.tar.gz

Additions to ChangeLog:

        19. Changed prototype of bzero() in alpha_headers.h.
        20. Applied Iconbox patch which added new styles IconGrid and IconFill.
        21. Applied Colorlimit patch which adds ColorLimit command to set
            maxmimum number of colors fvwm can use for pixmaps.
        22. Applied DontFocusOffscreen patch.

I haven't really tested the Iconbox patch much, so go nuts.

I've not been able to reproduce this. I took the FvwmIconBox configuration
from the system.fvwm2rc bundled with fvwm, and changed the
*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize line to:

*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 64x0

And everything seems to work for me. Could you send me your .fvwm2rc?

	Well the problem (the same with others, I think) is that fvwm2 has 
changed too much!. My problem is that the menu system is one of the most 
changed areas, and it is impossible to apply (even by hand) my patch to 
improve menu look (it still needs an improve :), I will have to rewrite 
it from scratch (taking into accound the new WIN mode and the animated 
menus, although I think I will just ignore this last feature as it would 
be very expensive when using bitmaps and gradients).
	So I won't be able to post a patch until next week (I'm having final 
exams now, and *finally* I will have to study, just a bit ...:), and I 
really don't know about the new menus philosophy, I've been rewritting 
it, so we could change MenuStyle in a per-menu basis, but the new version 
ignore it and include new features as WINmenus (do we really need it? :), 
so I'm a bit puzzled.

	Other important (*VERY* important) thing is that you should made patches
available in the beta site, in order to improve development and to low 
bandwidth, I don't know about others but I connect to internet through a 
28.8 kbps modem, and telephone isn't free in Spain :)

OK. I think I would prefer your stuff to go into the 2.3 version anyway.

Good point. I'm putting a patch on the ftp site right now.

Well I have fvwm 2.0.47b running ok with Solaris 2.5 and X11R6.3.
The one problem I noticed is that the build did not set the LD_RUN_PATH.
It may be an issue with the Imakefile of my site.def file. I need to check
on this still. Anyone else have this problem? This is a shared library issue
where you need to tell the compiler at build time where to look for the
libraries at run time.

I have included a small patch (which defaults to False). It puts
"StipledTitles" in all window titles. This is the default behaviour for our
1000+ Unix boxes and 50,000 user base. It would save me alot of hassle if
you could incorporate it in 2.0.47, as it is small and does not effect
normal behavior.

Thanks,
Randall

This is most likely a solaris problem. This seems similar to a problem I had a
month or so ago when I was trying to compile fvwm on solaris for a class I was
teaching on window managers. I couldn't get fvwm to compile so that I didn't
need to have LD_RUN_PATH set in order for it to find the X libraries. I tried
every combination of linker and gcc flags that I could think of to set the
load path to include /usr/X11R6/lib, but nothing would work (although ldd
always could find the right libraries). I stopped using Suns when Solaris came
out, so I'm pretty clueless on that dialect of unix. I'd like to know if
anyone else has had a similar problem.

I'm uncertain of whether such a feature is really a good thing, but so many
people have wanted it for so long I'm putting it in. I think that in 2.3 I
want to make it so that you can better specify what the titlebar should look
like depending on the state of the window, in as flexible a way as possible. I 
was originally thinking about it in the context of FvwmIconMan, but it'll work 
just as well for titlebars. Every thing I can think of tends to look like
printf line noise/format strings, so I've never taken the plunge. Something to 
think about.

        Great! Another bug-fix patch I noticed missing is the 
MouseFocusOnStartup patch (it's in unofficial_patches) - Greg Badros'
SCWM code originally, I just translated the variable names to fit FVWM2.

        I'd certainly like to see the StackingOrder patch (also in
unofficial_patches) make it into the 2.2 base, but I can readily 
understand if you decline, since it's a late entry and rather more than 
a few lines of neatly localized code. (Of course, with the amount of 
Restarting I've been doing trying out the new code, the annoyance of 
having the window I was working in dropped to bottom of the stack *does* 
make me want to press for this one a bit....)


        Now for the bad stuff.... Despite the niceties it introduces, I
have to consider the new menu code seriously broken in its behavior when
you first pop up a top level menu (by clicking on the root window). It's
not really acceptable to have to move the mouse cursor out of the menu 
before releasing the button to make the menu stick. Also, the cursor
doesn't seem to warp reliably to the title entry, so I've several times
started programs by accident by quickly clicking on the root window only
to find that the menu code interpreted my action as clicking on a menu
item. 

        I thought this might not be too difficult to fix, but it requires 
deeper digging than I've had time to do this evening.

fvwm under solaris should compile with the /usr/openwin/ X11 installation.
Unfortunately the Imake support under solaris was broken until 2.6

the problem is described on
http://night.primate.wisc.edu/software/imake-stuff/imake-vs-openwin.html
there you can also find patches to fix the problem ... 

about shared libraries ... 

the LD_RUN_PATH variable must be set or every -L on the compiler commandline
should be accompanied by a -R pointing to the same place as the -L ...
otherwhise the solaris shared library loader will not find the X libraries
or any other library no located in /usr/lib ...

cheers

I can't help wondering if an auto-configured fvwm distribution would have
figured this out properly.  You can find autoconfigured fvwm 2.0.46
at:
	
	http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software/fvwm

I hope autoconfiguring will make it into fvwm mainline soon....

I'm over quota on my public ftp directory, and it's easier to set up another

ftp://fozzie.cs.arizona.edu/pub/fvwm

for the time being.

Hmmm... that's not the way it works for me.. a single click leaves the
menu window up.  The cursor shouldn't ever warp (I dislike warping
cursors, and there are good UI reasons to feel that way); instead the
menu position should be such that the top item (not necessarily the
title nor the first clickable item) falls neatly under the pointer.

Perhaps you could tell me your relevant settings... (I'm not sure what
they are offhand, unfortunately). I spend most of my wm-development time
on SCWM, but I don't mind trying to help out with fvwm2 as needed.

2.0.47b works fine for me.

The only quibble I have is the change to the menu pop-down logic: if
you click down on the root window to pull up a menu, then move off the
menu, and let go, the menu stays up.  It used to dissappear.  I have
the menus appear using "Popup", rather than "Menu".

I don't see the problem someone else mentioned where the pointer is
warped to the wrong place, causing them to select an option rather
than cancelling.  The pointer warps to the menu title reliably, even
when menus are forced to the edges of the screen.

I'm using Linux (2.1.103) with a libc6-based Debian system.

There are some doc updates needed - I'll get a patch to you at some
stage; it's mainly manpage cleanups.

        Unfortunately, I'm not sure what they'd be, either. I didn't
add any of the new fvwm2rc settings like SetAnimation or SetMenuDelay,
so I'd think that MenuStyle would be the only applicable thing. I start
up with something like

        MenuStyle white MidnightBlue bisque [font-spec] fvwm

then I've added a little popup menu of six items to set fvwm, mwm, and 
win, with and without anim, so I can test without restarting.

        The starting of an app when the first button release is over
an item in the root menu (and the mouse has not moved) happens with
mwm and win menus but not fvwm menus. (This condition occurs when the
menu is too tall to fit on the screen if the top item is placed under
the mouse cursor.)

        In all cases, however, the menu refuses to stay up unless I
hold the mouse button down till I've moved the cursor outside the menu.
(This looks to be the intent of the code in MenuInteraction around line
534, to judge from the comment.)

        If you can think of any setting I've overlooked, please let me
know.

        OK, I tinkered with menus.c a little, and the following patch
seems to restore the sticky menu handling that we've been used to in
fvwm2.

        Since I've not had the time to dig too deeply into the menu
code, though, my concerns are: what was the actual intent of the new
code, does this patch produce any nasty side effects (haven't seen 'em
yet), and are there possibly pieces missing from the version we have
in 2.0.47b? (Hmm.... I just noticed that WinList exhibits the same
no-stick-on-click behavior - this patch doesn't affect it.)

        Also, Greg, I'm completely at a loss to understand why it
seemed to work differently for you. In any case, does this look like
a reasonable change?

I'll look into this, but probably not until Friday.  The main
motivations for the menu changes were:

1) Provide reasonable keyboard-based behaviour;  the old menus were
abysmally bad at managing menus with keystrokes (right-arrow moved the
pointer over some fixed number of pixels, instead of doing something
conceptually appropriate, etc.)

2) Deal better with the "out-of-space-at-right-side-of-screen" problem; 
animating top level windows out of the way turned out to be a pretty
nifty effect (on a reasonably fast server) and seems like the right thing

3) Generalize the code to handle deep menus; the old code only handled
depths of up to 3, because static variables were used to hold, e.g., the 
prior menu and the one before that.

The code is not trivial, but neither was the old code.  The new menuing
code isn't a few features chucked into crap, it's rewritten from first
principles, twice!  (My machine crashed after the first rewrite, before
my weekly backup, so I had to redo everything---better!)

I'll look into your patch and see if I can figure out what's the reason
for the different behaviour -- I've not looked at the code in a while,
and my rewrite for SCWM is pretty different, unfortunately (we were
shooting for more flexibility, there, though it still doesn't have
animated menus).

I added some minor bug fixes and made fvwm look even more like mwm.  One
of the changes includes an increase in the height of the title bar by 1 pixel.
The fvwm2rc is a simple example with title bar buttons that look like the
mwm buttons.

Enjoy.

following are:

	Bugs
		sorry, only bugreports, no patches
		(I limit myself to testing - don't have the time now)


unpacking comments:
    tar -zxvf fvwm-2.0.47b.tar.gz

    tar: Could not write to file fvwm-2.0.47b/modules/FvwmPager/FvwmPager.h: Invalid argument

    tar: Could not write to file fvwm-2.0.47b/extras/FvwmWharf/README: Invalid argument

    don't know what happened, could be NFS.


    tar -zxvf fvwm-2.0.47b.tar.gz fvwm-2.0.47b/modules/FvwmPager/FvwmPager.h
    fvwm-2.0.47b/modules/FvwmPager/FvwmPager.h

    tar -zxvf fvwm-2.0.47b.tar.gz fvwm-2.0.47b/extras/FvwmWharf/README
    fvwm-2.0.47b/extras/FvwmWharf/README

    so this worked. Probably a NFS timeout.



Build comments:


-)  Fvwm.tmpl
    #define HasXpm  YES     /* NO */
                  ^^

    two whitespaces !!!
    this has produced severe problems in the past (some old compilers don't cut
    spaces)

    It's no problem for me any more.


-)  I still had to 

    xmkmf; make all; make install; make install.man
           ^^^^^^^^
    otherwise the lib isn't built, thus all other targets fail.

    I think the 'install' target should build the library.

-)  unluckily there's not much use in using make -j -l2.5 (parallel make)
    because of the batch-character of the main makefile (imake).

    I tried an aggressive make (all on one line):
	
	make clean ; xmkmf ; nice make -j -l2 Makefiles ; 
        nice make -j -l2 all install install.man 

    resulting in several .c files being compiled twice.
    (more precise: in parallel:
	the toplevel Makefile has independent rules for 'all' and 'install'
	so 2 different makes are executed in each directory in parallel.)

	> nice make -j -l2 -n all install install | egrep '\.\.\.$'
	making all in ./libs...
	installing in ./libs...
	installing in ./fvwm...		(but dependent of 'all' -> make 'all' first)
	making all in ./fvwm...		(this competes with the above process)
	installing in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
	making all in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
	... and so on.


	the individual makefiles (except the 'libs' one) _have_ 'install'
	depending on 'all', so there's 2 makes taking care of 'all'.


    so one safe way is:	
	make clean ; xmkmf ; nice make -j -l2 Makefiles ; 
	nice make -j -l2 -C libs ; nice make -j -l2 install ;
	nice make -j -l2 install.man 

	(note that the library has to be taken care of separately, 
	because 'install' doesn't build the lib.)

   or :
	make clean ; xmkmf ; nice make -j -l2 Makefiles ; 
	nice make -j -l2 all ; nice make -j -l2 install install.man

   anyway: you almost can't use parallel make to make fvwm2.

   usually the load is at 0.22 for normal make over NFS (the net is
   sometimes the limiting factor).

   ----- want to say: the make process still needs work & optimizations.



Bugs 

-) DestroyMenu doesn't work reliably. My .fvwm2rc contains:

	DestroyMenu New-Windowmanager
	AddToMenu New-Windowmanager "&Restart Fvwm2" Restart /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2
	# /net/einstein/home/einstein/albrecht/bin/fvwm2
	+	"&local Fvwm2"	Restart /homes/albrecht/bin/fvwm2
	+	"Start &Fvwm"	Restart	fvwm
	+	"Start &twm" 	Restart	twm
	+	"Start tvtwm" 	Restart	tvtwm
	+	"Start &mwm" 	Restart	mwm
	+	"Start &olwm" 	Restart	/usr/openwin/bin/olwm

   after rereading .fvwm2rc (from another menu), most menus had
   duplicated entries. After insertion of empty lines after DestroyMenu,
   and rereading .fvmw2rc several times, I get from 1 to 3 copies of the
   menu entries.

   I found this bug, because fvwm barfs at duplicate hotkey usage. :-)

   also my mouse bindings seem to be somewhat duplicated

-) maybe that's related: I after all that rereading my .fvwm2rc, I opened 
   the windowlist:
   after selecting an entry, another windowlist popped up.
   after that, another one. 
   after some 8-9 clicks, I was able to get rid of that 'sticky' window
   list. When I tried again, it didn't go away after some 30 clicks.
   Then I killed fvwm2.

-) the windowlist doesn't have any indication of stat any more.
   there used to be prentheses around the geometry for iconified windows.

-) resizing FvwmButtons doesn't resize the bottons inside any more.
   in 2.0.45 (don't know of .46) my swallowed xterm, buttons & pager
   were resized, if I resized Fvwmbuttons.
   2.0.47b doesn't do that. Instead there's a bigger / smaller 
   lower & right margin (background color)

-) the old bug of a second pager appearing after a time is still there.

-) keybindings that worked under .45 don't work any more:

    # these are working fine.
	Key KP_Home	A	CM	Scroll -100 -100
	Key KP_Prior	A	CM	Scroll +100 -100
	Key KP_End	A	CM	Scroll -100 +100
	Key KP_Next	A	CM	Scroll +100 +100

	Key KP_Left	A	CM	Scroll -100    0
	Key KP_Right	A	CM	Scroll +100    0
	Key KP_Up	A	CM	Scroll    0 -100
	Key KP_Down	A	CM	Scroll    0 +100

	#Key KP_Begin	A	CM	TogglePaging
	Key KP_Substract A	CM	KillModule FvwmAuto
	Key KP_Add	A	CM	Module FvwmAuto 300

    # these 4 don't work any more.
	Key Home	A	CM	Scroll -100 -100
	Key Prior	A	CM	Scroll +100 -100
	Key End		A	CM	Scroll -100 +100
	Key Next	A	CM	Scroll +100 +100

    # these 4 do work ok.

	Key Right	A	SCM	Scroll +10  0
	Key Up		A	SCM	Scroll  0   -10
	Key Down	A	SCM	Scroll  0   +10


-) FvwmAuto isn't the newest version.
   FvwmAudio was superseded by FvwmEvent - more general.
   (chuck said he'd be trying to include it in .47)

   the newest Versions of FvwmAuto & FvwmAudio as well as my .fvwm2rc are
   at <http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~albrecht>
   Never mind that it states 2.0.45 there: the other versions are even
   older.

   I already merged FvwmAuto.
   (chuck put in some obscure-and-not-very-well-documented #ifdef's in his
   copy, while I did further enhancements in my development tree.)

   I will have a look on FvwmEvent / FvwmAudio in the next days.

        Ok, here's a revision of yesterday's patch that makes the WinList
menu stick as well. Other than this quirk, I'm really pleased with the

I have this problem all the time with Solaris.  Which is why I try to
avoid it when possible (I'm not keen on it's ld.so implementation --
but, on a positive side, it's better than BSDi's version).

If you're using GCC2 (which I am), you can always pass -Rpath when
linking.  It tells GCC to build in the path to look for shared libs.
I think I set my site.def (or whatever) to do this since I have two
copies of X11 installed (don't ask, long story).

If this is still unclear, let me know and I'll try to figure out what
I really did...

Sender: owner-fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list

I have run into a problem with fvwm2.0.47b right from the start.

My problem is that when the window manager starts, my FvwmButtons starts at a
different geometry location then I specified in the file.

I use a separate config file for Fvwmbuttons.  I have the following in my "rc"
file:

*FvwmButtonsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm2.0.47/buttons/fvwmbuttons

and this is the line in that file for the geometry:

Geometry +1228+133

Instead of the above location, Fvwmbuttons start at +1264+327.

When I execute a re-start of fvwm2 it moves FvwmButtons to +1264+327.

What could cause this behavior?

I have compiled fvwm2.0.47b with gcc version 2.8.0, x11r6.1 under Solaris 2.5.1
with the works.

The only other problem I noticed is one that has already been mentioned.  My
default menus will not stay up with just a click of the mouse over the desktop. 
I have to hold the mouse down, sweep across the box and then the menus will stay
up.

My previous version of fvwm2 is fvwm2.0.45, and I have not had any of these
problems.

The menu problem doesn't bother me as much as the location problem of the
FvwmButtons.

Just thought I would let you all know.

Thank You

Your patch looks great-- the first change you made is the way my fvwm2
is built (must've been a change that I made after the patch got posted); 
the second change is an improvement on my code (my window list *does*
act quirkily as you suggest).

Brady, it'd be a great improvement if you could make Bob's small
changes.

Thanks,
Greg

Speaking of man pages, I  don't see the "win" style  or the "anim" arg
in  the  fvwm2 man  page under "MenuStyle".    If Greg or someone else
doesn't have this  on hand, I will  volunteer to create  the patch for
this.

Nope, looks like I forgot to update the man page there.  Mine does have
docs for my new SetAnimation and AnimatedMove primitives -- did these
make it into the docs for 2.0.47b?

Thanks,

Is there an archive for the worker's list?  I found the fvwm archive,
and if I examine the "threads" section, for example, it contains the
worker's messages.

But if I download the entire June archive, only the fvwm list messages
are included there, not the fvwm-workers messages.

Can I get the latter as a bulk download somewhere?

Compiled and tested in HP-UX 9.05 (with none of the patches mailed
here):

usleep is not available in HP-UX 9, so I got lazy and used nap(3X)
instead which uses milliseconds and requires #include <codelibs/nap.h>
and -lcodelibs.

Nor is usleep available in HP-UX 10.01, and nap is no more available
(there is, for example, nanosleep). usleep can be used in HP-UX 10.20.

Unfortunately no patches included. I kludged a solution for myself and
I'm too lazy/busy to sort out problem completely...

Second try for an answer.

I have compiled fvwm2.0.47b on Solaris 2.5.1, using gcc 2.8.0, x11r6.1
successfully.

The only problem I have is that FvwmButtons refuses to start in location I have
indecated in my fvwmbuttons file.

The following is the line specifiying my fvwmbuttons file:

*FvwmButtonsFile /home/misha21/.fvwm2.0.47/buttons/fvwmbuttons

And this is the "fvwmbuttons" file (I know this is long, sorry):

Instead of starting at position +1228+139, Fvwmbuttons start at +1264+333.

Does anyone have any idea why or how this could happen.

I use the same "fvwmbuttons" file with fvwm2.0.45 and have no problems.

Thank you for any and all help.

Here's a replacement for usleep() I've used in the past for those
systems which don't have it:

  #include <stdlib.h>

  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/time.h>
  #ifdef _HAVE_SYS_SELECT
  #include <sys/select.h>
  #endif

  int
  usleep( unsigned long usec )
  {
      struct timeval timeout;

      timeout.tv_usec = usec % (unsigned long) 1000000;
      timeout.tv_sec = usec / (unsigned long) 1000000;
      select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &timeout);

      return (0);
  }

FWIW.

So far fvwm 2.0.47b seems to be OK for me on my SunOS system, although I
haven't tested it extensively (I installed Bob Woodside's menu patch).

I'm disappointed that the autoconf changes won't make it into 2.0.47,
because autoconf is so much easier to work with than Imake (ugh).

But, it's more important to get out a stable version so if this helps
speed that up... let's go!

I sat down and tested some different WM's one day.. and when I tried
gwm, I saw what a nice pager it had.. It was resizing dynamically, so
to get more space, you'd just move more in one direction, and viola.

It kinda zoomed out in the pager, so the "preview windows" got smaller
the more space you had.. This seems to be a pretty neat feature..
Anyone feel like hacking it into fvwmpager?

God I hate HP-UX. 

I no longer have access to an HP to try things out. Can anyone suggest which
#ifdef I should protect this with?

I added a rule to the libs/Imakefile which should fix this.

I think we should forget about parallel make since we are going to be moving
to autoconf in the near future.

Well, once you move to autoconf this won't be a problem ;)

Actually, usleep exists on HP-UX 10.10, at least.  It's not there on
HP-UX 9.01 (these are the only two HP-UX versions I have access to).

I don't have any good ideas in an Imake environment, except to put a
note in the README for HP-UX 9.xx telling people to change an Imakefile
to set a constant like _DONT_HAVE_USLEEP.  Or something.

The "select" seems to be portable, you may want to just  use it in all
cases.

I've put 2.0.47c at:

ftp://fozzie.cs.arizona.edu/pub/fvwm/fvwm-2.0.47c.tar.gz
ftp://fozzie.cs.arizona.edu/pub/fvwm/fvwm-2.0.47b-2.0.47c.patch.gz

Changes since version b:

	25. Added FvwmEvent module (successor to FvwmAudio). Replaced
	    FvwmAudio with a program which prints out message to use
	    FvwmEvent. 
	26. Added a usleep() for machines which don't have them. Set
	    HAVE_USLEEP accordingly in configure.h.

also, put some lines in libs/Imakefile so that make install builds libfvwm2.a, 
and applied the sticky meny patch.

	I have finished my exams, so I have more spare time to work on it, 
but as you (Brady) say that you would prefer it to be in the 2.3 version, 
I wonder if I should work (*hard*) to include it in the 2.0.47c (the last 
I have) or if I should wait until 2.3 version.

	Anyway I would try my best to understand the new menus scheme, although
IMHO, the scheme I had made for the newmenus patch was a more flexible 
approach.

This is a patch for Fvwm.tmpl that takes care of the "shared library" issue
for my Solaris machines. I turned it in last week but did not hear any
comments back on it.

I have successfully built fvwm-2.0.47b with this patch on the following
platforms and various releases of X11R6.

alpha_dux40 hp700_ux90 rs_aix42 sgi_62 sun4m_55 sun4m_56


The patch basically changes;
$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS) $(LDOPTIONS).......

to

$(CCENVSETUP) $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS) $(LDOPTIONS).....


I do not think this will cause anyone else a problem but would be interested
to hear if it did.

CCENVSETUP is defined in the X11 config tree.

If it does not cause a problem, it should probably be included.

Thanks,
Randall

	Well, I have finished integrating my patch into the new 2.0.47c, it 
changes lots of things in menus.c and builtins.c but it was easier to 
apply it than I had expected. I'm waiting for Brady Montz answered to my 
previous question about including it in the first stable version (I think 
the code is very stable, even more than current menu code, that by the 
way segfaults in MenuInteraction while processing the isgraph() function, 
I have replaced it by the old code in 2.0.46). The problem with my patch 
is that it changes things a lot, and may be Greg J. Badros wouldn't like 
it but.....

	I will post it tomorrow after a bit of testing so everybody in this 
mailing list could test it against their config files.

PS: Greg I'm having problems with the popdown of a menu when other menu 
is popped from it (I mean rootmenu->the_menu_give_problem->child_menu) 
which doesn't get popped down correctly and is just keep there, this only 
happen with my new style :( which is very similar to MWM, at least in the 
way it handles popdown menus, if you have changed something related with 
this issue I should know please notify it to me, thanks.
