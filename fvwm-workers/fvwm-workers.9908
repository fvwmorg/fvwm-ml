     the same problem.
     [Eterm bug fixed, rxvt doesn't work very well with transparent
     background. I've reported to the rxvt mailing list]

 23) Check if bug #312 is still there.
     [fixed]
 24) Investigate bug #314.
     [fixed]
 25) Investigate dying pager on desk-to-desk transfers (bug #358 et al.)

 27) Check if bug #334 is still a problem.
     [fixed]

The good news is that since the cursor is warped to the edge
of the window when resizing from a keystroke we don't need
rounding up anymore. I will remove it.

You should use CurrentPage instead if you don't like this. Unfortunately
I broke the CurrentPage condition a while ago. Will be fixed soon.

I suggest you enter this as an enhancement request into Jitterbug
so it doesn't get lost.

Is that what you mean, Paul (PDS)?

  AddToMenu QuitCDEMenu
  + "Really quit?" Exec /usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession

Looks trivial to me.

I don't quite understand what you're asking for. Apart from the
fact that our documentation is not nearly good enough to make
beginners happy with it, what is the problem with the FAQ here?

Yes, you're right. We have already fixed this in the development

I can't see this, neither with 2.2, 2.2.2 or current CVS. Can you send me

This has to work and it does indeed work for me. It doesn't matter at all
how many subshells bash invokes. Fvwm should simply fork off a bash that
is running asynchronously. Fvwm doesn't care what the process does.

(my bash version is 2.02.1)

Then the option must be named NonResizeSwallow or similar, not MaxSwallow.
I'd prefer to leave MaxSwallow as is (maybe 55x57 changed to 64x64 or 
60x60) and to add a new option, but I can't judge (I don't use FvwmWharf).

Also, I am not sure what to do with applications larger than 64x64,
they will occupy the surrounding buttons with this patch applied. I will
add a limit to 64x64, or is there a better solution?

Regards,
Mikhael.

The note above is not correct. :)
To Ben Winslow: did you manage to run the module using Exec Module?
SwallowModule works without problems. I will restore the removed man page
line about SwallowModule and add an example usage line.

There must not be a question here if you quit immediately. :)

A little bit off topic. Probably QuitSession fvwm command will work here.
I really miss an additional SM to test these recent *Session commands.
I know, they don't work well, but they don't work differently for
different SM's. xsm is too buggy and gnome-session is under developement.

Does anyone run CDE or other proprietary SM with the current CVS version?
Please mail me, I would like to ask to test some things.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Exec Module was the only way I could get the module to actually run-- when I
used SwallowModule, FvwmWharf tried to run the module as if it were a
program in my $PATH (because it strncmp'd the Swallow, and ignored the
rest), so no communication between fvwm was set up, etc, etc, and it didn't
work.

You are right in that Swallow and SwallowModule have the same meaning
(as far as I can understand from the source code). But if you put the word
Module (no need in Exec) you will launch a module, not an application.
I have added this to the man page.

Mikhael.

After a brief dalliance with GNOME/Enlightenment/WindowMaker/Afterstep, I've
come back to my FVWM roots.

FVWM has a lot of advantages over these other window managers. But one
thing it hasn't got is a modern-looking logo. It would be nice if we had a
logo which somehow reflected its great qualities: speed, compactness,
elegance, efficiency... 

So, calling all artists! If you have some time and would like to make a logo
for fvwm, please send it to me at alanho@princeton.edu. I'll post all
submissions at http://www.princeton.edu/~alanho/fvwm/. Come take a look at the
one I made. Perhaps when we get a good one we the humble users can contribute
something to this great project.

Nice logo. It would be well to have more artists participating.
Please consider keeping images in .jpg or .gif format, not .png or .xpm,
so the folks using Netscape Navigator 3 (or any other) could see them.
Also, please consider joining the Fvwm Logo Context by Pat Rogan at:
  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/fvwmlogo.html

Okay, let's try something different. In the file move_resize.c you will
find this passage (current CVS):

      if (opaque_move && !IS_ICONIFIED(tmp_win) && !IS_SHADED(tmp_win))
        {
	  /* send configure notify event for windows that care about their
	   * location */
          XEvent client_event;
          client_event.type = ConfigureNotify;
          client_event.xconfigure.display = dpy;
          client_event.xconfigure.event = tmp_win->w;
          client_event.xconfigure.window = tmp_win->w;
          client_event.xconfigure.x = xl + tmp_win->boundary_width;
          client_event.xconfigure.y = yt + tmp_win->title_g.height +
	    tmp_win->boundary_width;
          client_event.xconfigure.width = Width - 2 * tmp_win->boundary_width;
          client_event.xconfigure.height = Height -
	    2 * tmp_win->boundary_width - tmp_win->title_g.height;
          client_event.xconfigure.border_width = 0;
          /* Real ConfigureNotify events say we're above title window, so... */
          /* what if we don't have a title ????? */
          client_event.xconfigure.above = tmp_win->frame;
          client_event.xconfigure.override_redirect = False;
          XSendEvent(dpy, tmp_win->w, False, StructureNotifyMask,
		     &client_event);
#ifdef FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS
          fvwm_msg(DBG,"SetupFrame","Sent ConfigureNotify (w == %d, h == %d)",
                   client_event.xconfigure.width,
		   client_event.xconfigure.height);
#endif
	}

I guess if you remove this part your application will work smoothly
again.

  Changed to "if (0 && opqaue_move && ...".

  That's the ticket! So - what's this bit of code do? I mean, I can see
roughly what it's about, but what's its raison d'=EAtre?

  In particular, why would it cause a spew of expose events to this one
particular app. and no others that I've tried (including the demo one tha=
t
comes with the GUI builder in question)?

It *doesn't* cause expose events. It sends ConfigureNotify events to the
application, i.e. it informs the application of poistion and size changes.
The application should not redraw itself if it was not resized. So I guess
it's the fault of this application. Probably written wuite minimalistic:
It simply redraws itself whenever something happens with it (expose/move/
resize ...).

If you can get your hands on the sourced I bet you'll see that
it redrawn when it gets a ConfigureNotify event. Perhaps the
ConfigureNotify handler is even the same as the Expose
handler.

Sending ConfigureNotify events is really the right thing to do
(I believe it's even required by the ICCCM). If I remeber
correctly this is important for apps that have a transparent
background that they draw themselves depending on their position
on the screen.

  I'm misunderstanding something, then. I only got this info. by running
the app. via xscope, and *that* reports truckloads of expose events
hitting the app. from the server ... I wasn't looking for ConfigureNotify
events (I'll try later), so I guess it could be possible that these are
turning up, then the app.'s doing something that causes the server to send
loads of exposes ... but I looked for something suspicious going back the
other way and couldn't see anything likely. Oh well.

  No chance of that, unfortunately.

  Fair enough. I'll either live with it, or (more likely) patch my fvwm
whenever I build it.

Might a bug report to the application developers help?

I just attempted to answer Lee's question, but ran into problems.
I tried both of these commands:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm/fvwm-web checkout fvwm-web
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm-web

Either I have the command wrong, or there's a problem
with the server.

I also tried this from our CVS instructions:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm

it gives me:

cvs checkout: cannot find password
cvs [checkout aborted]: use "cvs login" to log in first

HELP!

Some time ago, fvwm2 hanged and the only way I could stop it was to kill
the X server with Ctrl+Alt+Back.

I just wondered, wouldn't it be nice if we could restart fvwm2 by
sending a SIGHUP signal from the console?

Greetings,

Tung

I suspect the second line should work, though I have never checked out
fvwm-web myself.  Did they give you the same error message about "cvs
login" as below?

You'd get this if you have never used anonymous@cvs before.  You normally
use dane@cvs, right?  Try doing what it says!

	cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm login

This is what I thought too and all works fine, but...
I can only guess why this command is needed, since my ~/.cvspass already
had :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm entry (the second one)
and was not changed (even the modification date) after this login command.
Seems like a bug to me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I sent this to the fvwm-workers list, but it never came through, nor did
it bounce back, so I'm not sure what happened. I asked fvwm-owner, but got
no reply. Could you commit my patch (or at least help me get it to the list)?

----- Forwarded message from "Eric Gillespie, Jr." <epg@pobox.com> -----

Since it looks like no one else is doing it, I've begun adding GNOME support
to FvwmGtk. I've attached the first patch. In order for it to work, I need
someone to create a new directory for the GNOME autoconf macros. Below is
the URL to a tarball containing that directory.

Larry, can you please verify if this problem is gone with
the current 2.3.6 snapshot? I have made several fixes that
might influence this.

  I'd [tentatively - not having looked at what that would incur!] go along

Hmm, well I follow both lists :)   The reason I asked on the other was
so that any good replies would be seen by all, not just developers ...
I realise that you guys are doing work on getting together some
screenshot stuff, but I was wondering whether it was accessible on the
fvwm.org site. If not when could we expect it?

The reason for asking is I just upgraded (??) to RedHat 6.0 which is
based on fvwm2.2 so I was looking for an overview of what could be done
so I could redesign my layout unfortunately I couldn't find anything ...

Cheers,
Lee.

After a quick look at the code, HUP performs the quit function but USR1 does a restart, so you could just use that signal from the console instead.

It wouldn't be too difficult to do. SIGHUP currently terminates fvwm2,
but a small change could associate it with the Restart() handler
function instead. Actually, SIGUSR1 currently causes fvwm2 to restart
so maybe you could try this and tell us whether this is what you had
in mind?

Cheers,
Chris.

I had tried to login, but forgot the guest password.

After a successful attempt I got a new entry in .cvspass for

:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm

 vs.

:pserver:anonymous@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm

Yeah, that happened to me, too, with my 'steve@cvs...' login.  Sometime
during the month that I was offline replacing my computer, and installing
debian, the server switched over to 'cvs.fvwm.org', it appears.


By the way: you can simply edit the .cvspass file to change this!

And if you have checked out sources from the old "cvs.hpc.uh.edu" machine,
you can switch them over to the new machine name, by simply changing
all the CVS/Root files on your disk...

Yeah, that's true.

Maybe the original poster's problem is that he/she has something in a
.bashrc file that stops and waits for input, or does something similarly
odd.  Changing to #!/bin/sh means that the BASH-specific startup files are
not run, which explains the change in behaviour.

Try running the script, then look at 'pstree' to see what is hanging the
script.  Or check carefully through .bashrc (and maybe something in /etc
?).

P.S.  The way to kill a shell script is with SIGHUP.  I think you have to
kill off any children, first, though.

Full_Name: Derek Murphy
Version: 2.2.2 (and 2.2)

OS: Linux-2.2.10
X_Server: XF86_Mach64
Submission from: (NULL) (216.13.129.193)


I couldn't get the bugtracker to let me search on keyword 'panel', so my
apologies if this is old news to you.

I have multiple panel definitions for multiple FvwmButtons definitions.
If the last entry in a panel definition is continued on three lines, and
the next entry is another, different, panel definition for the same
FvwmButtons, the whole thing does not display.

That sounds awkward, but here's an example. IF you comment out the last 
button in 'CommPanel' (Netscape) below, it won't allow the entire
RootPanel
to display because the previous entry is 3 lines. As long as the next
entry
is a different type of 'FvwmButtons' (not just another Panel), three lines
is ok.

Have I found a bug? If so, where is it? I _guess_ a parser of some sort,
but
I *really* don't know enough C to find it.

The excerpt: (notes below)

AddToFunc InitFunction  "I"     Module FvwmButtons
+                       "I"     Module FvwmBacker

+                       "I"     Module FvwmButtons RootButtons
+                       "I"     Module FvwmButtons UserButtons

Since you guys were talking about it...  and i like my soln better than
the FAQ version...

These files will add FVWM as an option in the dtlogin window.  much
easier than fiddling w/ CDE's configs on a user by user basis.  the final=
 =

locations are in the files.  for the FVWMlogo.?m files, they go in =


/usr/dt/appconfig/icons/C/

(and, yes, the pix/bitmaps are ugly, got a better one? =3D)

the post_inst is a local config file, but has some useful info.

Hi Jason, seems like we haven't heard from you in a while.

I'd like to get the fvwm-web project moving again.

My plan was to move all the static content pages into the fvwm-web source
tree and have you set up a cron or some other process that would
automatically propagate changes from CVS onto the fvwm web pages.

I think fvwm-web is ready to go.

Is this OK with you?

Do have some time to set this up?

(I know fvwm/docs/README is out of date, and I haven't decided where
"fvwm/docs/run_man2html.sh" and "fvwm/docs/txt2html.sh" should sit,
but they don't need any change at this time.)

I've been here the whole time, but we're building a cluster and a lab here
at UH so I've been rather busy.  I am in the weird position of having just
way too much hardware.

DE> I'd like to get the fvwm-web project moving again.

Yep, Dom sent me a message this morning.  My plan is to set up the script
on xxx.fvwm.org and make sure it works.  This will probably happen this
evening.  Of the content is OK, I'm considering just moving the web pages
to the new machine.  It's running Linux and is so much easier to maintain
than the Alpha running DU we're using currently.

In any case, the move of the FTP site and CVS tree need to happen soon as
well, so I do have some work ahead of me.

I'll you know when the web pages are set up.

You can instead use a CVS loginfo rule to be executed on commits.  I do
this for my home page, and we do this for Scwm.  In loginfo, something like:

^scwm-web ( date; ( sleep 2; cd /home/httpd/html/scwm; cvs update -dP ) &) >> /usr/local/home/gjb/cvslog/err-scwm-web 2>&1

works great for us.

That was my fault. Dominik pointed out that the mailing list won't accept
mail from hosts whose names do not resolve. I got an account with dyndns, so
the problem is solved.

Well, it only works if the web server and the CVS server are the same
machine, which they aren't currently.  You can play with rsh and such, but
it's much simpler to put it in crontab until everything is unified.

It also doesn't deal well with folks who make lots of little changes.  You
have no locking between the multiple update processes that result and the
end product isn't always pretty.

I did use this method for a while with the Majordomo cvs tree, but I
encountered one problem too many.

No, I don't know about something similar. Sounds interesting. And it is
not very hard to implement in perl. The syntax can be very simple.
Something like blocks of perl code (to be eval'ed) and plain configuration
lines with perl variables (to be expanded). Also it is nice to have an
implementation of fvwm-module protocol in perl. It must be an object
oriented (Fvwm::Module, Fvwm::Packet), so anyone else can inherit to
write his own fvwm-module. This is the hardest part.

Actually, there is a nice object-oriented Barry Warsaw's Python interface
to fvwm-module (for fvwm-2.2?), which can be a good starter. There is a
link from fvwm.org.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It's a thought I've had, as I try to update my X11::Fvwm module to work on
the 2.2 series. But there were some pretty heated discussions a year or so
back, when people started suggesting language support in reference to the
current config file syntax (see discussions of scwm, which was where it
started).

As for the X11:Fvwm module itself, I'm still pretty short on round tuits.
I recently left my contract gig at HP for a permanent gig with RedHat (and
yes, I still use fvwm, to the exclusion of E :-). So I've been mostly all
about todying up loose ends at HP and starting anew at RH here of late.

I think I got this wrong, sorry. The reason for rounding up is to do
with resizing xterms with the mouse with sloppyfocus/mousefocus.  If the
resize rubberband is rounded down in size there is a high probability
that when the resize is finished the pointer will be outside the window
and the focus will change.

I did the round-up change at the same time as the start-resize-immediate
change and forgot which change was for what.

Could we put the round-up back and fix the resize off the edge of the
screen some other way?

Cheers,
Tim.

There's John Lapeyre's fvwmconf which is an FVWM module written in
Perl.  Might be a good start.  I think there's a link from the FVWM
pages.

Could folks poke about on xxx.fvwm.org and make sure that there are no
broken links or other issues?

Currently I'm seeing these:

1) fvwm-cats is an absolute URL.  No big deal, but I do have it checked out
   with the rest of the documents.

2) the manpages and other converted documents just aren't there.  Is the
   plan to check in the html versions of these as well?  If I'm to generate
   them myself then they should probably be put into a subdirectory and
   stuck in .cvsignore.

3) the screenshots should probably be in a subdirectory.  Or perhaps in a
   separate module, so folks who just want the docs don't have to checkout
   the screenshots, just like fvwm-cats.

A checkout is done every 30 minutes currently.  Once I migrate the CVS
server over then I'll set up something like what Greg Badros suggested,
which will automatically do a checkout after you do a checkin.

Tim, alright I'll bite why all the changes to the pager?  I compiled everything and one key problem is the pager doesn't reflect window focus. until I switch pages or desks.

As long as its not part of fvwm-web, I think a full URL
is logical.  See #3.

I think we should take the generation off your hands.
The person doing the release should do the generation, then commmit
the generated pages into fvwm-web.

Any other opinions?

Subdirectories seem like they will help, I think this may grow a bit...

I propose creating a fvwm-cats subdirectory in fvwm-web
and moving all of fvwm-cats
because:

To test before upload the more relative paths used
the better "file:" works.

CVS checkout with "-l" will let you get only one directory.

Any other opinions?

Sounds, good.  The average 15 minute delay isn't bad either.
By the time I got to this sentence, the change I just made appeared.

That's okay by me. The command you suggest should be mentioned

The borders weren't following the colorsets and it wasn't using the
pixmap backgrounds for the mini-windows.  I forgot to commit a change to
libs/Colorset.c that may be causing your problems. Can you test it now?
If it is still broken can you send your config?

Perhaps we should have "stable" pages and "development" pages.

I still think modules are the way to go; if you don't want them, you don't
check them out.  If you do check them out once, they're kept updated
automatically when you do cvs update in a directory that contains them.
I.e.:

checkout fvwm-web
cd fvwm-web
checkout fvwm-cats
checkout fvwm-screenshots
[...]
update

The final update gets fvwm-web, fvwm-cats and fvwm-screenshots as well.  In
the end, though, it doesn't make much difference to me because I'm closest
to the server.  I'm just trying to think of folks behind dialups.

Yes, me me!!  I'm all for this idea!

I went looking in fvwm/docs for something ... discovered that the html
files had relocated to fvwm-web ... then discovered that huge screenshots
came along with the doc files!  I'm working over a 14.4k modem for the
moment, so I still don't have the fvwm-web module :-)

Hullo Julian,

You are the current debian maintainer for FVWM, right? I just installed
debian at home a few weeks ago and now I'm completely hooked on packages.
However, I trashed the old FVWM that came with debian 2.1 and am using a
version compiled from CVS, which lives in /usr/local.  All works fine, but
I don't get the nifty menus of applications that the debianized FVWM had.
What is the easiest way to make the CVS tree work like the debianized one?

One thought I had was to get ahold of your stuff that makes .deb files.
Is that the best way to go?  I know nothing about making deb packages, but
I'd like to learn 'cause I have another utility that I'd like to package
up someday.

Your thoughts?

Description:
	Hello,
	I use a FvwmPager called SimplePager which is a symbolic
	link to FvwmPager. When, I use the new options 
	*SimplePager*Colorset * n
	then if I call "SimplePager" I've got the pager for the current
	desk and everything is ok. But if I run this pager with "options",
	say:

	SimplePager * *
	or
	SimplePager 0 3

	the pager does not start (no process, no error to stderr).
	I do not have this problem if I remove the Colorset config
	line. Below my config.

Repeat-By:
       	cd $FVWM_MODULEDIR
	ln -s FvwmPager SimplePager
	Add the following in your .fvwm2rc:

Style "SimplePager"  NoTitle, Sticky, NoHandles, WindowListSkip, MouseFocus
DestroyModuleConfig SimplePager
*SimplePagerColorset * 3
*SimplePagerWindowColorsets 0 2
*SimplePagerHilightColorset * 1 
*SimplePagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*SimplePagerMiniIcons
*SimplePagerGeometry 155x96-0+210
*SimplePagerSmallFont 5x8
*SimplePagerLabel 0 Bureau
*SimplePagerLabel 1 Bureau1
*SimplePagerLabel 2 Bureau2
*SimplePagerLabel 3 Bureau3

	My FvwmTheme Config:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme
*FvwmThemeColorset 0 white grey45
*FvwmThemeColorset 1 Black white
*FvwmThemeColorset 2 white RoyalBlue3
*FvwmThemeColorset 3 black grey60
*FvwmThemeColorset 4 yellow RoyalBlue3
*FvwmThemeColorset 8 red RoyalBlue3
*FvwmThemeColorset 9 red yellow

	So, now: Module FvwmTheme, Module SimplePager * * 
	Do you have the SimplePager ?

Execpte this litle problem I am quite happy with the new module
FvwmTheme, Thanks !

Um, there is no passage in the code that suggest that there is a
SwallowModule option. The only thing I could imagine that wharf
doesn't require whitespace after a recognized option and interprets

  *FvwmWharfSwallowModule foo

as

  *FvwmWharfSwallow Module foo

This would be much more consistent.

Description:
	I upgraded from FVWM 2.2.2 to 2.3.6 and have problems
	with sticky windows, because they don't seem to respect
	TitleStyle any longer.

	I have defined a HGradient for ActiveUp, ActiveDown and
	Inactive. It works perfectly fine in 2.2.2 for sticky and
	non-sticky windows.

	In 2.3.6 it only works for non-sticky windows. For sticky
	windows, the ActiveUp/ActiveDown/Inactive settings are
	ignored.

	If I set an additional HGradient without ActiveUp/Active-
	Down/Inactive, it works if a sticky window is active,
	but if a sticky window is inactive, colors are messed up
	totally.

Repeat-By:
	My .fvwm2rc reads:

	TitleStyle      ActiveUp (HGradient 64 Orange4 Orange3) \
			ActiveDown (HGradient 64 3 Orange4 30 Orange3 45 Orange4 25 Orange3) \
			Inactive (HGradient 64 DodgerBlue4 SteelBlue3) \
			LeftJustified Height 20 -- Flat

	This works for non-sticky windows, but for sticky windows
	the three HGradient settings are ignored. If I add
	"TitleStyle HGradient 64 Orange4 Orange3" in front
	of the settings above, the HGradient additionally
	works for active sticky windows, but then the title
	for non-active sticky windows is totally screwed up.

Description:

When a shape notify event is received for a window
that is _not_ shaped, the shape of the window is
propagated to the parent, causing window decorations
to be truncated.

How to replicate:

Switch GTK+ themes using the GNOME control center.
(among other ways). This may be fvwm2rc dependent
(otherwise it would have been noticed before, I
would guess).

Fix:

SetShape should unset the shape if the window is
not shaped, instead of setting it. A patch against
latest CVS follows:

Just beginning to get back to looking at FVWM after doing lots of
other stuff.  I saw the 2.3.6 announcement, but the latest version on
the archive is 2.3.5.  Are the permissions perhaps wrong or something?

Jason, I still can't see the new downloads page on http://fvwm.org.
Is something wrong with the update process?

There were several places where a NULL pointer was accessed.
Fixed now.

We still need to work out issues such as generating HTML from the text
files and manpages first.  Otherwise, you will have your new downloads page
but no manpages.

Yes, but fvwm-2.3.6.tar.gz must reside in the version-2/testing directory.

Hello Dominik,

I just removed the following line from ~/.bashrc and the problem went
away.

---
stty erase ^H
---


BTW, I wasn't able to kill the script using SIGHUP. SIGKILL worked, but
fvwm2 kept waiting. And starting the script in background like "Exec
MyScript.sh &" worked fine too.


Thanks!

Huh? Could you ask at the bash mailing list why this happens? I'm
really interested in this question.

In my .bashrc files, I generally put all the stuff to be executed
in BOTH interactive AND noninteractive shells up front.  Then I put the
following:

	# If this is a non-interactive shell, leave now
	#
	if ! echo "$-" | grep >/dev/null i; then return; fi

And all the stuff for interactive sessions ONLY below this ...

That will avoid your problem.

Seems some flags have gone wild. If you remove the 'LeftJustified' bit
the gradients work again. I have made a quick patch in the development
sources, but more work has to be done.

To patch the 2.3.6 sources:

File screen.h, replace this line:

    HOffCenter                  = (1<<4),

with this one and compile again:

    HOffCenter                  = (1<<12),

Um, isn't the .login file supposed to be used for interactive

Wow!  Lots 'o processes! :)

What's wrong with the trusty case statement?

  case "$-" in *i*) return ;; esac

I _never_ use if-statements when comparing strings; case is much
faster, and you get globbing for free.  Portable, too! :).

Obviously, this is pretty off-topic ...

?? What kind of settings do you have in mind? For my zsh all my
settings for login shells are these:

  readonly LOGNAME; export LOGNAME
  if [ "$TERM" = "" -o "$TERM" = "unknown" ]; then TERM=linux; fi
  stty hupcl 2> /dev/null

The logname and TERM variables are propagated to all subshells anyway
and the stty setting is needed only once. I never had trouble with this.
(Perhaps I will never understand the daily toild of bash users :-) )

Double-Wow! How complicated! With zsh I'd do this:

  [[ -o login ]] && return

or

  [[ -o interactive ]] && return

I see what you mean about the mini windows, but I'm still not getting focus updates on the pager.

Not that you both get the problem with the window borders wrong:
It was solely a problem of the patch to FvwmPager not setting
the right variables. I fixed that yesterday.

Tim,

I'd be willing to attack colorsets for FvwmButtons. But first
I need to know what I will have to do. Can you make a
checklist for this? I'd like to know what the Colorset module
can do for me. E.g. is there a function to set a window
background to use a specific colorur set? And is there a function
that updates the attributes for window creation according to
the colour set?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Now I see the problem it has to do with *FvwmPagerWindowColorsets we
are using that to the exclusion of the per desk colorsets.  Now I'm not
quite sure how to fix this, I haven't stared at the code in a few days,
but I'll take a look.  I think we want to say that

*FvwmPagerFore is overriden by
*FvwmPagerWindowColorsets which can be overriden by 
*FvwmPagerColorset on a per desk basis

Does that sound right before I proceed?

The snapshot failed to build for the past couple of days with this error:

session.c:410: `SmRestartIfRunning' undeclared (first use this function)

I suspect this is an X version mismatch.  Either that or I need to clean
the directory and have it configure and build from scratch.

Hello !

Since the first release fvwm doesn't handle colormap installation for
subwindows in window hierarchies. Since it is needed for more and more
applications (IDL, PV-WAVE, try, e.g., xpalette), the time seems to be 
right for a patch. I've already got one from RSI Inc., written years
ago by Randy Frank, a former employee, for fvwm-1.24r. I have incorporated

it into the 2.2.2 release, and it works fine on all systems I could try 
(Sun ,Linux, Dec). Randy once posted it to the mailing list, but that was
in the early times and has been forgotten. I hope this time it will 
experience another fate, because it would help many desperate fans of
this marvelleous window manager. So here are the two patch
files (diff -c) for fvwm/events.c and fvwm/colormaps.c for 2.2.2:

I'm able to achieve the same thing, (checking out only subdirectories)
with "-l".  I'm going to try it that way, and we can always change it
later.

  dv> ?? What kind of settings do you have in mind?

I agree that tty settings should be in the login init file only.  That's
where I have mine set.  Tty settings are useful only on the local host
anyway.

But there are many other kinds of things which should be only set up in
interactive shells, which _aren't_ propogated everywhere.

Functions, aliases, CDPATH settings (think rsh et. al.), etc. etc.

PS. Also, currently I'm having a problem where tty settings in my login
    file that are in affect on the console are lost inside
    xterm's/rxvt's when I start X (obviously these don't run the login
    init file).

    I haven't looking into this yet; it happens only on Solaris, not
    SunOS or Linux.  Not sure where the problem lies, exactly.

  dv> Double-Wow! How complicated! With zsh I'd do this:

*shrug* Mine's portable to _most_ sh's, except very old ones.  Even when
writing for files like .bashrc which obviously will never be read by
anything but bash, I prefer to be portable (all things being
equal)--keeps the old reflexes sharp :).

Also, for our environment here I write a number of init setup scripts
which are sourced by everyone; with careful writing I can get the same
script to behave correctly for sh, ksh, bash, and zsh... and this is
part of that.

Note that it's possible someone (or some app) resets the prompt to be
empty by hand, so this isn't a foolproof test.  It's the most portable,
though, and resetting your prompt to "" is unlikely enough that most
times it doesn't matter in practice.

Nevertheless, I prefer to test $- for i on principle.  Esp. given that
"return" within an init script isn't well-defined in many shells anyway:
often the ones that don't support i in $- don't DTRT with return,
either.

I do the following, based on what Thomas Esser (of teTeX fame) uses.
I have ~/.bash_profile -> ~/Startup/Bash_profile etc.

Those files ending _sys are meant to be standard but could be modified
if necessary.  Those ending _personal are, well, personal!  Some of
the functionality divisions are arbitrary and possibly a little
excessive (for which I take the blame, not Thomas!).  For those using
zsh, this could be modified appropriately, I would guess.

~/Startup/Bash_profile:
-----------------------
sourceif() { test -r "$1" && . "$1"; }
if [ "$PRIVATE_ENVIRON" != YES ]; then
  sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_env_sys
  sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_env_personal
fi
sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_login_sys
sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_login_personal
sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bashrc


~/Startup/Bashrc:
-----------------
sourceif() { test -r "$1" && . "$1"; }
if [ "$PRIVATE_ENVIRON" != YES ]; then
        sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_env_sys
        sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_env_personal
fi
sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bashrc_sys
sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bashrc_personal

if [ ! -z "$PS1" ]; then
        sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_functions
        case "`basename $0`" in
            ksh | -ksh | bash | -bash)
                sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_aliases;;
        esac
        sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_interactive_sys
        sourceif $HOME/Startup/Bash_interactive_personal
fi

Well, I won't argue that, but note "standard" != "standardized" :).  I'm
talking about the extra tools people will need to build and install
before they can get wm-icons to install, not how easy/difficult it will
be for us (you :) to create a portable install script.

There are quite powerful sets of both awk and sed commands which are
_extremely_ portable; more than enough for the purposes of your script,
I should imagine.

Currently, if a window is deiconified with the mouse, IS_ICON_ENTERED(x) is
still set to 1, so when the window is iconified again, IS_ICON_ENTERED(x) is
still set to 1, so the full window title is drawn.  This is really a problem
when multiple windows are iconified when they all have IS_ICON_ENTERED set,
they start drawing over top of each other, and then try and redraw because
of that, which ends up chewing lots of CPU until you stop it.  Anyway, the
patch is attached, a whopping 1 line difference :)

I updated CVS this morning and just got around to restarting: FvwmAuto
no longer works.  It's running, but it doesn't bring the active window
to the top anymore.

I tried actually stopping fvwm/X altogether and restarting, and still no
luck.

I used the FvwmAuto app from my last build sometime mid-July and that is
working.

Also every time I start Fvwm I get this error; not sure who's generating
it?

  X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
    Major opcode of failed request:  70 (X_PolyFillRectangle)
    Resource id in failed request:  0x3800013

I think that every 2.3.* version must be in testing/. And optional links
in the parent directory for betas.
IMHO fvwm-2.3.6 still has too many problems to be a beta.

No, it is my fault. Fixed. Another reason to move fvwm-2.3.6.tar.gz to
testing/. :(

This fixes the fourth bug in my message from 18 Jul 1999.
First three are still there.
I will report a bunch of additional bugs soon after more investigating.

Go the auto* route, and you get all the standard directory-specifying
stuff, like --prefix for free!

Ah, I thought .login was for *login* shells, not for *interactive* shells.
Well, juggling with the 10 (in words: ten) config files of my zsh is
complicated enough. I won't try to understand how bash does its
initialisation :-)

We had a thread about this problem a while ago. I can't remember what
exactly the solution was, but grabbing for bash in the mailing list
archive might help.

Well, I write shell scripts usually in sh syntax, but I wouldn't care
to write my zsh init files in any other but zsh syntax. Apart from this
I consider any environment without zsh badly broken :-)

Okay. Luckily my sysadmin days are over for now.

I have quite a different idea of what beta releases should be. In
my eyes they are supposed to be releases for testing and quality
assurance purposes. If 2.3.6 were stable we could as well rename it
to 2.4 (apart from the colorsets feature that has to be completed
first).

???  It is.  That's my point.  You often need an interactive-only
section in your per-shell config file (.bashrc), too, not just in your
.login... IOW you can't just stick all interactive commands in .login as
a solution.

But isn't there a file that is parsed only for interactive shells in bash?

In zsh commands are read from .zprofile for every shell and from

Well I didn't change any of the font stuff, I also don't use them

Well it looks like your last commit fixed this my problem.  But I see
you broke the rule: just on major change at a time.  I just looked at
the version diffs and I see you made some changes to how fonts work so
I'll let you look at Dominik's problem.

As for the rest of the pager it all looks good, I like this tag team
aproach to modules.  I imagine FvwmButtons is going to be the same way
they are just to many config options for just one of us to get it right.

I'm probabbly not going to get to FvwmButtons before next week, so if
you have the time you can make the first pass.

I think I've fixed this. The only problem I can see now is that with
your config the focus'ed window doesn't show in the hilight color.

Okay, but I can't promise anything for the next few days. My parents
pay me a visit to see the total ecliple of the sun we have here tomorrow
(70% chance of a cloudy sky :-( ) and they'll stay until the weekend.

You better talk me through this one.  My understanding was that if you
don't specify FvwmPagerWindowColors or Colorsets that the window colors
come from fvwm itself.  And that is what I see now

Style "*"               Color Black/#515178
and 
AddToDecor $1 HilightColor   Black #909078

which gives me a pager window that look like the attached.

~/.fvwm2rc

~/.FvwmButtons

  (2x1, Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

BTW, is it possible to insert some kind of prefix before the error
message, at least the hostname or something?  I'm not too familiar with
how the messages are generated: does X do it "automatically" or is there
some kind of perror() equivalent?  If the latter we could make our own
"error printer" function that printed the name of the module, then the X
error, or something like that.  At least it would help.

Note it's not a bash issue; it happens with other shells, too.
Including zsh ;).

I think it's an X server issue, or s'thing.

But, I'll look back through messages discussing bash and see if a
solution was posted, thx.

Duh, sorry, I now remember what that problem was. It was about
bash not setting the PS1 variable in xterms. I don't think that
will help you.

Unfortunatelly, they are x errors not ones we can easilly handle, the
easiest thing to do would be to start up Buttons, Animate, and Pager one
by one and whatch to see which one causes the error then send us the
config for that Module.

0) #include "libs/colorset.h"
1) AllocColorset(0) soon after XOpenDisplay
2) Add M_SEND_CONFIG to messagemask
3) in the parse options routine look for "Colorset" and pass to
LoadColorset() Redraw if necessary
4) in the main event loop hand M_CONFIG_INFO packets to parse_config

SetWindowBackground() takes a (colorset *), sets the background and
generates
an expose event

CreateBackgroundPixmap() creates the pixmap used by SetWindowBackground
in case you want to paint the background manually, you have to check
that the colorset contains a pixmap first though.

if cset is the colorset specified use Colorset[cset % nColorsets].fg to
access a pixel.

The most difficult part is trying to keep backward compatibility which
means you have to keep around the old configuration specified colors and
choose at redraw time wether to use the colorset pixels or the old ones.
The way I did it with FvwmIdent was to have the colorset default to 0
and if the configuration specified a color the colorset is set to -1. In
the redraw routine if the colorset >= 0 then it is used.
This gives a default colorset if there is nothing specified at all but
doesn't change any working configs.

Cheers,
Tim.

Weird.  This would only happen if bash didn't think it was running
interactively... that's SOP for non-interactive Bourne shells.  I'd be
surprised if zsh behaved differently, since it would break a lot of
shell scripts.

Nope.  Bash does it the "traditional" way; if you have sections of your
init script you want sourced for interactive shells only, you check to
see if you're interactive and don't do them if not.

No, I think we identified it as a bash-only problem back then. I think
the problem was that bash overrides the PS1 prompt when started in a
non-interactive fashion, even if invoked from an interactive parent
shell with an exported PS1. So if you have this

  interactive bash 1, parent of
    non-interactive bash, parent of
      interactive bash 2

You might end up with a default promt in the interactive bash 2
if you export/set PS1 only for login shells. Doesn't happen with
any other shell I tried (zsh, csh, tcsh, ksh).

Hm, the bash manpage is somewhat vague about the config scripts.
It seems that bash sources different files for interactive login
shells (.bash_profile, .bash_login) than for interactive non-login
shells (.bashrc). On the other hand according to the man page it
doesn't read any files for non-interactive shells which is nonsense
in my eyes.

(bash 2.02.1(1))

Looks like the code here doesn't handle the case where windowFont is
NULL, which is clearly legal when the smallFont is not defined.

GNU bash, version 1.14.7(1)

       Non-interactive shells:
         On startup:
               if the environment variable ENV is non-null, expand
               it and source the file it names, as if the command
                       if [ "$ENV" ]; then . $ENV; fi
               had been executed, but do not use PATH to search
               for the pathname.  When not started in Posix mode, bash
               looks for BASH_ENV before ENV.

It's FvwmAuto.  Having that as the only module, I get the error on
restart.  If I comment it out and uncomment all my other modules so they
start, I don't get the error.  If I uncomment FvwmAuto again and
restart, I get the error.

Obviously there is no config for this module; I start it with:

  AddToFunc InitFunction

  AddToFunc RestartFunction

Does this mean you don't think there is a bug with focus following?

I got confused because my decor has a hilight that is the same as the
default colors (don't ask me why I don't understand decors) and it
looked like the focus window wasn't hilighted in the pager (it was but
with the same colors!).

I think there might be a bug in fvwm because when the pager first starts
the hilighted window is drawn in the default hilight colors and only
switches to the decor hilight colors when the focus changes. It looks
like the M_FOCUS_CHANGE packet sent in the windowlist isn't using the
decor of the focussed window.

I've fixed the core dump Paul reported (smallFont not specified) so I
think it may be time to let FvwmPager have a rest.

Cheers,
Tim.

I see this too.

Also, if I restart with some things iconified (into the builtin
iconbox), the pager doesn't show the windows in their proper place or
size when I de-iconify them.  Instead, I get a tiny little window at
0x0.

Anything that wasn't iconfied when I did the restart works OK.

Once I switch to another page, everything starts working again on all
pages.

Core's gone, thanks.

That's 0x0 in the pager... I mean that I get a tiny window outline in
the upper-left corner of the pager window, instead of a "normal"-sized
outline at the right offset (which wasn't the upper-left corner).

Paul, it sounds like we missed something here, if everything goes back
to normal on a page switch then, we probablly want to do an XClearWindow
and an Expose right before we hit the main loop.  I'm on my way to a
long metting so if you want to give that a shot.

I use in fvwm2rc the line
  Key  KP_Begin  A  N  \
      Next [!iconic !xosview !ipwatch !FvwmButtons CurrentScreen] Focus
to rotate the focus of X11 applications.

But fvwm2 ignored in this context some entries: Iconified apps
and xosview both are correctly ignored while rotating, but the 
following "!"-entries ("!ipwatch", "!FvwmButons") have no in-
fluence - both applications get the focus.

Folks, some dork is setting his From: address to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org and
sending messages to majordomo@fvwm.org.  I really have no idea why anyone
would want to do this, but there you go.

Anyway, I've filtered them out.

I'm sorry but that can't be and I can prove it.  
cd to modules/FvwmAuto
rm FvwmAuto
gcc  -g -O2  -o FvwmAuto  FvwmAuto.o -L../../libs -lfvwm

it links with no X libraries at all because it makes no X calls. It just
sends messages to fvwm.

Dominik you mentioed the same problem can you give narrowing down your
config a try?

Well, I can't seem to reproduce the problem with any of the
aformentioned modules.  I don't suppose one of you could send me your
fvwm2rc?  (I'm rather good at debugging things, but I have to be able to
produce the bug first :)

A script beginning
#! /bin/bash
would potentially behave in unpredictable ways if it read some startup
file.  This would be unacceptable.  (You can explicitly force this
behaviour by setting BASH_ENV, but beware the consequences!)  No shell
should read startup files by default when invoked non-interactively.

Its been over 2 weeks since I did a CVS update.

This morning, I built 2.3.7, and the only problem I see is XEmacs ignoring
all the regular keys, (A-Z, 1-9, F1-F12).  Special characters and
cursor keys are fine.  (I think it sees the keys, I have cursor blink mode
enabled, and the blinking seems to hesitate, it just doesn't do anything.)

If I exit  2.3.7, and use  2.3.6 from a few  weeks ago, the keys start
working again.  (Same XEmacs.)

The keys seem to work OK everywhere else, including a "gnuclient -nw"
attached to the same XEmacs.

I'm running XEmacs, 20.4 on Solaris 2.6.

Steve asked for a copy of the scripts I use to generate the CVS commit
messages.  This might be of general use, so I'll just send it to everyone.

It's a hacked version of the newlog.pl script that I think comes with CVS,
plus it's helper.  You grab the scripts from ftp.fvwm.org:/pub/fvwm/cvs,
put them in the CVSROOT of your project, add this to commitinfo:

DEFAULT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commit_prep -r

and add this to loginfo (changing the address, of course):

DEFAULT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/newlog.pl -s -f $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog -m fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu %s

Note that you also need a patch to CVS for it to get the user right if you
do like the FVWM tree does and map all remote users to a single local user
(which, BTW, isn't root here):

Back in the fvwm 2.2 series (?) we had a problem where clicking a Popup
submenu item caused the parent to disappear and the child to become the
"top-level" menu.  We didn't like that and Dominik changed it back to
work "normally" where if you click a submenu item it "posts" and stays
even if you move the mouse off of it.

Anyway, I thought he did...

But either way, it doesn't work now (latest CVS, and yesterday too but I
don't know how long before that).

Clicking on a submenu item has no effect; if you move the mouse down off
the item it moves the selection to the next item, instead of keeping the
"clicked on" item selected.

Did anyone understand that? :)

I know it's SidePic not SidePixmap but just crashing is a bit rude,
how about an error message instead?

You can't use more than one application name in a condition. If you
specify multiple names, all but the first one is ignored. You should
use the WindowListSkip style for these applications instead:

  Style xosview WindowListSkip
  Style FvwmButtons WindowListSkip
  Style ipwatch WindowListSkip

Uh, oh, would it be possible to turn that 3d look off? On a small
pager it looks rather ugly! Apart from this the mini windows are
too small with the 3d look. If I have two windows directly adjacent
on the desktop (with SnapAttraction) there is a noticeable gap visible
im my pager.

I asked this question back on 07/26/1999, but received no feed back.

I am assuming it's because of my explanation of my problem.

I will try it again.

I have switched from FvwmWharf to FvwmButtons for a couple of reasons (which has
nothing to do with my current problem).

I am using FvwmButtonsPanel to simulate the way I had FvwmWharf setup.  Now my
problem is that when I click on a panel to expand it, 40% of the time it looks
normal:

|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|       |       |       |       |       |
|       |       |       |       |       |
|       |       |       |       |       |
|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|

The other 60% the panel looks like this:

|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|       |       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|       |       |       |       |       |
|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|

with the icons and actions shoved in the top set of buttons.

I have to close the panel and re-open it to get it to display correctly (some
times several tries are necessary).

I don't know if the cause is the way I have my buttons defined or a bug in
FvwmButtons.  I had to play games with the "Size" option to get my background
image to look correct (I liked the way FvwmWharf used an image for each button
rather then tile the image like FvwmButtons).

Anyway I have my entire FvwmButtons configurations below, if anyone has any
suggestions please let me know.

Also, I have a snapshot of what the button really looks like when it is messed
up.  If anyone needs to see it, I would be glad to forward it.

Thank for your help.

This is not a strict prove. FvwmAuto uses libfvwm.a, which makes X calls.
I agree however that this is not the case. FvwmAuto may be a non-X app,
but it sends the raise command. So the problem may be in the stack code.

Speaking about this, FvwmAuto with non-zero argument seems not to work for
me (tried with the second/third arguments too). Zero first argument works
always. And I don't forget to KillModule between tries.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You can't use more than one application name in a condition. If you
specify multiple names, all but the first one is ignored. You should
use the WindowListSkip style for these applications instead:

  Style xosview WindowListSkip
  Style FvwmButtons WindowListSkip
  Style ipwatch WindowListSkip

Sorry, I trashed the original mail by accident, so there's no
quote of it in this message.

I think Mikhael said that the second and third argument of FvwmAuto
(enter and leave functions) do not work. This is not the case for
me and by looking at the code you can clearly see that if FvwmAuto
works with *one* argument there is no chance that it won't work with
two or three (unless the compiler is badly broken). So if it does
not work it must be some misconfiguration.

This far it's correct.

Nope, I never implemented something like this.

Not if the submenu was already posted.

Yes. That is what I wanted. Why do you say the normal way was that the
submenu would stay posted until you press the button on a different
item of the parent menu? I can't think of menu implementation that
does it this way. Windoze and KDE for example have a short delay before
the submenu pops down when you enter a new item on the parent, but it
*will* pop down eventually.

I don't think we can do anything about it. Sidepics will alway look
ugly if the menu is too short. The sidepic is always anchored at the
bottom of the menu, it's *not* centered. I do see a off-by-one bug
however. The sidepic reaches one pixel into the border of the menu
at the bottom. You can see it clear as day with

  MenuStyle * BorderWidth 1

I don't have Windoze handy at the moment; I thought it did "permanent
posting" too, not a short delay.

But at any rate this is the way all Motif apps I've ever used behave,
for example.  I _thought_ this is how menus used to behave in fvwm, as
well, but I'd have to go back and try it to be sure.

Go try it in Netscape, for instance: if you click a submenu line that
menu stays posted no matter _where_ the mouse goes; you can move it to
the other side of the screen.

I really like this behavior because I often get deeply cascading menus
and it's truly, truly frustrating to try to maneuver the mouse over to
the submenu without having it slip off the current menu pick, up or
down.  I click my way through all my menus, it's just so much easier
that way.

No, sorry, that is a problem of my monitor/graphics board
combination. Certain colours are not centered well on monitor's
dot mask. With xmag I can see there is no 'real' bug.

Hm, yes. Clearly a matter of personal taste. Unfortunately the selected
menu item and the visible submenu are linked closely together at the
moment. I tried to separate both once but failed.

That's the reason why KDE and Windoze have this delay. You can move off
the menu for a second or so when navigating around with the mouse
without bringing down the menu. As I said, I tried to rewrite the
menu code to allow something like this, for the same reason once.

Hey! You scared me for a moment. 2.3.6 does *not* crash. It's
the current CVS code, i.e. 2.3.7. I forgot a debug statement in
there. It's fixed.

I'm no expert on the menu code, but I'm not sure this matters?  In the
Motif method it's not really that you select other items as the mouse
moves, but have the old popup still visible.  Once you click, nothing
else is selected by moving the mouse.

Think of it like this: when you click on a submenu item you enter a
different "mode" of selection.  Once you click, you can no longer select
any item merely by moving the mouse.  Moving the mouse has no effect on
the section after that.  If you want to select another menu, you have to
explicitly click on it.  Then that becomes the selected item.

There's no way to get back to the initial state of selecting by simple
mouse movement in a particular menu, once you click in it (except by
getting rid of the menu and starting again).

It doesn't seem like you'd need to separate selection from popup menu
display in any way to implement this... but again, I don't know much
about the menu code so I could be wrong :).

Personally, I much prefer the Motif method.  It's simpler to use and
much simpler to code, more deterministic for the user, etc. etc.
Generally I really dislike time delays like that--the fact that I use
FvwmAuto is merely the exception that proves the rule ;).

Why did you do this? The missing_submenu_func must not be propagated
to the More... submenus as they are created when their 'parent' is
created, so they can never miss.

Are you using SloppyFocus? Is the cursor over the window when you press
the keys? Do you have root window key bindings defined for your 'regular'
keys?

With the latest commits the mini windows in the pager are not resized
properly. When I start the pager initially, everything looks right, but
as soon as the pager is resized, all mini windows shrink by two pixels
vertically and horizontally.

Okay, this one is fixed. In the MoveResizePagerView function the size
was calculated differently than elsewhere.

I noticed the size calculation of the pager has been changed. The old
calculation had the problem that, depending on the position of the
window on the desk, the mini windows changed their size while being
moved. But with the new code windows lined up with the bottom or right
screen border (or other windows) may no longer be lined up with the
according borders in the pager. Annoying as the old method might have
been, the new one is even worse.

What I don't like about this method is that you can't hilight items
on the parent menu anymore.

I'll change it back. I did it to reduce the amount of redrawing that
went on during a move.

Another reason to disklike time delays is solaris does a poor job of
implementing usleep, because that is the only place I where fvwm can
consistenttly lock up on me.

Yup, you *are* wrong. I just spent four unhappy hours trying to hack this
in, but the recursive structure of the menu code prevents me from
getting very far. :-(

Focus policy:

Style "*" MouseFocus

The mouse pointer is over the window.

Just about every key on my keyboard has a root window binding.

I'd like to disable the 'panels' in FvwmButtons soon.
The implementation is very disruptive and makes writing
new features like coloursets very hard and complicated. I
think this can be done in a much simpler way:

 1) FvwmButtons tells fvwm to invoke a new instance of itself
    when a panel has to be opened like this:

      Module FvwmButtons FvwmPanelFoo

    as the action of a specific button. The panel would
    simply have its own config strings.

 2) An option for FvwmButtons is implemented that controls
    if the module vanishes after the first press or if it
    stays up when something is selected.

 3) We implement a command line geometry option for FvwmButtons
    and define some way to paste the desired position into the
    action string (much like the % arguments in functions).

 4) FvwmAnimate is enhanced to allow animations when windows
    map or unmap somehow.

This way we would have a much cleaner FvwmButtons again that
is smaller and easier to maintain.

Any ideas, comments or volunteers?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hey I don't want to here you complaing, about colorsets, I had to get
most of the pager done, :). I think that sounds like a good way to go.
But maybe you should consider only execing the module once and using
ascheme where it just gets unmapped and then mapped when needed again.

If anyone goes for the map/unmap solution, check out how FvwmForm
does it.  I wasn't crazy about the inconsistency  in the API
so I documented it as a feature that would probably change.

They can never miss, but their submenus can.
Try your fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh (which I am going to replace with
fvwm-menu-directory among with other fvwm-menu-* scripts very soon)
and open a directory with many subdirectories (for example /proc),
"More..." entries were not functional in 2.3.6, this was fixed.

Mikhael.

No, I didn't said this. I said that the first argument when non-zero does
not work for me (no action) with any second and third arguments (or none).
Actually, when I tried it now, it works for non-zero arguments too.
But it didn't work yesterday. I see you did changes on 10 Aug. Did this
fix this bug?

Mikhael.

Do the keys work if you disable their bindings?

No, I was complaining about FvwmButtons :-)

That would be a possible enhancement, but you don't necessarily
need it. I don't know if you are familiar with FvwmButtons. The
implementation of the panels just creates a list of configuration
structures. As soon as you begin definig a panel it is very
difficult to access previous panels or the main panel. This makes
enhancing FvwmButtons extremely difficult, tiresome and risky.

If someone would help me with the map/unmap solution and/or
the FvwmAnimate enhancement I'd be grateful.

It's the window mentioned in the error message I see is a sub window
of xclock:

  X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
    Major opcode of failed request:  70 (X_PolyFillRectangle)
    Resource id in failed request:  0x3000002
    Serial number of failed request:  466
    Current serial number in output stream:  473

  X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
    Major opcode of failed request:  70 (X_PolyFillRectangle)
    Resource id in failed request:  0x2c00005
    Serial number of failed request:  38
    Current serial number in output stream:  38

  X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
    Major opcode of failed request:  65 (X_PolyLine)
    Resource id in failed request:  0x340000a
                                    ^^^^^^^^^

    Serial number of failed request:  59
    Current serial number in output stream:  66

(The first two messages are generated before several restarts, so the window
id's do not match.)

Output of xwininfo -tree on the root window:

  0x3000009 "FvwmXclock": ("FvwmXclock" "XClock")  46x53+345+1  +347+808
       1 child:
       0x300000a (has no name): ()  46x53+0+0  +347+808
       ^^^^^^^^^

The xclock is swallowed inside FvwmButtons with:

*FvwmButtons(6x5, Swallow(Kill, UseOld) FvwmXclock `Exec exec xclock -name FvwmXclock -geometry 40x40+2000+2000 -padding 1 -analog -chime -bg CBACK`, Action(Mouse1) beep)

(The button size is 9x11 pixels).

But if you can do it anyway you can as well give the user the
flexibility. And being able to define certain variables for
applications is useful too, e.g.

  export CVSROOT=":pserver:domivogt@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm"

I call a script from a menu that does my CVS operations. With zsh
I have .zshenv for this.

There are several things you could check. First of all fvwm doesn't
use the search path for its modules. You may have to use the
ModulePath command although that is not necessary if you installed
fvwm with 'make install'. If that is not your problem you have to
check your shell configuration carefully. fvwm uses /bin/sh as its
shell, so if you are using tcsh, zsh, ... you may have to make sure
the config file(s) for sh are set up correctly too. Or you can use
the 'ExecUseShell' fvwm command to specify the shell you want to use
for the 'Exec' command.

Hope this helps

Dominik ^_^

Sorry, we have no such statement. We did not test anything because -
as somebudy else said - fvwm is more y2k compliant that my headphones :-)

The problem is solved- the window manager's environment was
set by CDE, which didn't know about my $HOME/bin.  The fix
required adding $HOME/bin to the $PATH in .dtprofile.

What I don't understand is that by using this fix, it implies that fvwm
looks for executables using its own search path, not by using /bin/sh's
search path, which should come from my .bash_profile.  Confusing.

I tried to post a new note to the bug tracking system but wasn't able.

Thanks for the info.

Chris

No, bash doesn't use the .bash_profile when started as sh. This
is part of the sh compatibility. It looks only for .profile.
Excerpt from the bash man page:

       If bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the
       startup  behavior  of historical versions of sh as closely
       as possible, while conforming to  the  POSIX  standard  as
       well.   When  invoked  as  an  interactive login shell, it
       first attempts to read and execute commands from /etc/pro
       file  and  ~/.profile,  in  that  order.
       ...

Yes.
Actually there were 4 separate problems all causing not restoring window
states. Three were fixed and one (gnome-session related) is determined and
currently fixed by a temporary hack. I am still waiting for a confirmation
from Matthias about a real fix.

So, basically this is solved or at least I am solving it.

But there has been the fifth problem introduced since then. As I have
already reported, sometimes IS_NAME_CHANGED(w) is 0, even if the window
name was already changed during start-up/restart. This causes in a rare
cases not matching windows which can cause the situation described above.

There are additional related bugs still not fixed, like: you must not
restart (for now) from non-(0,0) page under a session manager.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Most programs do not set $PATH they just use what they inherit from
their parents.  Fvwm does this so if you want to change the $PATH for
fvwm you have to change its parent.  If you're running fvwm in CDE it is
not obvious but you found it in the end. ~/.bash_profile is only ever
read by bash (and only in certain circumstances, try "rsh localhost
some_program_on_your_$PATH").

Cheers,
Tim.

I've made it configurable since I like it to be 3d.  The width of the
border is configurable too (ready for the day I get a 5000x4000
monitor).  Set the borderwidth positive and it uses the old style (the
default is 1), negative and it uses the hilight and shadow pixels from
the WindowColorsets.

The windows being too small is fixed too, I was being lazy and didn't
want to have to do the code to handle resizes during moves.

Cheers,
Tim.

I like the 3d look of pager windows. IMHO, it may be a default.
I think they can be 3d for negative WindowBorderWidth even without
WindowColorsets specified as man page says (window back color is taken).

If the pager window is one point tall or wide, it is all hilighted (white)
or of a border color (if not 3d). Maybe it is better to paint it in the
window back color instead for this case?

Now the pager looks much better for me, but it itself is not 3d (desk and
page frames, title). It is probably a good idea to make it fully 3d
optionally.

Another thing.
This is my config (for an example purpose):

*FvwmThemeColorset 0 white green
*FvwmThemeColorset 1 red black
*FvwmThemeColorset 2 yellow blue
*FvwmThemeColorset 3 black rgb:FF/FF/D0
*FvwmThemeColorset 4 #000030 #62625a
*FvwmThemeColorset 5 #000030 #909084

*FvwmPagerColorset 0 0  
*FvwmPagerHilightColorset 0 2
*FvwmPagerBalloonColorset 0 3
*FvwmPagerWindowColorsets 4 5

I always get black on gray color instead of defined ones. Am I doing
something wrong? (latest CVS)

BTW, why WindowColorsets has no first parameter - desk, like other pager
colorset commands?

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, it doesn't work at home either.

If I remove the root window bindings for a key, then that
key can be used by XEmacs.

I notice a few other things:

Keys don't work with "dclock" either.

"contool" iconifies 10 times slower than it used to.

Can you send me a few of the offending binding lines and
all lines affecting your focus settings please?

I'm all for simplification as long as we can provide a method to achieve
panels that is no more difficult than the current one.

Someone already asked for it to map/unmap rather that start/exit.  I
think it would be best if that were possible as you could swallow things
in the panel and not have them killed/restarted all the time. In my past
life as a sys-admin I used to have a panel with xload's running on
different machines which was a very good way of spotting problems. 
Having to wait for ten xloads to start would be a pain

This would require a start position as well as a destination, it might
be possible to add this in conjuctions with having FvwmAnimate deal with
NoIcon windows.

How about if FvwmAnimate could keep a list of window-names, classes,
resources and window-ids together with a dissapear-to rectangle such
that M_DELETE messages and M_ICONIFY for NoIcon windows cause an
animation to that rectangle.  M_Add_window could make an animation from
a default rectangle.  I think this might answer the request for
Iconifying into a taskbar if the taskbar did a "Sendtomodule FvwmAnimate
dissapear_to $windowid x y width height" for every button.

The main FvwmButtons would set the button that controls the sub-panel an
the dissapear-to rectangle and send a toggle-unmap-state message to the
panel. The panel would map/unmap and FvwmAnimate would see the
M_ADD_WINDOW/M_DELETE_WINDOW and do a nice animation.

I used to do a slide up subpanel before FvwmButtons had panels (before
AnimatedMove as well) by having the main button execute a function like:

AddToFunc slideupdown I Next [panel] slide
+ I None [panel] make_panel

AddToFunc make_panel I FvwmButtons panel
+ I Wait panel
+ I slide_on

AddToFunc slide_on I Next [panel] Move <on screen coords>
+ I DestroyFunc slide
+ I AddToFunc slide I slide_off

AddToFunc slide_off I Next [panel] Move <off screen coords>
+ I DestroyFunc slide
+ I AddToFunc slide I slide_on

I can't rememeber if it was this simple or if I had to go through hoops
to get self modifying functions to work but it did work.  The only
things lacking were StackAbove and StackBelow functions to place the
panel just above the main after sliding up and just below before sliding
down.

Subpanels without the Panel mechanism are possible now so I vote to
remove the panel feature and we can work on how to make it easy
afterwards.

Cheers,
Tim.

PS is it open season on backwards compaitibility? If so can we remove
decors and expand the style structure to duplicate what decors provided?

Oh, please, no fancy interpretations of negative values anymore.
If we need a 3d look there has to be a 3d option.

Yes, that's exactly what annoys me. The same applies to windows that
are only two pixels tall or wide.

Me too but backwards compatibilty wins so the default is flat.

Too hard for me to do without risking color leakage.  If you dont
specify a WindowColors line FvwmOager uses the colors provided in the
M_FOCUS packet to draw the focussed window.  To make it 3d you would
have to call GetHilite & GetShadow and you should really do a free
before.

Feel free to send a patch, it won't be trivial since the outline is the
window border and making that 3d would require setting the border width
to 0, adjusting all the position calculations of the mini-windows and
finally drawing the border after every expose event.  There is also the
problem of partially off screen windows, these would sit on top of the
3d border and look bad. The only way to fix this is to create another
slightly larger window that sits beneath the desktop window and draw the
3d border in that - yuk!

Where do you get black/grey and what do you expect instead?

Because WindowColors doesn't and it ust the colorset version of that.

I guess it's a matter of point of view, or maybe I'm misunderstanding
what you mean.

I think the selected item _should_ always be the one that's
highlighted--and since you select a particular one when you click, that
one should be highlighted and no others, even when you move the mouse.

What am I missing?  I don't have any fancy highlighting (background
colors, etc.) on my menus, they just get 3d borders, then go flat again.

I think the current development code is too far away from 2.2.2 for
the patch to be applied easily. Could you please fetch the latest
snapshot from our we page and adapt the patch for it? It's probably
not a big issue, but I am very busy at the moment and won't get a
chance to do it myself any time soon. Please include an entry for
the ChangeLog file too.

Sure:

Style "*"           MouseFocus
Style "xmag"	    ClickToFocus
Key j R A Beep
Key k R A Beep
Key l R A Beep
Key s R N Warp Workstation
Key s R C Exec set -A back 1 E I 8 9;rxvt -pixmap ${back[`random 5`]} -name Workstation -fg white -iconic
Key s R M Exec set -A back 1 E I 8 9;rxvt -pixmap ${back[`random 5`]} -name Workstation -fg white -iconic
Key s R S Exec set -A back 1 E I 8 9;rxvt -pixmap ${back[`random 5`]} -name Workstation -fg white

(removing the 4 "key s" lines made the "s" key start working.)

Everywhere - windows, ballons, title. It just does not matter what colors
are specified in *FvwmThemeColorset, always #000000 on #bebebe.
Nice metal color scheme, BTW, but not exactly what I wanted. :)

This is the Motif method. Qt (KDE) behaves very similar (at least ver1).
Gtk (Gnome) method is different. It is a subset of fvwm. There is a
hilighting of menu item whenever a mouse moves over them, not only when
you click on the item, like in fvwm.

> What am I missing? I don't have any fancy highlighting (background

This is a matter of feel, not only look. Something like previewing first
of what will be executed when clicked.

Mikhael.

Could you please try to narrow down where this problem occured first
(2.3.0 to 2.3.6). I have just written a new configure option
--enable-move-bug-workaround that may have an impact on the problem.
Can you try this too?

Robert, since the panels feature of FvwmButtons is causing a constant
stream of bug reports and complaints we are going to rewrite this in
a simpler way. I have seen the behaviour you describe myself and I
thought it was fixed. Obviously it is not, but under this circumstances
it is would be a waste of time to investigate the problem.

It will be *easier* of course. Most people (including me) have trouble
setting up their own panels at the moment already, so it can't become
much worse.

I think it can be done in the same way as swallowing applications.
The only difference is that the application is not visible by
default but only after the button in pressed.

No, the destination is enough in this case. Sliding windows to open
them can be handles with only the destination geometry.

This should work too. It's a bit different than the current sliding
animations in FvwmButtons. Perhaps we can have both.

I didn't dare to suggest it :) All this stuff with Decors, ButtonStyles,
BorderStyles and TitleStyles is weird and needs a rewrite. I wouldn't
start with decors personally and instead begin with the other three.
Any opinions on this? I can't imagine we could keep backwards
compatibility with these commands if we rewrite them.

I don't have either. It just irritates me that the menus don't react
to my mouse or keyboard movements.

Try this:

 1) Configure colour sets for FvwmPager desk 0.
 2) Start fvwm on desk 0.
 3) Start FvwmPager to with 'Module FvwmPager * *'.
    The colour sets are used as they should.
 4) Switch to desk 1 with the 'GotoDesk 0 1' command.
    Pager displays desk one and uses a white background
    for the desktop. No problem so far.
 5) Switch back to desk 0 with 'GotoDesk 0 0'. Pager still
    uses the white background instead of the one configured
    for desk 0.

On the second thought, it would be bad to paint it in the window back
color, this will hide all small windows, which lie on (and inside) another
window. Now they are at least not hiden in this situation.

And I definitely want windows that two pixels or more tall or wide be 3d -
hilite & shadow colors are not random, they are built from the back color.

Maybe the better solution for one pixel windows is to force them to be two
pixels minimum? This also seems to be better for non-3d case in order not
to hide one pixel windows on a border of another window; although this
does not help for WindowBorder greater than 1 - the reason to use 3d. :)

Mikhael.

I perceive several problems with the current implementation
of colorsets:

 1) You can't call the SetWindowBackground function without
    a GC. What is it needed for? In FvwmButtons the GC was
    not even created when XSetWindowBackground was set
    first.

 2) How about renaming SetWindowBackground to
    ColorsetSetWindowBackground. This makes it easier
    to understand.

 3) With this in my init function:

      AddToFunc InitFunction
      + Module FvwmTheme
      + Module FvwmButtons

    FvwmButtons doesn't get the colorset information and
    uses a default. I think the only way to prevent
    synchronisation problems reliably is to make fvwm store
    the colorset lines it received from FvwmTheme and
    send them out to each new module in modconf.c
    (SendDataToModule), just like ColorLimit, ImagePath,...

 4) You can't set a transparent background in a colorset
    instead of a pixmap explicitly.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Could cou please fetch one of the current snapshots from our
web site and see if that problem persists? I have made some
patches to fix this, but since it does not happen on my
system I am only guessing.

I think the main problem is synchronization. It would
be nice if the modules start up with the proper colours
and not draw themselves in the default colours and then
redraw themselves for each colour set received. This
causes a lot more redrawing than necessary. We need a
mechanism to delay mapping of the modules.

A related problem is that the colour sets are sent in
reverse order to make sure the coloursets are allocated
only once. But if you allocate coloursets 0 to 10 and
only 10 is initialized, the module may still access
e.g. colourset 3 which is all zeroes.

The same problem occurs if the config lines for
FvwmTheme do not define colour sets in ascending order.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Mikhael, I think we really need some shell scripts with the names of
the replaced old scripts that call the new fvwm_menu_... scripts with
the correct options to get the old behaviour. I don't think we want
to force everybody to who used that files to rewrite their configuration.
Furthermore there are some references from the fvwm man page to the
old shell script. These have to be removed. I used them as a showcase
for the dynamic menu actions, so we now need a good example of what
you can do with it too.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Mikhael, I just noticed my BuildXlockMenu function does
not run anymore. I believe it has something to do with the
continuation menus (but I have no proof). Could you see if
your recent change to the missing submenu function causes
this problem?

Symptoms: when I first try to enter the menu from my root
menu, the root menu simply vanished. Further attempts have
no effect at all.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I should be possible to specify the xlock command line options
when calling the fvwm-menu-xlock script. What really driver me mad
are the animations when switching between different screensavers
or unlocking the screen. I want to be able to specify e.g.
'-erasedelay 0 -nolock' when selecting a menu entry.

You are right. There is no problem anymore, my fault.

Is this not a season for breaking compatibility?
The old directory scripts were not included in any major release (2.2.2),
so I thought there is no problem with them. I may be mistaken.
Also it is easy to replace them (in the man page too, I will do this):
  'fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh' replace by 'fvwm-menu-directory -d'
  'fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh'    replace by 'fvwm-menu-directory -r'

You will probably want additional options (-l -o 4) too, if you want exact
old behaviours. I'd prefer not to create compatibility scripts if possible.
The most probable case is that users had these scripts in their ~/bin or
/usr/local/bin; they still can continue to use them.

There are more problems with BuildXLockMenu. It had been included for ages.
Some rpms even put it into /usr/bin. I see nothing to be done about it.
Everyone who uses it just needs to switch to the new name and interface.
Hopefully the new names and interfaces are final. The options may be 
added, of cause.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It is already possible as the man page and --help say:
  fvwm-menu-xlock -t "My title" -- -erasedelay 0 -nolock

It's needed by the xlib calls within SetWindowBackground so we either
have a private static one or we pass one in.  It can be anything really
as long as the plane_mask is set to AllPlanes.  We could arrang for
InitPictureCmap() to create one that is used internally by the XPM and
colorset functions. The same goes for the depth argument.

No problem just lots of indenting to do, It might be a good idea to just
pass the colorset number in instead of the address of the colorset.

This is what it does already. If FvwmButtons gets it wrong that's a bug
in FvwmButtons. The problem at startup time is that there is no
synchronization of modules so FvwmButtons could get its configuration
before FvwmTheme has created all the colorsets.  What FvwmButtons should
do is to note the colorset numbers it is to use and to apply those
numbers every time it gets a Colorset M_CONFIG message.  This will casue
it to redisplay lots as FvwmTheme sends in the colorsets.

We could arrange FvwmTheme to send a "Function post_theme_start_function
Quiet" after it has read its config and sent all the colorset
definitions. You would then have to move all your module startup lines
from InitFunction to post_theme_start_function.

I think you're dealing with this,  I've seen problems with
"*FvwmThemeColoroset 0 black gray tiledpixmap side.fvwm99.xpm" it looks
like the gray background only extends to the top part (use FvwmIdent to
view), aspectpixmap doesn't seem to work at all.

No, that's not enough because they were meant as examples. Much
more people can read shell scripts than perl code. We need plain
shell command examples.

That's not a matter of personal taste. People don't want to rewrite
their configs and we should not force them to unless absolutely
necessary.

Make a shell script and let it call the perl script with the proper options.
We have a number of these links/scripts already and I see no reason to
leave this path.

Oh, I see. I didn't look at the synopsis. The xlock-options should
be included in the long description of the --help option.

I think arranging for FvwmTheme to send a command after it has done all
it's stuff is the way to go.  If you want to reduce redrwaing then put
your module startup lines in that function and only have FvwmTheme in
the InitFunction.

If you tell a moudle to use colorset 3 and never define colorset 3 then
you are going to have problems. I suppose we could change AllocColorset
to copy Colorset 0 into each new colorset it creates, at least then
accessing an undefined colorset wouldn't give black on black.

The problem is the reverse order when sending. When a module evaluates
ege. set 3 this one might still be undefined because fvwm has not
finished sending the coloursets (e.g. is has sent 10, 9 and 8 already,
but you use 3).

I think we need a ThemeFunction that is executed before InitFunction
and where FvwmTheme is initialised. fvwm would wait until FvwmTheme
dies or finished it input parsing (it sends some string to fvwm
that ends the startup).

Wouldn't this be more generic:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme

(The  module sends some  kind of  command back  to fvwm when  fvwm can
proceed.)

Eventually set 3 will be defined at which point the module should
re-evaluate it and display it correctly.  It should redraw everything
that uses set 3 when set 3 changes. That's why LoadColorset() returns
the number of the colorset it just loaded.

If FvwmTheme is going to send a string to fvwm to tell it it is done
initializing it may as well send a command. That way we don't have to
change fvwm at all, just get FvwmTheme to send a "Function
StartModules".  If the user wants to reduce redrawing at startup they
will have to move their other modules start lines from InitFunctions to
StartModules. Other users do nothing.

Cheers,
Tim.

If you are going that far why don't you just have FvwmTheme pass a
command back that will send a final M_CONFIG_INFO that signifies that we
are done loading colorsets, then the module could redraw at that point.
And users wouldn't need to rearrange their configs at all.

Perhaps to state the obvious, but whenever malloc (etc.) dump core that
almost invariably means you have a heap-stomp somewhere: something is
writing past the end of allocated memory, or into previously freed
memory, or even into totally bogus memory (via an uninitialized pointer
or somesuch).

A tool such as Purify or dmalloc or similar should be helpful here.

On one hand the redrawing is ugly and unnecessary. On the other hand
the modules has already accessed an illegal colour set.

This appears as a good idea to me. The only thing that has to be done
is to write a manpage comment on where to put the FvwmTheme startup
command.

The right way is to change fvwm-menu-directory.in and fvwm-menu-xlock.in,
since their man pages are auto-generated. fvwm-menu-desktop.1 is not.
It is a good idea to run 'make' before commit after changing these *.in.

I can't see how plain FVWM is better than any of the three suggested
variants (by three different people, you included). Never mind. :)

Hi,

Has anyone written a taskbar.patch for fvwm2-2.2 that provides the
DeskOnly option for FvwmTaskBar?  I have tried adapting the patch that
came with Red Hat's fvwm2-2.0.46-12.src.rpm, but I haven't been
successful.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jordan Koss

P.S.  I contacted Cristian Gafton at Red Hat about this issue, and he
suggested writing to this list.  If I should direct this question
elsewhere, please let me know.  Thanks.

This is one of the reasons why I don't use emacs. It uses very
unstructured code formating by default. I agree with Linus jokes
about emacs in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle.

BTW, although I don't use emacs, but my project partner uses, so my
question is how to configure emacs to produce structured code with
parentheses, so you only need search&replace, never reformatting,
i.e. --dont-line-up-parentheses equivalent of indent:

ColorsetSetWindowBackground(param1,
	param2,
	...
	);

or

ColorsetSetWindowBackground(
	param1,
	param2,
	...
);

Sorry for off-topic.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Tim, I am absolutely delighted about the possibilities
of the colour sets. With a bit of trickery I was able
to get the same gradient pixmap background on each and
every button in my FvwmButtons (although the code is
still very experimental and doesn't work too well with
xclock). I have attached a screenshot of my FvwmButtons.
The only problems left are the gradient in the xload
window (the 6th button in the bottom row) and that the
hands of xclock leave a trail painted in the original
background colour. I was just too lazy to solve problem
one, which should be easy.

I don't think we can do much about the xclock problem.
Any ideas how to implement a transparent background?
The only thing I can think of is creating a shaped
window with the background, but that is too disruptive.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Feh.  A weak reason to reject an editor, to be sure.  Every style will
not appeal to someone; some style has to be the default.  I personally
strongly dislike the style you're requesting.

The only reason to reject an editor due to indent style is if you can't
change it to a style you prefer.  That, no one can argue for a second,
is not one of Emacs' problems (not being configurable enough :).

Linus is a very good programmer, but his views on coding style I take
with a grain of salt.

If you're looking for style advice, go to a _REAL_ expert.  My favourite
is Rob Pike.  Reference on request.

Your use of the term "structured" is odd; I see nothing inherently more
structured about this indentation style than any other.  Also,
requirements that code not need to be reformatted are merely yolks
forced on us by those whose editors are less capable than ours, and
which can't do reformatting trivially.  ;)

Have your friend read the documentation.  This is completely trivial,
you can do it very, very easily interactively, etc.  Have them read the
CC Mode manual, and look at the section entitled "Customizing
Indentation", in particular "Interactive Customization".

To get them started, this will change the indentation of arguments in
the list to 5 spaces; modify to taste:

  (defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
    (c-set-offset 'arglist-intro 5))

  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)

I found this by writing the code, seeing where I didn't like the
indentation, then using C-c C-o to change it.

(this sets it for both C and C++ modes; that's the "common" part).

HTH.

I really don't want to start holy wars here. I have no problems with
anything others write, it is just easier to choose one coding style for
the project (I am speaking about the project with my partner, not fvwm).

Right. This is a reason number 3 from several. I will list you all in a
private message if you like. And I know well that emacs is very powerful.

So you say (you don't really say, I only guess), it must be:

a = my_first_long_named_function(my_param1,
                                 my_param2);
another_variant(param1,
                param2
                );

Very structured... Now try to rename both functions. Compare with:

a = my_first_long_named_function(
	my_param1,
	my_param2);
another_variant(
	param1,
	param2
);

The problem is that very many peoples write the first case just because
emacs by default does this.

I am confortable with my once customized text editor, not less powerful.
The amount of configurations, not lisp knowledge, stops me (consider
only key remapping; I am not speaking about tons of small things like
"travel freely everywhere after end of line/file", "travel, but don't
add spaces/newlines" etc.).

I would like to read this. My favorite is my OOP teacher, the name means
nothing.
The only really structured style is the one which doesn't use spaces for
indentation. Strong K&R. Exactly one special character (say TAB) for every
new level and no these special characters (TABs) anywhere else. This way
you can define TAB to be 4, 8, 11 (I prefer 3) without loosing structure.

"Structured" means you can see indentation levels of the fixed length.
Let's compare any other style with this "strong K&R". The benefits of the
last are:
  * looks very structured
  * anyone can define any TAB width he wants, so on the work I use TAB
size 3 and my partner - 5 on the same code
  * no needs in reformatting when renaming
  * you can always switch to "spaces" style, replace all TABs by 2
(4, 8) spaces (how about vice versus?)

I don't think this way. Yes, you can configure (almost) every editor to
run indent on your code after every keystroke, but this does not make the
code more structured (whatever meaning you use).

I suggest that we continue this mostly theoretical discussion in private.

You can use inline lambda function here (just to show how I know lisp).
There is no problems with hooks, the only missing thing was the
variable/function name to set/call to get the asked behaviour of
parentheses. This was the question. I would better not ask it. :-)

There is no C-c C-o in my emacs-20.3.1 without ~/.emacs.

Mikhael.

I understood that was your concern, that was the origin my comment about
editors that re-indent easily.  I can change this name and re-indent it
all in a few of keystrokes.

Meanwhile, I find the above syntax _much_ simpler to parse than the
other examples, where the arguments and the function name run together
and it's difficult to see them.

YMMV, that's why it's called "style" :).

I actually never read all the way to the bottom to see his comments on
Emacs; I was commenting on the rest of it.  Now that I look, his
"linux-c-mode" definition is not complete if I understand his style
correctly; he also needs (setq indent-tabs-mode t)--that's the default
but people often turn it off.

http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html

Short, but truly the best comments on style I've ever read.  Of course,
that merely means they're closest to my perferences :).

Actually, all of the Culture docs at http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ are
well worth a read (so is the rest of the stuff there).

*shrug* I disagree, but that's OK.

M-x tabify / M-x untabify

Is that what you mean?

My point is that "structure" is not so absolutely defined: I prefer
arguments that line up with the paren because it's simpler to see where
the function's arguments end, and it's simpler to find the name of the
function as your eye scans the page.  That, to me, is a more structured
code format.  YMMV.

The question of how the structure is added is completely separate.  It's
merely a matter of choosing the proper editor or configuring it
properly.  IOW, I wouldn't choose an indentation style because my editor
made some kinds of changes harder than others.

(Obviously you wouldn't reindent after every keystroke, but reindenting
a line after return and being able to reindent a function with a few
keystrokes is always useful--whatever structure you choose :)

True, but if you add enough things it gets unwieldy.  Also, you can't
redefine the lambda so while you're testing, anyway, I find it best to
create a function that you can redefine easily without stopping/starting
the editor over and over.

Yes there is.  Unless someone has gone Jack-the-Ripper on your standard
Emacs installation.

Note you have to visit a C or C++ file first (or create one), it's only
bound in a CC-mode buffer of course.

Hi!

First, I'm not shure if I really activated the configure switch for 
the move-bug-workaround. I can't see any obvious differences between
versions compiled with switches manually turned (presumably) on or off. 
Which one of the scripts am I supposed to change?

But I've done some vigorous amateur testing, and I think I found
something interesting.  This clumsy window jumping is more obvious
when you move the window with mouse pointer grabbing it at its borders
or the title bar.  pushing is very often worse then pulling e.g., you
move the window to the right with the mouse located at the left border
       ___________ 
      |=titlebar==| 
mouse->           | => move to the right 
      |           | 
      |           | 
       ----------- 

I think the problem is that the location of the mouse pointer relative
to the window changes during moves, that is, it is situated inside the
window for some time, then outside of the window for some time. 
This interferes with the redrawing process. When the mouse pointer 
is situated well inside the window, the moves will be much smoother. 
This also explains why the jumping is worse during fast moves.  
So it might help to hide the mouse pointer during moves, but that 
of course might look strange, too.

Still, there are differences between different applications and how
they behave under fvwm and fvwm2.  I can't see too much differences
between 2.3.7, 2.2.2, and 2.2.0, though, it would really be necessary
to quantify the effects, and I have no clue how to do that.

I've just picked out some apps and describe their behaviour with
opaque moves.  All windows are 400x400 pixels wide (except x11amp, and
kcalc which can't be resized)


fvwm2.3.7 / fvwm2.2.2 / fvwm2.2.0 
=================================

xterm, eterm, xview: ok, but not as smooth as under fvwm 
kfm, emacs: clumsy 
kcalc, gnomecalc: very clumsy 
x11amp: horizontal moves ok, vertical moves clumsy 
filerunner: clumsy

Things seem to be a little worse if Esetroot was used to set the
background image.


fvwm 
==== 

xterm, eterm, xview: smooth 
kfm, emacs: a little clumsy
kcalc, gnomecalc: clumsy 
x11amp: horizontal moves ok, vertical moves clumsy 
filerunner: clumsy when mouse pointer is well inside window,
            really bad when mouse pointer is placed on borders
            worse than under fvwm2.3.7


maybe I'm just too picky ;)

have a nice day and thanx, 
amir

Duh, I don't know why. I have the image/gif line in /etc/mime.types.
Don't know why my mail client didn't use it.

You will see it the switch has been activated in config.h. If it is,
the DISABLE_CONFIGURE_NOTIFY_DURING_MOVE macro must be defined.

That's *weird*. Please try this configure option mentioned above
and then try using the 'emulate fvwm' command (this puts the
feedback window in the top left corner of the screen, so it should
not obscure the window being moved so often). Perhaps it's a problem
of the backing storage of the feedback window. Please make sure
you're running your X server with backing storage enabled. With
Xfree you have to start it with 'startx -- +bs' to do this.
 
I notice a substantial improvement with the 'emulate fvwm' line.

No.

Good point, I hadn't thought about that. Mind you, FvwmTheme is not

Nope, I don't know of such a patch. It would be in the code if
it were there. What would such a patch be supposed to do
exactly?

Well I just tried 
DestroyModuleConfig AButtons*
*AButtons(Swallow(Kill, UseOld) FvwmXclock `Exec exec xclock -name FvwmXclock -geometry 40x40+2000+2000 -padding 1 -analog -chime -bg rgb:50/50/20`, Action(Mouse1) beep)
FvwmButtons AButtons

and it comes up fine [40x40 you sure do like your clock small], that is
not including anything you commited on the 16th.  Is it possible that
some of the colorset stuff you are doing is giving this?

it seems if I start up a module after initialization, the colorsets are not right.

The two modules I'm looking at are FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan

IconMan gives 
FvwmIconMan: X Error:
FvwmIconMan:          error code: 9
FvwmIconMan:          request code: 53
FvwmIconMan:          minor code: 0

The pager seems to get a transparent background which is kind of a nice feature but not what I was looking for.

attached is a screen snap with two pagers the one on the left is the second one I started. Yes I did do make cleans everywhere to make sure everything was up to date.

Hi Dominik,

Thanks for the prompt reply.  The patch was called
fvwm-2.0.46-taskbar.patch.  There were about 15 patches in Red Hat's
fvwm2-2.0.46-12.src.rpm altogether.  This particular patch allowed one
to set the FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly flag.  (It may have fixed a few small
bugs as well.)  If the flag were then set, the taskbar would only show
the names of windows on the current desk.

Thanks again.

Jordan

Why don't you check in all of that or at least tar up your changes and
send them to Tim and myself, that way we can see where you are and maybe
then offer some suggestions.

Ah, okay. I have that patch lying around on my disk somewhere. I have
incorporated the bugfixes, but this feature was too complicated back then.
Any help is welcome.

No if you notice I only have that many colors when I stretch X pixmaps, I get.  Serioussly I noticedc that so I started stepping through what happens, is both the depth that gets passed in and i for the for loop wind up being optimized to registers.  And when the core gets made it checks its last location for src_depth and it usually happens that it is in i's register.

Hi Dominik,

Thanks again for the fast reply.  I can send you what I have so far.  
The patch sort of works, but it fails in two ways when I switch desks.
First, it doesn't always redraw the mini-icons in the taskbar buttons.
Second, when I have multiple windows open on a desk, the buttons on the
taskbar become tiny when I switch to that desk.  The buttons remain tiny
afterwards.  My guess is that somehow the count variable associated with
the buttons array goes negative, which then causes the individual
buttons to be drawn at the minimum size.  But I haven't had a chance to
test this out.

Also, the old patch had problems when a window was lauched iconified.
I guess it didn't assign the window a desk number appropriately.  I'm
not sure how to go about fixing that.

The patch also incorporates the fix that allows the Start button to pop
back up after it has been depressed.

I'll send you the patch in a separate e-mail.  I don't want to clutter
this e-mail list more than I have already.

Thanks again.

Jordan

No, the credits don't belong to me. Can't remember who had the idea,
but my English is too limited to think of 'Feline' :)

The name game is confusing enough already with fvwm, fvwm1, fvwm95,
fvwm2. We really shouldn't make it worse by gicing fvwm a different
name in each man page :-)

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Just minor problems. I've fixed dozens of this kind :-) *But* I can't
do much with a patch for 2.2 since there have been large changes in the
module interface. If you could fetch 2.3.6 from

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/

and convert the patch for 2.3.6 I will happily apply it and then
we kan look into the remaining bugs.

No, posting to the list is good. The mail will get archived then.

Sorry, wrong option. Use 'startx -- -wm'.

Subject: horizontal grow has problem with sticky windows
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Using latest CVS versions, I encountered next problem with this command:

Maximize grow 100

Let R be the window to be resized and S a sticky window which frame
forms the boundary for R's grow and both windows have no overlapping
area.

Problems arise in the two following situations:


1 - Window S is spread over the west and north-east area of window R

             ---------
             |       |
             |   S   |
---------    |       |
|       |    ---------
|   R   |
|       |
---------

Using "Maximize grow 100" on window R grows it ignoring window S.



2 - Window S is in the south-east area of window R

---------
|       |
|   R   |
|       |
---------

             ---------
             |       |
             |   S   |
             |       |
             ---------

R stops growing till the x coordinate of the left side of window S.


Note: these problems don't arise with vertical grows.


Regards,

Tung

Hi Dominik,

Do you ever sleep?  :)

I downloaded the new version.  It will take me awhile to make the new
patch, and I don't expect having a big block of time until Thursday to
work on it.  So, I probably won't be able to get back to you until
Friday.

I can, however, offer one suggestion right away.  In
fvwm-2.3.6/modules/FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c, lines 275-277, the code
reads:

#ifdef FVWM95
                 | M_FUNCTION_END | M_SCROLLREGION
#endif

These two flags occur again at lines 500-518 in the same file.  However,
in the file fvwm-2.3.6/libs/Module.h, these two flags *never* get
defined.  I'm not sure where the FVWM95 macro gets defined, but if it
ever does get defined, FvwmTaskBar.c probably won't work right.  (I
think this happened to me the first time I tried creating a patch
for the taskbar...)

Jordan

It NEVER gets defined.  FvwmTaskbar was ported from a project
called "fvwm95".  That logic was disabled during the port.

The fastest bugfix in history :) Took about one minute.

I have tried to write the command that Dan suggested,
but I don't know my way around with all these pipes
and file descriptors. Basically I copied the code
from MyNextXEvent into module_interface.c and modified
HandleModuleInput to watch out for "FINISHED_STARTUP"
fro the module. It worked faily well al long as I had
dozens of debug fprintf's in the code, but after I removed
the it fails miserably. It doesn't work during startup.
When fvwm is up and running it works the first time I
call it manually, but all further attempts fail too.
Could someone with a better idea of this pipe stuff
take a look at this, please?

The intended setup is to have something like

  + ModuleSynchronous Timeout 5 FvwmTheme

as the first line in the Init/RestartFunction.

BTW, whatever the manpage says, the only module sending
that string back is FvwmTheme for the moment.

Bye

Dominik it looks like you didn't check in conditional.c?

I just noticed that in FvwmIconMan we catch these X errors right after we do the XOpenDisplay we can but 
XSetErrorHandler (handle_error);    

where handle_error is 
static int handle_error (Display *d, XErrorEvent *ev)
{
  ConsoleMessage ("X Error:\n");
  ConsoleMessage ("         error code: %d\n", ev->error_code);
  ConsoleMessage ("         request code: %d\n", ev->request_code);
  ConsoleMessage ("         minor code: %d\n", ev->minor_code);
  ConsoleMessage ("Leaving a core dump now\n");
  abort();
  return 0;
}

Well I found my problem, if you have soom good gradient lines using segments you could verify that this doesn't break segmented gradients to badly.

Basically what was happening after to many fprintfs was that the problem was not stricly FvwmIconMan the problem was that FvwmTheme was dumping core on one of my colorsets.  The reason was that memory was getting trashed ant the cummalitve effect finally caught up with me.  This also fixed my problem of IconMan not picking up all the colorsets I had defined.

So the fix just makes sure we don't write more pixels than we asked for.

Nice one.  Do you know if this problem exists in fvwm?  It has an
alloc-non-linear in two places, one in the menus and one in the
buttonstyle.

Cheers,

My guess would be yes, the change to AllocNonLinearGradient happened here,
I don't know what the origional problem was,  Dominik??.

=========
1999-08-14  Dominik Vogt  <dominik_vogt@gmx.de>

    * libs/Graphics.c (AllocNonlinearGradient):
    (AllocLinearGradient): fixed gradient colour allocation
==========

The FvwmTheme line that was causing the problem was 
*FvwmThemeColorset 3 gold #515178 DGradient 128 #000000 #909078

unfortunatelly I relinked fvwm with the fixed library so I can't say if a
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 #000000 #909078

would have caused a problem or not, but it does look right with the fix.

Version: 2.2.2

Submission from: (NULL) (130.225.96.4)



When using fvwm2 version 2.2.2 under HPUX10.20 on a monochrome X-terminal,
the titlebars are always black. Previous versions used dithering to
make it look grey, which was nice. I can't seem to get this feature in
this version.

I looked in the mailarchives and found this message:
     http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9701/msg00256.html

which suggests compiling with --disable-extended-titlestyle, but that
didn't help.

Do you have any suggestions for making it work?

these were for events added in 2.0.46 IIRC

the table definition is bad, as the builtins follow the other events.
so each time a new event surfaces they're relocated.
The ifdefs were to cleanly compile under various 2.0.xx versions.

or removing these IFDEFS alltogether.
those days have long passed.

I saw a CVS commit discussion about an auto-generated file being
committed instead of the generator file.  (I think it was
fvwm-menu-desktop.1.)

Question: should the CVS tree even contain the auto-generated files?

I think the return code out of do_execute_module can get
changed by this logic:

      for(i=6;i<nargs;i++)
	{
	  if(args[i] != 0)
	    free(args[i]);
	}

so that later on, when it returns "i", it doesn't represent the pipe
you want to read on.

(I haven't done any testing yet.)

Yup, thanks, that did the trick. ModuleSynchronous works as expected
now.

The last colour specified for a gradient was never actually used.
Hard to notice with a 100 colour gradient. But if you had a two
colour gradient, say from yellow to blue, the first colour was
yellow and the second was green. The third colour would have been
blue then. Seems that I forgot making sure we don't allocate too
many colours. Could someone check if this is still working?

(Try 'HGradient 2 red green').

I don't think that this is the right fix. It requires users to have perl
installed to generate man pages. The better way IMO is to fix their
dependences - not the actual auto-generated script, but its *.in source.

So the man pages in the question will be only auto-generated when the
corresponding source files are changed. Now only developers who modify the
perl sources are required to have perl installed.

I hope, this is also an answer to Julian Gilbey.

Anyway, Tim, you didn't update .cvsignore, so something must be done now.
I choose to readd them.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You seem to have fixed the problem with the generated files fooling CVS
into thinking I had modified them so I'm happy.

  I've just run up the latest snap (17/aug), and after installation, I
can't do 'man fvwm2'.

  This seems to be because the man page itself has a new header (.SH
HEADER) claiming that the command is 'fvwm' (n=E9e fvwm2), and it is this=

that Solaris's 'catman' uses for the windex file.

  I.e., although the file is fvwm2.1, windex ends up with 'fvwm' in it (s=
o
one can only 'man fvwm') ... but man then fails 'cos there's no 'fvwm.1'.=

(only 'fvwm2.1).

I like the idea of forcing a coredump. All modules should do it this
way. It's a big help for debugging.

Ta very much. Don't give me all the credit though, I think it was you
who suggested separating the background pixel from the pixmap. Without
that we wouldn't be able to use shaped pixmaps. And don't forget Brad
who is a coding dynamo.

Are you using a hacked version of xload and xclock? The ones I have only
do solid background colors.

oclock has a transparent option, I don't know if it works when
swallowed.

I think there is something not quite right with the way gradients are
calculated.

Linear Gradients
================
"Gradient 2 black white" should give two pixels black and white. It
gives black and #777777.

Non-linear gradients
====================
1) I don't think the lengths of the segments should have to add up to
100. It's not impossible to add up the numbers and scale from the total.
2) I'd like to be able to have steps in the gradient. I think this measn
being able to specify a segment length of zero and have that translated
in to a segment length of 1 pixel (maybe 0) e.g. "gradient 1000 3 cyan 1
yellow 0 cyan 1 yellow" would give two ramps of 64 pixels from cyan to
yellow.  The closest you can get that the moment is "gradient 1000 3
cyan 49 yellow 1 cyan 50 yellow" whihch doesn't give a nice sharp line
down the middle but a blur.

I think part of the problem stems from the fact that AllocNonLinear uses
AllocLinear to do each segment.

Cheers,
Tim.

The coredump should be optional, perhaps enabled only during debugging
or something.  Quite often a module can ignore and recover from an X
error (I get this on restart, but there's no other affect to me system
that I can determine) so I think forcing it to dump core is not a good
idea for user versions.

Also, I agree all modules should install the same handler.  When the
mythical InitModule() function is written and put into libfvwm.a, it
could do that (then the module can replace the function after
InitModule(), if it wants to).

I think you're wrong on this one Dominik.  Just making FvwmTheme finish
starting up before FvwmButtons is only going to be satisfactory if you
never try to change a colorset dynamically.  FvwmTheme has the ability
to change colorsets at any time and the other modules that have been
colorsetified all update themseleves whenever a colorset changes. The
reason I put this into FvwmTheme is that I think it would be very nice
if you could try out other peoples themes just by pasting the colorset
lines into an FvwmConsole.  Having to do a Recapture to update is bad
enough with styles but a Restart to update the modules is just too
slow.  I think we should fix FvwmButtons so that it follows colorset
changes.

I'm not saying that ModuleSynchronous should be deleted, it does reduce
redrawing at start up (it might also make it possible to swallow an
FvwmScroll-ed window).  I just think that the man page for FvwmTheme
should not say it is the only way to start it up.

Cheers,
Tim.

Some modules silently ignore some errors for very good reasons
(FvwmScroll ignores BadWindow on Reparent) so having a common handler
would require all modules to ignore those errors. We might end up
ignoring too much.

That's why I said that the module can replace the function... do I not
understand what's going on?  I know next to nothing about X error
handling.

That helped Tim now I'm catching on I guess I just always took the gradient stuff as truth and assumed it all worked.  At the very least you are right we need to avoid using AllocLinear in creating nonlinear gradients.  

As to your point on Linear gradients, the reason it is wrong is that it is going through AllocNonLinear to create the gradient.  So nonlinear gets npixels = 2  start = black end = white.  and it then calls linear with npixels=3 start=black end=white   and it returns an array with three colors in it.
Guess which one is getting chopped off?  


If you give me a couple of minutes I can patch the linear stuff.

I'm going to have to agree with Tim on this one Dominik.  The wording
in the man page is a little to harsh for my taste.  You probablly want
something like FvwmTheme can be started with ModuleSynchronous to reduce
the number of repaints, by other modules during startup of fvwm.

But Tim I don't think Dominik was planning on leaving the colorset set
stuff the way it is in FvwmButtons he just commited what he had so far
so we could help with his xload/xclock problems.

I think I have a fix if you wouldn't mind commenting out 
Graphics.c:243 and trying out your various tests.
I did try HGradient 2 black white and that works as planned.

The oldest version on my disk is 2.0.38 and it already has
the same title drawing code as 2.2.2. If somebody can provide
me with a version where it still worked and with screenshots
of the titles from both versions I can look into that.

Of course. My fix intended the right thing, but I missed taking care
of the total number of colours. Although the percentages may add up
to 100% you may get a few colours less or more than you requested
because of ronding errors. I will look into that.

That's not what I wanted to say. Of course you can change configurations
while the modules are running. But there is still the problem that
FvwmIconMan coredumps because fvwm sends the colour sets in reverse
order. What I was trying to say is that FvwmTheme should start *before*
all modules that want to use it. It makes the modules more stable and
reduces redrawing greatly.

No need to fix it, I wasn't finished rewriting it yet :)

I know that it sounds a bit strong, but I don't want to have people
complaining in the future because they don't understand the
implications. And writing even more about startup seemed to be overkill
to me. If you are unhappy with the wording, feel free to change it,
but I'd prefer that the man page discourages people from experimenting
with FvwmTheme startup. If they do it as I wrote they can do nothing
wrong.

Yup, but without you I would not have begun such a big task at

Er, no. With the experimental stuff I have in FvwmButtons it
simply forces its own background on the swallowed application.
Very dirty and unreliable, but seems to work for xload and xlock.

*FvwmButtons(3x2+15+3, Colorset 6, Swallow xload 'Exec exec xload -g +32767+32767 -fg $fg -bg $bg -nolabel`)
                       ^^^^^^^^^^

If the application ever sets its background again...

It does, but what I am aiming at is forcing our colour set
backgrounds upon applications that don't support all the
fancy stuff we can do. E.g. you can make an application
shaped with the colour sets, even if the applications is
completely ignorant about shapes, but a real transparent
background is much more difficult.

Ah, we think alike. I have already rewritten the code in this way. The
'100%' limitation was rather silly. I have already removed it and fixed
that damn color allocation.

You could now say

  gradient 1000 3 cyan 50000 yellow 1 cyan 50000 yellow

Is that good enough?

Not really. The whole logic in the calculations was screwed. The
approach to add up everything and hope that the total is right
simply didn't work.

No, I meant to force a coredump only when we would exit anyway. I have
written a function that does it (libs/XError.c (PrintXErrorAndCoredump()))
and put it in all modules that were using a private X error handler.

I upgraded to the latest CVS sources today (from 2.3.6), and noticed that my
TitleStyles no longer work.  I imagine it's from:

Changes by:     domivogt        99/08/01 08:19:24
[...]
Log message:
* fixed title drawing
[...]

Anyway, I'd try to fix it myself, but I'm rather tired at the moment, and
I'm not familar with fvwm's title-drawing code, so with the two combined I
probably wouldn't get very far.

Here are my titlestyle entries from ~/.fvwm2rc:
TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 18 -- flat
AddTitleStyle TiledPixmap title-act.xpm
AddTitleStyle Inactive TiledPixmap title-inact.xpm -- flat

Attached is a screenshot showing what my titlebars look like

I wanted to remove FvwmAudio from CVS and 'cvs remove'd
all its files, but then I accidentally deleted the CVS
subdirectory. Now I can neither check in the changes nor
can I check out a freas FvwmAudio. If I try I get the files,
but not the CVS subtree.

What else would the mythical InitModule do?  

Parse cmdline arguments?  How about "ParseModuleArgs"?  It's been sitting
in libfvwm for a few months now.  Has anyone used it?

It does?  I never saw this my setup creates 5 managers, using colorsets
2,3,4 of 0 through 4.  I usually see my initial managers get drawn in
the regular bg,fg colors. Then the change_colorset function gets called
when the colorsets actually arive.  Could you give me an example of when
it dumps?

Now the only time it does dump core, and this just occured to me last
night, is if FvwmTheme crashes.  That is because FvwmTheme allocates the
pixmap in the XServer (keep in mind a Pixmap is really an unsigned long,
which is the id of the real pixmap in the XServer).  But when FvwmTheme
dies X cleans up after it by freeing any on freed pixmaps.  So when one
of the modules tries to use one of the pixmaps they get a BadDrawable
(fatal error).

So what I think we might want to try is having FvwmTheme ask fvwm to create the pixmap and then return the long to FvwmTheme.  Any comments, Tim I hope you are reading this too.

Here's a challenge for our configure experts:

THere is a file libs/defaults.h where lots of tuning/default
constants for fvwm are defined. I want to use the same constants
in the man page so that I don't need to update it every time
one of the defaults changes. Any hints how to do this?

Perhaps you need to use more colour sets? I saw the coredump is caused
by an all-zero colour set in this call:

  	XSetForeground (theDisplay, man->backContext[i], man->backcolor[i]);

(x.c, line 906).

It didn't happen again since I use ModuleSynchronous to start FvwmTheme.
I am definig colours sets 0 to 11 at the moment and the problem shows
about one time out of five. I think it will become more likely the more
colour sets you define (plus IconMan should use colour sets with low
numbers).

Sound like a good idea. If it doesn't slow down things considerably...

Tim, yesterday I tried to port the gradient styles from
Graphics.c for TitleStyle and consorts. But with the current
code I have to do this:

  - Create a pixmap with the gradient
  - Stretch the pixmap in X direction to the required width
    (creates a new Pixmap)
  - Stretch the pixmap in Y direction to the required height
    (creates a new Pixmap)
  - Copy the contents of the pixmap into the window title.
  - free all pixmaps

This is ***slow***. There are two ways to solve the problem.
We can either try to write code that handles pixmap background
for titles (which won't work well with the current ...Style code
because of the stacking of styles). Or we need gradient drawing
functions that allow to draw the gradients directly into a
drawable of a given size. What do you think about it? I'd prefer
the second approach, but I'm unwilling to duplicate the gradient
drawing code.

BTW, shouldn't the CreateStretchPixmap function work in a single
step instead of calling CreateX/YStretchPixmap? I think it will be
more efficient but not much more code.

You got me thinking here and I realized that one place this will always
fail is with motif applications the window we have is not the one you
want to set the background of, and I just tried their is no way to get
to those windows, so you would be garunteed that motif apps wouldn't get
gradients.

As for xload and xclock I think the only thing you can do is set up a
timer and send an Expose event to them preriodically.  I'm not sure how
slow that would be though.

I think the simplest solution is to make sure FvwmTheme doesn't crash
;-)
If we create a MakeMeAPixmap command we would also need a DeletePixmap
to go with it and some means of synchronizing the request/response. 
Sounds a bit complex.

Another possibility is to use XSetCloseDownMode() in FvwmTheme so the
pixmaps and colors are not freed if FvwmTheme crashes.  This would
create color and pixmap leakage unless we could come up with a way for
FvwmTheme to free them when it restarts. Maybe
XSetCloseDownMode(Temporary) followed by XKillClient(AllTemporary) is
all that is needed.

Cheers,
Tim.

EEEK! drawing in other clients windows is a bit naughty.  It must work
in xload because it does and XClearArea before drawing the load line.  I
guess that xclock moves the clock hands by drawing the old position in
the background color and then drawing them in the new position in the
foreground.

Making an application shaped is OK but don't forget that the application
may be using it's own colormap so you can't just draw in it's windows.

Excellent stuff. It fixes all my annoyances.

Great. I was trying to think of a way to handle "cyan 1 yellow 0 cyan 1
yellow" but couldn't come up with an alogorithm that wasn't horrible.

I think it's possible by adding another 3 inputs to
CreateGradientPixmap(). The extra inputs would be the pixmap to draw
into (or NULL) and the size of the pixmap. CreateGradientPixmap()
assumes the pixmap size suits the gradient type so the code to put the
pixel values into the image would have to be scaled by
width/pixmap_width etc.  The image would have to be created to match the
pixmap size so the final XPutImage works properly.

The HGradient code would be

    case H_GRADIENT:
      for (i = 0; i < pixmap_width; i++) {
        register Pixel p = pixels[i * width / pixmap_width];
        for (j = 0; j < pixmap_height; j++)
          XPutPixel(image, i, j, p);
      }
      break;

where pixmap_width is the width of the input pixmap and "width" is the
width given by CalculateGradientDimensions(). I think this might also
fix the Tetris effect when making gradients with just a few colors.

Yes, just laziness on my part.

Actually that may be possible too. I didn't try it, but I think
the algorithm already handles that case (by not allocating anything
for emty segments). If it doesn't work it would be only a small
change to handle zero length too.

I just upgraded to the latest CVS and did a Restart, and some of my
Emacs frames and some of my rxvts, and my Netscape were both resized to
be only one line (or pixel for Netscape) tall (width was unaffected).
Some were iconified, some weren't.  I don't see a pattern as to which
ones were resized and which weren't.

Weird.

Here's the bottom of my error log; I believe these were all generated
during/after the restart but I'm not 100% sure.

Paul,

I noticed this a couple of days ago, a make clean all took care of it.

Well, libs/defaults.h isn't generated by configure, so it would be a bit of
a pain..  One option is to have this file generated by configure (perhaps
with options to set them as well), in which case it would be really easy--
just add the man pages to AC_OUTPUT() and use the appropriate @var@
replacements in the man pages.  The alternative is:

echo -n "Generating man pages..."
grep '^#define' libs/defaults.h | awk '{print "s/@"$2"@/"$3"/g"}' > config.tmp
for x in `find . -name "*.[1-8].in"`; do
	sed -f config.tmp $x > `echo $x | sed 's/\.in//'`
done
rm -f config.tmp
echo "Done."

That would accomplish what you're after. It looks pretty ugly, but
it's not straying too far from the way configure would do it... 

You'd end up using something like:
"... The default delay is @DEFAULT_CLICKTIME@ milliseconds...."

Well, I couldn't reproduce it on subsequent restarts.  I think it must
be transient.  I don't _think_ it's related to old builds, but you never
know I guess...

The idea   of   "configure" changing the content     of man pages,  is
interesting.   This way, the fvwm2 man  page could  drop references to
XPMs if they aren't installed, etc.

However, this would  create a bit of  a problem on our  web site.  The
generated man  pages would reflect the  options chosen by the last one
to generate the pages.

Tim, I can't figure out how colour set 0 is initialised.
Where is the background set to this grey hue?

I think that's not portable enough with sed and awk. If I use configure,
where would I put the default values? I'd like to be able to keep them
in defaults.h.in if possible.

Which window should I draw to with Motif apps? I was thinking about
drawing into the main window and its first child. Would that help?

Doesn't sound like anything I want to try.

I have now made a fix that solves the problem that window moves
were too slow. Had nothing to do with ConfigureNotify or Expose
events though. The 'excessive amounts' of Expose events seem to
be normal with XFree. The only way to reduce them is to use
'Emulate fvwm' to have the feedback window in the top left corner
(and of course to close all other windows :-) ).

Neil, could you please fetch another snapshot and try it with
and without the move bug workaround option, please? If your
original problem goes away even without that option I will
remove it again.

Bye

Can't you have a space as the shortcut key?

Submission from: (NULL) (129.128.153.50)


Hello,

I would like to suggest the followin .fvwm2rc options:
MaximizeRight, MaximizeLeft, MaximizeTop, and MaximizeBottom.
If bound to a titlebar button etc... then these would work
exactly like maximize but only one side of the window being
resized would expand: not both.
This is useful if you want for example a window to fill the
top part of the screen without obscuring the window below or
if you want a window to expand to the right leaving the buttonbox
visible.

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

I like being able to browse menu's using the keyboard, and cancelling a
submenu using the left arrow is very handy, but wouldn't it be more
consistent to have the right arrow for entering it? (without disabling
the "enter" key for it, of course)

My RestartFunction is defined this way:

AddToFunc RestartFunction
+	I	Module FvwmPager 0 3
#+	I	Module FvwmCommandS

(FvwmCommandS is commented out.)

When the pager goes away, I can get it back with WindowList, but it has
a very strange geometry. The y coordinate is just my screenheight, so it
should appear in the page beneath the current one. But I DON'T have a
page there, I'm only using two pages, one on the left and the other on
the right side.

Another problem is I can't reproduce it many times. I can't find a
reliable way to reproduce it, it just "happens" sometimes, not very
often (less 10% of the restarts).

Hum.. I just discoverd "Recapture" brings the pager back.. (as well
xbiff, which tends to go away too.)

Regards,

Tung

Uh, it should always have worked this way. I see that it's broken at
the moment.

Teehee, what a funny cut-and-aste bug:

This code in menus.c

  case XK_Right:
  case XK_KP_6:
    if (!MST_USE_LEFT_SUBMENUS(mr))
    {
    }

should really have been:

  case XK_Right:
  case XK_KP_6:
    if (!MST_USE_LEFT_SUBMENUS(mr))
    {
      if (miCurrent && MI_IS_POPUP(miCurrent))
        return MENU_POPUP;
    }
    
:-)

If I remember correctly this was the fix for some bug. Of course
the area wherre warping is done does not need to be *this* big.
I'll look into it when I have the time. Can you please
explain why you don't like it? I'm just interested and would like
to understand the usability issue behind this a bit better.

With 2.2.2, it underlines, but I can't seem to select it,
so I'd say you can't have space as a hotkey.

I thought I saw it somewhere restricted to letters and numbers.
It wasn't in the man page.

DefaultColors sets colorset 0. The default DefaultColors is "black
gray", it's set in SetRCDefaults() in fvwm.c

It might work, wether its the right thing to do or not is a completelly
different matter though.

I don't like it when software tries to outsmart me.. "I'm sure you want
your mouse pointer over --> there".. No, I didn't!

Enlightenment has (or atleast had) a pretty sane way of handling
resizes, not sure how to explain it.. but I'll give it a try:

If you hotkey+mouse grab a window by the 'o' and drag down-right, you'll
get something like this:

+-------+    +----------------+
|    |  |    |           |    |
|----o  |    |           |    |
+-------+    |-----------o    |
             |                |
             +----------------+

Somekind of proportional grid/rubber mat... Which is IMO a better
behaviour than warping the mousepointer across the screen.

I took a quick poll in the room about the warping:

Like it or not:
5 - Most annoying, not usable, hate it
0 - I like it

Existance:
5 - If existing, very optional, Off by default
0 - On by default

The default of Fvwm shouldn't totally change behaviour in our opinion.

The whole thing is a hack. If it doesn't work then we won't fix
it but tell people not to use it.

Dan, is it already possible to duplicate the 'sliding' effect
FvwmButtons currently uses for its panels?

I'm not sure if this is what you intended

menus.c:ReadMenuFace
  else if (StrEquals(style+1, "Gradient"))
  {
    char **s_colors;
    int npixels, nsegs, *perc;
    Pixel *pixels;
    char gtype = style[0];
  
      return False;

    mf->u.grad.pixels = pixels;
    mf->u.grad.npixels = npixels;
    mf->type = GradientMenu;
    mf->gradient_type = toupper(gtype);
  }


return False ?????????????

  Odd. I'm sure that it (right-arrow) used to work ...

Can you give an example of the output? Or better: if you know
what's wrong, can you fix it (it's a rather simple function)?

It used to print

*FvwmWinList: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 9 (BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter))
   Major opcode of failed request:  53
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
   Resource id of failed request:  0xc00010 
 Leaving a core dump now

now it prints

*FvwmWinList: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 9 (BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter))
   Major opcode of failed request:  53 (CreatePixmap)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
   Resource id of failed request:  0xc00010 
 Leaving a core dump now

Cheers,
Tim.

FvwmAnimate produces a different kind of animation.
(Sort of zoom lines to show the path the window took when it changed from

Both modules don't update their backgrounds when they are
resized. I didn't try the other modules with colour set support,
but I assume they have the same problem.

It might be useful if the sendtomodule command could specify the
animation type (an optional 9th arg) so that a module could pick the
animation style without affecting the users choice for normal
iconification.

?????????????????

It ***can't*** print this. THe resonsible line from XError.c:

  fprintf(stderr, "   Major opcode of failed request:  %d \n",
	  error->request_code);

How could a '%d'-printf argument print a string? BTW, if it
prints this additional information now - great, but I'd like
to understand why. Which module is printing this?

Yup, that's what we need to get the 'sliding' effect for FvwmButtons.

Try a cvs update.  XError.c does the number to string translation, this
thread started from the CVS commit message that implemented it. I'm not
sure that there is not a better way of doing it, 
XGetErrorDatabaseText() might work but I couldn'e understand the man
page.

Cheers,
Tim.

Try this:

*FvwmAnimateDelay 100
*FvwmAnimateEffect Lines
SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate 10 10 100 100 500 500 100 100
*FvwmAnimateEffect Twist
SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate 500 500 100 100 10 10 100 100
*FvwmAnimateEffect Lines
SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate 10 10 100 100 500 500 100 100
*FvwmAnimateEffect Twist
SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate 500 500 100 100 10 10 100 100
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmAnimate*

You need to do "DestroyModuleConfig" once and a while to
not have a memory leak.

You can use an alias for FvwmAnimate to not affect other animations.

Use a colour set with a gradient as background and make the pager
bigger. You will see it clear as day. To resize IconMan you may
have to turn off the MWM styles.

This leaves FvwmAnimate in twist mode. My default mode is Random and I
don't want it being changed by a module that is using FvwmAnimate for
its own animations. What I'd really like is to be able to do:

SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate 500 500 100 100 10 10 100 100 Twist

And for FvwmAnimate to do a twist and then go back to Random mode for
icons.

Having the optional mode means no memeory leaks.

> You can use an alias for FvwmAnimate to not affect other animations.

Do you think that FvwmButtons should start its own FvwmAnimate with an
alias?  I suppose it could be called FvwmButtonsAnimate but how do you
stop FvwmButtonsAnimate from doing the animations for other windows that
get iconified?

Cheers,
Tim.

Okay, that solves one part of the problem. With the 'Frame'
animation we can get the 'expanding box' effect. (Though I
still think an optional pagameter for the SendToModule would
be nice). Now we need a bit more sophisticated animations:
Just animating a wire frame is not quite what we want. The
window itself needs to be animated.

Can this be fixed? :-)

I wouldn't do that. I'd simply require FvwmAnimate to be running
to get the 'sliding' effect. We do this with FvwmTheme already.

Yes, after I sent my last mail, I thought about it a few minutes
and realized that all those qualifications, point out that the above
is NOT the way to go about this.

It would seem to me that color, delay, line width and iterations might
need control also.

Meanwhile, back to FvwmButtons panels, the panels slid out themselves,
since FvwmAnimate XORs its animation onto the screen, it needs to grab
the server during animation.  Its not clear to me how the panel could
slide out and have zoom lines at the same time.

Nope, I'd rather have FvwmAnimate doing all animation and FvwmButtons
none. This way needs some more functionality as pointed out in my previous
mail.

I am using a gradient and as you can see in my screen grab nothing
appear wrong.  I know for a fact it handles it because I know it was
broken when I was first creating the patch, I finally figure out that I
neede to reset the pixmap in the ReConfigure function in x.c.

here is my config, why don't you send me yours it is possible that I
missed a case.

Just aa thought but the window shade feature really does what we
want here.  Could we move that code into libs and just call it from
FvwmButtons??  [I haven't looked at the window shade code so I don't
know if this is possible]

While is seems logical that all animation take place in one module,
I think I agree with Brad.  This looks more like a library function.

I don't see what you would send to FvwmAnimate to have a Panel

send the entire window content.  (I think.)

Screenshots attached. Screenshot 1 shows the original FvwmButtons

The window ID, the start and end rectangle and the sliding method
(left, right, up, down). For example:

  SendToModule FvwmAnimate x11 y11 x12 y12 x21 y21 x22 y22 slide-left 0x300000a

FvwmAnimate could map the window itself. Of course it would be easier
to get FvwmButtons running with library functions. But I'd like to
enhance FvwmAnimate anyway: what I imagine are animations when windows
are mapped and unmapped, just like you see in movies: first, a dark
green frame is drawn, then a grid, and then the window flickers a bit
before it maps :-) We wouldn't want to have all this code in several
modules *and* fvwm itself, right?

Yep; some confusion over BuildXLockMenu, I think.  I'm forcing a snapshot
build now.

*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale works only if your DeskTopSize is 3x3.
If it isn't FvwmPager assumes it is and only finds out about
your desktopsize after it has mapped. You can see this effect
sometimes when it first starts up.  I think the fix for this is
to pass DeskTopSize to the modules in the same way as ColorLimit
i.e. in the initial module config loading.

This gives a 3 row iconman. When the number of windows on a desk is
not a multiple of 3 there is a gap at the bottom.  The gap should be 
drawn in colorset 5 but instead it's drawn with colorset 0 (but only
the background color not the pixmap is set as the window background)

Alright lets try a couple of things here, 

one could you run M4 for with -debug it rights your rc file in /tmp with
all the macros filled in.

two try running a pager unswallowing your pager for me. and see if it is still broken.

three here is the screenshot, I had forgetton it.

I'll use FvwmCpp instead. Complete config file attached.

This fixes the pager, but iconman still fails (note that I can only

  Yes, I still suffer flashes under this new snap.

  I am convinced, now, esp. from the xscope output, that the app. is
redrawing its whole window upon a ConfigureNotify (of which, natch, there
are loads when one drags).


  Unfortunately, I'm not convinced I'll be able to persuade the
GUI-builder's authors to do anything about it since, according the the X
ref. man., this event is used to tell the app. of a change: I'd assumed
that it was more of a hint, and that any resizes/redisplays that happened
would also generate a Expose/Resize event.

  If that's not true, then they can justofy the full window redraw as a
resize process (yes, I know they could remember the size & only do it if
it'd changed, but that's a nicety, not a bugfix).

  Unless anyone happens to know that WMs in general (not just FVWM) /do/
send both Resize/Expose and Configure ...

Thanks, it fixes the blank bits when first drawn but a Refresh still
causes the pixmap to be lost and replaced with the background color.

Brad, did you ever think about getting commit rights for CVS?
I don't think there would be any objections.

Actually Tim, and I discussed that, and alas I can't actually commit at
the moment, due to some crazy firewall rules but I'm in the process of
getting a less restrictive machine setup and then I should be able too.
So in the mean time I hope you all don't mind throwing in the occasional
patch for me.

I think the ICCCM requires the window manager to send these
ConfigureNotify events even if the size is not changed. The folks
writing this GUI builder are really doing something wrong. It's
not technically illegal what they do, but it's not a nice way to
behave for an application. The synthetic ConfigureNotify is meant
to inform the app. of its new position which might interest some
programs (with transparent background). Thea right way to do this
is to check if the window has been resized before redrawing.

I don't know which WMs do it at the moment, but any WMs that don't will get
a constant stream of bug reports from users of apps like rxvt with a faked
transparency effect.

Hi All,

I saw this in my console after running an fpga design tool from
Xilinx.  Does the message below help?

Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

Is there more that I can report regarding this issue?

Tell me when you resize IconMan what do you want to see.  
blank squares or do you want all of the buttons to resize themseleves??

I was able to reproduce your problem while working on Tim's and they
are related so what is the correct behavior right now you are left with
empty squares, however if you update one of the colorsets after a resize
it will fill in the area empty area by resizing all the buttons.

I've been using fvwm-2.2.2 with eXceed and it works great except for the
arrow keys.  I have CTRL-arrow.key bound to desk left/right/top/bottom moves

# Arrow Keys
# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100

but that is not exactly working properly.

I have a pager with 1 desktop and 8 "miniature view" (I hope that's what they
are called)

+ "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
DeskTopSize 3 3		# BAD NAME FOR COMMAND - should be FvwmPager?SIZE?

which gives me the following pager look

-------------
| a | b | c |
-------------
| d | e | f |
-------------
| g | h | j |
-------------

yet if I were sitting in view-A and CTRL-right, I endup on view-F instead
of view-B.  I haven't modified any of the settings of the keys (ie. no
xmodmap or xkeycaps settings) -- the bindings work fine withOUT eXceed
which leads me to the belief that I need some extra eXceed setup ?

BTW: the CTRL-arrow.keys only take me to the following views --> B,D,H,F
    (for up, left, down, right respectively)

Any Hummingbird eXceed experts out there ? Tim/Dan ?

I'm running eXceed from a Pentium-III windows-NT (yuck) to a solaris machine
 'uname -a' --> SunOS eddie 5.6 Generic_105181-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2

okay one more time this diff includes the last changes I sent, so start from cvs again.  This should also fix Dominik's problems with IconMan not handling resizes correcttly.

My Desktop size is like this:

DeskTopSize 2x2

(I don't know if the "x" is required, but thats the way I read the man
page.)

My Pager is invoked:

FvwmPager 0 1

So I have 2 desks, 4 pages each.  Control arrow moves me around in
the 4 pages on my Sun's and under Exceed.

I'd try changing the Desktop size, and then check and see how Exceed has
the keys configured.  Try using some other key, like F1.

Dominik,

I can no longer reproduce this can you confirm.  It may have gotten
fixed along the way.  However I did find won bug if you don't use
balloons and change colorserts.

here is the one line fix, could you take care of it when you get a chance?

I don't think you'd see the problem that I am having if you have only 4
pages.  Try increasing the number of pages you have to see if there are any
adverse affects.

ie.

 DeskTopSize 3x3  # Or any other #x# as long as its more than 4

BTW: Should 'DeskTopSize' be renamed to something along the lines of
     FvwmPagerDeskTopSize.  Its strictly related to the pager, right ?

I'll give this a try and let you know, but do attempt a larger 'DeskTopSize'
to see if you get any weirdness.

I tried:

Desktopsize 3 3

(exactly like yours, and it works fine for me.)

I don't think so.  It also stops the arrow keys from going any farther
than they do.  This is entirely independent of the Pager.
(I don't run the pager, and I have no need to, I can find my way around
2x2 pages without it.)

I'd still try another key, and looking at the Exceed key definitions,
but right now, I'm guessing.

This is really odd - I just tried binding F1 and that worked FINE.  Then I
said, "what the heck" and tried the same 4 bindings in the .fvwm2rc file
through FvwmTalk and they started functioning properly.  So I looked at my
.fvwm2rc file further to see if I was clobbering those entries for some
reason (eventhough they only don't work under exceed) and saw nothing.
So I started pasting all the key-bindings into FvwmTalk regardless of content
in hopes of narrowing it down and it kept working without a hitch.  I'll try
to restart exceed to further narrow it down to see why it doesn't work straight
off the bat.

Dan, when you added 'Desktopsize 3 3' did you exit you exceed session and
start a new one (I don't know how recapture/restart would affect things) ?

I'm thinking its a setting once invoked stays set; the question is why isn't
it getting set for me as soon as I started my exceed session ?

Hello,

Thanks for your sample functions but they do not do
what I had asked for. Your functions move the entire
window. I asked for a resizing function that pulls
only one side of the window. Repositioning should look
different for each position of the window.
See <http://www.cs.mun.ca/~nzanella/temp.html> to get an
idea of what I am suggesting.

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

I exited Exceed before trying '3 3'.

To get the behavior you describe, you'd have to have something like:

Key Left	A	C	Scroll -200 +100

Check for "read" commands to see if your .fvwm2rc is reading other files.

Are you using FvwmCPP or FvwmM4?  Perhaps one of them is having some
fun with your .fvwm2rc.

Hi,

I've no easy web access from here, so I send you this bug report as an
email, sorry.


I've got the FvwmPager iconic in the down right corner of the screen.  If a
balloon doesn't fit in the screen horizontally _and_ vertically, it is badly
displayed horizontally. This is because, balloon position is first checked
horizontally and then vertically, and `vertical' modifications cancel
`horizontal' ones and then the right side of the balloon is outside the screen.
Here is the code responsible for it (modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c):

  /* too close to left */
  if ( window_changes.x < 2 )
    window_changes.x = 2;

  /* too close to right */
  else if ( window_changes.x + window_changes.width >
            Scr.MyDisplayWidth - (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2 )
    window_changes.x = Scr.MyDisplayWidth - window_changes.width -
####   First change

      (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2;

  /* too close to top ... make yoffset +ve */
  if ( window_changes.y < 2 ) {
    y = - Desks[i].balloon.yoffset + view_height;
    XTranslateCoordinates(dpy, view, Scr.Root, x, y,
                          &window_changes.x, &window_changes.y, &dummy);
  }

  /* too close to bottom ... make yoffset -ve */
  else if ( window_changes.y + Desks[i].balloon.height >
            Scr.MyDisplayHeight - (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2 ) {
    y = - Desks[i].balloon.yoffset - Desks[i].balloon.height -

      (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border);
    XTranslateCoordinates(dpy, view, Scr.Root, x, y,
                          &window_changes.x, &window_changes.y, &dummy);
####                   2nd change, last change forgotten.

  }


Suggested fix: just put horizontal check after vertical check:



  /* too close to top ... make yoffset +ve */
  if ( window_changes.y < 2 ) {
    y = - Desks[i].balloon.yoffset + view_height;
    XTranslateCoordinates(dpy, view, Scr.Root, x, y,
                          &window_changes.x, &window_changes.y, &dummy);
  }

  /* too close to bottom ... make yoffset -ve */
  else if ( window_changes.y + Desks[i].balloon.height >
            Scr.MyDisplayHeight - (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2 ) {
    y = - Desks[i].balloon.yoffset - Desks[i].balloon.height -

      (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border);
    XTranslateCoordinates(dpy, view, Scr.Root, x, y,
                          &window_changes.x, &window_changes.y, &dummy);
  }

  /* too close to left */
  if ( window_changes.x < 2 )
    window_changes.x = 2;

  /* too close to right */
  else if ( window_changes.x + window_changes.width >
            Scr.MyDisplayWidth - (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2 )
    window_changes.x = Scr.MyDisplayWidth - window_changes.width -

      (2 * Desks[i].balloon.border) - 2;


regards,
Stephane

Good point. Probably the bug is that FvwmIconMan doesn't properly resize
at all. Another bug seems to be that FvwmButtons doesn't resize swallowed
apps when it's resized itself.

Of course not. BTW, I have the same problem with firewalls from
my work. A colleague has written some kind of Java socks proxy
that takes me through. He's unwilling to put it under GPL though,
but I can ask him if I can give it to you.

That means that the offending window requested a minimum size of -2x-22
pixels. In this case it doesn't really matter. The only thing to do
would be to report this bug to the developers of the tool and hope
they will fix it.

OK, I did some more tests and found out that the following key bindings break
the arrow-key bindings noted above (this is only broken under exceed)

If I include,

Key KP_2        A       C       GotoPage 1 2
Key KP_4        A       C       GotoPage 0 1
Key KP_6        A       C       GotoPage 2 1
Key KP_8        A       C       GotoPage 1 0

the arrow.keys no longer work and I get movements to specific desks.

It seems as though exceed thinks the following,
 down  arrow-key is my KP_2
 left  arrow-key is my KP_4
 top   arrow-key is my KP-8
 right arrow-key is my KP-6

Dan, are you able to reproduce what I've described above now ?
If not, I'm stumped...

BTW: recapture doesn't change state -- good; restart, on the other hand, will
     re-show the problem in case you don't want to restart you exceed session
     between .fvwm2rc changes.

BTW: KP_# works like a charm - no problems with my keypad bindings.

Could we agree that Tim applies your patches? I'm getting a bit confused with
all the patches I'm already applying.

I can make it produce the error by cd'ing to utils and touching *.in. 
The error
doesn't happen with make but does with `MAKE="make -j 5" make -j 5' i.e.
a parallel make so it looks like one of the scripts isn't producing a
uniquely named temporary file

  I've just done a patch for windowlist.c that allows a Next-like '()'
condition specifier to appear in front of the current options (after
position).

  I'm in two minds as to whether it's worth removing some of the
'duplicate' WindowList options, though.


  The likely candidates are: CurrentDesk NoIcons OnlyIcons NoNormal
OnlyNormal NoSticky OnlySticky


  AFAICS, pro-removal:
  - tidier
  - less code duplication

  anti:
  - normal conditions are cumulative (i.e., a window has to match all the
conditions) while WindowList opts. generally aren't. I don't see how one
could, say, list all icons /and/ window on desk n. Not that I can see
anyone who'd want to, but ...
  - WindowList can do Desk <n>; () only has CurrentDesk [this ought to be
added, I guess].


  I'm tending towards leaving 'em in.


  On the same subject, should the given conditions be blindly applied if
given (i.e., a window is only included if it matches the conditions,
regardless of whether it matches the other WindowList options) or should
the conditions be used as an alternative (e.g., '(some condition) Desk 2'
lists all matching '(some condition)' /and/ on 'desk 2').

  I've coded as must-match-if-given, but if done as an alternative pick up
there'd be problems picking out your matches from all the other windows,
which by default will be shown.

Hi,

I've downloaded and installed 2.3.6, and have found a bug in
FvwmCommand.  FvwmCommand.c assumes that a couple of environment
variables are set, specifically HOME and DISPLAY.  If they are not set,
calls to strlen() and strcpy() with their return values result in
cores.  The questionable calls are located in lines 156 and 165 of
FvwmCommand.c.  The return values of the getenv() call should be checked
before using them.

I discovered the bug by running FvwmCommand as a cron job.  The HOME
environment variable existed in the shell spawned by crond, but the
DISPLAY variable did not, thus causing the core.  Use of FvwmCommand by
my user id worked fine since the environment variables were correctly
set.

Thanks,
Brennan

  Oops. Ish.

  Yes, it shouldn't coredump (!), but if you don't specify a FIFO name (-f
or -S I think), and also don't have HOME or DISPLAY set, then how does
FvwmCommand know which FIFO pair to use to communicate with the correct
FvwmCommandS (HOME for location, DISPLAY to ID login - there may be more
than one)?

Neil,

To answer your question--I'm not sure.  For a workaround, I just changed
the code to strcpy() in "" as the DISPLAY if the variable didn't exist. 
That fixed *my* problem.  After I saw that that worked, I didn't take
the time to delve into it more than that.  I'm not sure if it's any help
to you, but the pipes setup in my home directory are the following:

".FvwmCommand-foo.bar.nortel.comfoo.bar.nortel.comC|" and
".FvwmCommand-foo.bar.nortel.comfoo.bar.nortel.comM|",

where "foo.bar" is my machine name, of course.  I hope this helps.

Brennan

  Not really! Not only can I not understand how it actually *worked* given
that DISPLAY would've been set when FvwmCommandS was run (or did you patch
that too?), I can't figure out how the code would have generated those
filenames at all - unless gethostname() returned
"foo.bar.nortel.comfoo.bar.nortel.com", and DISPLAY was "" at FvwmCommandS
startup (if unset, it, too, would dump core).

Why don't you post the patch so that I can have a look
at it. If I had to do it I would give WindowList an optional
new syntax that takes a normal condition modifier like the 
Next, Prev, ... commands (see conditional.c). I wouldn't start
mixing both methods of specifying flags but mark the old
syntax as obsolete.

  OK. It's not tested yet, mind.

  That brings us back to one of the questions I asked: Next/Prev
conditions are AND conditions (you get only windows that match all listed
conditions); those WindowList optons that are actually conditions seem to
be OR conditions (you get windows that match /any/ of the conditions).

  But yes, ideally, we'd extend the Next/Prev conditions to cover all
those supplied by WindowList, then leave the WindowList options as just
those things that really are options.

Line 128 of FvwmCommandS.c looks mighty suspect.  I'm not sure of the
inner workings of sprintf(), but sprintf()'ing to the same string as one
of the arguments to the call may be the cause of this.  I inserted two
debug statements just before line 128--one to print "client" and the
other to print "hostname".  "client" = ":0.0", and "hostname" =
"foo.bar.nortel.com".

When this is the case, line 128 (and sprintf()) returns "client" as
being "foo.bar.nortel.comfoo.bar.nortel.com".  As stated before, using
the destination string as one of the arguments to sprintf() is probably
not a smart idea.

  Hmm. That's not right at /all/, is it?

  I think it ought to be:


  if( name == NULL ) {
    char *dpy_name;

    /* default name */
    home = getenv("HOME");
    if (!home)  home = "";
    f_stem = safemalloc( strlen(home) + strlen(F_NAME) + MAXHOSTNAME + 4);
    strcpy (f_stem, home);
    if (f_stem[strlen(f_stem)-1] != '/') {
      strcat (f_stem, "/");
    }
    strcat (f_stem, F_NAME);

    /* Make it unique */
    strcat (f_stem, "-");
    gethostname(hostname,32);
    dpy_name = getenv("DISPLAY");
    if (!dpy_name)  dpy_name = ":0";
    if (!dpy_name[0]  ||  ':' == dpy_name[0])
      strcat( f_stem, hostname );  /* Put hostname before dpy if not there
*/
    strcat (f_stem, client);

  }else{
    f_stem = name;
  }


  .. in both FvwmCommand.c & FvwmCommandS.c

Hi,

I switched over to a Sparc Ultra 5 platform recently, and compiled and
setup 2.2.2.  After launching fvwm, I noticed that there was something
peculiar with my FvwmButtons module.  Edges between buttons were not
drawn properly and were jagged (see attached GIF).

I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether this was a problem with
the fvwm code, the X server, the graphics card, or perhaps the monitor? 
Please forgive me if this is a stupid question.  I've run fvwm on a
number of platforms and never seen behavior like this.  Thanks for any
input.

Brennan

P.S.  Just in case you're wondering, I've tried 2.3.6 and gotten the
same results.  Also, I doubt if it's related to configuration, but
here's my FvwmButton config:

*FvwmButtonsFrame 2

It's not the monitor and probably not the graphics card, it might be the
X server or FvwmButtons.  I can't reproduce this but then I don't have
any wm applets and I had to use xclocks instead.  FvwmButtons doesn't
crop swallowed windows so it might be something to do with the sizes of
the buttons.  Have you tried making the buttons bigger or using the
(NoHints) swallow option e.g. Swallow (Respawn NoHints) ...?

Cheers,
Tim.

I added NoHints to all of my swallowed apps and that didn't change
things.  I also tried to make each button 96x96 by using Size, but that
didn't change the size of things.

How about readline support for the FvwmForm module?

I seemed to have caused an infinate loop with malloc in the middle.  I'm
tracing it down now.  I caused this with xmms, so a word of caution to
anyone else using xmms and an fvwm snapshot...

In 2.2< version, when someone want to drag a windows from one
 desktop/virtual screen to another using middle button and got
 outside the pager, the pointer handle the moved window at the topleft
corner of this window which was very usefull (allowing to move this window
evrywhere in the screen)

Now in 2.2.2 version, if the pointer go outside the pager the pointer 
will handle the window from anywhere, manytime from outside the windows
itself. This new beavior isn't very handy: for exemple, depending of where
is the new handle, you can't move the windows everywhere in the virtual 
screen, and sometime you can move it outside ANY desktop/virtual screen
in a way you cannot get it back, this window is lost somewhere :-).

Is it possible to get back to the old 2.2 beavior ? It's not a feature,
 it's a bug :-)


Thanks.

S.R.

Yes.

It looks    to me  like    the "KP_"  bindings   override the  "Left",
etc. bindings.

Looking at the Exceed keyboard config, they have "Left" on the arrow
keys, and the keypad.  On the kepypad, "Left" is the unshifted state,
and "KP_4" is the shifted state.

Fvwm  takes the "KP_4" binding and  applies it to both  keys that do a
"Left".  This doesn't seem right to me.  Perhaps if the binding
was for any modifier, but not with the Control modifier.

I tested this with 2.2 and 2.3.7.

Dominik?

Perhaps as a workaround, if you don't want to use the keypad keys
as arrow keys, you could go into Exceed, XConfig, Input, Edit,
and remove "Left", etc. from the keypad definitions.

Great - at least you see what I was experiencing.  The workaround is not a
problem, since I rarely logout (depending on how often NT croaks) its not that
big of a headache - I'll simply re-institute the arrow.bindings through
FvwmTalk by hand after each login (I just thought it was worth mentioning
since the behavior did differ from what I'm normally used to under unix/linux)

Thanks Dan for the help and the prompt responses..

Keep up the great work guys !!!

The second (parallel) make will not fail, but the state is not good, any
of 7 generated from .in files can have a zero size.

I don't know how to fix this problem, but it happens because AFAICS
../config.status, used to generate fvwmbug.sh and all fvwm-menu-(word)
scripts, is not designed to be run in parallel with itself. If I am right
this must be probably reported to autoconf developers.

I wonder, how faster or slower a parallel make is than a normal one.
A normal make always takes all my CPU.

Mikhael.

  I run dtcm with a NoIcon style - I've configured the asclock that I run
to deiconise dtcm with FvwnCommand, then when I've finished with it I
iconise it & it vanishes again. No prolem there.

  However, I've found that overnight (every time I think, though possibly
not), since I leave myself logged in Mon. a.m. to Fri. p.m., my FvwmPager
has plotted the open dtcm window, even though it's not open (and AFAIK not
opened itself then closed itself while I'm not here!).

  It is easily fixed by cliking on the asclock to /really/ deiconise it
then iconising it again - the FvwmPager then correctly doesn't show the
dtcm.


  Anyone any ideas? Obviously I can't make it happen on demand (!), but I
suspect it's possibly something to dtcm maybe doing something at midnight.

I guess it's slower if you only have one CPU :-)

A parallel make should be faster even on a single processor machine. The
idea is gcc spends most of its time in I/O not actually computation, so
while one gcc is blocked another can use the cpu.

I see that Tim applied my patch, could you both confirm that your
respective problems are now fixed, and Tim could you move your bug

This sounds interesting.   I think you are telling  me  that a program
can  get the content of  a window  using  a window ID  even before its
mapped.  We could even do those winXX type title bar animations.
(Not that I like them.)

The reason I changed FvwmAnimate to  accept the "SendToModule" command
was  to     enable  animations for   FvwmTaskbar,    FvwmIconman,  and
FvwmIconbox.   If someone wants  to take that  on, I think FvwmAnimate
will support that quite nicely in its current state.

Submission from: (NULL) (195.100.244.152)


when I set the border and handlewidth to one pixel width and place a window
over that window: the one-pixel:ed border will save some of the graphics in
the window placed upon it. borders will also "steel" graphics from the
root-window.
the bug was found some weeks after the first version of fvwm2 had been
released in the snapshots-releases.

Well, if it has never been mapped before this might be a problem :)
But in the end I see no reason why the window shouldn't get expose
events for each state of the animation. Might be too slow for some
applications. Hmm, this will probably only work nicely with
background storage. We could set the backing storage attribute
to always for the window being animated and hope the X server
does the right thing. Hmm - hmmmm, how does FvwmButtons do this
at the moment?

Yup, seems a one-pixel border is never redrawn after the first
time.

What about shaping the window? If a window has a shape mask with
only the top left and the lower right pixel set, would it get
an Expose event for the complete window?

Since CreateStretch*Pixmap uses an unsigned int for width and height, if it
gets passed a negative number (due to an application with broken window
hints), the highest bit is set, resulting in an insanely high number (eg.

enough to bring many systems to their knees..  Here's the fix:

 Hi,

there's been a small bug for the last week: if you specify a
background color for a button (i.e. *FvwmButtons(Back foo ...) )
then the frame/relief gets drawn with the appropriate color, but
the background of that button gets drawn in the default color given
by *FvwmButtonsBack. (I'm not using FvwmTheme).

This seems to be caused by the #if 0 in modules/FvwmButtons/draw.c,
line 252, which disables the else-branch.
Removing the #if 0 / #endif works for me, but maybe it's not the
correct fix now with the FvwmTheme stuff.

Thanks for the great work!
Bye, Philipp

Mark,

that patch works only as one would expect if the styles
RaiseTransient and LowerTransient are used. I could imagine
the final behaviour like this:

There are three styles, (Dont)RaiseTransient and
(Dont)LowerTransient plus (Dont)StackTransientParent.

The first should work as the man page says: If they are
set, raising/lowering the parent window raises/lowers
transients too. The StackTransientParent style additionally
says that the parent window is to be raised/lowered together
with its transients whenever a transient is raised/lowered.

At the moment the patch is way too strict. The problems I
see are:

 - You can't lower transients below the parents anymore,
   even with DontLowerTransient and DontRaiseTransient set.
 - If both Dont... styles are set you can't raise transients
   above any other windows.
 - Again with those two styles: When you click on a transient,
   its parent is raised.
 - The LowerTransient/DontLowerTransient style seems to have
   no effect at all.
 - You can't restack transients anymore. If an application has
   two transients, you are unable to raise one transient above
   the other.

We need to clean up these issues before we can apply that
patch.

The better way is to delete the last revision. I have just executed:
  cvs admin -o1 FILE
twice for every utils/*.1 to cancel two last revisions of these files.
For some reason multiple FILES not accepted, when revisions are different.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It's about three times faster on a 4 way ultra-sparc.

cd fvwm/libs
time make:
 
real    0m17.779s
user    0m11.940s
sys     0m2.740s

time make -j 5:

real    0m6.212s
user    0m12.200s
sys     0m3.120s

uname -a:

SunOS tazmo 5.6 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4

It gets less impressive on the modules that only have few .c files to
compile.

Cheers,
Tim.

Not bad. After Brad's suggestion I tried to compile some old
version on a one processor machine in parallel and serial.

Parallel make:

  60 seconds

Serial make:

  57 seconds

Dan, I almost have FvwmAnimate working with FvwmIconMan.  My only
problem is on a deiconify I usually see the window get mapped then the
message gets toFvwmAnimate.  Is there anyway that you know of to delay
the deiconification until Animate finishes?

I don't think its going to be easy.

FvwmAnimate is using M_LOCKONSEND so that fvwm2 doesn't progress
until it gets a response from FvwmAnimate.  You could do the same thing
with FvwmIconMan.  I don't think thats going to cover the whole
process through, the "sendtomodule" command will let fvwm2 proceed.

I was hoping  the  lack of synchronization  wouldn't hurt  the  effect
much.

All modules will have this problem. I think we need generic way of
synchronizing other modules with FvwmAnimate. Couldn't the requesting
module provide its name with the command and then wait for FvwmAnimate
to send back a notification that the animation has finished?

I got half way through making FvwmWinList do the same (then I realized
it din't know where the window was located) and I gave up when I saw
this.

I don't think there is an easy way to get fvwm to pause in the middle of
iconifying a window and yet continue to pass messages between modules.

I think a better solution to this is for the modules to tell FvwmAnimate
where to animate NoIcon windows to i.e. have it handle:

SendToModule FvwmAnimate NoIconLocation windowid x y width height

FvwmAnimate can then do the animation at the right time and fvwm will
wait for it (it uses M_LOCKONSEND).

It means that FvwmAnimate will need 4 extra ints per window, initially
set to 0 and when it sees an M_ICONIFY with width & height set to zero
(i.e. a NoIcon window) it substitues the NoIconLocation numbers for the
M_ICONIFY packet numbers.


Cheers,
Tim.

Looking thru the code, I think making FvwmIconMan an M_LOCKONSEND
module is at least worth trying.

Be careful about any X grabs.

M_ICONIFY and M_DEICONIFY both have the window locations don't they?

I think I'd have to try it to be sure, but in module_interface.c
any commands it gets from a lockonsend module, it hands off to
HandleModuleInput which I think can make it wait for another lock on
send, then return to the previous one.

Reply-To: christian.wiedholz@hl.siemens.de

OS: Solaris 2.5.1
fvwm version: 2.3.7  (fvwm-snap-19990824)

1. True color visual
There seems to be a difference in display of icons like the xemacs-icon
when starting fvwm2 without any options and with "-visual TrueColor".
When using the latter option, borders of the icons (for the shadow) are
missing.

2. Icons disappear
>From time to time icons of iconized windows disappear. I'm not quite
sure when, maybe after a restart. I couldn't reproduce that behavior.
However these windows can be accessed via the window list.


Ciao,

Christian

And another problem:

The new packet types M_SCROLLREGION and M_FUNCTION_END are
never used in fvwm, i.e. never sent to the modules. I guess
you forgot to include some file in the patch?

I noticed one potential problem with the patch:

  --- fvwm-2.3.6/libs/Module.h.deskonly	Thu Aug 26 16:13:23 1999
  +++ fvwm-2.3.6/libs/Module.h	Thu Aug 26 16:15:16 1999
  @@ -96,7 +96,9 @@
   #define M_RESTACK            (1<<28)
   #define M_ADD_WINDOW         (1<<29)
   #define M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW   (1<<30)

                                ^^^^^^^

You won't be able to ever get this M_SCROLLREGION package since on
a 32 bit architecture 1<<32 is zero. 

It's not clear to me why packet types cannot simply enumerated.
To all: any comments?

Bits are used since modules can set up a mask for the packet types they
want.

Hi Dominik,

It looks to me like these packet types are only defined in FvwmTaskBar.c
and only inside FVWM95 #ifdefs.  If no one ever defines the FVWM95 macro
anymore, then I guess these packet types are unnecessary.  That would
solve the previous problem too.

The patch for fvwm-2.0.46 only added in these types to fvwm/module.h,
which was where these packet types were defined in that version of fvwm.
I am not aware of a patch that sends these types to the modules, but I
am not sure what it would look like.  I simply searched for SCROLLREGION
in all the patches and all the sources for the fvwm-2.0.46-5 rpm, and
only found references in FvwmTaskBar.c and the taskbar patch.

Jordan

Hm, probably a remainder of fvwm95 that is not needed in fvwm.
I will commit the patch soon.

Okay, the patch is in the development tree. Could you please make a patch
with entries for the NEWS file and for modules/ChangeLog?

Now let's address the problems. Please post some example configuration
I can use for testing and a short step-by-step description of how to
see the problems you mentioned (think of me as a complete idiot when
writing the instructions %-p ).

Bye

Sure. What did you do in move_resize.c?

I have no problem with the XORPixmap in general. The only thing
I noticed is that when I start dragging a window that's partially
hidden behind another, the pixmap wire frame jumps a few times
back and forth before forrowing the pointer propertly.

Hi Dominik,

Sorry this is a week late, but I've attached the new version of the
patch for fvwm-2.3.6.  Since I am running Red Hat, I altered the
previous redhat.patch and spec file;  I have included those as well.

Everything compiled OK and it ran without dumping core.  The sizes of
the buttons were actually OK, but now I realize I didn't try making so
many buttons that the taskbar had to start making them smaller.  That
resizing might create a problem...

The one problem I noticed is that when switching from desk to desk, the
taskbar didn't always appropriately refresh the text and pictures of
buttons.  It seemed to delete them OK, and redraw the buttons themselves
OK, but not refresh the text and mini-icon.

I'm not sure if I correctly treated the issue of checking whether a 
particular item is sticky (line 355 of the patch).  The mode for
checking this changed dramatically.  Actually, the change to using the
ConfigWinPacket structures was confusing to me.  I think I got it right,
but I am not certain.

Also, the in the past, the original patch had some problems with a
window that I would start iconified.  I'm not sure if that has been
fixed or not.

Regarding using fvwm-2.3.6 in general, I encountered two problems.
First, FvwmBacker didn't work.  Either the method for setting its
resources changed, or the way the IconPath's are read in changed.
Second, I had programmed the arrow keys in fvwm-2.2 to move around the
cursor if the cursor is on the background.  In fvwm-2.3.6, when the
cursor was above a shell window, I couldn't use the arrow keys.  I don't
know if my resource file was the culprit, or if it was something else.

Thanks again.

Jordan

No problem, it works.

I have no problem with this, but I fixed two coredumps while trying
to find this. I need a config to reproduce your problem if it's still
there.

Yup, it's okay.

I don't see a problem with windows starting iconic.

The IconPath and PixmapPath commands are obsolete and have been
replaced with the ImagePath command. What is your IconPath command
(plus PixmapPath plus ImagePath)?

It's a know problem in 2.3.6. Try a current snapshot instead.

Sure.

  MenuStyle * DoubleClickTime 0

It's not meant to protect the user from accidental clicks on the top
item but on a random item it he clicks somewhere near the bottom of the
screen. With earlier versions of fvwm, if you had a small window near
the bottom of the screen and double-clicked the close button you would
end up activating some random function from the menu instead of the
double click action (if you had one). The delay you experience is the
time allowed between the two clicks to trigger the double click action,
which is 450 milliseconds by default.

Well, then use the aforementioned menu style for your root menus.
You can make each menu work differently if that suits you (please
refer to the man page - ...MenuStyle commands).

Sure.

It's not meant to protect the user from accidental clicks on the top
item but on a random item it he clicks somewhere near the bottom of the
screen. With earlier versions of fvwm, if you had a small window near
the bottom of the screen and double-clicked the close button you would
end up activating some random function from the menu instead of the
double click action (if you had one). The delay you experience is the
time allowed between the two clicks to trigger the double click action,
which is 450 milliseconds by default.

Well, then use the aforementioned menu style for your root menus.
You can make each menu work differently if that suits you (please
refer to the man page - ...MenuStyle commands).

I must correct myself. You *can't* have a different DoubleClickTime for
each menu

I don't think it was ever gone. I tried to make it fool proof, but
I guess with enough raising and lowering windows during the triggered
delay it's still possible to confuse FvwmAuto.

A couple of problems with the recent set of commits for Button
colorsets.  First even if I don't set the global colorset option or
the one for the swallow of my pager the pager (showing two desks) gets
displayed incorrectlly, the first desk is displayed in some color, but
the second is fine.  Second I only have one pixmap button 
(Title Kill, Icon bomb.xpm, Size 60 30, Action Close, Colorset 0) 
and it gets a small rectangle with the gradient in the upper left corner 
and the rest of the square is black, the same is true for my xdaliclock 
and xbiff++, however xload and xbuffy seem to be okay.

Brad

P.S. the xcpustates use motif widgets, and I know they won't get colorsets

Now that colour set support for FvwmButtons is complete, which
modules are still outstanding?

Done:

FvwmButtons
FvwmIconMan
FvwmIdent
FvwmTheme
FvwmPager

Not necessary (no GUI):

FvwmCommand
FvwmConsole
FvwmCpp
FvwmDebug
FvwmEvent
FvwmM4
FvwmRearrange
FvwmSave
FvwmSaveDesk

What about these modules?

FvwmBanner
FvwmForm
FvwmGtk
FvwmIconBox
FvwmScript
FvwmScroll
FvwmTaskBar
FvwmWharf
FvwmWinList

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I need the colorset lines from FvwmTheme and the lines from FvwmButtons
to debug this.

I seem to have a problem with FvwmIconMan, I have 4 pagers defined, 3
go in FvwmButtons and are sticky, the last goes is StartsOnPage 0 1 0
and catches all my gimp windows.  The problem is if I use my I use mouse
or keyboard to traverse my pages. It seems that the manager follows me,
but worse than that it keeps redrawwing itself, over an over again. It
also happens if I move the manager from one page to another using the
Pager, but in that case once I release the mouse button, the manager
keeps following the path it took from the pager to my mouse release.

Is anyone else seeing this?  I'm not sure exactlly how to debug this
one, if anyone has a tip I'm listening.

Since all FvwmBanner does is display a pixmap, its not a candidate.

Brad, would you patch FvwmTaskBar? Since you wrote the colour set
support for FvwmWinList this shouldn't be difficult for you (TaskBar
has been spawned off from the WindowList code). I guess we can safely
skip FvwmBanner. I'll look into FvwmWharf then.

Hm, that's too complicated for me. Can you send me your IconMan
configuration (plus the lines that start it and possibly the
colorset lines)?

Submission from: (NULL) (207.38.97.136)


If I only have a few windows up, I can place them on different desktop
pages outside the current screen using GNU Emacs Lisp functions.

However, when I have many windows (100s), the window placement many times
fail to work at all. Emacs Lisp is unable to get the correct coordinates
and 
cannot properly calculate the target position.

Any ideas why this is so?

It works just fine in tvtwm (pl 11) so I had to switch back to use that
instead. Sorry.

This brings me to an idea, but I don't know if it's really worth the
"small" effort.

I have a rather big "Applications" menu which is seperated by normal
lines. It would be nice if I could jump to next section by a singe key
press like <Tab>.

Or use <Ctrl>+<Down> and <Ctrl>+<Up> for browsing the sections. I
personally don't like the (undocumented?) "moving down/up 5 items"
anyway. ;-p


Just a idea.

Hello,

(using lateste CVS versions..)

I have bound my middle mouse button to WindowList, but it doesn't work
I'd like it to. And I think it did it's job right a few weeks ago.

This is the binding:

Mouse 2         R       N       WindowList CurrentDesk Transient

And this is what shows up at stderr:

[FVWM][WindowList]: <<ERROR>> Unknown option 'CurrentDesk'

Or did I do something stupid? ;-(

Hum, next time I should do a search through the mailing list archive
first... grr.

But shouldn't the man page be updated about the changed WindowList
options?

B..b..but, you really mean *hundreds* of windows? Your machine must
be swapping for minutes before opening a new window, unless you have
a 256-way SMP machine (each CPU with 500 TeraHertz and 10 zillion
bytes of RAM) ;-)

Hm, unless you tell us what kind of windows you try to place, how
you do it ('I use Emacs' is way too vague) and what happens in
comparison to your expectations I can only guess. There are a
number of fvwm commands influencing window placement. For example
the ...Placement styles and StartsOn... styles.

In the end it's a problem of Emacs ('Emacs Lisp is unable to get
the correct coordinates') and I know a bug in Emacs that seems to
be fixed in 20.4 (although nobody intentionally fixed it). It
caused the position calculations of Emacs Frames to go awry, but
only for a few pixels. And my XEmacs request a window height of
65519 pixels or so from time to time.  You get the point; the
(X)Emacs window positioning and sizing code isn't famous for being
bug free ;-)

My advice is: try playing with aforementioned styles and try setting

  Style * HandleWidth 0

I know it's ugly, but if this helps it's a clear indication that
Emacs does some calculations wrong. If it does help, try Emacs 20.4.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

No problem.  Note he said "windows", not "instances of Emacs".  A single
Emacs executable can have as many individual frames (separate X window)
created as you like; there's very little incremental cost for making a
new frame once emacs is started.

I personally believe that FvwmConsole should have it, I know it's almost
like running FvwmCommandS and then an xterm as it follows .Xdefaults for
color and such but I'd think it would be more then cool to have that
nifty YGradient in the background

  This change shouldn't, AFAICS, have invalidated the existing syntax -
merely added the option of a [] condition class.

  Hmm. A mistake on my part, methinks. The patchfile I sent Dominik had
too much information :-(

  The following really ought to still be in windowlist.c:

  This just happened during the day! It may have happened this time at
some part of login - I didn't notice when.

  Anyone any ideas at all?

Something awful.  I will have another go at it.  I'm on anti-biotics and
I think it's killing off my brain cells.

This is a feature! When clients provide an icon bitmap if it is not a
bitmap it is assumed to be a pixmap. To display it fvwm creates a window
and copies the pixmap into the window.  Fvwm assumes that the pixmap has
the visual and colormap of the root window and so creates its icon
window with the same.  If started with the -visual option fvwm does not
allocate any colors out of the root colormap and so cannot draw the 3d
border around the icon. The result is that these icons look flat (like
icons that have an icon window provided e.g. Eterm).

Cheers,
Tim.

Instead of making FvwmGtk follow the fvwm colorsets I was thinking that
FvwmGtk could provide colorsets like FvwmTheme so that fvwm and the
modules could take on a GTK appearance and get their colors from the
.gtkrc file. Looking at the .gtkrc examples it seems that 4 colorsets
might be good (set by the normal, selected, active and insensitive parts
of a gtkrc style).

This one doens't even share the Fvwm visual yet.

Well FvwmConsole really does use an xterm for its window and we don't
get any sort of handle to the window, so I'm not sure how we could set
its background.  Tim, Dominik, any ideas?

Actually Tim did the WinList so I let him take first crack at it, and given Tim's comments on Script and Gtk, I'll take a look at IconBox.

Uh, it could be done the way I do it in FvwmButtons, but I'm not
sure if this is worth the effort (i.e. by forcing the background
upon the xterm).

I have still several problems with the new panel implementation in
FvwmButtons:

 1) I don't know how to find out the border width of the FvwmWindow.
    If you have a HandleWidth of 20, the border of panel obscures
    the button.

 2) What should FvwmButtons do if the panel is shaded or iconified?

 3) Since the window is resized when sliding it looks more
    like a growing but a sliding window (the application
    resizes it's graphics too).

 4) Can we somehow write a script that converts the old panel
    syntax to the new?

Any comments are welcome.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

The problem is we don't actually ever get the window we just do an exec xterm -e <args to connect pipe>

Same with FvwmButton. It is informed of windows being mapped.
You could wait for the xterm with the appropriate title being
mapped.

Alright I'll give it a shot then, and let you know if I get stuck.
Right after I finish with FvwmIconBox.

Hello,
If you do somethimg perhaps you can take the occasion to add a config
option for the user can use an other terminal than xterm with
FvwmConsole. 
Eterm can be a "user" solution for theme with FvwmConsole.
Of course it is only an humble suggestion in the real discussion ...

   Yes, a couple of hundred GNU Emacs frames from 5-6 Emacs
   processes.  On a 166 MHz 128 MByte i586 running RedHat-6.0. I do this
   when I'm working on really complicated programming problems.  Helps a
   lot to have your whole system spread out over the desktop pages and
   then wander over the pages as the problems are being solved.  No need
   to have any (out of date) printouts.

   I use the GNU Emacs Lisp function `set-frame-position' to place the
   frames on a page in a desktop.  The function `frame-parameters' gives
   me the current location of a frame through its `left' and `top'
   fields. As this only gives me the relative placement of a frame, I
   had to invent the trick of placing a "origo" frame on page (0 0) when
   I start GNU Emacs while there. Asking for the position of my "origo"
   frame as well as my current frame gives me enough info. The rest is
   just simple math.

   What goes awry here in fvwm2 is that `frame-parameters' fields `left'
   and `top' report erroneous values when I have too many frames
   up. Works fine when only a very few frames is there.

   How come, then, that everything works just fine in tvtwm with many

   fvwm2.

   Haven't tried XEmacs. This is GNU Emacs I'm using. 20.3 right out of

   I'll give that a trie. Thanks for the advice.

   With the information above, I hope you can figure out what is going
   on.

   Thanks a lot for your quick attention to my problem!

Xterm sets the $WINDOWID variable before it spawns the FvwmConsoleC
command so you could look for that and send it from FvwmConsoleC to
FvwmConsole.

There are quite a few different ways of doing window management and
drawing decorations. Because a bug occurs with one window manager and
not another doesn't means it's the fault of the window manager. It can
be the application as well. The reason why I suspect an Emacs bug is
that if Emacs lisp fetches the window positions it won't ask the
window manager for them but X itself. And I don't think X is lying
about them.

What you could do too is run 'xwininfo -all' to get information
on one of the failing frames see if something is wrong there.

   I have the following in my .fvwm2rc related to window placement:

      Style * NoTitle,NoHandles,BorderWidth 2
      Style * RandomPlacement,SmartPlacement

   which I guess is too ugly to many :^). But I concentrate on the text
   in the frames and don't care a bit about the decorations. They are
   just in the way. Being an Emacs freak, I have it all coded to the
   keyboard, so I don't need the handles.

   However, the placement commands you mentioned above only help when a
   frame is created.  I have no problem with that.  It comes up and is
   being randomly and smartly placed in my current page, just like I
   want it to.

   Yes, I could use those .fvwm2rc commands to place the frame wherever in any
   other page. But, that is too static. I want to be able to place my
   frames in different pages at different times.

   That's why I have reverted to use `set-frame-position' and
   `frame-parameters'.

I think the code to change other applications' backgrounds should
go into the library. This could be used as a graphics plug-in in
fvwm too.

I use FvwmPager from SCWM.  This way I figured out some strange behaviour 
of the pager:

When switching between desks, e.g. from 0 to 1, the pager does this in
two steps:  First it switches from 0 to 10000, then from 10000 to 1.

I use FvwmButtons to swallow xclock and xload, and I have noticed that
suddenly these buttons are being initially painted with the wrong
foreground
colour! It's hard to be sure, but it looks like the highlight colour used
to
give the buttons a 3D effect. It's silvery grey at any rate. The
interesting
part is that at the xclock secretly "knows" its true foreground colour,
because the clock hands and the seconds-pointer leave a trail in this
colour
as they move around the face.

   After giving me all those hints, I had another look at my Emacs Lisp
   code. Played around a bit and figured out that the problem comes
   about when I do a `raise-frame' before `set-frame-position'. If I
   raise the frame after I have moved it, it works just fine!

   Seems to be a timing problem.

   Anyways, my problem is solved and I'm happily back using fvwm2.

      With Kindest Regards

Here is the patch for FvwmIconBox, I beleive we agreed Tim would apply
these for me.  I didn't get use of the pixmaps working as background for
the icons and labels, it seemed to create to much flicker.  If you want
to try your hand at it look for the XSetBackground calls in RedrawIcon.

I don't see why we should do anything with SCWM's pager. Although
it's a spawn-off from fvwm we are not maintaining that code. Or
is this a typo?

fvwm-2.0.46 did it this way, but this has long been fixed.

No it's not.  SCWM does not (yet) have a pager of its own but allows to
use fvwm modules.  It is about the original fvwm pager as it came with my
Syse 6.1.  I only happen to use it together with scwm.  I just wanted
to indicate how I discovered that behaviour.  Sorry if it wasn't clear.  I
thought that you might be interested in getting bug reports about
fvwm-modules even if they are used in a non-fvwm context.

> fvwm-2.0.46 did it this way, but this has long been fixed.

Sorry for that.  I had checked the bugtracking system, but it had not been
mentioned in there.  (probably the bug was fixed before the bugtracking
system was introduced...)

Best regards,
Dirk Herrmann

I thought you were talking about SCWM's pager used with fvwm, not
vice versa.

BTW, upgrading fvwm is really easy with SuSe 6.1. Just de-install the
old fvwm, fetch a copy of the new fvwm-2.2.2 package (will be in
SuSe 6.2 too), then configure, compile and install it (to /usr/local).
Works straight out of the box.

No problem, I like to hear bug reports for already fixed bugs
rather than new bugs :-)

Most of the time we don't care to open bug reports for problems
we find ourselves. The bug tracking system already has around
450 messages, and it's been around for less than a year now :)

Yup, I could already confim this. It's a bug in xmms that I already
reported to the developers. Perhaps you could report it there too,
to make sure it will be fixed.

:-) I always like to hear this kind of feedback. It was not easy
to implement, but definitely worth the effort.

The Resize function will not let make a window smaller. You will first
have to start to make it larger. Then, immediately, without letting go of
the mouse button, you can make the window smaller.

It would be nice to have an option to the GotoPage command so that
you can return to the previous page. Just like tvtwm's scrollback function.

DestroyPicture frees up colors. If you use a PseudoColor visual and see some

No. The man page is correct. I'm not sure if this option was removed
on purpose. I've re-added it again.

Yup, that fixed it. Everything is the right colour again. (I meant the
background colour really ... ;-) )

            Mark, 
            that patch works only as one would expect if the styles 
            RaiseTransient and LowerTransient are used. I could imagine 
            the final behaviour like this: 
            There are three styles, (Dont)RaiseTransient and 
            (Dont)LowerTransient plus (Dont)StackTransientParent. 
            The first should work as the man page says: If they are 
            set, raising/lowering the parent window raises/lowers 
            transients too. The StackTransientParent style additionally 
            says that the parent window is to be raised/lowered together 
            with its transients whenever a transient is raised/lowered. 

Sounds okay. But is it only the raised transient and its parent which
move, or does the movement of the parent raise all its transients too?
(as if the Raise action was acting on the parent). The patch does
the second.

            At the moment the patch is way too strict. The problems I 
            see are: 

             - You can't lower transients below the parents anymore, 
               even with DontLowerTransient and DontRaiseTransient set. 

Well that *is* what I am trying to achieve, but I didn't intend to make it
obligatory. I've probably confused the issue by (a) making the mistakes
mentioned below, and (b) supplying one patch to introduce more than one
new feature.

My overall aim is for a configuration in which transients cannot
be obscured by their parent. This is Motif behaviour, and some of
our applications actually rely upon it. It can be partly achieved
with RaiseTransient and the new StackTransientParent, but still needs
something more to prevent the movement of the parent above its transients;
ie. when they are already raised, and the parent is raised again.
I would like another new style, say RaiseTransientStrict, which does
everything RaiseTransient does except allowing the parent to toggle
above/below the transients when they are all at the top of their layer.

             - If both Dont... styles are set you can't raise transients 
               above any other windows. 
             - Again with those two styles: When you click on a transient, 
               its parent is raised. 
             - The LowerTransient/DontLowerTransient style seems to have 
               no effect at all. 

Hmmm ... the patch was a little blunt in applying StackTransientParent
style without regard for the (Dont)RaiseTransient and (Dont)LowerTransient
styles - resulting in the above three problems. A little more logic soon
fixes that.

             - You can't restack transients anymore. If an application has 
               two transients, you are unable to raise one transient above 
               the other. 

Ooops ... that was working fine before ... before ... before I broke
it. I'll fix it.

            We need to clean up these issues before we can apply that 
            patch. 

I'm afraid there's more that needs cleaning up too: in my original
patch submission for 2.0.46 I included treatment of a whole tree of
transients (where a main-window-with-transient-subwindows is itself
a transient of another window). Well I did that out of a belief that
nothing prohibits it. You quite reasonably asked "Does this ever happen",
and it seems the answer is "Yup". Start Netscape, Edit->Preferences,
Navigator->Applications, press the "Choose" button to select a destination
for Downloaded files and bingo, you have three windows (1) File Browser
which is transient for (2) "Netscape: Preferences", which is itself a
transient for (3) the main Netscape window. It seems to me that  with
RaiseTransient, a raise of (3) which raises (2) really ought to raise
(1) too.


I'll send patches for StackTransientParent and RaiseTransientStrict
shortly. What do you think about the tree of transients?

Nope, documented. Excerpt from the man page:

  Ctrl-Cursor-Up or Ctrl-Cursor-Down move up and down five items

Okay, it's there for only a few days now :) Try Meta-Up and Meta-Down
with the latest CVS.

Hrm, something is awfully wrong here. I just got a coredump
because IconMan requested generated a BadMatch in a CreatePixmap
request (value out of range). Backtracing the coredump I find that
IconMan got a ConfigureNotify with these values:

  xconfigure.x = 0
  xconfigure.y = -164264529
  xconfigure.width = 151
  xconfigure.height = 0

Either fvwm or the X server are freaking out or some code
in IconMan overwrites parts of its own memory.

First of all the IconMan looks really strange when I start it
during fvwm startup. It creates four windows, the first two
stretch all over the screen and the other two have the right
size but are not on the current page (screenshot attached).
Is that on purpose? If I kill IconMan and restart it while
fvwm is still running, all windows end up on the current page.

I have seen the bug you describe once, but I don't know how to
reproduce it. The window jumped around the screen again and
again and again and again... To me this looks as if IconMan
got a ConfigureNotify event and reacted to it by configuring
itself (perhaps resizing). But has a different notion of its
own position and request a new position thus getting a new
ConfigureNotify again... I have seen something similar with
TaskBar: start a task bar at the bottom of the screen, then
drag it to the top. Most of the time it will jump back and
forth between the top and bottom border of the screen before
settling down. This *is* caused by a ConfigureNotify/Request
race condition with fvwm, but I didn't know what to do about
it and didn't care either.

------------------ a while later ----------------

Yup, it really seems to be what I suspected. Since we implemented
colour set support, a ConfigureNotify event triggers the function

force_manager_redraw() -> draw_manager() -> resize_manager() ->
resize_window() -> XMoveResizeWindow!!
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I made a patch that

 - eats up all ConfigureNotify events from the server before
   doing anything
 - only redraws if something has changed

Does that help?

Bye

Dominik ^_^

After today's (31 Aug) changes I see two problems.

Dominik, when I press a button in FvwmButtons, it takes modulo 2 or
substructs 2 when possible (I don't know which) from both x and y
button positions (there are 4x4=16 buttons). I don't use panels.

Tim, in the next pixmap last color (must be blue) becomes black.
If you leave only 'c blue' - it returns to blue. But yersterday it was
blue even with 'm black'. :-)

/* XPM */
static char * mini_monitor_xpm[] = {
/* width height ncolors cpp [x_hot y_hot] */
"16 16 8 1 0 0",
/* colors */
"       s none  m none  c none",
".      s iconGray5     m black c #808080",
"X      c #c0c0c0",
"o      s iconColor6    m white c yellow",
"O      s iconColor1    m black c black",
"+      s iconColor2    m white c white",
"@      c #000080",
"#      s iconColor5    m black c blue",
/* pixels */
"           .    ",
"XXXXXXXXXX.oOXXX",
"X++++++++.ooO++O",
"X+@@@@@@@oOoO.oO",
"X+@#####o##oooOO",
"X+@####ooO#ooO+O",
"X+@####Ooo##O#+O",

Mikhael.
