I'm seeing a very bizarre behavior on my Debian GNU/Linux box (3.0).
I'm using the official packaged version of fvwm from unstable
(2.4.10-2).  I had this same problem with the fvwm from testing (2.4.8)
so I upgraded, but upgrading didn't help.

I'm sure that this has not always behaved this way, but I suppose I
might not have noticed it for a while; I don't often look at my complete
process list.  I haven't modified my .fvwmrc or anything in months.

The issue is that any process I start either from fvwm directly or from
FvwmButtons will go <defunct> after I exit it.  It stays defunct
forever, with a parent of the fvwm process, until I restart fvwm.

For example:

  # ps -aef | grep defunct
  psmith   26363 26244  0 10:22 ?        00:00:00 [FvwmButtons <defunct>]
  psmith   26368 26244  0 10:22 ?        00:00:00 [rterm <defunct>]
  psmith   26572 26244  0 10:32 ?        00:00:00 [rxvt <defunct>]
  psmith   26713 26244  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 [rterm <defunct>]
  psmith   26718 26244  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 [rterm <defunct>]
  psmith   26765 26244  0 10:44 ?        00:00:00 [rterm <defunct>]

  # ps -aef | grep 26244
  psmith   26244     1  0 10:22 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/fvwm -d :0.0 -s -clientId 11c020967f000098873609811110258690033 -restore /home/psmith/.fvwm/.fs-restart-lemming:0.0
    ...

The FvwmButtons above is because I killed the old one and restarted the
module, to see if changing my FvwmButtons commands like "Exec rxvt ..."
to "Exec exec rxvt ..." would help but it didn't.

I don't get it: is there some kind of known issue with fvwm where it's
not waiting for children?  Or, maybe this is an issue with libc in
Debian or something like that?

Yes, but I am afraid that there is no good default (but when
someone choose for us as XRender do). I think the good default
depends on the applications the user use.

Yes linear colorcube are not so good. At least I can see the grey
colors gap. XRender solve this problems by adding some (but do not
dither).  Linear colorcubes are good for fast pointwise dithering (and
not so catastrophic visually). I've read some papers this day on
dithering and there are methods for dithering with an arbitrary colors
map but not in "real time" (this is maybe not an obstruction with
colorsets). So if we can find the gaps, we can either discover a new
dithering method with the lcc + the gaps or use the lcc when dithering
is needed and the lcc + the gaps if not.

Yes of course I am really interesed! If you know some articles or good

You might start here:

http://www.inforamp.net/~poynton/Poynton-colour.html

There are quite a few links there.

I spent a year or 2 reading sci.engr.color (usenet).

I'll send you the source separately.

Full_Name: Beat Müller
Version: 2.4.11
CVS_Date: 
OS: Solaris 7
X_Server: Xsun
Submission from: (NULL) (129.132.29.7)


When I start fvwm these error messages show up, about 2 to 4 in a row:
   RelieveRectangle: called with w = 7, h = -1

Then I patched do_relieve_rectangle in Graphic.c so that it shows 
more info:
   RelieveRectangle: called with w = 7, h = -1, x = 0, y = 0

This didn't ptovide the necessary information because I have no object
in the (0, 0)-corner. I am puzzled...

I don't know where RelieveRectangle is called in this case, but according
to the sources RelieveRectangle and RelieveRectangle2 are used quite
often. In that stage it is not of great use to add my .fvwm2rc here,
but if you can give me some pointers how to track down the calling
module.

Cheers
Beat

Well, I don't see it, but then I'm not using debian 3.0 either.
I do ps's often enough that I'm pretty sure I would have noticed.

Have you set ExecUseShell or $SHELL?

I plan to remove the current FvwmDebug (and rename FvwmNewDebug) later
unless you see a good reason not to. FvwmDebug is not currently up to
date anyway and has some problems that FvwmNewDebug does not:

  * it requires maintaining
  * it does not support all argument types well (like pixels, booleans)
  * the output is not very readable/parsable

FvwmNewDebug and FvwmGtkDebug are both fully generic, i.e. they will
support any new/changed packets without modification. Of course for this
to happen, structures in perllib/FVWM/EventNames.pm should be up to date,
please actually update this file when you add/change current module
packets. This class is used in all perl-based modules. In the future it
may be auto-generated, but since Perl library is more complete in this
respect than C module library, it is currently impossible.

FvwmGtkDebug is not a regular static module, it is a pretty useful
dynamical application, it requires Gtk-Perl installed, please test it.
FvwmNewDebug does not require anything special. I plan to add more
functionality to FvwmGtkDebug (Quit button :-), currently simply close a
window) and FvwmNewDebug (--log file option). Both support setting the
initial mask and xmask using command line options --mask and --xmask.

The reason to leave FvwmDebug for now is for reference and since it
currently has -w flag that is not yet supported. There is also a small
problem with M_RESTACK arguments that I will solve in perllib soon.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, no joy.

Mandrake 8.1.
I set ExecUseShell that way, restarted Fvwm, created some rxvts,
exited from them, then looked for defunct processes.

I tried:

exec rxvt
exec exec rxvt
exec rxvt &
exec exec rxvt &

then

ps -aef | grep defunct

Ok, applied, together with the typo fix of Suzanne.

When we have multiple xterms on our desktop, selecting (bringing to the 
front) the one we are interested in, requires clicking either on the 
title or on the BOUNDARY ONLY!! 

The title bar is usually hidden by the tons of other windows.

Given that the boundary is hardly 1mm 
wide, it's tough to click right on it. Is it possible to select an xterm by
clicking anywhere on it??

Please don't use the bug reporting system to ask questions,
thats what the mailing lists are for.

Look for MouseFocusClickRaises in the man page.

I did not know tha copy string allocated its own space.  Anywhere 
additional calls that I added probably also have this problem.  I will 
look at it closely this weekend.

Suzanne, do you prefer to continue to send patches or use cvs commits?

At least I, Dominik and Olivier applied your different patches since
January, so I think you have a quorum to get write permission.

So, if you prefer to use cvs and there are no objections, you may follow
the instructions in cvs.html and contact Jason.

Regards,
Mikhael.

CVS write access would be great. Then I can commit straightforward bugfixes as
I run across them.

Will do.

Greets,

I've developed a patch which enhances Ben Mathews' excellent titlebar-launcher feature.
It allows one to specify different actions when different mouse buttons are
clicked on a launcher. It uses the same sort of syntax for this as
FvwmButtons, like so:

     *FvwmTaskBar: Button Icon terminal.png, Action (Mouse 1) Exec xterm, \
                                             Action (Mouse 3) Popup TermMenu

"Action Exec xterm" still works and defines a general action separate from the
others.

One application for this is the desktop system I'm developing for Fvwm, which
lets you dynamically configure elements such as the taskbar. So a user might
left-click on a launcher to execute it, or right-click to popup a control menu
for that launcher with choices like "remove from taskbar".

As a sort of zero-cost side effect, the Start Menu can also take different
actions for different mouse clicks with this patch:

     *FvwmTaskBar: StartMenu (Mouse 1) Mouse1Menu
     *FvwmTaskBar: StartMenu (Mouse 3) Mouse3Menu

If/when I receive write access to CVS (I'm waiting for cries of protest before
submitting the request to Jason :-), I can commit this myself, but of course
I'd like to okay it with everyone first.

I wanted to write this before FvwTaskBar patch was applied, but realized
that 1) many use FvwmTaskBar, 2) I myself have no time to implement what
I suggest fully. Still maybe others agree with me.

Having 2 modules implementing the same is twice (if no more) work for
maintainance. FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan already have all features that
users want to see in FvwmTaskBar. And vice versa FvwmTaskBar currently
has several features that FvwmIconMan users want to see.

Generally, every new or old feature should be duplicated.

I have several thoughs about a smooth transition from FvwmTaskBar to
FvwmButtons with swallowed FvwmIconMan. I think that having only one
module for layout (currently FvwmButtons, but the name may be changed
to FvwmPanel) is what we need and having only one module managing window
list (currently FvwmIconMan, but the better name would be FvwmWinList)
is what we need.

The idea may be this. We stop adding any features to other modules and
only extend FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan. We then replace FvwmTaskBar with
a module that only converts its legacy configuration to FvwmButtons and
FvwmIconMan configurations (using aliases like FvwmButtons-FvwmTaskBar
and FvwmIconMan-FvwmTaskBar) and starts these modules. In the future we
encourage users to use only these 2 modules for creating their panels.

Suzanne, Ben, Olivier and other FvmwTaskBar lovers, is there a chance you
agree with such arrangement? Would not having one powerful FvwmPanel and
one or more "applets" to be optionally swallowed be a better solution?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Please, go ahead and send the request, you've submitted more

I kind of think that calling a taskbar anything other than a taskbar 
might be confusing to anybody not familiar with fvwm, but you also have 
a very good point about having less code to maintain.

Could you post your fvwm2rc file that shows how you got the neat XP 
taskbar with FvwmButtons shown on the screenshot?  It looks pretty cool.

I don't think so, does GNOME or KDE have a separate concept of task bar?
They have a concept of a configurable panel, something that we all try to
achieve.

> but you also have a very good point about having less code to maintain.

Actually there is one more solution. The goal is to have only one code and
one syntax for one complete feature. But this feature may be embedded in
several modules. I.e. create a library that is used in 2 or more modules.

But I think that whoever writes such library will come to a conclusion
that it is more clean to have modular setup, like FvwmPanel swallows
FvwmWinList (I use here the ideal names) than to try to embed such big
features like fully featured window list a-la FvwmIconMan or fully
featured button layout a-la FvwmButtons.

This does not mean other features like time-outed tips/balloons can't be
moved to the library for use in all C modules.

Well, you can't see what it does (it is dynamical) without running it.
To get the configuration, get the fvwm-themes cvs (or browse it online).
You want the files in themes/redmondxp/modules/ directory. Some knowledge
of how the modules component works in fvwm-themes may help too.

Mikhael.

Yay!  Let's dump yet another module! 8-)  FvwmTaskbar is way too
difficult to maintain already.  A modular setup sounds fine.  The
FvwmTile/FvwmCascade -> FvwmRearrange way may work too:  Replace
FvwmTaskBar with a symbolic link to FvwmButtons and add a
"--taskbar" option too (note that I'd like to move to GNU style
long option names in the future).  When FvwmButtons is started in
"TaskBar" mode it reads all "*FvwmTaskBar..." config lines and
translates them to the proper FvwmButtons config language.  The
translation may be done by calling a perl script.  This is what
has to be done:

 * Add the FvwmButtons taskbar mode code and provide default
   options to emulate a plain FvwmTaskBar by default.
 * Write a translation script.  This is the tedious part.
 * Add the features that are missing in FvwmButtons/FvwmIconMan.

In the same way, it should be possible to emulate FvwmWinList with
FvwmIconMan (FvwmWinList shares a lot of the FvwmTaskBar code).

So, I'm gone for a few days and people get write access?  I should 
take a break more often :-)  Nice to have you on board, Suzanne.

Oh yes, dump it,  I am all for it!  And while you are at it,
remove the debug capabilities from FvwmCommand as well which also
require maintenance and are seriously out of date.

You can ignore these messages for now.  I added them a while back
to catch bugs, but ironing out the places that call
RelieveRectangle with the incorrect height or width proved way too
difficult.  I will remove the message.

I'd have no problem with this, as long as it really is (or will be) possible
to exactly imitate the "taskbar" look with FvwmButtons + FvwmIconMan. I've
been using FvwmTaskBar to give my husband a reassuring Windozy feel when he
logs into Linux :-)

Still, is it okay if I commit the FvwmTaskBar improvement that I've already
developed?

Well, relatively to what is already duplicated, duplicating one Action
parameter is not very much. I have no objections.

But, it would be nice if we would think more about extending FvwmButtons
and FvwmIconsMan in the future, i.e. how to make them FvwmTaskBar capable
if not yet.

Is anyone interesting in adding the following features to FvwmIconMan:

  * a configurable maximal item width (like *FvwmTaskBar: ButtonWidth)
  * tooltips (like *FvwmTaskBar: ShowTips)
  * a configurable spacing between items
  * a configurable fixed item height (we have no analogue yet)

The last feature would enable automatical switching from one row to two
and more rows when FvwmPanel (i.e. FvwmButtons) is resized.

The next is moving of any-window-autohiding to fvwm or a module.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Should be in a lib (some users ask this for FvwmButtons).

One very interesting feature of the TaskBar is that its width is
exactly the screen width whatever the border width (this is even
dynamical). So for me a must is:
 
 * Do so that FvwmButtons understand % geometries as width%pw x height%ph:
   force the geometry of the FvwmButtons window (border width taken in
   account) to be ScreenWidth * pw/100 x ScreenHeight * ph/100. This
   should be maintained during FvwmButtons life.

An other minor feature of the taskbar is the asymmetric look of the
relief of the buttons. Users may complaint if this disappear.
Also there is the "..." feature and AutoStick. But I do not like
these two :o)

Also, it seems to me that it will be difficult to simulate FvwmTaskBar
resizing with a FvwmButtons: StartButton and GoodiesButton have fixed
size as the "WinList" use the full height. Note that I always resize
my TaskBar during a session. 

About Goodies: Mikhael is FvwmPerl can be used to write a "Proc" modules:
A module which will send (configurable) string and Icon with a configurable
period whenever
- The time change
- The used disk swap space / memory change.
- battery state change.
- Cpu info change.
- mailbox change.
- etc ...

Maybe there is a "proc" Perl module?

Ah yes this is an important feature. It is broken but it works
surprisingly well :o)

My conclusion. Yes it is a bit stupid to maintain 3 modules for
"window list". I vote for the replacement of the FvwmWinList by
a symlink and a warped config (one "sort" issue here).
For the TaskBar, in the view of the enormous work needed (I do not
want to do it now), I think that we should put the FvwmTaskBar
removal in the 2.8 or 3.0 todo list.

Moreover, I think that FvwmTaskBar is easy to maintain. I am agree
that the code is not terrible. But IconMan code is really terrible!

So one thing which should be done too is to make a big clean up
of FvwmIconMan code.

Probably extend FScreenParseGeometry to support 100%x5% syntax.

FvwmIconMan already supports 5 types of relief, adding more would be nice.
How about oval 3d borders and small spacing between buttons. :)

Actually AutoStick may be interesting as a general window feature, but it
is really not a showstopper.

Yes, the current table-only center-expand-and-fill layout management of
FvwmButtons does not permits this, but it is not very bad as it works now.

Even if such package exists, I don't want users to install anything from
CPAN (except for Gtk-Perl, because this is too nice GUI to miss it).

I am ready to write FvwmMonitor (or whatever this is to be named) once I
figure out the monitoring code for memory/disk/battery/cpu.

If we speak about names and symlinks, probably the new super-windowlist
module should have a new name. I may think about:

  FvwmWinList    (not really a new name, but it is the best for me)
  FvwmWindowList
  FvwmTaskList
  FvwmAppList

I don't like very much the last two, FvwmWindowList is ok.
So maybe as a temporary solution, copy FvwmIconMan to FvwmWindowList
and start to clean up FvwmWindowList? Or replace FvwmWinList?

Yes, it is terrible. I think the multi-manager support may be removed.
I don't see a good reason to have it. Just run 2 FvwmIconMan's.

Mikhael.

I guess I did that, sorry.
Fvwm is a proper noun and capitalization is probably correct,
but I don't have a strong preference. Its our proper noun and
I suppose we can do whatever we want with it.

I only converted what Dominik would convert anyway. I myself never write
"Fvwm" even in the beginning of the sentence. Either "FVWM" (acronym) or
"fvwm" (package/executable name) just like with GNOME, KDE, CDE or GNU
I would never write Gnu or Kde. But this is only my humble preferences.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I really don't care much about capitalizing it or not, but
constantly mixing "fvwm" and "Fvwm" is bad.  I once chose to use
the lower case version everywhere for consistency.  By the way,
the phrase/word "built-in" appeared for the same reason.  All
three spellings appeared many times in the various man pages, so
I just changed them all to "built-in" which was what ispell
suggested.  My dictionary also lists "built-in" as the adjective
for "to build in".  It does not mention "builtin".

I don't see how this helps to adapt to the screen width.  There is
still the problem that FvwmButtons can't easily find out its
border size.

Speaking of resizing FvwmTaskBar:  The

  *FvwmTaskBar: Colorset ...

background is not updated when the task bar is resized.  Instead,
the background is tiled.  Try

  *FvwmThemeColorset 6 vgradient 128 red green
  *FvwmTaskBarColorset     6

Perhaps someone could fix this.

Asymmetric look?  Never noticed that.  But anyway, the Draw3dRect
should be replaced with RelieveRectangle that is used everywhere
else.

Bah, users ;-)  Honestly, if someone can't live with a few pixels
drawn in a different colour, we may be better off to recommend not
to upgrade fvwm in the next ten years.

Shudder.  Maybe the most flawed "feature" in fvwm and its modules.

Yup, this will be difficult.  The FvwmButtons layout is strictly
statical and can't easily be enhanced to add or remove cells on
the fly.  At startup, FvwmButtons creates a grid of button
pointers.  In the most simple case one grid cell is exactly the
size of a button, but for more advanced layouts the grid has more
cells.  The button placement algorithm may or may not add or
delete grid rows and columns, depending on the options.  Once all
buttons are placed in the grid ("shuffled"), the grid size becomes
static.  When FvwmButtons is resized, the size of the button bar
is divided evenly among the individual cells.  New cells are never
added anymore.

To find the button belonging to the pointer position, FvwmButtons
divides the offset from the top left corner by the cell size,
yielding a cell row and column.  Then it looks up the button
pointer in the grid cell.  This obviously depends on all the grid
cells being the same size.  (There is some more logic dealing with
button bar sizes that are not multiples of the grid size).

All that needs to be done is to issue fvwm commands from a shell
script.  Pretty trivial.

Cough, cough!  I guess you never tried that with a non-sticky
taskbar ;-)  And there was a ConfigureNotify race condition for
years.  It's still in 2.4.x.

I won't tell what I think about the code in various modules, but
keep in mind that the original authors of the modules may still
read this ;-)

Gee, now I'm going to blame ispell (under XEmacs) which says
"BUILTIN is correct", but when I try to spell check
"built-in", it just says "BUILT is correct".

My dictionary agrees with yours.

I think Olivier suggested to solve it just like FvwmTaskBar does it.
By listening to M_ADD_WINDOW/M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW.

I think we need more than one (configurable) ways to create the 3d look.

I need such feature badly. How you would do the following. Dynamically add
or remove buttons in the given container. I am speaking not about syntax,
the syntax is pretty clear to me. To remove button from container:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons RemoveButton <buttonid>

To add new button to container:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons AddButton <containerid> <index> <newbuttonid>
  SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeButton <newbuttonid> Title t, Icon i

Or may be create a button without the parent and then add it:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons CreateButton <newbuttonid> Title t, Icon i
  SendToModule FvwmButtons AddButton <containerid> <index> <newbuttonid>

The grid should be recalculated after such add/remove, I guess.
I didn't have a chance yet to see how to implement this.
Maybe you can help here and add this add/remove feature, please? :)

We speak about the official FvwmTaskBar replacement here, right?

Maybe I don't understand you, but how is such shell script better than an
fvwm module written in perl (that is script too). In your solution:

  1) run shell/perl script (how, from cron, fork?) to send commands
  2) run FvwmCommandS module
  3) use external FvwmCommand in the script to send commands

In the solution that we with Olivier speak about:

  1) run persistent FvwmMonitor instance that periodically sends commands

Such FvwmMonitor gets parameters module-alias (to have several instances),
monitoring-type (battery/cpu/mailbox/time), time-interval (20 sec) and
other parameters that affect which command (title changed/icon changed) is
send and when. I bet, the "pretty trivial" script you speak about is
harder to implement than such module. Perl library helps a lot here.
Additionally, you may send dynamical commands to such module.

1) Transparent FvwmPager is ok (when used with ParentalRelativity), but
Tint does not work in the transparent colorset, it makes horrible colors.

2) When FvwmPager is transparent the fg for desk labels is always taken
from HilightColorset instead of Colorset.

3) When FvwmButtons Colorset has IconTint and the button has icon, the
IconTint is applied to the whole buttons instead of only non-transparent
part. In this case Tint does not have effect. I.e. to tint the whole
FvwmButtons that uses only one colorset, Tint and IconTint should have the
same values (otherwise image background in text based buttons look
different then in icon based ones).

This is all not urgent at all, but should be fixed sometimes, I hope.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The colorset enhancement may be calculating relief colors differently.
Currently, we use sh and hi (that is evaluated from bg if not given) to
do this. Such static colors produce bad results when used for gradient,
image or transparent background with a large or medium range of colors.

It would be better to have a boolean flag in colorset that switches off
the use of the hi and sh in colorset and evaluates hi and lo using the
internal algorithm based on the real-time bg pixel that should be
converted to the relief. The problems are clear. This is slower and not
very configurable. I wish the gtk color algorithm to be used in this case,
not motif's, otherwise it will be not smooth for random gradient/image.
Still regardless of problems, this should produce a much nicer result.

As for configurability, I think it is good to extend the colorset to have
a flag that chooses gtk-based or motif-based calculations. And hiFactor,
shFactor that are used in gtk-based (and maybe in motif-based) algorithms.
Probably these 3 values may be global for all colorsets to make it easier
for the user to define them. Or we may add Colorset * syntax.

----

One more issue to think about. Using numbers for colorsets is ok, but
using symbolic names is better yet. Technically it may be implemented
using one array (for numeric names) and one hash (for symbolic names).
These array and hash have no any correlation. Anyone may choose either
numeric or text id for colorset. Like:

  Colorset CDE4 bla-bla
  Colorset MENU1 bla-bla
  Colorset MENU2 bla-bla

  MenuStyle * MenuColorset MENU1, ActiveColorset MENU2

Preprocessing may be a solution, but this is really not the same as the
colorset library managing these ids itself.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I want to release 2.5.4 in 7-10 day unless there are big code changes,
small changes are ok.

Yes.  But then we need to say "keep the given window size at all
cost".  We don't need a "percentage of screen size" geometry.

Of course I can help here and there.  But implementing this
entails a full rewrite of the FvwmBUttons design.

I just wanted to say:  regardless of wether FvwmPerl implements
this, we can already have the same without it.

Fine with me.  I won't get around to make big patches until then.

What do you mean exactly?

"bg average" gives in general a good color with image and gradient
colorset. With Transparent average does not work, but it may be
implemented if the server support backing store (by taking a random
20x20 part of the root window and averaging on this part). Average
slow down colorset loading (~ *2 with an image).

No Objection. It will be good to have "private" colorset too.
A module may need to have a colorset for its own use only.

Hum, tinting the ParentalRelativity colorset is totally experimental
and it can work only under certain special situations.  It can work
with menu (can leads to some colors pbs with animated menu if you do
not "use" Backing Store). Does it works on your machine?
It can work "without" backing store with FvwmIdent, FvwmIconMan,
FvwmButtons by _chance_. Do you try it? In certain case I hope that it
can works (fine) without backing store; for example it can work with
FvwmIconMan button Colorset:

	Colorset 12 Transparent, NoTint         # bg cset
	Colorset 17 Transparent, Tint Black 30  # plain cset

works fine here without backing store. Similar good situation may be
reproduced with FvwmButtons Button/Container (but not the main
FvwmButtons background). FvwmPager is an other story in the view of
all the windows that it manages.

Any way to get a real change that Tint works with ParentalRelative
transparency you should start your Xserver so that it supports
BackingStore (this is the case by default with XFree-3, but with
XFree-4 you must pass the "+bs" option to the server).  You can check
if your server really support BackingStore by using xdpyinfo.  Also
you should set the following Style:
 
 Style FvwmPager ParentalRelativity, BackingStoreOff

It works here and I will be not surprised that it does not work
on your machine.

I do not think that we should support Tinted ParentalRelativity (it
may be undocumented and Tint should be reseted to no tint when
Transparent is used). If one want tinted transparency it should use
the RootTransparent Colorset (not yet documented as I hope to add
support for this everywhere together with clipped drawing before the
feature freeze). For this to work you should use Esetroot or fvwm-root
or FvwmBacker with *FvwmBacker: RetainPixmap[Esetroot] (not yet
documented as this is maybe "dangerous" if you cycle very very quickly
around different page/desk which leads to different bg).

I will take a look.

Ok, I think that I finally understand the situation. There is no
visual with two depths of course. The card has two hardware colormaps
and so it can has two installed colormap at once. I think that we can
detect this situation at fvwm startup and select the best visual
(if the -visual{ID} is not use).

- Call XListInstalledColormap, if we have only one cmap we have
nothing to do (just use the default visual).
- If we have 2 or more cmap choose the best one, found the associated
visual and use it.

The question is: should we use the best cmap/visual by default or
always use the default cmap/visual?

Yes, the card can support two visible colormaps at once.

I've heard that some Sun systems can be noticably slow at higher
depths.

I think automatic selection of the best depth rather than
the default depth would be a good feature.

The user might still want to override that at the command line.

Something I never noticed before:  I'm using a colourset
background for FvwmIconMan:

  *FvwmIconMan: *Colorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan: *FocusColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan: *FocusAndSelectColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan: *PlainColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan: *SelectColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan: *TitleColorset 6

  *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg red, bg green
  *FvwmThemeColorset 6 fg red, bg green, dgradient 128 red green

I just noticed that the *Colorset option is drawn into the
individual buttons.  I think some time ago the buttons were simply
transparent, showing the background colour set.  This happens even
if I comment out all the other colour set options except

  *FvwmIconMan: *Colorset 6

Any idea when and why this was changed?  At least when no button
specific colour set is given, the button background should be
transparent again.

Bye

It is my fault, sorry.

I don't use transparent images when I thought I do, so "non-transparent
part" is the whole button. To get an idea what I am speaking about, load
colors@redmondxp and modules@redmondxp and then execute one of:

  Colorset 10 IconTint red 20
  Colorset 10 Tint red 20

If all images would have alpha channel, it would work as expected.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just for your information, both the latest 2.4.x and 2.5.x support now
and suggest in the man pages the syntax:

  *FvwmIconMan: Colorset 6

>   *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg red, bg green
>   *FvwmThemeColorset 6 fg red, bg green, dgradient 128 red green

Just for your information, both the latest 2.4.x and 2.5.x support:

  Colorset 2 fg red, bg green

Although 2.4.x still requires FvwmTheme to be run, optional with 2.5.x.
Since you post your config often, can I suggest you to change the syntax
to the latest one for educational purposes?

I don't think anything was changed. At least everything works like it
worked for me. I have your old configuration from 2000 and it a is a bit
different. It uses colorset 8, not 6 for *FvwmIconMan: Colorset, and you
explicitely set this colorset 8 to be Transparent. :)

Ah, I wasn't aware of that.  From the man page:

  .IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id ]colorset \fIcolorset\fP"

I find that rather confusing.  What is the difference between
these two:

  .IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id ]colorset \fIcolorset\fP"
  .IP "*FvwmIconMan: [id] colorset \fIcolorset\fP"
                     ^^^^^

If a space is required, it should be "[id] colorset".  If no space
is allowed it should be "[id]colorset".  If both versions are
allowed it should be "[id] colorset", just allowing the unspaced
version without mentioning it.  "[id ]" is meaningless to me.
Does it allow spaces?  More than one and other types of whitespace
too?  According to the rules used in the other man pages, "[id ]"
is equivalent to "[id]" or "[ id ]", so I'd guess that whitespace
is explicitly forbidden.

Really?  Good you told me, I might never have found it out on my
own ;-)

I changed it by hand in the mail but missed the FvwmThemes lines.
Since I often run the same config file on 2.4.x, switching to the
new syntax is out of the question.  I even write some configs in
2.4 syntax and override them later with new 2.5 syntax if it's
available.

Yes, you are right.  I must have changed that by accident.  Still
I think transparent buttons should be the default unless the
button specific options are used.  What do you think?

There was a patch to the sigchild handling a while ago, but I
can't remember what it did.  Have to search the mailing list
archive and ChangeLog.

Yes, it was a bug in IconMan. I've fixed it.

I do not know. I guess that the logic in IconMan is to use the 
the bg colorset (if set) to the not set buttons colorset.
So, my fix introduce a bug: in this case the buttons should
be transparent. I.e., we should use the same logic than in
FvwmButtons. I will fix this.

Yes! Maybe I should read the all mail before answering :o)

I don't speak about average bg that is one single colors, I speak about an
ability to draw the 3d relief based in the current or neibour colors as
opposed to using one single hi and one single sh colors.

Take a look at some WindowMaker screenshots, like:

  http://www.chez.com/laurentpif/linux_images/wmaker1.gif
  http://windowmaker.org/images/screenshots/gradients.png

There are definitely better screenshots (I don't have a time to search for
them) showing how exactly hi and sh may be evaluated. The idea is this.
There is a rectangle with image or gradient, the edges of this rectangle
should be converted to a relief, they simply tinted with black or white!

Suppose, we have this rectangle (don't take the numbers too seriously):

  44444555556666677777

It is better to be converted to:

How you would document the folowing syntaxes (with and without id):

  *FvwmIconMan: colorset 45
  *FvwmIconMan: 1 colorset 45
  *FvwmIconMan: transient colorset 45

I think the man page is correct, but I see your point. I really don't
care. It was not a good idea in the first place to allow such syntax.
Hopefully the new super-windowlist module will not need multiple ids and
will use module aliases instead. FvwmIconMan supports aliases too.

I didn't document it in 2.4.x, should I? 2.4.x always had a hidden
internal Colorset command, but now this command may be used by users, in
this case it is simply translated to: SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset.

This is why I only suggested what works with 2.4.8+.

I don't know. Do you mean PlainColorset should use Colorset if not
specified? I thought this is already the case. Or that Colorset should be
forced to be transparent even if not specified (this is bad for a non
swalowed FvwmIconMan).

Hm.  I upgraded to the latest Debian testing stuff (including a new
libc) and now the problem has disappeared.

Oh well :).

I grabbed fvwm-themes CVS and ran through all the themes, but

Thanks.

Transparent (and tinted) menus are very slow, I don't use this on the
daily basis (not that I use any predictable theme on a daily basis).
Hopefully transparent menus could be somehow speeded up, or maybe it is
just my video card and my 350Mhz processor.

Anyway, here are the full instructions:

  * install the latest fvwm-themes cvs
  * load components:
      colors@redmondxp
      modules@redmondxp
      buttons@ice
      color-decors@ice
      windowlook@qnx
      startup-extra@personal (after you created it, see below)
  * load desker from the panel, set it to the left, not the default right
  * optionally enable normal icons from panel (I can't live without them)
  * optionally install the latest wm-icons cvs and execute:
      % wm-icons-config -p -f -q norm 64x64-aquafusion
      % wm-icons-config -p -f -q menu 22x22-aquafusion
      % wm-icons-config -p -f -q mini 22x22-aquafusion
      % wm-icons-config -p -f -q 16x16 16x16-aquafusion

Now create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/startup-extra that have one function:

DestroyFunc PrepareScreenshot
AddToFunc   PrepareScreenshot
#
# ---- make menus transparent/tinted, and use xft fonts ----
+ I Colorset 5 fg rgb:ff/ff/f0, bg rgb:46/74/9a, fgsh rgb:10/30/40, Transparent
+ I Colorset 6 fgsh rgb:10/30/40
+ I MenuStyle * Font 'shadow=1 r rb b:xft:Luxi Serif:Bold:size=15:minspace=true'

#

#

+ I Style FvwmPager-Desker BorderColorset 45
+ I Style FvwmPager-Desker BorderWidth 4
#
# ---- set window list colors ----
+ I Colorset 17 IconTint cyan 5
+ I Colorset 18 IconTint yellow 12, fg rgb:ff/ff/b0
+ I Colorset 19 IconTint cyan 5, IconAlpha 73, fgAlpha 70
#
# ---- set iconbox, normal icon colors, border colors
+ I Style "*" IconBox screen w 110 5 -10 -40 p, IconGrid 80 10
+ I Colorset 1 IconAlpha 80, fg white, bg rgb:4a/6a/8c
+ I Colorset 2 IconAlpha 80, fg white, bg rgb:6a/8a/ae
+ I Colorset 3 bg rgb:7c/80/84
+ I Colorset 4 bg rgb:a6/aa/ae
+ I *FvwmPager-Desker: WindowColorsets 3 4
#
# ---- set background ----
+ I Exec exec fvwm-themes-images --sky --sky-colors rgb:1a/1a/1a,rgb:21/48/80,rgb:59/77/a7,rgb:21/54/90 --setroot --pattern-type uniform:1


Now you may either run PrepareScreenshot from FvwmConsole (Alt-F12) or
temporarily add these 2 lines to this startup-extra file (but don't do
this permanently, otherwise other themes will be always overriden by these
hardcoded changes):

  AddToFunc FuncFvwmStartAllHooks I PrepareScreenshot
  AddToFunc FuncFvwmLoadAllHooks I PrepareScreenshot

Load the newly created startup-extra@personal after refreshing themes.
If you don't see what is on the screenshot, don't blame me. :)

Mikhael.

Yes, it is slow, but on my 1.2GHz Athlon system it is not
noticeable.  My configuration on this box is quite different from
that on my ancient Pentium 75 Thinkpad :).

To get "fast" Transparent menu you should use:

        Colorset 5 RootTransparent buffer, Tint black 30
                                   ^^^^^^
and use fvwm-root or Esetroot to set the root bg. This can take a lot
of memory: each "buffered" RootTransparent colorset will load a tinted
version of the root pixmap. If the transparency is not buffered the
tinted menu bg is dynamically created/destroyed, so it is "slow".
With Tinted ParentRelative Transparency we should make in addition
a screenshot of the concerned part of the root window, so this is
"very slow".

Hi, 
Im using fvwm cvs, updated Oct 11 2002. (today)

I found a bug in fvwm's WindowList, I think its been there for a while,
but I have just recently been able to reproduce it.

Start fvwm with this in your fvwm2rc:

Mouse 0 4 A Iconify
Mouse 0 I A Iconify
Mouse 3 R A WindowList
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec xterm
+ I Exec xterm
+ I Exec xterm

1) Iconify all three xterms,
2  Pass your mouse over one of the icon titles to focus it.
3) Go back to the root window and press button 3 for the WindowList

Notice The top entry in the WindowList, it gets messed up.
looks like:

Desk: 0         Geometry
-------------------------
0. sa@g: ~     (
1. sa@g: ~     (+00(4):80x24+0+346)
etc...

if you start a 4th xterm and give it focus, and then pop up the 
WindowList, the geometry is displayed correctly.

hth,
sa

It is faster, thanks. The background now appears almost immediatelly after
some hardly noticable blink (it may be more noticable on other hardware).

Still, it is not fast, you may see how item by item is drawn on the
background. This may be because of tinted menu icons with alpha channel or
xft fonts. I think it is not because of tinted menu icons or xft fonts,
but because of png icons. I don't know what can be done here at least for
non-static background, becuase the icons should be applied to the
background every time a menu is poped up... But maybe there is a way.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I cannot see such a blinking (I get some blinking with fine gradient).
Do you see the blinking when you popup the menu for the second time
(with a given cset definition)?

I can reproduce this only with some xft fonts and some shadow. Xft
is slow I do not think we can do something (maybe recent version of
Xft2 is faster).

In fact I can "reproduce" this (without xft but with IconTint and IconAlpha)
when I run my Xserver with --depth 24 (almost not visible even with
very big menu, but I can see something).
However, in depth 24 I've _no_ XAA. Can you run your server with
--depth 16?

Yes, I think this the way: do you want to have in memory all the
menus in some pixmaps? Note also that it is not possible (in general)
to draw in a Pixmap with a ParentRelative "bg".

Description:
    I have a mouse binding to Alt+Mouse to move a window. But, in
    the new CVS checked-out versions of Fvwm, it sometimes does not work
    when there are two windows and one is in the background.

    It works in a version of fvwm with the last issue in the Changelog
    dated 2002-09-06.

Repeat-By:

    * Config of .fvwm2rc is:
      --- 8< ---
      Mouse 1   W  M    Move
      --- 8< ---

    * Open a terminal window by right-clicking and choosing Xterm from
      the builtin menu. Move it around by pressing Alt and dragging the
      mouse. It works!

    * Now, open another terminal window similarly and place it such that
      the old terminal is partly visible. Try to move the old terminal
      window in the background using the Alt+Mouse shortcut. It doesn't
      work. The window just blinks. Moving the foreground window still
      works though.

Can you think of a way to include the check out date in the version
info and bug reports if someone pulled fvwm from CVS?  As far as I
can see, CVS only spits out the check in date, not the check out
date.  Let's disregard the case that someone checks out only a sub
directory and assume either "cvs update" or "cvs checkout" is run
in the top level directory.

Of course, a new CVS check out should not force you to recompile
or reconfigure everything.

Bye

This is the problem, not to rerun anything, but still to update the
version info string everywhere! :) Actually I think it is acceptable if
all files that use version info are regenerated after each non-zero
update, because we want this.

Theoretically, I see several possible solutions, all not really working.
First is to run "date +%Y-%m-%d >.cvsdate" on the server on every commit
and mark .cvsdate as non ignored, but still always-overridden-
without-conflicts file. Unfortunately, cvs does not have such concept.

Second is to use some $Date$ variables that are substituted by cvs and
then are extracted by our script, but  the problem, it should be the date
of the cvs repository, not of some certain file.

The best I can suggest is to scan CVS/Entries */CVS/Entries for ChangeLog
dates, but still there is an autoconf problem, when exactly to rerun this
code (on every make, when date of .cvsstamp is changed?).

I ran out of ideas, maybe someone else has something workable.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can't reproduce it myself, but it doesn't surprise me.  I have
rewritten the focus code recently and that probably plays a role
here.  Please describe the behaviour as precisely as you can:

 * Just to make sure:  did you actually try it with the minimal
   config you posted?

 * What exactly do you have to do to make it happen:
   - Where do you press the mouse button?  Over the interior of
     the window or on some part of the decorations (which part)?
   - Where exactly do you move the windows?

 * What is the "blinking" effect you see:
   - Is the wire frame drawn for a split second and removed
     immediately?
   - Is the lower window raised and then lowered?
   - Or is it a different effect (please describe)?

 * Do you see the move cursor?  If not, does the cursor change to
   some other icon (which)?

 * Please add any additional information that seems unusual, even
   it may seem unrelated.

Yes, on every menu popup the bg is visible for short time, try:

  Colorset 5 bg white  # or black

Just started another X, it is faster with depth 16, because gradient is
not really smooth, but not too much.

It's faster with non-xft/non-shadow, but still blinks.

Now, problems. When I returned to my X with depth 24, the tinted
background image from another X was used in menus. How is it possible?
Are atoms shared among X's?

Another problem (unrelated) is that I always got

  [FVWM][NewMenuStyle]: <<ERROR>> menu style * is in use

so I was not be able to change the font in my menus without Restart.
But I am sure I didn't have any tear-off menus.

Generally, I don't see much differences between depth 16 and 24.

Well, it is possible to store static parts, like shadow text. :)

I'm not sure if that changed in the last few days, but I remember
that Olivier said something about fixing the transparent colour
set problem in FvwmIconMan.  But now, I get transparent buttons
only if I use a transparent colour set for the whole icon manager
*and* for the buttons:

  Colorset 8 transparent
  *FvwmIconMan: Colorset 8
  *FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 8

If I use a non-transparent colour set for either "Colorset" or
"PlainColorset", the colour set background is fitted into the
buttons.  So, at the moment transparent buttons are only possible
in a swallowed FvwmIconMan.  One invoked as a top level window
can be either completely transparent, showing the root window
background, or have colour set crammed into the buttons.

I think the problem here is that the buttons are not separate
windows.  Thus, they can not use the normal colour set background
drawing function.  A transparent button should simply not draw any
background on its own.

Bye

It seems to be ok now, although I didn't test throughly yet (with 2.4.x).

Here is how to get another weird thing. Add to your .fvwm2rc the line
"Style Eterm* IconOverride" and optionally "Style Eterm* Icon xterm.xpm",
the second is not needed if you normally use iconified windows.

Then execute "Style Eterm* NoIconOverride" and start Eterm, iconify it.
You should see 48x48 icon supplied by Eterm (a monitor in a perspective).
Then do "Restart" while Eterm is iconified. You should get this 48x48
icon window (unmanaged) and the normal icon assigned to Eterm (xterm.xpm).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Full_Name: Jeremy Slade
Version: 2.5.0
CVS_Date: 
OS: RH 7.3 (2.4.18)
X_Server: XFree86-4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (12.252.72.107)


I have a number of hot-keys configured w/ Alt key (e.g. Alt-F4 to close).
Everything works great for a while in a given X login session.  But then
at
some unpredictable time, those shortcuts stop working.  Other apps that use
alt/meta (e.g. xemacs) continue to work no problem, but all the of the WM
hot-keys are ignored.  For example, xemacs gets the Alt-F4 event and
complains  
it is an unrecognized keystroke.

Restarting fvwm doesn't help, it continues to not work until I log out and
log back in.

Fixed.  When the icon changed, fvwm never unmapped the application
provided icon window.

On a side note, I found some code that I don't understand
(add_window.c, destroy_icon()):

	if (FW_W_ICON_TITLE(fw))
	{
		if (IS_PIXMAP_OURS(fw))
		{
			XFreePixmap(dpy, fw->iconPixmap);
			if (fw->icon_maskPixmap != None)
			{
				XFreePixmap(dpy, fw->icon_maskPixmap);
			}
			if (fw->icon_alphaPixmap != None)
			{
				XFreePixmap(dpy, fw->icon_alphaPixmap);
			}
		}
		XDestroyWindow(dpy, FW_W_ICON_TITLE(fw));
		XDeleteContext(dpy, FW_W_ICON_TITLE(fw), FvwmContext);
		XFlush(dpy);
	}
	if (FW_W_ICON_PIXMAP(fw) != None)
	{
		if (IS_ICON_OURS(fw))
		{
			XDestroyWindow(dpy, FW_W_ICON_PIXMAP(fw));
		}
		else
		{
			XUnmapWindow(dpy, FW_W_ICON_PIXMAP(fw));
		}
		XDeleteContext(dpy, FW_W_ICON_PIXMAP(fw), FvwmContext);
	}

Why is the pixmap freed in the "if (FW_W_ICON_TITLE(fw))"
condition?  Shouldn't it be freed in the
"if (FW_W_ICON_PIXMAP(fw) != None)" branch, or outside of both
branches?  I don't exactly understand the icon logic, but to me it
seems that fvwm leaks the icon pixmap memory if the icon has no
title.

Sigh.  From the FAQ:

--------------------------- snip ------------------------------------
0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse
     bindings stop working.  What can I do?

A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See
   Q 5.5 for more details.

Trivia: In all my years as an fvwm developer this has been by far the
   most frequently asked question.  Whoever can solve this problem so
   that this question is never asked again will be mentioned in big
   letters on the fvwm home page :-)
--------------------------- snip ------------------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.  You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings.  With XFree86 and fvwm version 2.4.0 or above, the
   right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key, Mouse or
   PointerKey commands in your configuration file and the number
   of modifiers you want to ignore.  If you do not have a
   lightning fast machine or very few bindings you should not
   ignore more than two modifiers.  So do not ignore scroll-lock
   if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server.  The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard
   map.  Pressing these keys has no effect then.  To re-add them
   try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
--------------------------- snip ------------------------------------

Bye

Some more evidence:

 * It works fine in the latest 2.4.x version.
 * The problem only occurs with iconified windows.  As long as the
   window is in normal state, the button is drawn as it should be.

I'm not sure about that. It was happening a month back, too.
(Sorry, I know I'm expected to send a bug report early, but I was
trying to be sure if it was a bug.)

Yes, I did, with exactly the same config. It still does the same
in today's CVS checked out version too.

1. I setup the config as I said.

2. I start fvwm. The builtin menu is got by right-clicking on the
   blank desktop. I select the first item, "1. XTerm".

3. I get the wire frame thing which allows me to place the window
   wherever I want to. I place it near the bottom of the screen.
   I move the window by pressing Alt and dragging the mouse
   *inside* the window. The window moves.

4. I do step 3 all over again, but, place the new terminal a
   little near the top of the screen such that the old one is
   partly visible.

5. Now, the new window can be moved by Alt + dragging inside the
   window, but, the old one can't.

I did check the "blinking" effect and it is the visual bell of
the terminal. Somehow, instead of the mouse action being
interpreted by fvwm, it's being _sent to the terminal directly_.
I set the terminal bell in xterm to an audible one and it does
beep.

No, I don't see the wire-frame nor the move cursor. The lower
window doesn't seem to be raised and lowered. Maybe it's too fast
for the eyes, but I don't think so.

>  * Please add any additional information that seems unusual, even

Ok, here's an experiment I tried. After I had the two windows,
I closed the top one and the lower one still could not me moved.
It just beeped.

Here's another minimal config which is interesting:
--- 8< ---
Mouse 1             W    M Raise
Key F2              W    M Raise
--- 8< ---

If I have two windows, the clicking on the lower window with Alt
pressed down doesn't raise the window, but, Alt+F2 raises the
window if it's focused.

So, my description of my problem is: As soon as a window goes
into the background for the first time, somehow instead of fvwm
interpreting mouse actions, it's being sent directly to the app.

Ready to give you anymore info. Mail me. If it'd be easier for
you if I were on the list, tell me. Also, if none of the Fvwm
Workers can reproduce this problem, I'll assume it's a problem on
this side. Tell me if it's so.

But, I'm pretty sure it's not a problem at this end. I even
verified this with two different versions of the X server.

That's because the code handling keystrokes works totally
differently than the code handling mouse buttons.

That probably means that fvwm doesn't ask to be informed of these
button presses.  Please apply the attached patch to your code with

  $ cd fvwm/fvwm
  $ patch < debug.patch

recompile, record the output on the console it produces and
describe what exactly you did when you got which parts of the
output.  You can also fetch the latest CVS code instead of
patching, it contains the same debug code.

Bye

Update:  With these instructions I can reproduce the problem.
Don't bother applying the patch or sending me debug output.

Okay, fixed in CVS.  Depending on your configuration you may have
to add the line

  style * FPAllowRaiseClickFunction, FPAllowFocusClickFunction

to your config file.

Yes, yes, I will fix IconMan colorset. I just lost my fvwm times
by trying, these last few days, to understand what is DirectColor.

I spent this morning making my "set the root background" work properly,
and was looking at fvwm-root. I noticed that the manual doesn't match
the code.  Appended is a patch for the manual (against current CVS)
to address this lack.  The color-limit stuff is a bit vague because I
didn't read that code in depth.

While on this topic, I'm using Esetroot instead of fvwm-root. Why? Purely
because it sets the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID pixmap property, and aterms listen
for that. I notice fvwm-root can _clear_ this property but not set
it. Is there any special reason for this? Merely that you use a different
property for this?

I was thinking of adding this facility (as an option, like -fe, since
it is otherwise a resource waste). I presume it's a bad bad idea to hand
the same pixmap to both properties, yes?

Yes. There are visual/cmap issues here when fvwm do not use the
default visual ... I should complete the doc.

I do not know. There is no mention of this in the ChangeLog's, maybe
we can found an answer in the mailing list archive.
Anyway, some root programs use _XSETROOT_ID other ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
(together with XA_XROOTPMAP_ID). For example xv free the _XSETROOT_ID
pixmap but do not set it (maybe xv has an option for this). xli free
the  _XSETROOT_ID pixmap and set it to a 1x1 black pixmap. Both
xli and xv know nothing about ESETROOT_PMAP_ID. On the other hand,
kdesktop and Nautilus use ESETROOT_PMAP_ID and know nothing about
_XSETROOT_ID.

I think we should do the following with fvwm-root (and FvwmBacker):

- In any case free the resource associated with _XSETROOT_ID and
ESETROOT_PMAP_ID (some checking is needed).
- By default, set the _XSETROOT_ID to a None pixmap. This indicate
a bg change, this is useful for apps which use ParentalRelativity to
produce transparency (as fvwm and its modules). Moreover, we do not
waste memory if the user do not use a program which use the "Esetroot"
method for transparency (at present time, by default, fvwm-root set
_XSETROOT_ID to the root pixmap id and exit in the RetainPermanent mode,
so the root pixmap is in X memory).
- Add one option -retain-pixmap. In this case use ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
(and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID) to give the root pixmap id to the world
and exit in RetainPermanent mode. So aterm will be happy as well
as fvwm and any apps which use the Esetroot method for transparency.

So I think we can remove the -fe option and add this -retain-pixmap
option. What do you think?
 
It seems that there is an informal spec. for  the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID properties. Here it is (from Owen Talyor):

  A program that wants to set the background should:

   - Create a persistant pixmap by calling to the server with:

      dpy = XOpenDisplay(display_name);
      XSetCloseDownDisplay (dpy, RetainPixmap);
      pmap = XCreatePixmap (dpy, DefaultRootWindow (dpy), width, height,
                            DefaultDepthOfScreen (DefaultScreenOfDisplay (dpy)));
      XCloseDisplay (dpy)
   - Grab the server
   - See if ESETROOT_PMAP_ID is set
   - If so, call XKillClient(xdisplay, *(Pixmap*)data_esetroot)
   - Change ESETROOT_PMAP_ID and _XROOTPMAP_ID to point to the
     new pixmap
   - Set the pixmap as the background for the root window
   - Ungrab the server


I add that XA_XROOTPMAP_ID is for permanent program (as FvwmBacker,
do not know why FvwmBacker do not use it :o/). It should be never
killed.

Patch welcome for fvwm-root. I will modify FvwmBacker.

> I was thinking of adding this facility (as an option, like -fe, since

Yes, as good program (as fvwm :o) will monitor both _XSETROOT_ID
and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID. So, if you set both properties such apps will
see 2 bg changes.

Great! Works wonders. Thanks. This is why I love open source ...

Also, one more thing before I go, a line like the one below
still conflicts with mouse action even after this patch:

Mouse 1  R    N

This might be needed if you use the stroke library. But, it's not
a big problem. I removed it and everything works fine. I don't
think you should worry about it.

Thanks very much,
Arvind

Cool idea, I like that.  That would definitely be a wirthwhile
addition to the distribution.  I've got to try it out myself.
Does it work with 2.5.x?

The more I think about it, the more I like the idea.  There are
infinite ways to develop it further.  For example, it would make
an excellent Alt-Tab replacement:

 * Make the triggered actions and the keys configurable.
 * Add keyboard support.
 * Add remote control functionality ("show proxies",
   "select proxy", "hide proxies")

For example, when pressing Alt-Tab the first time, fvwm would send
a "show proxies" message to the module.  Pressing Tab repeatedly
would cycle through the windows with any built-in command, e.g.
"Next", optionally selecting each window would trigger an action.
Then, after releasing the Alt key, fvwm would send a
"hide proxies" message and probably trigger another action.

Bye

After this commit the following my bindings do not work inside a window:

  Silent Mouse 6 A A ThisWindow Raise
  Silent Mouse 7 A A ThisWindow FourStateMachine RaiseLower
  Silent Mouse 8 A A ThisWindow MaximizeFullScreen
  Silent Mouse 8 WTFS S ThisWindow Move
  Silent Mouse 8 R S Menu MenuFvwmRoot

I would like my thumb button (8) and the second wheel (6, 7) to work as
they did before this commit. Note, no complex functions here, just press.

To emulate this hardware, you may execute: xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 6 8"

Regards,
Mikhael.

Here a patch that allows compilation on my machine with 2.5.4 from
cvs. It get pbs with desk switching, I do not know if my fix is
really ok.

I think some works is needed. I may help with the new 2.5.x font
and image rendering API.

Thanks.

Anyone with any comments of the "set the Esetroot X11 property" option?
Should I bother?

But I've answer this question and more (To: you and the fvwm-workers
list). Maybe this mail never arrive (can one see this mail in the
workers list?).

Anyway, here it is again:

Yes. There are visual/cmap issues here when fvwm do not use the
default visual ... I should complete the doc.

I do not know. There is no mention of this in the ChangeLog's, maybe
we can found an answer in the mailing list archive.
Anyway, some root programs use _XSETROOT_ID other ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
(together with XA_XROOTPMAP_ID). For example xv free the _XSETROOT_ID
pixmap but do not set it (maybe xv has an option for this). xli free
the  _XSETROOT_ID pixmap and set it to a 1x1 black pixmap. Both
xli and xv know nothing about ESETROOT_PMAP_ID. On the other hand,
kdesktop and Nautilus use ESETROOT_PMAP_ID and know nothing about
_XSETROOT_ID.

I think we should do the following with fvwm-root (and FvwmBacker):

- In any case free the resource associated with _XSETROOT_ID and
ESETROOT_PMAP_ID (some checking is needed).
- By default, set the _XSETROOT_ID to a None pixmap. This indicate
a bg change, this is useful for apps which use ParentalRelativity to
produce transparency (as fvwm and its modules). Moreover, we do not
waste memory if the user do not use a program which use the "Esetroot"
method for transparency (at present time, by default, fvwm-root set
_XSETROOT_ID to the root pixmap id and exit in the RetainPermanent mode,
so the root pixmap is in X memory).
- Add one option -retain-pixmap. In this case use ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
(and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID) to give the root pixmap id to the world
and exit in RetainPermanent mode. So aterm will be happy as well
as fvwm and any apps which use the Esetroot method for transparency.

So I think we can remove the -fe option and add this -retain-pixmap
option. What do you think?

It seems that there is an informal spec. for  the ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID properties. Here it is (from Owen Talyor):

  A program that wants to set the background should:

   - Create a persistant pixmap by calling to the server with:

      dpy = XOpenDisplay(display_name);
      XSetCloseDownDisplay (dpy, RetainPixmap);
      pmap = XCreatePixmap (dpy, DefaultRootWindow (dpy), width, height,
                            DefaultDepthOfScreen (DefaultScreenOfDisplay (dpy)));
      XCloseDisplay (dpy)
   - Grab the server
   - See if ESETROOT_PMAP_ID is set
   - If so, call XKillClient(xdisplay, *(Pixmap*)data_esetroot)
   - Change ESETROOT_PMAP_ID and _XROOTPMAP_ID to point to the
     new pixmap
   - Set the pixmap as the background for the root window
   - Ungrab the server


I add that XA_XROOTPMAP_ID is for permanent program (as FvwmBacker,
do not know why FvwmBacker do not use it :o/). It should be never
killed.

Patch welcome for fvwm-root. I will modify FvwmBacker.

> I was thinking of adding this facility (as an option, like -fe, since
> it is otherwise a resource waste). I presume it's a bad bad idea to hand

Yes, as good program (as fvwm :o) will monitor both _XSETROOT_ID
and XA_XROOTPMAP_ID. So, if you set both properties such apps will
see 2 bg changes.

That worked without modifying defaults.h?  Let me think...

There are two different problems here.  As you said, with certain
styles set, transients are raised twice when they are created.
The second time should have no visual effect at all, though.
Please post all your "Style" commands so I can see if something is
wrong in the new transient handling.  I am aware that under some
obscure (well, not obscure to me) situation, transients are
lowered and then immediately raised.  But that should only play a
role if you have at least one transient and a transient of that
transient.

The second problem is that new windows are always drawn unfocused
at first, even if they have the GrabFocus or GrabFocusTransient
style.  I have committed a patch to remove this effect (except for
sticky windows).

OK, I'll get tomorrow's snapshot to see if there were any effects on
my current issue.

Another thing to note, why is it that transients are always above
other windows beyond their initial bring-up state.  In other words,
I have this "Open Page" Window which when comes up flickers :-) and
then gets focus and I can type into it no matter where my cursor
was -- which is cool.  But assume I want to paste-in something that
was on its parent window, if I move the mouse (and I use MouseFocus)
to purposely lose the focus on the transient, the transient resists
being lowered.  If I force a "lower yourself" command on it, the
parent gets lowered as well - is this intended behavior ?  Does anyone
else see it a bit too forceful and harsh ? I would have thought that
the 'GrabFocusTransient' just grabs the focus and raises itself
upon bring-up.  Ideally, the transient should be at least "forcible"
to be lowered if one opted to do it via a 'lower' command, no ?

Last suggestion :-)  it would really be cool to have an automatic
mechanism to get all the necessary data that you as developers need
to see to report a bug (or an oddity).  Something akin to emacs'
"report-emacs-bug" or emacs VM's "vm-submit-bug-report" which pretty
much dumps the configuration options, and various internal important
state values/settings.  A builtin command (or an external script via
perl or something) could be invoked via a menu entry which would result
in a window (similar to FvwmIdent's output) which one can cut-n-paste.
Map that "fvwm-report-bug" in the source (like Alt-Tab is done today)
to say Alt-F12 and its available to all fvwm users.

Thanks (please CC replies)

If you search for "Transient" in the man page you may find some insights.
The default is:

  Style * RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, StackTransientParent

I use:

  Style * DontRaiseTransient, DontLowerTransient, DontStackTransientParent

We already have fvwm-bug (should be in your $PATH).

Copying from FvwmIdent would be nice, but it does not contain much more
information than xwininfo -all (that may be copied).

FvwmCommand(1) provide more like an information you speak about, but it is
inconvenient to use and I will remove this functionality sometimes anyway
as Dominik requested. I will think about something more convenient for
dumping style and other information about a window, but this will be of
limited use and really not something to be added to fvwm-bug by default.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Full_Name: Michael
Version: 2.5.3, 2.5.2, 2.5.4
CVS_Date: yesterday's checkout (oct 16th)
OS: linux 2.4.19 (who cares)
X_Server: XFree86 4.2.0
Submission from: (NULL) (212.16.29.239)


Basically, if you open, say, xterm and issue

FvwmCommand "AddToDecor oops"
FvwmCommand "Current ChangeDecor oops"

(sure, you can do the same in FvwmConsole)

the highlight will go off of your window. I believe there was no such
problem with 2.5.0, but since I have neither sources nor binaries here and
somewhat reluctant do download again over relatively slow line,  I can't
tell for sure.

I've tried to dig the source, but since it was my first peek into the
sources of fvwm (never gave me any trouble before -- excellent WM! Thanks)
I haven't got very far ;-)

And with current snapshots (and probably the only valid syntax in
3.0):

  Style * !RaiseTransient, !LowerTransient, !StackTransientParent

I can reproduce the problem now.  Raising a transient that is
already on top raises its parent first and then the transient.  I
will take care of this later.

I'm porting an application from gtk+-1.2 to gtk+-2.0 and saw that when a
window has to be centered with gtk_window_set_position, actually the window
is placed somewhere else. it used to work in gtk+-1.2. there is no such a
problem in many others window managers (i.e. icewm).

I think after this commit RootTransparent in menus does not work,
i.e. there is a solid background. Transparent works.
I use fvwm-root to set a background, so this is not a problem.

Mikhael.

This is normal, fvwm-root will have an option -retain-pixmap
which allows RootTransparent to work (future patch by Cameron
Simpson I hope). At present time you should use Esetroot or
FvwmBaker with *FvwmBaker: RetainPixmap. It is absurd that
fvwm-root retain the pixmap by default (memory wasting), so
fvwm-root just signal that it change the root bg by setting
the _XSETROOT_ID property to None (so that the memory safe
ParentalRelativity method works). For root transparency
the  _XROOTPMAP_ID and ESETROOT_ID properties should be used.
This is coherent. The ParentalRelativity method use _XSETROOT_ID
and the "E" method use _XROOTPMAP_ID and is off by default
for memory reason.

Hello,

I have one desk. I also have 4 pages in my pager.
If I have the terminology right. Built and updated from cvs
today.

As is, colorset 9 works great: inactive pages' backgrouns are red.
Active page backgrounds are blueish (gradients).

However, if I change my Colorset 9 to the following:

   Colorset 9 fg white, bg red, NoShape, Transparent

(notice the "transparent") things start out nicely: my
current page is blue-ish/gradient, and my inactive pages are
transparent.

However, when I change pages, and the previous page goes
inactive, its background still stays blueish. If I move
through all desks, all my desks will have blueish
backgrounds until i restart fvwm.

Did I do something wrong, or are things misbehaving a
little?

Relevant lines included below.

Add:

  Style FvwmPager ParentalRelativity

I think we will receive a lot of such questions in the future...
Because for some reason, people like transparency.

If we would only have individual window styles, a module could send a
request for fvwm to make the window that is going to be transparent to
be ParentalRelativity.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Great, thanks. Works as expected.
I think if something (I am not sure what at the moment)
could be added to the manpage (maybe around the
"parentalRelativity" section, it'd help alot. 

Reading the manpage

          ParentalRelativity enables clients that use a
          background pixmap  of  type  ParentRelative to
          achieve transparency.  Fvwm modules that support
          transparent  colorsets  require this  setting.
          Opacity is the default and should be used for all
          non-transparent clients for better performance.

I still dont understand what parental relativity is :(
Anyway, things work well here, so I dont really need to know
what it is, just think maybe it'll save some questions to
you guys ... 

thanks very much for quick response.

Full_Name: Chris Siebenmann
Version: 2.4.12
CVS_Date: 
OS: Red Hat Linux 7.3
X_Server: XFree86 4.2.1
Submission from: (NULL) (128.100.102.51)


 If I iconify a window (in a style where the icon winds up on the root
window, not swallowed into an FvwmIconManager or the like), the icon is
more or less stuck below all non-icon windows regardless of attempts to
manipulate the stacking order. Everything appears to be on the default
layer (layer 4 in my case), according to FvwmIdentify.

 If I perform operations that cause fvwm to refresh the icon, such
as flipping to another virtual screen and then back or moving a
window (with OpaqueMove) such that the icon is partly exposed, the
icon will temporarily pop into visibility in its proper stacking
order. If I raise and then relower an obscuring window, poof the
icon disappears again.

 This bug is not entirely consistent; there are some icons that it
doesn't happen to. I can't see a discernable pattern in what they
are, unfortunately.

 I do not use an IconBox ('Style * IconBox none').
 I can't think of any other relevant styles or elements of my
FVWM configuration. (If I am wrong about this, please let me know
and I will be happy to fill in any necessary details.)

 I was previously running FVWM 2.4.3, which did not behave like this.

 I am willing to test patches. (Eager, in fact, as I'm finding this
glitch to be quite annoying; I may have to revert to fvwm 2.4.3
temporarily.)

Fixed.  It was a problem in the code unbinding old bindings.  The
bug wasn't new, but was brought to the surface more often now.

For a start, detailed instructions to reproduce this would be
helpful.  Please try to describe it step by step and attach an
fvwm configuration that shose the problem.

Well, this line works for me just like before the latest change.
And it it ok, please don't change this.

The real fix for colorsets is to implement the fully functional
ActiveColorset as I wrote below.

In the future I would remove both HilightBack and ActiveFore as well as
MenuFace. They are all pretty redudant.

I don't have a problem to add such option everywhere and will do this.
But it is not absurd for Esetroot to retain a pixmap by default.

Anyway, I think either the previous functionality should be restored or
this new option be added before the 2.5.4 release. Cameron, do you want to
provide a patch?

Mikhael.

No, you want

  MenuStyle * HilightBackOff, ActiveForeOff, ActiveColorset <n>

I see no reason at all why ActiveFore should only work with
HilightBack.

Agreed with ActiveFore and HilightBack (with coour arguments), but
I won't remove everything in favour of colour sets.  Don't forget
that colour sets can eat up a lot of memory or be very slow.

I think it absurd in the sense that if no apps use E-transparent
background are used then you waste memory (e.g., 2.5 Mb with a 2 heads
1280x1024 system). Moreover, I know no program which use _XSETROOT_ID
which retains the pixmap. So, I think it is good idea to use
_XSETROOT_ID to just retain a None pixmap to warn pgs that
the bg change and use _XROOTPMAP_ID for retaining the pixmap.

I do not want to restore the old functionnality. I can do the patch
to fvwl-root if Cameron does not have the time soon.

 I did some more digging on my problem of Lower not lowering windows
below iconified windows.
 It first appears in fvwm 2.4.10; it is not present in 2.4.9.

 Reproduction steps with the fvwm2rc at the end of this message:
- start your favorite Xnest environment (or a real X server) and
  fvwm as 'fvwm2 -f fvwm2rc-test'.
  The fvwm2rc uses button 3 on the root window to pop up a menu
  of operations and uses manual placement of windows.
- pop up the root menu; pick XTerm; place the resulting window
  somewhere.
- pop the root menu up, pick Iconify, button-1 the xterm window
  to iconify it.
- pop the root menu up, pick XTerm, place the resulting xterm
  window so that it completely obscures the iconified XTerm.
- pop the root menu up, pick Bottom, chose the (new) XTerm window.
  On fvwm 2.4.9 and below the iconified XTerm icon appears on top
  of the uniconified xterm. On 2.4.10 and later, nothing happens.
- on 2.4.10+, then pop the menu up, pick Move, pick the XTerm window.
  Move the window slowly so as to reveal the iconified XTerm.
  When a tiny bit of the icon appears, it will suddenly jump
  into full appearance over the window you are moving (as it should
  be).

[I believe xlogo32 should be universally available; if not, substitute
 the default icon of your choice.]

Both of these lines has the same effect, because HilightBackOff turns
active background and foreground off completely.

But I see that ActiveForeOff/ActiveFore does work with HilightBack,
i.e. makes ActiveColorset fg be ignored or not.

Now, about the whole idea of ignoring one or another colorset component.
This may be useful, but such functionality is only a small part of a
bigger functionality: take the original main colorset colors and do
some transformation on them (for example tint) and not just leave as is.

Such functionality is useful everywhere, think FvwmIconMan or FvwmButtons
where there is one parent colorset and another one that may or may not
reuse the parent colorset. This is why I would not achieve such
functionality using menu booleans, but move it to colorsets.

I see 2 possible solutions. One, statical, is available now.
I use here symbolic names for colorset instead of numbers for clarity.

  MenuStyle * MenuColorset MENU. ActiveColorset MENU2

  Colorset MENU fg yellow, bg navy, Pixmap navy_sky.xpm
  Colorset MENU2 fg $[fg.csMENU], bg $[bg.csMENU], Plain

or:

  Colorset MENU2 fg cyan, Transparent

Another solution is dynamical, like:

  Colorset MENU fg yellow, bg navy, Pixmap navy_sky.xpm
  Colorset MENU2 fg parent, bg parent, Plain

where "parent" is handled specially just like the current "contrast" and
"average" are. This only valid in the 2-colorset context, where the parent
colorset is defined.

I don't think there is a big difference in memory or speed if no fancy
features are used. But we can only guess without benchmarks.

Just for information.

4 months ago I send a patch to the X experts which fixes some memory
leaks (and slow font loading) in the Xlib i18n code.  After 3 requests
to apply this patch (the last one a few days ago) the patch has been
applied to the X cvs tree.

I don't understand some of the bit field sized of some members of
the colorset_struct.  Specifically:

  unsigned int fg_alpha : 7;
  unsigned int icon_alpha : 12;

What are these?  Are they pixel values?  Then they have to use the
"Pixel" type.  In any case, 7 or 12 bits seem very wrong to me.
In any case, the names are not descriptive enough.

  unsigned int tint_percent : 12;
  unsigned int icon_tint_percent : 12;

Percentages with 12 bit resolution?  I'd guess we nee 7 bits here.

Bye

That is all an attempt to keep the old menu style logic.  In my
eyes it makes no sense to artificially limit the possibilities of
what gets drawn in which colour.

There is one flaw in this reasoning:  there is no parent colorset
here.  Menu items are not buttons in a large button (the menu)
that could shine through or not.  Menu items are solely a
foreground over a constant background.

And there is another problem with colour sets.  You can not say
"ignore this part from my colour set and use it from that other
colour set instead".  That is what we need here.  The idea of
colour sets is to provide the colours and leave it to the caller
which (s)he wants to use.

Then you would see the background of the root window on the menu.

I don't like that idea at all.  Colour sets must not know anything
of each other.  When transformations have to be done, a higher
instance has to do them.  We should take care not to overload
colour sets with unrelated functionality.

We have done benchmarks with the [BDHV]Gradient menu faces and it
makes a big difference.  For example, when I fire up my directory
menu script on the /dev directory, it takes up 4.5 screens at
1152x870x32 = 18 MB for the colour set backgrounds while the menu
built-in gradient implementation uses only a few bytes.

I don't see any logical difference between FvwmIconMan and menus.
Whatever functionality you have in one regarding the active item, you want
in another.

Colorsets hold color information. There is nothing wrong for this
information to be "use parent's colors or any defaults if there is no
parent".

This depends on how ActiveColorset is implemented, currently it is not
really used except for storing 2 values fg and bg.

I would like the active menu item to have the parent colorset that is the
whole menu surface. This way there is a lot of flexibility without any
additional flags. Of course if this is proven to have a bad performance,
this is another story. But logically I want menus not to be different from
FvwmIconMan or FvwmButtons.

Yes, but there may be library functions that merge 2 colorsets. And even
create new colorsets on the fly if needed.

Do you suggest, instead, to have a lot of flags (similarly to what
ActiveFore and HilightBack do) and the same code in different places?

Gradients in colorsets are not currently optimized, but this does not mean
they can't be made as effective. I don't suggest to remove MenuFace before
this happens.

 An additional two notes:

 I localized the problem to fvwm 2.4.10's fvwm/stack.c changes; the 2.4.9
stack.c (hacked to change '->pstack' to '->stack.p') doesn't exhibit the
problem when compiled into 2.4.10.

 The problem appears to go away if I force the do_lower parameter to
fvwm/stack.c's restack_windows() to be zero. I suspect that this is
not the actual answer, but I lack the understanding of fvwm's internals
to understand what I just broke. (Everything seems to work fine for me,
but I don't use multiple layers.)

Yes we should do:

	/icon_alpha/icon_alpha_percent/
and use 7 bits for all the *percent members

Yes, I know.  I do know when these problems appeared, just not why
they appeared :-)

Don't worry, nobody understands that heap of dung.  That is a
questiong of bad design, not of fvwm internals knowledge.

I reviewed the stacking code yesterday, and it is rife with bugs.
For the moment I do not need any additional input on the problem
because when you give it is probably already outdated.  I will
report back when I think I got all of the problems.

Fvwm has 2 Style options that affect application controlled
window placement:

              NoPPosition  instructs  fvwm  to  ignore the
              program specified position (PPosition  hint)
              when adding new windows.  Using PPosition is
              required for some applications, but  if  you
              don't have one of those its a real headache.
              Many programs  set  PPosition  to  something
              obnoxious like 0,0 (upper left corner).

              NoUSPosition   works  like  NoPPosition  but
              applies suppresses using the user  specified
              position  indicated  by the program (USPosi=AD
              tion hint).  It is generally a bad thing  to
              override  the user's choice, but some appli=AD
              cations misuse the USPosition hint to  force
              their  windows  to  a  certain  spot  on the
              screen without the user's consent.

If the window in question is a transient, there's another
option you can find in the man page.

Could you investigate how these options affect your problem
and get back to us?

Thanks,

I confirm the fix (with snap-20021022) -- one last thing on a related
topic.  The following was noted earlier in the thread that is still
annoying,

	Another thing to note, why is it that transients are
	always above other windows beyond their initial bring-up
	state.  In other words, I have this "Open Page" Window
	which when comes up flickers :-) and then gets focus and
	I can type into it no matter where my cursor was -- which
	is cool.  But assume I want to paste-in something that was
	on its parent window, if I move the mouse (and I use MouseFocus)
	to purposely lose the focus on the transient, the transient
	resists being lowered.  If I force a "lower yourself" command
	on it, the parent gets lowered as well - is this intended
	behavior ?  Does anyone else see it a bit too forceful and
	harsh ? I would have thought that the 'GrabFocusTransient'
	just grabs the focus and raises itself upon bring-up.
	Ideally, the transient should be at least "forcible" to be
	lowered if one opted to do it via a 'lower' command, no ?

And the reply was to use,

  Style * !RaiseTransient, !LowerTransient, !StackTransientParent

which indeed does work, but not as expected (well not kinda).  Here's
what I think most users would expect.  Assume I have a parent window-A
which  overlaps another parent window-B.  If in window-A I bring-up a
transient window and then raise window-A (ie. in essence raise it
above the transient) all looks fine.  Assume then that I move the mouse
to window-B (having MouseFocus), window-B gets focus -- all great so
far.  Now if I go back to window-A, the transient should come-up instead
of the parent, no ?  In other words, I should be able to lower the
transient as long as the focus is on the parent, but if the parent
losses focus, then the transient should raise itself above that parent.
Let me rephrase (again, just in case), the transient should always be
on top (raised) unless I specifically lower it (or specifically raise
its parent), and the transient should stay lowered as long as its
parent has focus, once that focus is lost from the parent the transient
should again regain its "raised" status.

I tried the various permutations of the misc. 'Raise' and 'Transient'
commands and couldn't get it to do what's described.  Is it possible ?

Much thanks all for a great window manager and keep up the
wonderful work.

Well, that would confuse and annoy me immensely :-)  I'm quite
sure you wouldn't be happy with the automatic raising either.  If
you can cope without the automatism,

  Style RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, !StackTransientParent

should come close enough.  When you raise the parent, the
transient will come back up.

Jason,

could you modify the script that mails the CVS commit messages to
include the branch name in the subject?  For example

  CVS 2.4 domivogt: * Updated ANNOUNCE.

instead of

  CVS domivogt: * Updated ANNOUNCE.

(the branches are named branch-x_y).

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I made one tweak; let's see how it works.  I'll probably need to work
on it after I see a couple of messages go by.

I think I got all the bugs.  The stacking code is always a rich
source of bugs.  Within 24 hours I found no less than six, some
introduced in 2.4.10 or later and some just hidden by fortunate
circumstances or uncontrolled side effects in earlier versions.
Expect the 2.4.13 release within a week.  It would be nice if you
could download the latest code from the 2.4 branch in cvs and
double check wether all problems are gone:

  $  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r branch-2_4 -d fvwm-2.4 fvwm

(this checks out the 2.4 branch into a directory fvwm-2.4).

Bye

Ok, I got "Next" working using:
	Key Tab     A   M   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Next

I can get a "Show" on the Alt press using:
	Key Alt_L   A   N   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Show

But, I've yet to figure out how to config for the Alt release.
There's that windowlist menustyle of SelectOnRelease,
but I'm not sure that can apply.

For now, I still stuck with Alt polling for the release.

Uh, I didn't want to suggest that you have to do all the things I
listed yourself.  

Would you like to add your module to the fvwm source tree?  Of
course you would have full access to the sources.  You might want
to consider:

 + Reduces future maintenance work.
 + We would automatically add some nifty features like colorset
   support, i18n support etc.
 + More people can help you implementing some nifty stuff.
 + It would be maintained in the future, even if you ever lose
   interest in continuing the work.
 + It will automatically be adapted to all module interface
   changes.
 + Your module would be distributed with each and every copy of
   fvwm.

 - It would only be added to the 2.5.x development branch.
 - You would have to respect code and feature freezes when fvwm is
   getting close to the next stable release.
 - We would appreciate if the module was formatted with the new
   indentation style used in the core, but this is not a must.
   (indentation with tabs = 8 spaces).
 - It must use the Gnu Public License.

It's your decision, but I hope you can tolerate the drawbacks for
the benefits.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I propose adding offset functionallity to the vector drawing instruction.
I have looked at the sourcecode. I think the files borders.c (X drawing
commands), builtins.c (parsing the vector instructions) and screen.h
(definition of struct vector_coords in DecorFace struct).
Is anyone working on these files at the moment?
I was thinking about giving this a try.

Hello,

when I start my pager, my page backgrounds are all black,
when I really want them to be transparent.

however, it takes either switching pages, or even
ctrl-alt-f1 (switch to console) and back and the backgrounds
turn back into transparent ones.

Hello,

   fvwm 2.5.4 (from cvs) compiled on Oct 20 2002 at 00:42:44

I recall seeing someone state that there was a way to set
sizes of xpm icons in windowlist in 2.5.x versions.

Sorry, I can't seem to find the reference to this in the
archives , or in the manpages (presumably because I dont
quite know what I am looking for)

thanks,

denis

for example:
Style * IconSize 87 65

However, this doesn't resize the xpm:s. It pads the icons (for smaller
icons, more surrounding transparency) and crops (for bigger icons)

(Maybe I missed something though...)

Can you be more specific? Do you mean switching sizes of mini application
icons used in WindowList (say, from 16x16 to 20x20) without redefining
new MiniIcon for all apps? If so, there is no such functionality except
for using wm-icons.

If you mean to control a vertical and horizontal space used in WindowList
items, this may be done using MenuStyle in 2.4.x+.

With wm-icons you may execute something like:

  wm-icons-config -p -f mini 16x16-gnome
  wm-icons-config -p -f mini 16x16-kde
  wm-icons-config -p -f mini 21x18-3dpixmaps
  wm-icons-config -p -f mini 22x22-aquafusion  # this requires cvs

Similarly you may change the icon set used for "norm" and "menu" icons.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hm, what would thins be good for?  You can already get an offset
relative to the button size by adding a few points to all
percentages.  Isn't that good enough?

Yes.

You do not need to care if people are working on specific files
unless they stated so.  Concurrent work results in merging
conflicts extremely rarely, even when working on the same .c file.

I guess I was asking whether it was possible to scale icons
shown in the windowlist. For example, if I say that a
MiniIcon is myicon.xpm, but it happens to be 40x40, I wanted
to specify a maximum height, so that all images shown in
windowList were, say, 32 x 32. However, it seems that I will
be happy with wm-icons. I was not aware of their existence
before. My problem was that my xpms were not really all that
uniform :-)

thanks,

denis

I guess what would constitutes annoying is debatable :-)  What you note
doesn't allow me to lower a transient below its parent and as such its
not really what I was after.  In short, I take it what I'm asking for
is simply not doable, right ?

Thanks

Internally the script keeps track of a branch and I changed it to
include that in the script, but it doesn't look like what it calls a
branch has anything to do with what you're calling a branch.  Either
that, or CVS has changed its output at some point.

The current scripts are pretty nasty; they were even nasty before I
started messing with them; I'm looking into other scripts that do the
same kind of thing as a fresh base for hacking.

There are some days when I barely get through my main inbox, much less
all of the other mail I get, so it's probably best to give me a CC if
it's even mildly important.

It is very much my intent to add this module to the primary source tree.
However,  I want to get it in my core features and give it some
reasonable cleanup and testing before letting it loose.

The terms are perfectly acceptable.  You might want to talk to some of the
other people about 2-space indentation.  I am willing to switch my tab
formatting from 4 to 8, but I'm not necessarily willing to be happy about it.

Is this problem new? In a message of the 20 october you say
that your transparent pager works as expected (after you add
the ParentalRelativity Style).

But it's not possible to get an absolute offset in pixels independent of
the button size, unless you write a script that calculates that from the
button size. And that would involve parsing the font size and so on.

For example, you may want "shadow" effects for soem lines or a button
relief that is a fixed number of pixels from the button's border.

David,

You posted a patch in Juny adding SortClassName option to WindowList.
I added a new option (should be in cvs soon) SortByResource that is a
powerful version of SortClassName, i.e. it takes first resource class and
then resource name (and not just the first). Then as usual it takes the
window or icon name if the resource is the same. The question is this.

Should I remove SortClassName option since we now have SortByResource?
Or you wish to have SortClassName as it is now?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I haven't noticed the problem at that time, but that does
not mean much. I might've been so happy to get a transparent
pager that I did not pay enough attention.

I am attaching a small .fvwm2rc with which I can
reproduce this problem.

Note, that the problem goes away if I restart fvwm. It only
appears to be there when fvwm2 starts for the first time.

 In testing so far, a CVS version from branch-2_4 pulled on Tuesday
night or so seems to be working fine. (Sorry for the delay in reply,
but I wanted to give it some time to make sure.) Certainly the stacking
issue I saw is gone and I haven't observed any other ones.

Actually, both of these seem more like bugs, than warnings.
Anyway, to be totally sure, in style.c I changed:

        if (FMiniIconsSupported && ret_style->change_mask.has_mini_icon ||
            S_DO_EWMH_MINI_ICON_OVERRIDE(SCC(*ret_style)))

to a not equivalent:

        if (FMiniIconsSupported && (ret_style->change_mask.has_mini_icon ||
            S_DO_EWMH_MINI_ICON_OVERRIDE(SCC(*ret_style))))

Regards,
Mikhael.

In my eyes, releases during the development phase are solely a
matter of convenience for the users and developers.  More people
download, install and test a tarball than a snapshot or cvs.

During the 2.4 development phase, I tried to make a release once a
month, just to have a fairly recent release.  THe only reason was
to not get bug reports for a release that is already 3 months old.

I wrote an answer, but I removed it, because I just discovered stack bugs
that should be fixed before 2.5.4 (or at least you decide whether they
should be fixed).

I have no problems if you release 2.5.x every month.
I just need some good release from time to time to base on it,
so I may sometimes ask to slow down for some days.

I would say, after the recent stack fixes are fixed.

And after someone adds a --retain option to fvwm-root.
Cameron, Olivier or maybe me (I have no idea yet, but I can try cvs diff).

Mikhael.

I don't think it is a new probelem. It was reported (and confirmed by me)
on the xvirtualroot thread on another mailing list.

It seems that FvwmPager when draws a window, that is on a layer below
of other windows, initially draws such window *above* all windows.

Mikhael.

This is the last days problem. At least I don't remember seeing anything
wrong on 2002-09-22 (from fvwm-themes ChangeLog).

Start fvwm without config, open 3 xterms and one FvwmConsole from the
menu. Place them somehow, so they cover 2 others, no matter how.
Execute:

  Layer +1

on any window. Stacking list goes crazy when you lower/raise windows.
Open new xterm. All windows end up in pretty random layering possitions
relatively to each other. FvwmPager shows them correctly.

Mikhael.

Looks like FvwmPager completely ignores the initial stacking
information for the new window.  The same happens for
"StartsLowered" and I wouldn't be surprised if it treated all
layers the same.  I saw that in the past repeatedly, but could
never pin it down.

I don't see where SortClassName would be better than SortBuResource, but
let's have 2 if you need this. I just think, the first should be renamed
to SortByClass.

Hmm, is not it me who asked you to take a look at the others (below)
when you replied "ok, maybe"? :) We still need a maintainer.

I think I fixed this, it should be in the next snapshot.

It seems that all snapshots since 2002/09/13 have this problem.
I have no idea how noone reported this. Probably everyone uses cvs?

I think we should add a "make; make install prefix=./tmp-root" test on the
resulting snapshot before releasing a snapshot.

I also don't see in the snapshots a patch we spoke about a month ago that
replaces VERSIONINFO in configure.in with " (snap-20021026)".
Jason, can you please add this patch? I may resend the exact perl command.

Please also think again about the idea of running utils/create_snap.sh,
so we may edit it as needed without asking you to change anything.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Um, yes, but that's just because I forgot to add a style name.
Try this:

  Style * RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, !StackTransientParent

I understand, but I think it wouldn't hurt to include it earlier.
It is easy to just include it in the tarbell and make it build
the executable without installing anything.  Just say a word and
I will add the necessary logic.

We have switched to 8 spaces per tab only recently.  The 2 space
indentation will go away gradually in the libs/ and fvwm/
directories.  It's all not critical in the modules, though.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I made a patch to implement the vector offset additions I suggested a
while ago on the FVWM-list.

I followed the instructions on the web for CVS, I hope I did everything
correct.

With this you can do for example:

ButtonStyle 2 5 0+3x0+3@2 100-5x0+3@2 100-5x100-5@2 0+3x100-5@2 0+3x0+3@2

to get a button that is aligned with an absolute number of pixels from the
border.
With this it's also possible to get lines of double witdh by using offset
of 1 pixel.

I'll explain what happens for me, maybe you may identify the new problem.

My main X has about 30 windows now on 4 desks and I can't kill it for now.
When I do restart, the stacking order is broken even if all my windows are
on Layer 4. Either Raise or Lower or both do not work on all windows, so
RaiseLower issued for more than once does nothing.

I started another X (also with fvwm-themes) and I can't reproce any
problem.

But when I restart on the main X with many windows, it is pretty broken.
So I tried instead of one of these (that are equivalent):

  Restart
  Restart --dont-preserve-state
  Restart fvwm-themes-start

to divide such full Restart into 3 parts:

  Restart /full/path/to/be/sure/fvwm -f no-rc
  Read themes-rc
  StartFunction

After doing the first command Raise/Lower on these 30 windows works fine.
The second is fine too. The problems start after the third.

I managed to narrow this down to a single command. You will not believe
it, the command is "Style * NoIcon". If I issue it on the second X, fvwm
enters to this horrible state too, when Raise/Lower do not work on all
windows. (When I tried to reproduce this again on new X it did not work).

I should leave for today, if you have enough information to fix it, fine.
If no, I will try tommorow to find a minimal config. It is not very easy,
some unknown condition is needed to reproduce it. "Style * NoIcon" does
not triggers it without this condition.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Actually, it turned out easier to reproduce than I thought.

Start fvwm without config.
Open several windows (use 4 FvwmConsole and one xterm for example).
Issue:

  Style XTerm /some/valid.xpm

Iconify several (xterm and FvwmConsole) windows.
Now:

  Style * NoIcon

Try to Raise/Lower the remaining 3 windows. Either Raise or Lower
or both do not work on all windows. (Either double click the title or
issue Raise/Lower from FvwmConsole).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Fixed.  The stacking code has just too many side effects.  At
least it's much easier to debug nowadays.  By the way, do you feel
like writing a test script for the stacking code?  Something that
issues stacking commands and verifies the results after each step,
similar to what the verify_stack_ring() function does?

Is it possible that a different executable is started initially
than upon a restart?  Is $PATH the same on the console and within
a running fvwm?

The path is the same, yes. However, I just went to try it
again, and I dont see the problem anymore. Sorry for wasting
your time. If I can track it down to the point where it is
reproducible every time again, I'll let you guys know.

thanks,

Ok. Now please fix one more problem, but try not to break the previous
fixes. :)

Start fvwm without config. Start xterm. Iconify it. Restart.
Open one FvwmConsole, move it to the right/bottom.
Open another FvwmConsole, move it so it overlaps the first.
Double click on the new (second) FvwmConsole. It is not lowered.
But this is only a one time small problem, much better than it was.

Maybe after I implement different automatical trackers in perllib. I will
need a test module for each tracker anyway. Mostly to test perllib, but it
may be of general use too. So, it will be a test module, not a script.
This way it will test M_RESTACK/M_RAISE/M_LOWER, not just Next (Raised).
But don't expect it to be very soon.

Mikhael.

It's not that I do this intentionally, you know?  I could have
stared at this code for weeks and I would not have found any bug.
I don't even understand what went wrong now that I 'fixed' it.  I
fully expect more oddities in the stacking order when icons are
involved.

  Style xterm StartIconic

and

  $ xterm -iconic

are good candidates for more problems.

Too much to do and too little time.  I know the feeling.

Sure, it was redudant to ask.

Stacking problems are ones of the most annoying. You may get mad if you
can't lower or raise that window. I will check again whether this last
problem is annoying or not (it is autofixed) and decide later today
whether to let it to be in the release.

Mikhael.

Here is one more problem. I think, colors of almost everyone's menus
should be wrong.

1) Start fvwm without config. Open FvwmConsole.

  Style * Hilight3DThickness 3, HilightBack darkgreen

(Hilight3DThickness is just to make it more visual.)
Notice how gray shadows are used for active menu item instead green.

There is same problem if colorsets are used, the shadows for active menu
item are taken from MenuColorset and not from ActiveColorset.

2) Now, one more bug that is only visible without colorsets:

  Style * Background red

Menus are still gray, not red! Although red shadows are used everywhere.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think it always worked this way.  I didn't want to change that
with my latest menu changes because the feature is available
through colour sets.  I didn't want to add features that are
removed in 3.0 anyway.

Use

  MenuStyle * HilightRelief

to activate that.  It's not the default for backward
compatibility.

Well, not quite. Without colorsets HilightRelief was off (I think it is a
bug that should be fixed) and with colorsets HilightRelief was on.

For example with any released 2.4.x >= 2.4.8 try this without any config:

  FvwmTheme
  Colorset 5 bg gray
  Colorset 6 bg darkgreen
  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6
  MenuStyle * HilightBack  # this command is fully optional
 
I think a new option HilightRelief is redundant, it should always be
HilightRelief just like it was always with colorsets. IMHO, it's good to
correct this bug when wrong shadow colors were used without colorsets.
I am all for configurability, but having !HilightRelief is simply wrong.
What do you think?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've posted my updated FvwmProxy on freshmeat.  Note the 2.5 patch,
fixed desk switching, Alt-Tab functionality, and no more crashes.

If everyone feels it's ready, we can hook it into the CVS tree.

Just have your lawyers fax me their NDA forms and I send it through
my IP legal team.  Oh, wrong job.

I'm still trying to figure out how to catch an Alt release in the .fvwm2rc
file to match 'Key Alt_L A N' for the press.  Then I could get rid of the
key polling.  Anybody got any ideas?

The --retain-pixmap in fvwm-root is my chore. If you want to get 2.5.4
our the door please don't wait for me. The job is small, but may not be
ready until after the weekend.

My apologies.

I had to introduce HilightRelief so that you can still have the
old behaviour.  But it's probably not critical at att.  What might
annoy the users more is that with HilightBack the title string is
not drawn hilighted anymore.

Don't worry, it is already done by Olivier and it is in cvs.

I am happy now to release 2.5.4.

By the way, FvwmProxy will not be part of it.

Done.  I had do do some work on it first:

  - Removed C++ style comments

      Comments with "//" are not allowed by ANSI C.  Some
      compilers might not be able to compile it.

  - Fixed a few compile errors and warnings

      This is not allowed in C:

        {
          int x;
          x = 1;
          int y;
        }

      Declarations must be at the beginning of a block.
        
  - Split AdjustWindows() into two functions to reduce the levels
    of indentation

  - Include the standard fvwm include files.

        #include "config.h"

      must always the first file to be included.

  - Removed ConfigFvwmProxy

      Once colour set support is added it should just default to
      using colour set 0 and the colour related options can be
      removed.

Remove the key invocation code from the module and let fvwm do it
via the remote control interface.  There are plans to add a
command that triggers actions when a key is released, not pressed.

I think, ideally FvwmProxy would just provide the graphical
interface and let fvwm open or close it.  I'll take a closer look
later.

Oh, and you should contact Jason ( tibbs@fvwm.org ) for write
access to the CVS repository.

Bye

I think this is already valid in C as stated in the ISO/IES 9899:1999
standard. :) I don't know which compilers except for gcc support it.

Now, a different issue.

How about renaming this module to something that is more intuitive?
I may think about FvwmProxyWindows, FvwmWindowMarks, FvwmIndicators.
I am sure you may find a better name.

Mikhael.

Just a pedantic note; both of the above _are_ legal in C, as of the ISO

in FVWM as compilers that support this syntax are still not ubiquitous.

It's not a theoretic problem.  gcc (2.95.4) simply refuses to
compile the following test program.  Otherwise I would never have
noticed it.

----------------------- foo.c -----------------------
int main(void)
{
        int x;
        x = 1;
        int y;
        y = 1;

        return 0;
}
-----------------------------------------------------

  $ gcc -o foo foo.c
  foo.c: In function `main':
  foo.c:5: parse error before `int'
  foo.c:6: `y' undeclared (first use in this function)

Anyway, since we are concerned about protability we can just
forget about the 1999 "standard" and stick with the old draft.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

It doesn't compile on Solaris (Forte 6.2),
HPUX 11.11
or AIX 5.1
either.

Using clicktofocus on Solaris 2.5.1.

Start an xview application (cmdtool/textedit).
Unfocus it, iconify it and reopen it using the windowlist menu
(alternatively,  Rester) Click into the xview app. May want to use multiple
xview windows to help the initial defocusing.

The window won't accept focus....until you bring up a menu in that window
(need not select anything from menu) and then click in the window.

Other anomolies...

Restart is VERY slow to start.
My mozilla icon which used to be white is now grey.

Thanx

My remotely running mozilla is REALLY slow repainting upon

faster.

<<
Start an xview application (cmdtool/textedit).
Unfocus it, iconify it and reopen it using the windowlist menu
(alternatively,  Rester) Click into the xview app. May want to use multiple
xview windows to help the initial defocusing.

The window won't accept focus....until you bring up a menu in that window
(need not select anything from menu) and then click in the window.
>>

An easier way...

"FvwmIdent" an xview window.
Click on the identfy window, closing it.
This will cause the xview not take focus problem.

Thanx

Lenience cures that problem....but it now requires 2 clicks to click into an
xview window (besides mailtool for some reason).

Also, the icons in to left corner upon Restart is back.
Once opened tho, icons obey iconbox upon iconifying.

I didn't yet get any feedback regarding the patch I sent to the list 3
days ago. I understand you where busy getting the 2.5.4 out these days, I
just would like to know if it's likely my patch will be incorporated.

If its confusing that it might, say, route packets to other
managers or be used to visualize your firewall, I can be flexible.

To be consistant with existing modules, how about FvwmWinProxy?
Just so I don't have to change the dozens of instances of the
word 'proxy' in the source.

I can't reproduce any of the problems you described with the
instructions you gave.  If you make a minimal configuration file
demonstrating your problems with *exact* instructions what to do
on the desktop ("click button 1 here", "move mouse ofer there"
...).

What makes you think fvwm modifies application provided icons?  As
I mentioned before, we can't do anything about "It doesn't work"
stlye bug reports

This was my first association. I also thought about something similar to
FvwmCommandS. I needed to look at the code and configuration to figure out
what it really does.

FvwmWinProxy is fine with me although I myself would probably use plural.

Actually, the only module to be consistent with (FvwmWinList) together
with FvwmIconMan and FvwmTaskBar is likely to be replaced/united in the
long run. I suggested either FvwmWindowList (better, because this is a
new name) or FvwmWinList for such super window list modules.

So, please throw the final name.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Don't worry, it's just that the patch is too big for me to apply
it at work, and at home I'm still busy with my removal.  I plan to
incorporate the patch, but I have to proof read it first (as I do
with almost patches).  Given that nothing important happens in the
mean time, I can do it until Friday.

I   believe this one   was a   Lenience issue.    I believe  all xview
applications fail to set the input hints.

I've had this problem in the past with contool, another xview
application.  According to some cryptic comments in my .fvwm2rc,
it can be caused by starting the application with the -WP? arg.

Yes, that's the focus policy they want.  They want to take the
focus themselves and often get confused when fvwm gives it to
them.  The proper style for an xview application is

  Style ... NoLenience, NeverFocus

I do the setup, but I might have missed the discussion where the cabal

OK, I've set up the CVS account; everything should be ready to go.
Jason, if you do want to send me a different crypted password
privately, I'll update things.  Otherwise, you're ready to check out a
fresh tree and start committing.

I'm still unable to accomplish what I had described earlier.  With
the correction I can't really lower (and keep lowered) a transient
(again I use MouseFocus).

Brief Description - have window-A, want to lower its transient
(assume I want to cut-n-paste from the parent into the transient
post pop-up), if I then change windows and move my mouse to
window-B (window-A's transient is still lowered) and attain focus
on window-B and then return to window-A, I'd like to see window-A's
transient raised and focused.

Is what I described doable ?

Thanks

And you are *really* using fvwm-2.5.4?  For older versions, use

  Style * RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, DontStackTransientParent

Maybe with some incredibly clever scripting.  The easiest way
would be to just use FvwmAuto.  But then, all windows will be
raised, not just transients.

Hello Dominik,

I moved to OpenOffice 1.0.1, 2.4.18-17.8.0custom, XFree86 4.2.0, and I'm 
using fvwm 2.5.5 (from cvs), updated right now.

I've removed the Style command that I was using:

Style *OpenOffice*   DontRaiseTransient, DontLowerTransient

since I don't see those problems anymore ... ;-)

Thanks !!

ciao,
Giuseppe.
