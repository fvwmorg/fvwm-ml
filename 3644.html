Hi again Dominik,
<br />
<br />Thanks again for your help. Drawing upon it and looking around 
<br />
a bit I figured this out:
<br />
<br />AddToFunc &quot;StartFunction&quot;
<br />
+	I GotoPage 0 0
<br />
<br />And, that does exactly what I want: the desktop always starts
<br />
and restarts in Viewport 0 0. 
<br />
<br />I haven't had the problem recently where telnet forces caps
<br />
on me - and anyway fvwm restart doesn't reset the lock.
<br />
<br />I was way off in my understanding of geometry management. In 
<br />
fact, what I was complaining about works fine: I just didn't 
<br />
interpret my own MSwindows desktop settings correctly.
<br />
<br />I have a new problem to raise. I wrote an application with a
<br />
small window which is used to popup other windows: usually
<br />
Motif XmSearchbox or XmBillboard dialogs.  These popups put 
<br />
themselves right on top of the original window rather than 
<br />
at the x,y coordinates specified in the application's default
<br />
file for the dialog.
<br />
<br />Based on the discussions and assistance which I have benefitted
<br />
from here, and which is greatly appreciated, I think this is 
<br />
a problem with XFree86 and not lesstif or fvwm. If there is
<br />
a contrary opinion, please let me know.
<br />
<br />A Manifesto.
<br />
<br />I have great hope for this line of software - XFree86,
<br />
lesstif, fvwm2, and freetds - will take over as a transparent
<br />
replacement for sun whose business I see being gobbled up from
<br />
above by IBM and from below by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I think the current move to client-side Java is justified 
<br />
primarily by the argument that it is platform independent.
<br />
I see this argument as not well grounded because 1. Microsoft
<br />
has terminated its agreement to support Java after 2006, 
<br />
2. Microsoft would have avoided some of its antitrust problem
<br />
if it had never gotten involved with Java, and 3. Microsoft's 
<br />
desktop OS supremecy is threatened by Java 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, XFree86 makes Xwindows code platform
<br />
independent now and without a termination date. And, as 
<br />
compiled rather than interpreted code, it runs faster. I 
<br />
know of people who say java is slow running head to head 
<br />
against sun Xwindows applications.
<br />
<br />And, of course, I have several years experience as an xwindows
<br />
motif developer and would like to see X survive so I can 
<br />
continue to use this expertise.
<br />
<br />BTW, if you know of a business in the U.S. northeast which
<br />
believes in this line of thinking and is expanding its 
<br />
technology commitment, I would appreciate it if you would
<br />
let me know.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />David
