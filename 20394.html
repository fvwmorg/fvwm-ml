<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; I am.  And I'm inviting other developers to come along and put
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; their efforts into another project that is going somewhere...
<br />
<br />I would be glad to hear about alternatives to fvwm2.
<br />
<br />However, last I looked Enlightenment was nowhere close to the kind of
<br />
thing I want... it's not an alternative &quot;if you like fvwm, check this
<br />
out&quot;.  It has a completely different set of goals, and almost all of
<br />
them are quite incompatible with what I want/need in a window manager.
<br />
<br />I need my window manager manage my windows, and that's about it :).
<br />
However, the management I want is advanced enough, functionally, to sink
<br />
most window managers out there.  Even fvwm2 currently doesn't quite cut
<br />
it; when the GSR happens, maybe.
<br />
<br />After that I want a little bit of nice-to-look-at, but I've got an 8-bit
<br />
video card on my Sun workstation (and I want to keep the same setup at
<br />
work and home, for ease-of-use) and I've only got 28M of RAM on the
<br />
equivalent of a pentium-75 at home; between them I just don't have the
<br />
resources for all the &quot;angry fruit salad&quot; Enlightenment's display seems
<br />
to have.  Who has time for all that stuff?  Graphically, I just need a
<br />
clean, tidy, easy to navigate virtual desktop that's there when I need
<br />
it, and otherwise stays out of the way.
<br />
<br />That's not to say that I think fvwm2 shouldn't have first-class graphic
<br />
support for those who want it... I just don't want to see that become
<br />
its _only_ mode of operation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; Fvwm2 development is for all intents and purposes stopped and dead.
<br />
<br />This, I'd have to unfortunately agree with.
<br />
<br />I'm sure everyone is appreciative of Chuck's efforts, but lets face it,
<br />
fvwm2 needs a coordinator who's got more free time than he's had in the
<br />
last couple of years if it wants to survive.  I remember well over 18
<br />
months ago the &quot;last beta before 2.1&quot; was out; now it seems that every
<br />
new patchlevel is the &quot;last beta before 2.1&quot;.  I'm not optimistic about
<br />
_ever_ seeing 2.1 at this rate, much less the major changes that are
<br />
planned after it's released.
<br />
<br />Believe me, I sympathize totally with Chuck.  I wanted to get a new
<br />
version of GNU make out before the end of May, and here it is July and I
<br />
still haven't made the second pretest yet!  I know exactly how
<br />
frustrating this is, when you have obligations which aren't part of your
<br />
&quot;real&quot; work, and you just can't seem to get to them.  I'm no better at
<br />
juggling this, and I certainly don't have the bandwidth myself.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, Stig's point here is very important and if we're fair and
<br />
honest with ourselves I don't think it can be dismissed lightly.
<br />
<br />IMO one of the major things keeping more dynamic development back is the
<br />
lack of regular, timely updates.  People don't have incentive to keep
<br />
updating and making things better if no one sees the enhancements.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; Meanwhile, there is an fvwm2 variant (AfterStep) that seems alive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; and well.
<br />
<br />AfterStep is intriguing, and I've considered grabbing that and taking a
<br />
look.  However, it is documented to have some annoying limitations
<br />
(because it seems to want to be as faithful to NextStep as possible,
<br />
which can be restrictive) that make me wary so far.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; Also, there are two other promising WM projects (Enlightenment, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; WindowMaker) that have been totally rewritten and that have large
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;s&gt; and active user-bases.
<br />
<br />Already discussed Enlightenment above; haven't heard of WindowMaker
<br />
before.
