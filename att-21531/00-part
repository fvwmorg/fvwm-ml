Dear Future Executive: 


2Hour Resume/Cover Letter Package
_______________________________________________________________________
Please pardon us if this important message doesn't concern you.

INTRODUCTION
The Resume Doctor has created generic resumes and cover letters for both
the general public and college graduates. All you do is modify them 
(delete the text which is there) with the inclusion of your information. 
There is no need to format anything. It's already done for you. We save you
time even if you're an expert with word processors. Using this package is
easier than using a resume program or having your resume or cover letter 
prepared by a resume specialist whom you don't know. The Resume Doctor has
examined both options and find them too costly and cumbersome. You could
have a superb looking resume in less than two hours with our resume package. 
In fact, we guarantee it. We'll finish it for you if you are unable to. 
(please read below).
 
The Resume Doctor treats every customer as if they would a member of thier
family. In order to continue to provide superior service to our clients, 
we are offering this package for a limited time only. If you're serious about 
looking for work, we're serious about helping you. So order today before 
we sell out. The Resume Doctor has been preparing resumes since 1988 and 
we know what works.

Our complete package, detailed below, may either be mailed to you on a
diskette or attached as an E-mail download. In both cases, you will simply 
save the files as a document (doc ext.) or a rich-text (rtf ext). Please
indicate on the order form below which method you require.




                                 THE PACKAGE

There's simply nothing that compares to what you get with our resume package. 
A complete package like ours could easily retail for more than $75.00. 
Your cost is just $29.95.


PREFORMATTED RESUMES  
You will receive a variety of resume templates. All of the templates are 
formatted differently. Just choose the one best suited for you. We also 
include the most common formatting instructions in case you get lost. 
Everything you need will be at your finger tips for fast and easy 
processing. 


TOP COVER LETTERS
Our cover letters are the best. "You have to see to believe". Our cover 
letters are written for cold-calls, replies to classified advertisements,
and self-promotion. The cover letters are motivational in style. There's a 
chock-full of paragraph options to choose from.  We think that our cover 
letters alone will get you in the door. 
Attn: Graduating students - "Our cover letters will level the playing field
for you." (if you're writing your own cover letters, our cover letters will
           serve as a perfect demonstration on how they should be written.)

60 SECRET WORDS/PHRASES
Similar to internet search engines, more and more businesses are using 
scanners that search for certain words/phrases in resumes. We'll provide you
with the top 60 words/phrases and tell you where to put them. This is vital
if you're applying at large companies.

LIST OF FIELD HEADERS
You get field headers too. Some of the most common headers in resumes are 
Objective, Summary, and Experience. You'll get a comprehensive list from us
with your package.

OVER 120 ACTION WORDS
Words such as collaborated, systemized, rehabilitated, and inspired are 
examples of action word. Action words help get your message across. The 
Resume Doctor has more than 120 of them to give you.

FAQ 
Want answers to our most common questions such as do you include salary
history in a resume or cover letter or does a resume have to be just one
page?
Answers to those questions are included in our package.

INTERVIEW TIPS
We have the best. Don't even think about going on an interview without them. 
They're that good!

CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND GUARANTEE
As indicated above, The Resume Doctor will finish-up your resume for you if
you're not able to do it within two hours. We also anticipate reviewing your
completed resume and cover letters. Just E-mail them back to us. We are
responsible. You get interviews or a refund. It's that simple! All
information provided to The Resume Doctor is kept completely confidential.
Please contact us at 818-710-6474 and we'll be happy to answer any question
you may have regarding our service.

CAREER HELP
Now that you have a great looking resume and cover letter, you'll want to do 
something with them. Our package presents you with the very best career links
on the internet. 

RESUME POSTING FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES
We've included in the package top web sites for posting your resume. You 
could cut and paste them into a bulletin board in about five minutes.
(We will have a list of sites for the general public soon)
