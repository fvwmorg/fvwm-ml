I have no problem with the current method, however, I would like to be
sure that the current path isn't limited in size.  Recently I tried to
break my plug-in hierarchy for the gimp down into several
sub-directories (I have well over 100 plug-ins) and then list all of the
directories in the path.  (Essentially what one would have to do if the
current method is maintained but wanted to organize things into
hierarchies.)

Well. . .to make a long story short, the gimp couldn't handle a path of
that length which could be a concern here.

Yes. . . this is a good idea.  I've encountered many situations where
users cannot figure out which path to use for what.  At one point I was
guilty of this.  One path would certainly eliminate a lot of confusion.
