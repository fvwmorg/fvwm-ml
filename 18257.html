<br />Yepp, this was the option that I had been thinking of. I cannot tell,
<br />
what difference it makes, because I enabled it ever since I compiled
<br />
my first copy of fvwm.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've had convincing pointer-focus afficianados that *that's* obsolete

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ;-) The fact that nearly all apps on MS-Windows and the Mac use modal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialogs is pretty clear evidence that you're way out on the fringe on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this one.
</em><br />
<br />&lt;FLAME MODE&gt;
<br />
You see, that is one of the many reasons why I do not use these
<br />
environments ;-) I might be able to accept that some people actually
<br />
like modal dialogs, but I can see no reason whatsoever why this could
<br />
not be made an option. The only exception is, that you accept the
<br />
lazyness of the programmer being a valid excuse.
<br />
&lt;/FLAME MODE&gt;
<br />
<br />Although I feel very strong about this topic, it is not intended as
<br />
flame-bait. You said, that MetaCard is a developer's tool, thus you
<br />
might have some influence on setting policies. I would like to suggest
<br />
that your policies consider the needs of all potential
<br />
customers/users. Therefore, the ability to configure all &quot;religously&quot;
<br />
discussed features of the GUI should be the first and foremost design
<br />
criterion! (these topics include: pointer mode, modality, keyboard-
<br />
vs. mouse-driven, amount of colors, keyboard layout, ...) Leave the
<br />
final decision to the end-user, but provide default settings that you
<br />
consider sensible and that are commonly accepted in your target
<br />
market.
<br />
<br />So far, the only seemingly good argument for modal dialogs appears to
<br />
be that they require your immediate attention if there has been a
<br />
serious error. The reasoning is, that you could not do anything else
<br />
anyways, before answering this dialog, so you might just as well be
<br />
forced to answer it. I do not believe this to be true:
<br />
<br />Imagine a texteditor; when closing the window the text is supposed to
<br />
be autosaved, but a hard-error occurs and the system is unable to
<br />
write the file. Writing to a backup file fails just as well, so the
<br />
application needs your help and pops up a modal dialog asking you what
<br />
to do now. The options are 1) save under another name, 2) forget about
<br />
the whole thing and discard the data, 3) mail the file to you so that
<br />
you can recover it from your mailbox, 4) return to the main
<br />
application; unfortunately, many application programmers forget the
<br />
latter, because it complicates the program design.
<br />
<br />As a user, I might be able to think of a couple of other options: 1) I
<br />
might want to select the entire text and after copying to the
<br />
clipboard, paste the contents to a different application, 2) I might
<br />
want to use &quot;xv&quot; to get a snapshot of the current window, if only it
<br />
was not obstructed by the modal dialog, 3) I want to select print-file
<br />
instead, so that I get a hardcopy of my work, 4) I know why this error
<br />
occured and I want to select another entry from the main window in
<br />
order to fix it, 5) I have to double check a couple of other options
<br />
in the main application before I can really decide on which button to
<br />
press.
<br />
<br />Pro-modality people usually suggest that you could just as well close
<br />
the warning dialog and then (hopefully) return to where you left
<br />
off. Only 1) this does not work in all situations, 2) it is
<br />
counter-intuitive to the way that I work, 3) it might have taken
<br />
considerable effort to finally get to this stage where the box popped
<br />
up; closing it now would require me to re-do all this work after I
<br />
fixed the original error.
<br />
