<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the not so distant past I spoke offline with Brady Montz, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; asked if he might like to take over maintainership from me when I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ready to give it up, as I felt that he was one of a few good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; candidates from the mailing lists and that he might have more time to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; devote that I do.  At the time he said he was interested.  After I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; made my decision this morning, I wrote him again to ask if he was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; still interested, but unforutunately haven't heard back from him yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I really wanted to hear back from Brady first before I wrote anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the mailing lists, but decided that I should speak up before too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many messages flew back and forth without my input (hope you don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mind, Brady).  In the event that Brady has changed his mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't want to (or can't) take over, I'm sure we'll be able to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; someone else.  I'll be sure and announce when this is all decided.
</em><br />
<br />I'm sorry that I've been harsh to chuck in late '96, when I wanted to speed
<br />
up development. He wasn't ready to pass on the torch, then and he still has
<br />
not enough time to review all that patches and still do own modifications.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've had to think about this a bit since it's quite a time commitment, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think I'm willing to do it. I'd want to look into a way of splitting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development between among a small group of people, perhaps with a public CVS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source tree with all checkins to be approved by me. Does anyone have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggestions along this line?
</em><br />
<br /><br />yes: try do a complete split &amp; reindentation of the code as fast as
<br />
possible, so that work can begin.
<br />
<br />I'd like to have a more methodically split: e.g: menu code was spilled over
<br />
several files in 2.0.43-45, don't know of .46
<br />
<br />Indentation is pretty bad, since people had to keep the patches small
<br />
(diff -w is no good for indentation)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />To get rid of the patches-backlog, you should get development up &amp; running
<br />
as fast as possible, with a quick brushed up release as a basis for all
<br />
those patches. (don't try to first include gazillions of patches that were
<br />
for 2.0.43 to .45) 
<br />
<br />Then you should ask the authors of the most important patches to redo them
<br />
for that release. Then you can quickly select / apply those.
<br />
I don't think they'll be offended, if they have to redo a patch once and
<br />
then have it included.
<br />
Many of these patches have been re-done several times, because they didn't
<br />
make it into .41, then they didn't make it into .42 and so on.
<br />
<br /><br />After this catchup on the patches backlog, most of the &quot;I detected a bug in
<br />
2.0.46&quot; -&gt; &quot;Yes it's been there since 2.0.39, use this workaround&quot; traffic
<br />
on the lists should cease, leaving more time to fiddle with code.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Then we can focus on the unknown bugs and enhancements.
<br />
<br />BTW:
<br />
we should still finish the discussion, wether we want
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) a new language / languages ??
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) export fvwm's data &amp; special functionality
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) reinvent the wheel while adding one feature after the other to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the existing language (delay ?).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I already posted an idea to have fvwm-core without any language, but just a
<br />
bytecode interpreter (maybe with a callout for unknown opcodes).
<br />
<br />The syntax-analyzer / semantic parser would be a standalone program
<br />
producing bytecode output, being piped to fvwm.
<br />
We could even have different ones.
<br />
Modules would also output bytecode -&gt; no redundant syntax &amp; semantic
<br />
checking.
<br />
<br />The bytecode interpreter (i.e. most of current functions.c &amp; builtins.c)
<br />
would be a shared library which can be unloaded (swapped out !), when all
<br />
configuration is done and no functions have been defined (minimal user).
<br />
We could even split the language into a startup config part (always
<br />
unloaded) and a dynamic executing part (functions)
<br />
<br /><br />this is all some sort of brainstorm, so don't hesitate to comment, ask for
<br />
elaboration, etc ...
<br />
I also hope you don't mind the intermixing of we / you. I tried to use &quot;you&quot;
<br />
for things only You (as the maintainer) can do, and &quot;we&quot; for things we can
<br />
do as patches, that can be included fairly easy, when there's a comon base
<br />
for patching. (2.0.46 ?, 2.0.46 autoconf, what versions else do exist now)
<br />
<br />Maybe we can re-acquire some spin-offs or borrow / lift some code there ?
