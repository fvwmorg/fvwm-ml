<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am running 2.3.20, which is the latest version that is ported to FreeBSD.

<br />2.3.20 was in July, the current version is pre-2.3.28.
<br />
<br />There are many people, every one with his own wishes about focus policy,
<br />
placement policy, usage of keyboard or mouse, circulating policy, window
<br />
states like maximizing, iconifying, shading, borders, buttons, bindings
<br />
and so on. FVWM lets you to customize most of things, but you should be
<br />
ready learn it, it is not hard if you are a unix person.
<br />
<br />The best way to learn fvwm commands is to open FvwmConsole and try all
<br />
commands that you want (or find in the man page). Try first the simple
<br />
ones like Move, Maximize, Exec xterm, Restart. Many commands need a window
<br />
context, they are best to be tested with Next or All, like:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Next (XTerm) Focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next (XTerm) WarpToWindow 50 8p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All (!FvwmConsole) Iconify
<br />
<br />You will find that Focus does not warp the mouse pointer to a window,
<br />
i.e. you may type into a newly focused window despite the fact that the
<br />
pointer is actually over some other window.
<br />
Once you learn how individual commands work, you may create complex
<br />
functions consisting from individual commands, say:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;DestroyFunc SelectWindow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AddToFunc   SelectWindow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I Echo Selected window: id=$w, name=&quot;$n&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I Iconify false
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I WindowShade false
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I Focus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I WarpToWindow
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Tab  A  CM   Prev SelectWindow
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Tab  A  SCM  Next SelectWindow
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want dialogue windows (or any new windows) to get focus and to have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active pointer in them.  In particular, I want to do this with WordPerfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that tab between dialogue buttons and fields without using the mouse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know how cooperative WordPerfect 8 is with X, but so far I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get things to work right with native X applications - so that is my first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have tried the examples in the FAQ with no success.  The closest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have got so far is to get new windows colored like they have focus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and raised, but the pointer doesn't go to the window and if it happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be where the window opens, it is in cross-hair form and for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with xterm I can't type into the window (the little block after the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prompt is in outline form, like the window doesn't have focus, although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is in the hilight colors).
</em><br />
<br />The cross-hair cursor is used when the window is requered for a window
<br />
operation like Iconify, Move, Focus, but there is no window context.
<br />
This happens if you use FvwmEvent without PassId. I.e. your function
<br />
defined as add_window hook is called without a window context, thus
<br />
all window commands, like Focus will first require you to choose
<br />
a window and press a button or Enter. Hovewer if you use PassId, and
<br />
then WindowId $0 WarpToWindow, this will work on a newly added window.
<br />
<br />The example in FAQ lists 2.3.19+ as requirement, but it should be 2.3.21+,
<br />
sorry for the mistake. If you already use a developement version, I would
<br />
suggest to update to 2.3.27 anyway.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I gather that I am supposed to do this with FvwmEvent, add_window and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some function defined to do what I want.  But so far, defining that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function with various combinations of Focus, FlipFocus, Raise, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WarpToWindow has not come up with what I am looking for.  I think I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was able to do this at one time with hints for mouseless operation for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the disabled.  But I lost my configuration with a crash and have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unable to find the site with that information again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can someone tell me very slowly and clearly, like I am as senile as I,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly what I have to do?
</em><br />
<br />This is from FAQ, but edited to work with any 2.3.x (but not 2.2, because
<br />
it does not support PassId). Put this to your .fvwm2rc:
<br />
<br />#
<br />
# Every new window is focused and gets a mouse cursor
<br />
#
<br />
*FvwmEventCmd
<br />
*FvwmEventPassId
<br />
*FvwmEvent add_window SelectWindow
<br />
<br />AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent
<br />
<br />DestroyFunc SelectWindow
<br />
AddToFunc   SelectWindow
<br />
+ I WindowId $0 Focus
<br />
+ I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Mikhael.
