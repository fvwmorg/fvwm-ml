<br />
<br />DATE: 09 - 04 - 04
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />
<br />How are you? And hope all is well?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be surprise to receive this mail but I will like you to 
<br />
go through it carefully before responding, I hope at the end it will 
<br />
find you and your business in the best of interest. Let me quickly 
<br />
introduce myself and the reason why contacting you is very important. I am 
<br />
Kalister Maunda; I am a senior staff at the Office of the Minister of 
<br />
Petroleum Affairs Angola.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;I have traveled along side with our Oil minister Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos
<br />
<br />&nbsp;to your country in search of investors that will come and invest on our Petroleum 
<br />
Sector, it was in one of this trip that I was opportuned to realize that the trips 
<br />
been made by the Minister is not for the search for investors, but for the 
<br />
search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan 
<br />
petroleum Export that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this 
<br />
discovery, but I later realized that I was the only one among other 
<br />
staffs that was not aware of these happenings, investigation into this 
<br />
matter made me to know that even the president is involved. I suddenly 
<br />
realized that the BBC and news achieve below is true.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2546281.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2546281.stm</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrived from the trip I made with the minister and went straight 
<br />
to confront my Head of Department, and he told me that he is aware of 
<br />
the whole situation, he went further to show me some documents that was 
<br />
used to withdraw some millions of American Dollars that was meant to be 
<br />
used to pay Oil contracting Firms in Angola, he said I should assist 
<br />
him in the search for a reputable and trust worthy business man that can 
<br />
assist us in transfering the funds to a safe place where it will be 
<br />
used for Future Investment.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore asking for your opinion on this issue, will you be 
<br />
able to assist us in transfering and claiming the money of which some 
<br />
percentage of the total amount involved will be granted to you for 
<br />
assisting us and for the time you spent on the transaction.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are willing to assist us kindly provide us with details of 
<br />
how we can reach you by phone or by fax so that we can proceed to 
<br />
conclude this transaction. You can contact me on my email
