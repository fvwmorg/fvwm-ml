<br />I don't mean to throw something else into the mix here, but I did some 
<br />
&quot;testing&quot; before I'd get Sun involved.  I remembered a while back when I 
<br />
was looking into this that I stumbled on something, but don't think I 
<br />
ever made sure of my findings.
<br />
<br />Turns out, the two windows that act up at for me don't act up by 
<br />
themselves.  Meaning, if I have RM6 and/or the EDM GUI running, things 
<br />
seem fine.  This leads me to believe there's another application in the 
<br />
mix that's introducing something strange into the environment that's 
<br />
causing the entire problem.  Could this be the case?
<br />
<br />Here's why I think that.  At work, I run Checkpoint's PolicyEditor. 
<br />
While that was running, I started my EDM GUI.  The main window briefly 
<br />
opened, but exited just after the &quot;About&quot; window closed.  I closed the 
<br />
Checkpoint GUI and restarted the EDM GUI, which now functioned properly. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I then remembered RM6 showed symptoms while the EDM symptom was there. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed the EDM GUI, started Checkpoint, and then started RM6.  Sure 
<br />
enough, when moving the pointer over the buttons that pop-up the balloon 
<br />
help, the window died, which (I think) is the symptom that most people 
<br />
are complaining about.
<br />
<br />So, my problems only appeared to be present when the Checkpoint GUI was 
<br />
up and running.  This was until I noticed yesterday that both RM6's and 
<br />
the EDM's symptoms were still present even though the Checkpoint GUI had 
<br />
no longer been running.  (Maybe there's residual effects from having 
<br />
that window open?)
<br />
<br />So, thinking back, I remembered that I had been running VMWare 
<br />
Workstation v3.x while my problems were present the first time around. 
<br />
I grabbed a copy of WMWare 3.x today and started it up (you only need to 
<br />
run vmware-config.pl and then start the vmware binary to see the 
<br />
problem, no need to actually install a vmware host).  The problem was 
<br />
there.  I stopped VMWare and the problem went away.
<br />
<br />Note I started v3.x.  The new version of VMWare (4.x) does NOT produce 
<br />
the symptoms in RM6 and the EDM GUI.
<br />
<br />What do you think about this?  Could it be that the problem is VMWare 
<br />
3.x and the Checkpoint GUI instead of the other two (RM6 and EDM GUI)? 
<br />
Is it possible that something strange is being introduced that's 
<br />
screwing up the other apps?
<br />
