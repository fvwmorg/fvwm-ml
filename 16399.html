</em><br />
<br />BAW&gt; I'm new both to fvwm and (just minutes ago) fvwm2.  I'd spent the
<br />
BAW&gt; last few days moving from ctwm to fvwm and had gotten my
<br />
BAW&gt; configuration file (not located at ~/.fvwmrc) just about how I
<br />
BAW&gt; wanted it.
<br />
<br />Welcome aboard Barry.
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; So I decided to pull down version 2 beta and run it with my version 1
<br />
BAW&gt; config file: fvwm -f /path/to/my/fvwmrc
<br />
<br />Uh oh...I think I know where this is going.
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; Whoa!  Big problem!  The -f command line switch has different
<br />
BAW&gt; semantics now.  I got a semi-cryptic error from fvwm saying it
<br />
BAW&gt; couldn't exec my file.  Hmm, I didn't think it should have exec
<br />
BAW&gt; permission, but okay, I changed it anyway.  Still no good.  On top of
<br />
BAW&gt; this, fvwm still starts up but with *no way* to exit it!  Fortunately
<br />
BAW&gt; I start up an XEmacs process too so I can kill fvwm.
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; So I guess it's time to read the manpage :-).  Sure enough the -f
<br />
BAW&gt; option should take a command instead of just a file name.  However,
<br />
BAW&gt; for backwards compatibility sake, I would suggest that -f have the
<br />
BAW&gt; same semantics as for version 1, and that a different switch be used
<br />
BAW&gt; for the new semantics.
<br />
<br />Yup, I plan to make that change for the next beta release.  Actually,
<br />
I wanted to get it into 2.0.42, but rushed at the end to get it out
<br />
because it was taking so long and neglected to make that change.
<br />
2.0.43 will have -f &lt;configfile&gt; like 'normal' and a -cmd &lt;configcmd&gt;
<br />
for the alternate method.
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; Also, fvwm should have some failsafe exit mechanism that is
<br />
BAW&gt; *always* present unless specifically defeated.  No matter how
<br />
BAW&gt; early the problem in the config file is, there should be a tidy
<br />
BAW&gt; way to exit fvwm.  These things would help in the conversion
<br />
BAW&gt; process.
<br />
<br />Actually, I'm trying to figure out why it's locking up when no config
<br />
file is available.  There are a lot of defaults in there now
<br />
(including one menu bound to a button press over the root window which
<br />
is just 'Exit FVWM'), and I thought that would be sufficient, but
<br />
apparently not since it still doesn't work.  I hope to have this
<br />
cleared up for the next beta as well though.
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; Finally, I have a dual-headed SparcStation, so I tried starting
<br />
BAW&gt; up fvwm version 1 with the -s option, on :0.0.  Then I tried to
<br />
BAW&gt; start up fvwm2 with -d :0.1 -s but it complained that another WM
<br />
BAW&gt; was running.  Once I use -s, how can I get another window manager
<br />
BAW&gt; on my second screen?
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I don't have access to any multiple display systems, so
<br />
I can't test this out...  As I recall though, I think Rob said that
<br />
the multiple screen code was lacking some.
<br />
<br />What happens if you don't use the -s?  Does that work - does fvwm2
<br />
control both screens?
<br />
<br />And I think that someone else out there on the list has done this
<br />
before.  Does anyone have any advice/experience/etc with this?
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; Please!  I don't mean the above to sound ungrateful.  I see Chuck
<br />
BAW&gt; Hines is the maintainer for fvwm now and that's real cool 'cause he's
<br />
BAW&gt; contributed greatly to XEmacs.
<br />
<br />Hey, thanks for the ego boost there Barry!  Although I think that the
<br />
word 'greatly' should be removed from that sentence, especially with
<br />
my lack of activity on the current beta...
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; In my couple of days of hacking with version 1 I've already kill
<br />
BAW&gt; more than one nit I had with ctwm.  fvwm is great stuff and I
<br />
BAW&gt; look forward to more glowing reports in the future. :-)
<br />
<br />And we're glad to have you aboard!
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; I'm really psyched about doing more integration with Python and
<br />
BAW&gt; the module subsystem (yup, I've seen Jonathan Kelley's fvwmmod.py
<br />
BAW&gt; -- again, cool stuff).
<br />
<br />Sounds like you'll be making some good contributions then!  I've never
<br />
played with Python myself, but I know it's gaining in popularity.  And
<br />
any additional interfaces for modules can only be good for fvwm, I
<br />
think.  There's some Tcl/Tk ones already, I'd like to make a Perl
<br />
interface, and now Python.  Pretty cool...
<br />
<br />BAW&gt; Thanks for letting me blow off steam!
<br />
<br />No problem.
<br />
<br />Chuck
