<br />
Dear Sir,
<br />
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
<br />
behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to
<br />
me by a member of the South African Export Promotion
<br />
Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation
<br />
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference
<br />
talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to
<br />
seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
<br />
execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
<br />
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because
<br />
of the nature of this business.
<br />
<br />Within the Department of Minerals &amp; Energy where I
<br />
work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation
<br />
and with the co-operation of three other top
<br />
officials, we have in our possession an overdue
<br />
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain
<br />
percentage of the total contract value executed on
<br />
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,
<br />
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
<br />
US$28.500,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred
<br />
Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
<br />
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
<br />
excess balance unclaimed.
<br />
<br />Since the present Government is determined to pay
<br />
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain
<br />
good relationship with foreign governments and
<br />
non-governmental agencies. We intend to include our
<br />
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and
<br />
the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). So we are
<br />
seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the
<br />
&nbsp;unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate
<br />
foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary
<br />
information upon application for claim to reflect
<br />
payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of
<br />
you/your company.
<br />
<br />I have the authority of my partners involved to
<br />
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
<br />
this transaction your share as compensation will be so
<br />
negotiated and agreed upon by both you and we on this
<br />
side, before further details will change hands to
<br />
enhance our primary objective.
<br />
<br />The business is completely safe and secure, provided
<br />
you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not
<br />
matter whether you/your company does contract projects
<br />
as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of
<br />
you/your company to settle any legality. Also, your
<br />
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
<br />
successful execution of this transaction. I have
<br />
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
<br />
not disappoint us.
<br />
<br />For further , do not hesitate to contact me
<br />
on this my private email account, then after
<br />
i shall furnish you with the details of my lawyer,
<br />
his name is barrister Don Ronald Benfica
<br />
who is presently in Madrid spain
<br />
<br />Awating your urgent response.
<br />
<br />Mr. MANUEL SISILU
<br />
