<br />AR&gt; Some of the things others have suggested to me is:
<br />
<br />AR&gt; - drag-n-drop to/from GoodStuff Applications Launcher
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; Going with my above statement, I don't think I would ever make
<br />
Chuck&gt; GoodStuff (or rather FvwmButtons, the equivalent in 2.xx) have any
<br />
Chuck&gt; specific drag and drop capabilites.
<br />
don't need to.
<br />
FvwmButtons isn't interested in the information, which is passed from Mfm
<br />
to the application. It just might forward it (Black Box!).
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; But I think what might be better is to give MFM it's own toolbar (like
<br />
Chuck&gt; GoodStuff/FvwmButtons), which could perhaps be torn off (or made a
<br />
Chuck&gt; separate program entirely), and add code to MFM to allow it to be
<br />
Chuck&gt; compiled as an fvwm module.
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; Also, in the not too distant future there will be some modules that
<br />
Chuck&gt; will allow for shell script communication with a running fvwm, and an
<br />
Chuck&gt; idea similiar to that could be used as well (so MFM wouldn't have to
<br />
Chuck&gt; be invoked as a module).
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; And by building the toolbar into MFM, it would have drag and drop
<br />
Chuck&gt; functionality under any window manager, not just fvwm.  And under
<br />
Chuck&gt; fvwm, it could also possibly perform fvwm specific window manager
<br />
Chuck&gt; functions (much like tkgoodstuff).
<br />
<br />I'd vote for an mfm feature to create one or more toolbars with drag &amp;
<br />
drop, which I could swallow from FvwmButtons then.
<br />
No hassle for Chuck who is already quite overloaded, no long response times
<br />
on feature requests from the mfm people, no mfm specific drag &amp; drop target
<br />
functions in fvwm(buttons). 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />AR&gt; - dynamic main window menu's
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; There are pseudo facilities to do this now in the 2.xx betas, and will
<br />
Chuck&gt; probably be slightly easier in the next beta (2.0.43) and the first
<br />
Chuck&gt; official release (2.1.0) which should be out shortly after that.
<br />
<br />can't wait to see them.....
<br />
<br />AR&gt; - GUI interface to build .fvwmrc files
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; Actually, two of these exist right now that I know of:
<br />
[...]
<br />
<br />I guess, you can't do all the tweaks from a configuration generator, but
<br />
it'd certainly help novices/occasional users.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bryan&gt; Next issue: I'm closely associated with the mfm people. (mfm is
<br />
Bryan&gt; a very nice desktop manager) What kind of work do you think the
<br />
Bryan&gt; two groups should do make these two programs work more
<br />
Bryan&gt; hand-in-hand?
<br />
<br />well a combined desktop/file manager is no new idea.
<br />
I guess it started with Apple, went on to Norton Desktop for Windows, PC
<br />
Tools Desktop for Windows, Windows 95 has then more or less just killed the
<br />
market for these afterproducts for Windoze.
<br />
<br />In general I think, it's a good idea, but I don't know how to have fvwm2 &amp;
<br />
mfm part one root window in a smooth manner (- without bounding boxes:
<br />
&quot;You can't put that file icon there, because it's the fvwm side of the root
<br />
window !!!&quot;), without them being integrated.
<br />
Even if mfm were a module for fvwm, it'd just have some sort of transparent
<br />
window (rectangular!) in which to place it's icon. No placing icons
<br />
anywhere else.
<br />
<br />(might be that I overlooked sth. here, I've some sort of &quot;incompleteness&quot;
<br />
feeling)
<br />
<br /><br />Bryan&gt; One area which seems a &quot;must&quot; is the ability to make a element
<br />
Bryan&gt; on the buttonBar be a drag-and-drop receiver.
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; In other words, if I drag a file off of mfm and onto a
<br />
Bryan&gt; WordPerfect icon on the buttonbar, it'd be nice if WordPerfect
<br />
Bryan&gt; could be 'taught' in invoke itself with the name of the file.
<br />
<br />Would certainly be nice. One way was desribed above: mfm button bar, maybe
<br />
swallowed by FvwmButtons.
<br />
<br />Maybe sth like this already exists (roughly):
<br />
Create a button which executes the command &quot;wordperfect `print_selection`&quot;:
<br />
you just mark the file with the mouse and press the button.
<br />
Mfm could always put the highlighted file in the pastebuffer automagically,
<br />
so that you just click on the filename and then on the button.
<br />
(I know the command isn't print_selection, but `p?? -xyz`, but I can't
<br />
remember now.)
<br />
<br />It's not directly drag`n`drop, but it`s close, and fvwm shouldn`t support
<br />
multiple drag`n`drop interfaces.
<br />
<br />It might be different, if mfm and other file managers could come to terms
<br />
with a single drag'n'drop interface, but maybe not. ;^)
<br />
<br /><br />Chuck&gt; This would require coding changes on WordPerfect's part, for it to do
<br />
Chuck&gt; it itself.
<br />
If wordperfect recognized a file dropped onto it's icon, it'd still do so,
<br />
if swallowed in FvwmButtons (maybe via an own iconmanager - ewww, that
<br />
needs some smoothing), or in a special iconbox, filled with drag'n drop
<br />
receivers, swallowed into FvwmButtons (I like the latter MUCH less).
<br />
<br />This should be doable quite easily - am I right ?
<br />
(I guess our Capacity on these issues is still with The Green Men, is he?)
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; What do you folks think? We have a fine window manager and a
<br />
Bryan&gt; fine desktop manager.  What makes windowing environments
<br />
Bryan&gt; successful is that the two work together in synergy.  To be
<br />
Bryan&gt; able to do this at the free(d)ware level on X would be a
<br />
Bryan&gt; tremendous benefit to everyone.
<br />
<br />I do second that, but it would mean either integrate, or use existing
<br />
interfaces. (Maybe with slight extensions, as long as they are generally
<br />
useful extensions. No one wants to see mfm-specific functions bloat fvwm,
<br />
when most people don't use them. But then I think most people would use the
<br />
file manager part, if they were integrated. It's maybe just a matter of 
<br />
&quot;I don't need no steenking Windoze&quot; ?)
<br />
<br />Chuck&gt; As I said, I actually don't see where it buys a lot, since not many
<br />
Chuck&gt; programs would recognize the drag and drop protocol themselves.  That
<br />
Chuck&gt; would be the real win (for those that like and use drag&amp;drop).  But
<br />
Chuck&gt; until one becomes a real standard...
<br />
<br />It shouldn't even bother fvwm, which drag'n'drop interface the application
<br />
uses. Just make sure, FvwmButtons can swallow an iconified application and
<br />
passes on all events from the icon to the application.
<br />
<br />If WordPerfect and Mfm can agree on an interface to use, fvwm shouldn't
<br />
keep them from communicating.
<br />
<br />just my 0.02$,
