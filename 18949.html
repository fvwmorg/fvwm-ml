It's been what -- three days since fvwm 2.0.44 has been released???

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the distinction between a Decor and a Style is, when you should use

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one or the other, and basically why they are two different things and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what each is good for.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, it seems that everything _except_ Style has gone to the new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;AddTo&quot; format (with the &quot;+&quot; lines), which is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<br />The reason that some things have gone global is because there aren't any
<br />
more style flags (yet).  There is a slight confusion between Style and
<br />
ButtonStyle, for example, but this is due to the flag limitation, which is
<br />
to be addressed by Chuck after version 2.1.
<br />
<br />Many of the things you've mentioned I've been forced to think about at one
<br />
time or another during implementation, but factors which caused me to make
<br />
certain decisions include backwards compatibility, practicality, and being
<br />
able to _not_ use any of the options (most important).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why is there only one AddToFunc, AddToMenu, AddToDecor, but there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a distinction between ButtonStyle and AddButtonStyle?  I don't get that.
</em><br />
<br />Functions, menus and decors do not belong to anything.  They are only
<br />
assigned or called from other things.  In this respect, they are global.
<br />
Button/title/border styles belong to decors.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, as I said before, some of the syntax uses this new (), --, !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notation and some doesn't (like Style doesn't use !, it has multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values for the opposite &quot;flag&quot; types).  That's also confusing.
</em><br />
<br />It's not entirely consisitent, but once you get the hang of it it's not
<br />
bad.  I did this since it made code a bit smaller and more convienent.
<br />
Might be something too look into after 2.1.x though -- more consolidation
<br />
of parsing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you define the colors to HilightColor as &lt;c1&gt; &lt;c2&gt;, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colors to the Style Color option as &lt;c1&gt;/&lt;c2&gt;?  There's just a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistency and even some redundancy, I think, in the config file
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language now.
</em><br />
<br />HilightColor has always been like that, unless someone changes it.  There
<br />
has always been a lot of inconsistency and redundancy, and it won't go
<br />
:-).  Part of the problem is retaining some sense of backward
<br />
compatibility for fvwm2. 
<br />
<br />You can't expect perfection -- no one works on this stuff full-time (also
<br />
it would take much longer :-).  These things are meant to be practical,
<br />
i.e., you write something in the RC and it operates in a particular
<br />
manner.  If you want more you could always go with gwm or something.  If I
<br />
wrote a window manager from scratch I'd probably include something close
<br />
to a Turing-complete language written in lex/yacc.
<br />
<br />The main reason that for example ButtonStyle has become somewhat complex
<br />
is simple:  it still works with original button definitions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that somewhere there needs to be a very short overview: &quot;Use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ButtonStyle to define buttons on the window frame border; use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AddButtonStyle to modify attributes of an existing ButtonStyle; use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AddToDecor to make a new Decor; use UseDecor to apply a Decor to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Style; use UseStyle to `duplicate' a style&quot;, etc.
</em><br />
<br />This is reasonable, and I think would probably be most effective.  Let me
<br />
see if I can come up with a man page section for that.  If you can, I'll
<br />
send it to you for comments.
<br />
<br />I really didn't think there would be as much interest in this Decor stuff
<br />
when I wrote it.  It is just a feature, and you can use it or ditch it.
<br />
However, since do seem to be interested, the future is wide open.
<br />
<br />The idea behind UseDecor is that you can make sets of window
<br />
title/button/border/windowfont/hilightcolors and assign them to any
<br />
window.  That's it.  It's a lot of stuff which does take some time getting
<br />
used to. 
<br />
<br />I wouldn't expect anyone to understand everything in one day about decors
<br />
any more than I'd expect anyone learning everything about Emacs in 1 year. 
<br />
I wrote the Decor stuff and even I haven't learned everything about it;
<br />
I've seen examples which I've never thought of being posted recently.
<br />
<br />Let me see if I can explain the AddButtonStyle to you a bit more.  Imagine
<br />
a stack of styles, each painted on top of one another.  If I give a
<br />
ButtonStyle command with a style in there, than it clears the stack; i.e.:
<br />
<br />ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue
<br />
<br />This would give me a solid blue button.  Say I wanted a pixmap over that
<br />
blue button.  Then I can say: 
<br />
<br />AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm
<br />
<br />And say I wanted a second left justified pixmap over that, yielding a
<br />
stack which holds three styles: 
<br />
<br />AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left
<br />
<br />Then, a fourth style say is added, which is the default vector button of
<br />
button 3:
<br />
<br />AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3
<br />
<br />Resulting in the full definition (this does the same thing for all button
<br />
states since no state is specified for any definition):
<br />
<br />ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue
<br />
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm
<br />
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left
<br />
AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3
<br />
<br />That's it.  The same is possible with TitleStyle if EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is
<br />
enabled. 
<br />
<br />Say I wanted to use the TitleStyle for button 1 without clearing the
<br />
abutton stack:
<br />
<br />ButtonStyle 1 -- UseTitleStyle
<br />
<br />To get rid of UseTitleStyle
<br />
<br />ButtonStyle 1 -- !UseTitleStyle
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, someone should to rewrite the system.fvwmrc file to maybe use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Decor and/or Style &quot;correctly&quot; as an example; here's how I changed my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ~/.fvwm2rc (obviously, comments more than welcome :) after I (think I)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figured out Decor and UseStyle:
</em><br />
<br />True, some examples are needed.  But the problem is that these things are
<br />
quite flexible, and I could give you a pretty simple example as above or a
<br />
very complex one.  I guess the key would be to get as many examples as
<br />
possible.  But someone has to make an example repository. 
<br />
<br />It would be nice if someone could setup some sort of fvwm2 example
<br />
repository with a http inteface (seriously!). 
<br />
<br />The main thing right now is to fix bugs; this is the only the first beta
<br />
release of the decor stuff in fvwm2 :-). 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Andrew
