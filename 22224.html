<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;    Well, after a long long time without having seen any improvements

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; in the great fvwm2 I have decide to take up the task, but it will have

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; a cost, I have reindented the full source (using indent -kr -bli0 -bl), so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; patches are not a good way to distribute it (last was greater than the code
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; itself :).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;    My question is simple, is anybody working on fvwm2 now?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes: Charles Hines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; if yes what are his goals?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My advice: check the archives of this list for his posts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; If nobody answer, I will start a new series in the fvwm2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; development (maybe something like 2.0.46.x :), and start to put patched
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; versions at Adam Kopatz site, I would include most of the patches most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; commonly used (as FvwmPager Ballons, fvwmpython interface, etc...), so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I asked the authors of this patches to contact me (I'm not going to repeat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; already done code :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, Charles Hines is actively maintaining fvwm2.
</em><br />
<br />An admittedly lethargic active development though...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm sure your intentions are good; however, a post like yours might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seem like an attempt at a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; to some people.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wonder if a more cooperative approach would work better.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that original post aggrivated me quite a bit at first, but then I
<br />
realized that I was really more upset with myself for not having
<br />
enough time to do the work on fvwm that I really wanted to.  So I've
<br />
come to a decision, which I'll outline below...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That said, I've been wishing for a long time that the speed of development
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be increased.  I've considered proposing a &quot;linux style&quot; dual tree: one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stable branch and in parallel, a rapid development branch.  Charles Hines'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; develops in the &quot;cathedral&quot; style, well-suited to maintaining a stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; branch.  The only reason I haven't proposed a dual-tree development to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; list is that it would need someone with a lot of time to manage the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; development branch, and I don't have this amount of time.
</em><br />
<br />I've had many people write me (both on the mailing list and directly)
<br />
citing that same cathedral/bazaar paper:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html">http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html</a>
<br />
<br />It's not that I was deliberately choosing the &quot;cathedral&quot; method of
<br />
development, but I just didn't have enough time to truly do a more
<br />
frequent development cycle.  I really wanted to (eventually) get a
<br />
good 2.1.0 version out, and then start dual stable &amp; development
<br />
paths.  As you can see, I haven't quite made it there yet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Whatever you do, please please *please* use the autoconfigured version of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fvwm 2.0.46, which you can find at:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software/fvwm/">http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software/fvwm/</a>
</em><br />
<br />GJGG&gt;   Sorry if it seems so, but I only want to cooperate with you in
<br />
GJGG&gt; the development of such a nice wm, but I wasn't subscribed to
<br />
GJGG&gt; fvwm-workers list, so don't now anything about active
<br />
GJGG&gt; development, I by no means want to seem a &quot;hostile-taker&quot;,
<br />
<br />I was hoping that was the case.
<br />
<br />GJGG&gt; on the contrary, but as the WEB Page doesn't get updated for a long
<br />
GJGG&gt; time,
<br />
<br />Several months between updates has been the norm for me for the past
<br />
couple of years, unfortunately, so I'm not sure that I would consider
<br />
5 months to be a &quot;long&quot; time considering that...
<br />
<br />GJGG&gt; I just think fvwm2 developer team has switched over to scwm, I
<br />
GJGG&gt; know now that things are not so bad, many people are still
<br />
GJGG&gt; working on it!, I would apply the changes to your version (the
<br />
GJGG&gt; one with autoconf), and submit it to Adam Kopaz to be include in
<br />
GJGG&gt; his page.
<br />
<br />Please hold off on putting another fvwm pseudo-distribution out
<br />
there.  It really confuses things...
<br />
<br />GJGG&gt;   Any more info appreciated (mainly more patches I must include)
<br />
<br />Ok, more info (and the decision I mentioned above):
<br />
<br />As of today I'm giving up being fvwm's maintainer.  Unfortunately I've
<br />
finially decided to face facts and accept that I don't currently have
<br />
anywhere near the amount of time to devote to fvwm that it should
<br />
probably have.  It was a painful decision, but probably for the best
<br />
(besides, I guess I can still submit ideas and patches periodically).
<br />
<br />I wish to thank everyone that has helped out, submitted patches &amp;
<br />
ideas, or just plain used fvwm over the years that I've been involved
<br />
with it, especially the folks on the mailing lists.
<br />
<br />In the not so distant past I spoke offline with Brady Montz, and I
<br />
asked if he might like to take over maintainership from me when I was
<br />
ready to give it up, as I felt that he was one of a few good
<br />
candidates from the mailing lists and that he might have more time to
<br />
devote that I do.  At the time he said he was interested.  After I
<br />
made my decision this morning, I wrote him again to ask if he was
<br />
still interested, but unforutunately haven't heard back from him yet.
<br />
I really wanted to hear back from Brady first before I wrote anything
<br />
to the mailing lists, but decided that I should speak up before too
<br />
many messages flew back and forth without my input (hope you don't
<br />
mind, Brady).  In the event that Brady has changed his mind and
<br />
doesn't want to (or can't) take over, I'm sure we'll be able to find
<br />
someone else.  I'll be sure and announce when this is all decided.
<br />
<br />So, what's next?  Well, I'll hand over my current development snapshot
<br />
to the next maintainer after that's settled and they can start with
<br />
that or just toss it out and start with 2.0.46, whichever works out
<br />
better for them.  Then we'll see where they drive it...
<br />
<br />My parting thoughts on the future of fvwm:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Please try and keep the base code lightweight, standalone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ie - minimal external code usage beyond Xpm), and as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generic as possible.  Granted, it still needs more cleanup.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The configuration language definitely needs some more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improvement, but I don't think I quite agree with adding an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extension language like Guile, Tcl, Python, etc as I think
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are all overkill.  Just my 2 cents on the subject since
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was out of town and unable to respond when this thread
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came up again recently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The current module interface needs more work as well, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should probably be encapsulated in another little lib to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shared amongst the modules as much as possible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Dynamically loaded modules that use hooks into existing fvwm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;routines to make for tighter integration is probably worth
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking into.  That'd probably help with modules being able
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to muck with decorations, multiple language interpreters,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.
<br />
<br />I could probably put down more, but I guess the TO-DO list and the
<br />
notes I keep in my local development ChangeLog already cover all this
<br />
and more...
<br />
<br />That's enough rambling for now I guess.  Please be kind and
<br />
understanding to the next maintainer.  It's been fun.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
Chuck
