&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**^** THIS IS IT FOLKS **^**
<br />
<br />This is THE Letter that you have been reading about in the News lately.
<br />
&nbsp;Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
<br />
&nbsp;nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
<br />
&nbsp;investigation of the program described below , to see if it
<br />
&nbsp;really can make people money.  If you saw it, you know that
<br />
&nbsp;their conclusion was that while most people did not make the
<br />
&nbsp;$50,000 discussed in the plan,EVERYONE who followed the
<br />
&nbsp;instructions was able to make 100 to 160 times their money at
<br />
&nbsp;the very least. The show also investigated whether or not the
<br />
&nbsp;program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that
<br />
&nbsp;there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the
<br />
&nbsp;program.  This has helped to show people that this is a simple,
<br />
&nbsp;harmless and fun way to make some SERIOUS money at home..
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&quot; This is one of the most exciting opportunities, with the MOST
<br />
&nbsp;income potential on the internet today&quot;- - - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Hi, my name is Steve. After I saw this letter aired on the news
<br />
program, I decided to get some of my skeptical questions answered.
<br />
Question #1- Does it really work ? Until I try it, I can only go on
<br />
the testimony of people I don't know, so I will only know if I try it. I've
<br />
never done this type of thing , but I decided it was time to try
<br />
something. If I keep doing what I am doing, I'll keep getting what I've
<br />
got. Besides, people 70 years old have been surveyed and they will 
<br />
consistently say that the 2 regrets that they have of their lives are;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) they wish they had spent more time with their families and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) they wish they had taken more chances.
<br />
Upon hearing this again, and hearing what the Media said about it,
<br />
I decided that at 28, I was going to take a small chance and see
<br />
what would come of it.
<br />
Question #2- Is it legal?- Yes,( Refer to Title 18, Section 1302 &amp; 1342
<br />
of the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws)
<br />
This opportunity isn't much of a risk and could turn out to actually
<br />
be a bit of fun.
<br />
Bottom Line; The risk is only $20 and time on the Internet...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
The following is a copy of the Letter the Media was referring to:
<br />
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
<br />
<br />This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON. PRINT this letter, 
<br />

<br />

not require you to come in personal contact with people, do any
<br />
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house,
<br />
except to get the mail and go to the bank!

<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL
<br />
&nbsp;MARKETING PROGRAM
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Basically, this is what we do: We send thousands of people a
<br />
product that they paid us $5.00 US for, that costs next to
<br />
nothing to produce and e-mail back to them. As with all multi-
<br />
level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new
<br />
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. 
<br />
allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your
<br />
computer).  We are not promising you anything.  You have to put
<br />
forth some effort to make this business work, but come on how
<br />
hard is emailing! The products in this program are a series of
<br />
four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each
<br />
order you receive is to include:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* $5.00 cash United States Currency
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* The name and number of the report they are ordering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ordered.
<br />
<br />To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.
<br />
THAT'S IT! The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic 
<br />
multi-level marketing business anywhere!
<br />
<br />FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE 
<br />
&nbsp;PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******
<br />
<br />This is what you MUST do:
<br />
<br />1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them if you don't order them).
<br />
*  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose name appears on the list next to the report.
<br />
*  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save them on your computer and resell them.
<br />
*  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, each of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order them from you.
<br />
<br />2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any way other than is instructed below in steps &quot;a&quot; through
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;d&quot; or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.Once
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and address under REPORT #1 with your name and address,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to REPORT #3.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to REPORT #4
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the list and has NO DOUBT collected large sums of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cash!
<br />
<br />Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction portion of this letter.
<br />
<br />4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be very, very
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advertise. Another avenue which you could use for advertising
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!
<br />
<br />5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This will help guarantee that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />
AVAILABLE REPORTS
<br />
------------------------------------------
<br />
**Order each Report by number and name**
<br />
Notes:
<br />
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT
<br />
-  ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST DELIVERY
<br />
-  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheets of paper
<br />
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number &amp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and (c) your postal address.
<br />
-  Be sure to include your family and friends in your profits.

<br />
<br />HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it
<br />
works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on
<br />
your first level.  (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet
<br />
will EASILY get a larger response.)  Also assume that everyone
<br />
else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow
<br />
this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
<br />
<br />1st level--your 10 members with 5 = $50
<br />
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) = $500
<br />
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000) = $5,000
<br />
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000) = $50,000
<br />
THIS TOTALS -----------&gt;$55,550
<br />
<br />Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
<br />
only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would
<br />
happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Lots of people get
<br />
100s of participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!
<br />
<br />Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
<br />
you can afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet
<br />
connection and e-mail is FREE!!!
<br />
<br />REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing
<br />
and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list &amp; bulk e-mail vendors
<br />
even work on trade!
<br />
<br />About 50,000 new people get online every month!
<br />
<br />*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS********
<br />
<br />TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
<br />
the directions accurately.
<br />
<br />*  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the orders start coming in because: When you receive a $5
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order, you MUST send out the requested product/report to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, Title 8,Sections
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which state that &quot;a product or service must be exchanged for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money received.&quot;
<br />
<br />*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
<br />
<br />*  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUCCESSFUL!
<br />
<br />*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
<br />
<br />*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******
<br />
Follow these guidelines to help assure your success: If you don't 
<br />
receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue
<br />
advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you
<br />
should receive at least 50 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't,
<br />
continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 50 or
<br />
more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
<br />
already working for you, and the cash can continue to roll in!
<br />
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
<br />
on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You
<br />
can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people
<br />
are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income
<br />
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!
<br />
There is no limit to the income you will generate from this
<br />
business!
<br />
<br />NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a
<br />
business name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your
<br />
local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal
<br />
agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the 
<br />
Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free
<br />
seminars about business taxes.

<br />
<br />*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******
<br />
<br />This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! 
<br />
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a
<br />
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of
<br />
potential income.  I'm living proof that it works. It really is a
<br />
great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost
<br />
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program 
<br />
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS   
<br />
<br />The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this 
<br />
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
<br />
get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached
<br />
several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see
<br />
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
<br />
required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
<br />
first 19 weeks, with money still coming in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
<br />
<br />Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
<br />
my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am,
<br />
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there
<br />
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
<br />
my money back.  Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size
<br />
post office box crammed with orders!  For a while, it got so
<br />
overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.
<br />
I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life
<br />
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter 
<br />
where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better
<br />
investment with a faster return.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
<br />
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
<br />
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
<br />
was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I 
<br />
didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first
<br />
try!!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN
<br />
<br />This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
<br />
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
<br />
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
<br />
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your
<br />
family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck
<br />

<br />I am nearing the $90,000 mark from this program. I have used several
<br />
forms of advertisement.I used regular mail and bulk email.The regular
<br />
mail was very expensive for 2 reasons. I purchased a very select list 
<br />
names, and the postage.The 3rd time I sent out e-mails, in the 
<br />
quantity of 700,000.So, after 3 times participating in this program,
<br />
I am almost at the $90,000 mark. That isn't too bad. I hope the
<br />
same success for you. Good luck....
