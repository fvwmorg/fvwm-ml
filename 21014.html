First of all, here is the announcement I made that these were
<br />
responses to, just so people on the fvwm list don't end up massively
<br />
confused:
<br />
<br />I wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second alpha release of scwm (pronounced &quot;squim&quot;, to whyme with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;swim&quot;), the Scheme-Configurable Window Manager is now avaialble at

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scwm is currently a hack of fvwm2 that has the configuration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language replaced with Guile Scheme. Eventually it will evolve into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that is both much leaner and much more configurable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No one sent me any feedback on the last alpha release. I'd really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate it if some people would try it and send me their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comments, suggested changes, etc.

<br />Now, my response to recent comments here:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Incidentally, gwm couldn't do this, as far as I could figure out) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fvwm2 can't yet do this.  I'd guess the development for this ought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go in core fvwm as well.  On a more general point, how much does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fvwm2 have to be hacked to produce scwm?  Is there something simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could be done to fvwm to help it to be modified in this way?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It strikes me that perl users might want to have fvwm configured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using perl, for example.
</em><br />
<br />Converting the builtins themselves was relatively simple for most
<br />
cases. Some trickiness arose from the fact that all fvwm builtins get
<br />
a good deal of implicit contextual information (what window, if any
<br />
they are operating on, etc) and this was tricky to convert. However,
<br />
in doing the conversion, I have often made my Scheme procedures much
<br />
simpler than the fvwm commands they emulate, because the extra
<br />
features of the fvwm commands could be done by using normal scheme
<br />
functionality. As an example, instead of making move-pointer-to (my
<br />
equivalent of move-cursor) be able to move the pointer either
<br />
absolutely or relatively, I added a procedure that gets the current
<br />
pointer position and wrote the relative move version in scheme using
<br />
those. As another example, I wrote the Next, Prev and WindowList
<br />
command equivalents entirely in scheme based on very simple
<br />
primitives. So while a conversion _could_ be done almost mechanically,
<br />
it is a big win to give it deeper thought.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) ability to execute bits of scheme after the wm starts, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; customisation isn't the endless edit-save-restart cycle that it seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to be on almost any other window manager.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fvwm can already do this, using its module interface.  Perhaps that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that's nontrivial to convert to scheme, or perhaps it just hasn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been a priority for the author.  There are a couple of modules which allow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication with fvwm and execution of almost arbitrary commands (I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are some which really do have to be done at wm startup, but perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm wrong and all these have now been removed).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Come to think of it, couldn't the whole exercise be done by writing a fvwm2 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; module in guile which converted guile statements into fvwm2 and sent them?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (You'd need a minimal .fvwm2rc which started the module.)  Parts of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already exist for other languages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The whole exercise _could_ be done that way. In fact, I think there
<br />
are already FvwmPerl and FvwmPython modules done this way. I decided
<br />
to do it by converting the binary itself because it will eventually
<br />
save a lot of memory to be able to get rid of the fvwm parsing and
<br />
control-flow machinery, as well as all the weird features of many fvwm
<br />
commands that are there because the fvwmrc language lacks things like
<br />
conditionals and arithmetic. In fact, I think I might be able to use
<br />
less memory than fvwm2 eventually, if you don't count the guile shared
<br />
library.
