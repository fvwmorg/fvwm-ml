<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, when I click on the title bar of a window that is below and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the focus-giving click, the window wouldn't be lowered.
</em><br />
<br />I sent the following to the list a few days ago:
<br />
<br />ME&gt; [...snip...] but when I have ClickToFocus set for a window, I get the 
<br />
ME&gt; following behavior [mouse 3 tied to RaiseLower]
<br />
<br />ME&gt; Window has focus        click 3 in Title        RaiseLower toggle
<br />
<br />ME&gt; Window has no focus     click 3 in Title        Window Raises briefly
<br />
ME&gt;                                                 above any windows it
<br />
ME&gt;                                                 had been below, then
<br />
ME&gt;                                                 drops to bottom.
<br />
<br />ME&gt; [...snip...] This seems to be due to the ClickToFocus generating a Raise
<br />
ME&gt; event before evoking the RaiseLower which then drops the window to the
<br />
ME&gt; bottom.  I *really* like fvwm, and I don't consider this a real problem,
<br />
ME&gt; but neither do I consider it to be proper behavior, as the Raise is not
<br />
ME&gt; called out in the manpage as a result of a window-click, at least as far
<br />
ME&gt; as I have found.  Is this related to the relatively nasty behavior I see
<br />
ME&gt; with some Motif processes (getting a Raise command [dutifully executed]
<br />
ME&gt; resulting from a button-click which was issued to call forth a menu 
<br />
ME&gt; in the window _body_ [note: menus from menubar work properly], thus 
<br />
ME&gt; covering up the newly created menu)?  [...snip...]
<br />
<br />I would really like to get the Motif window-click menu problem solved, and
<br />
Scott Raney's observation about configureNotify events is the most
<br />
relevant-sounding bit of info I have heard (although I suspect it would
<br />
only lead to the general area in the code from which the bothersome
<br />
behavior comes, rather than being from the same cause).  In my problem
<br />
instance, the menu click passed on to the app invokes a Raise whether the
<br />
window is on top or not, and generally (although in some highly loaded
<br />
cases on my Linux box this behavior is not universal, indicating the
<br />
generally undesirable existence of a race condition) after the menu has
<br />
been invoked.  This problem would persist even with Kai's proposed change. 
<br />
The raise event seems to come from the app, and is handled in an
<br />
acceptable sequence by mwm and vuewm, but not by fvwm and twm.  Does mwm
<br />
really ignore menus (as fvwm seems to do) or does it subtly give them
<br />
favored status by keeping them on top?  If fvwm were to handle them with a
<br />
StaysOnTop style, then my immediate irritant might go away (leaving a
<br />
residual hackish aftertaste).  However, I don't know how to query the
<br />
system for window info for a menu, because the focus event required to
<br />
bring up the query function causes the menu to go away. 
<br />
<br />Why does the ClickToFocus automatically come with a window raise, anyway? 
<br />
When I click in a ClickToFocus window which already has focus, it does not
<br />
raise.  The only thing I can find related to this is an oblique reference
<br />
in the Focus command, where the manpage states that execution of the Focus
<br />
command will raise the window &quot;if needed to make it visible.&quot;  I presume
<br />
this means if any part of it is covered, rather than if no part of it is
<br />
visible.  This is too generally useful for finding windows for me to 
<br />
suggest changing, but if a non-raising focus alternative were available 
<br />
for use by ClickToFocus, it might solve *some* problems.
<br />
<br />My apologies if this is overly long...a global tiefen-property, it seems 
<br />
at times...
