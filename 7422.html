<br />
Hi all.
<br />
<br />While fatigued yesterday, but needing to sync back into &quot;normal time&quot; 
<br />
again after the festivities, I checked out another window manager.
<br />
Usually this is a complete waste of time: anything any other WM has,
<br />
fvwm makes possible and more; sometimes there's a Good Idea to bring back 
<br />
to my fvwm config, but more often it just leaves me confused as to
<br />
why anyone would live with the limitations implied by Not-Fvwm (as
<br />
they're known as around here ;) 
<br />
&lt;ahem&gt;, anyway, I went there, &quot;there&quot; being treewm: <a href="http://treewm.sourceforge.net/">http://treewm.sourceforge.net/</a>
<br />
and, well, wow.
<br />
Treewm has a unique feature which I found very appealing (and, for once,
<br />
I couldn't simply write it into my fvwm configs): the ability to run
<br />
desktops within windows. Initially there's the root window, and from 
<br />
there, one launches regular windows (xterms, whatever), or windows that are
<br />
desktops, with their own backgrounds, window policy, etc.
<br />
These desktops can be treated like any other window (shaded, iconified, 
<br />
re-placed...). 
<br />
Their child windows may be seen in the master taskbar, or not; moved to other 
<br />
desktops/windows, captured en mass by new desktops...
<br />
Of course, the first thing I tried out (I was tired ;) was to run fvwm as a 
<br />
client to one of these desktops, and.... lo! it &quot;worked&quot;, albeit in a
<br />
funny sort of completely-unworkable way - nevertheless, I was very
<br />
impressed. The problem was that treewm is not configurable enough,
<br />
so I couldn't get it to leave a bunch (pardon the puns) of stuff alone
<br />
for fvwm to take care of (not really that surprising really). Possibly
<br />
it hasn't occured to the programmer that someone might be (stupid|brave|.*) 
<br />
enough to try such a thing.
<br />
Of course, I could write a config for fvwm that was suited for being
<br />
&quot;swallowed&quot; by another WM, and maybe that would be worthwhile, but
<br />
probably it would defeat the purpose of having such a powerful WM like
<br />
fvwm in the first place.
<br />
Treewm also has a very nice vi-like command-line interface (which, of
<br />
course, will be in my fvwm config before too long), and the strange,
<br />
not-entirely-pointless, feature of being able to slice holes in 
<br />
windows/desktops so that what's underneath them is readable/selectable/writable...
<br />
<br />For the record - I hit the inevitable walls quite quickly, and reunion
<br />
with fvwm was not long in the coming - but for a moment there... well,
<br />
I've said enough for now.
<br />
<br />Happy 2003 to you all.
<br />
<br />Dennis.
