Before I begin, let me note that my knowledge of WindowMaker and
<br />
Enlightenment is _solely_ from screenshots on the Web pages you pointed
<br />
me to.

</em><br />
<br />You might want to take into account the fact that some of us don't have
<br />
the resources to continually upgrade hardware.  I'm running a Pentium
<br />
120 with 64 MB of RAM and 2 MB VRAM, which ain't bad (I wouldn't
<br />
consider it &quot;retrocomputing&quot;), but is already about a year obsolete. 
<br />
When I'm running Netscape, a few Tcl/Tk apps, a few Emacses, a lot of
<br />
Xterms, and the Gimp or POV-Ray (a situation that happens not
<br />
infrequently), I go heavily into swap space and my CPU load is
<br />
sometimes high.  In these situations (as I have while I'm writing this
<br />
letter), I very much like to have a simple and efficient window look.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's basically junk.
</em><br />
<br />I think what you mean is that it LOOKS like junk; for the most part, I
<br />
agree, since the default system is not flashy.  However, fvwm's pixmap
<br />
capabilities, while certainly not as extensive as Enlightenment's, can
<br />
make a very nice-looking desktop if you're into that kind of thing (I'm
<br />
not).
<br />
<br />What X and FVWM, and, indeed, most Unix apps are, is _functional_. 
<br />
Unix programmers optimize for functionality and speed, but usually not
<br />
good looks.  (The Gimp is the exception, though it loses in speed and
<br />
bloat, IMHO.)  From what I saw of Enlightenment's desktops, it is
<br />
indeed stunningly beautiful, but I can't really imagine getting any
<br />
serious work done with all that visual noise.  Also, with such a
<br />
complete predominance of images over text, I would be very confused
<br />
trying to figure out, for example, Enlightenment's button bar.
<br />
<br />In other words, Enlightenment might be great for graphics buffs
<br />
running i686/366's with 1 GB of RAM and 4 MB of VRAM, like you, but for
<br />
the rest of us who just want to USE their wm's, as opposed to admiring
<br />
them, FVWM is great.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Programming for the computers of today and tomorrow is more interesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more rewarding than programming for the computers that you only keep around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you're sentimentally attached to the stickers that you can't peel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off their cases.
</em><br />
<br />As I said, my computer is pretty good, but I still like FVWM's
<br />
efficiency.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmmmmm, maybe I should just scan the case and use it as a screen background!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Want another computer?  ;-)  
</em><br />
<br />Good idea!  I'd love a laptop, of any speed!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Enlightenment is slow because it uses ImageMagick to do weird things to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; window decorations.  I'll bet that it'd be relatively easy to add boring but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient window decorations to get back vanilla fvwm2/win95 decors for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retrocomputing buffs...
</em><br />
<br />Better yet, why not just use FVWM itself?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a lot of effort going in parallel directions on the window manager
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; front.  Granted that almost zero effort is going into fvwm2, but it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a really good thing to unsplinter the various window manager factions out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there and, uh...take over the world? no that's not it!...uh, look forwards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of backwards...
</em><br />
<br />One of the nice things about Unix is that you have many choices.  I
<br />
definitely wouldn't like it if all the wm's were combined into one as
<br />
inefficient as Enlightenment must be.  (Remember, I've only seen the
<br />
screenshots, but I surmise that it uses the hellishly slow X11 SHAPE
<br />
extensions, no?)
<br />
<br />BTW, it might be nice to add Shaped decoration support to FVWM...  I'll
<br />
look into it, though, I agree, fvwm's code is extremely messy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps fvwm's code isn't the most elegant, but officially it's still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beta, and perhaps a code cleanup will take place either before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; official 2.1 release, or during the next development cycle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see anyone doing the work and it strikes me as easier to start from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different codebase.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe it just takes an evil spy like you to give us a kick in the seat
<br />
of the pants :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     AfterStep is probably the most mature.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know much about it, so I can't comment; however, if I remember
<br />
correctly, AfterStep is based on FVWM2.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     WindowMaker will leave AfterStep behind soon (if it hasn't already)
</em><br />
<br />WindowMaker appears to be in the early beta stages now, and I frankly
<br />
can't see what it has that any other wm doesn't...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Enlightenment is probably the most promising because it's really NEW.
</em><br />
<br />Enlightenment may well be the wm of the future, and is definitely worth
<br />
looking into.  OTOH, it doesn't appear to have any new features other
<br />
than the fancy wm decorations, which surely aren't the most important
<br />
feature of a wm.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It is totally undocumented and spare but it's pretty readable...
</em><br />
<br />Just wait a few years, until it's actually usable on normal
<br />
computers...  By then, it'll probably be as munged up as fvwm's :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The theme interface is neat.  It reads prepackaged tarballs so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     sampling interfaces written by other people is pretty idiot-proof.
</em><br />
<br />That's nice, but rather superficial, don't you think?  Still, it might
<br />
be nice to make FVWM more modular in this respect.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     There is no &quot;modules&quot; interface.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The lack of a modules interface is good because I think that modules in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their current incarnation are a pain.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree wholeheartedly.  Modules are more efficient than scripting
<br />
languages, since they can be compiled, but are more versatile, since
<br />
many scripting languages can be hooked into the module language.  I
<br />
think we now have tcl, perl, and python for FVWM, am I correct?  I
<br />
suppose we could have a guile interpreter too, but who'd want to use a
<br />
LISP-derivate?  Blech.
<br />
<br />Okay, that's my $0.02 (maybe $0.03) in defense of FVWM.  BTW, don't
<br />
think I'm against your criticism in this group -- it might just get
<br />
some of us off our asses.  Probably the biggest impediment to the Great
<br />
Code Rewrite is lack of leadership (no offense, Chuck).  Chuck's been
<br />
too busy to organize people, and I guess no one else really feels he
<br />
has the Chuck-given right to make massive changes to FVWM's codebase.
