<br />DV&gt; ((Chuck, are you still lurking?  Can you fill in the gaps before
<br />
DV&gt; 1998?))
<br />
<br />I am still lurking, yes, but not sure how much I can fill in as my memory is
<br />
getting a little fuzzy in my old age...I'll see what I can do... :)
<br />
<br />I apologize for leaving all of the cited text in here.  I normally would trim
<br />
out most of it but for filling in a history it seemed appropriate to leave it
<br />
in.
<br />
<br />DV&gt; Robert Nation started it back in 1993.  The first time anything
<br />
DV&gt; was heard about it in public was on the 1st of July in 1993, when
<br />
DV&gt; Rob bundled a development version (0.5.something) with an rxvt
<br />
DV&gt; release (a still popular terminal program).  In the next few
<br />
DV&gt; months, fvwm became an independent package and fvwm-1.0 was
<br />
DV&gt; released in fall, still 1993.  Originally, the &quot;F&quot; in fvwm stood
<br />
DV&gt; for &quot;feeble&quot;.  But then, Rob seems to have forgotten this at some
<br />
DV&gt; point in time and thus the famouse FAQ question 1.1 was born.  But
<br />
DV&gt; although there is strong evidence on the meaning of the &quot;F&quot; in old
<br />
DV&gt; new group archives, we nowadays prefer the &quot;mysterious F&quot;
<br />
DV&gt; interpretation ;-)
<br />
<br />I never agreed with &quot;feeble&quot; myself, even early on.  That was one of the
<br />
reasons I came up with that list in the FAQ, to provide alternate
<br />
possibilities, hopefully mostly positive.  Many of them were suggested in
<br />
emails on the mailing list, if I remember correctly.  Of course, I added the
<br />
explicitives to that list because they were what I most often used while
<br />
trying to figure out bugs. :)
<br />
<br />DV&gt; I know litte about what happened between 1993 and 1996.  Rob
<br />
DV&gt; stopped to maintain fvwm and Charles Hines took over the project
<br />
DV&gt; for several years(?).  When Chuck resigned, Brady Montz became
<br />
DV&gt; the new maintainer for a couple of months, I believe in late 1997
<br />
DV&gt; or early 1998.  Anyway, it took almost 8 month between the 2.0.45
<br />
DV&gt; release (22nd of January, 1997) and 2.0.46 (20th of August, 1997).
<br />
DV&gt; I can only guess why, but probably this was a foresign of Chuck's
<br />
DV&gt; approaching retirement.  At this time I had been using fvwm-2.0.x
<br />
DV&gt; for about two years at home and wanted to implement some of the
<br />
DV&gt; features I liked in CDE to fvwm.  In December 1997 I sent Brady my
<br />
DV&gt; patches and never got an answer.  I tried again half a year later,
<br />
DV&gt; and contacted the mailing list, but fvwm development was as dead
<br />
DV&gt; as it could be.
<br />
<br />I believe that I maintained fvwm from Aug 95 through May of 98.
<br />
<br />I had been using it actively from an early point (probably right around the
<br />
1.0 version, but I can't be sure, I have some saved emails about fvwm from
<br />
early in 1994 and I know I had been using it for a while before then).  I was
<br />
working at IBM and the machines we had at the time while fairly powerful were
<br />
still brought to their virtual knees by mwm, so I believe I searched USENET
<br />
(comp.windows.x.apps) for a good replacement.  Found fvwm and never looked
<br />
back... :)
<br />
<br />I kept a close eye on fvwm after discovering it (I believe there was a mailing
<br />
list at &quot;fvwm_at_shrug.org&quot;, and stuff on comp.windows.x.apps of course).  I
<br />
contributed a couple of minor patches to fvwm in those earlier days, like to
<br />
get it to compile nicely under AIX and some stuff with colormap behavior (I'm
<br />
so happy to not have an 8bit display any more).  By the way, if anyone has (or
<br />
can track down) any archives of that earlier mailing list, it'd probably be
<br />
pretty cool to resurrect them...
<br />
<br />Then one day Rob had sent out a message (on the mailing list, I believe) that
<br />
stated something to the effect that he didn't want to work on fvwm any more,
<br />
and was looking for someone else to maintain it.  I wanted to offer to take it
<br />
over (as an X11 learning experience - I had dealt with X at the toolkits level
<br />
but was curious about the more low level stuff) but didn't feel I had the time
<br />
to properly devote to it so I didn't say anything at first.
<br />
<br />Then after about 2 weeks of watching people say &quot;I'd love to, but I can't
<br />
program&quot; I figured I'd better make that offer after all, qualifying it with
<br />
something like &quot;I don't know if I have time to do this right, but I'm willing
<br />
to make an attempt&quot;.  Rob remembered my previous contributions and figured I'd
<br />
be able to make a go at it, so he turned it over to me.  That was version
<br />
&quot;pre-2.0-patchlevel-33&quot; if I remember correctly.
<br />
<br />Then I worked on it sporadically over the next couple of years.  At first I
<br />
wasn't too bad about getting releases out, but the length of time between each
<br />
one got longer as &quot;real life&quot; invaded.  Another part of the problem was
<br />
because I did use it as a learning experience, I would often rewrite patches
<br />
that were submitted to me so I really understood what was happening and with
<br />
an eye towards making things &quot;easier&quot; in the future (which I'm sure pissed off
<br />
a couple of people, but at the time I thought I had good reasons for doing
<br />
things that way).
<br />
<br />Finially I had to admit that I just didn't have the time to properly devote to
<br />
it any more.  So it May of 1998 (I believe) I sent some email privately to
<br />
Brady Montz, as I felt that the stuff he contributed showed him to have the
<br />
most promise for taking it over at the time, and he (reluctantly?) agreed to
<br />
give it a shot.
<br />
<br />And you know the rest of the story from there...  I wish I could have done
<br />
(and learned) more, but I'm happy to have done my part.
<br />
<br />DV&gt; Then - I believe it was in September or October (I have to look
<br />
DV&gt; this up in the mailing list archive) - Brady resigned and
<br />
DV&gt; everybody on the mailing list thought this would finally be the
<br />
DV&gt; end of fvwm development.  Seeing this and not willing to give up
<br />
DV&gt; fvwm this easily, I took over the job as fvwm maintainer for the
<br />
DV&gt; moment.  After a lot of discussion we agreed that we should try to
<br />
DV&gt; make a first stable release in the 2.x series as soon as possible.
<br />
DV&gt; With a grat team effort we were able to resolve the most pressing
<br />
DV&gt; issues and managed to get the stable 2.2.0 release out the door
<br />
DV&gt; in February 1999.  (I want to thank all the people who helped to
<br />
DV&gt; make it possible back then).
<br />
<br />DV&gt; My memory of the sequence of events is a bit foggy.  Some time in
<br />
DV&gt; late 1998 or early 1999 we decided that having a single maintainer
<br />
DV&gt; as the master over the code wasn't such a hot idea.  In the past,
<br />
DV&gt; people had been eager to work on fvwm but had been hindered by the
<br />
DV&gt; maintainer, or more precisely:  by the absence of a maintainer.
<br />
DV&gt; As a result, almost no work had been done in fvwm for over one and
<br />
DV&gt; a half years.  So I gave up my role as the maintainer and the
<br />
DV&gt; responsibilities were since taken over by the people on the
<br />
DV&gt; fvwm-workers list.  Unfortunatly I'm still stuck with most of the
<br />
DV&gt; project organizing work.
<br />
<br />I have to admit that at the time I didn't think the &quot;rule by committee&quot; stuff
<br />
was going to work with fvwm, but all in all it seems to have worked out pretty
<br />
well.  I think that a lot of that has to do with the fact that you were there
<br />
to steer it's course.  Having some other pretty sharp individuals contributing
<br />
helps too, of course. :)
<br />
<br />DV&gt; Anyway, since that day in October 1998 when a complete X newbie
<br />
DV&gt; couldn't keep his mouth shut fvwm development is as active as it
<br />
DV&gt; will ever be.  Some of the people that helped to make 2.2 possible
<br />
DV&gt; left and some became less active, but we still have an excellent
<br />
DV&gt; team here (with a weakness in writing documentation).  Although
<br />
DV&gt; I'd rather not single out anyone, I have to mention Olivier
<br />
DV&gt; Chapuis and Mikhael Goikhman who are doing an excellent job in
<br />
DV&gt; providing some framework (configure, fvwm-themes,
<br />
DV&gt; internationalization, not to mention all the nifty features in the
<br />
DV&gt; fvwm core they have written).  Although at times it might appear
<br />
DV&gt; as if I am the one that keeps fvwm alive, fvwm wouldn't be half as
<br />
DV&gt; good without the help of the many people on the mailing lists, be
<br />
DV&gt; it by writing bug reports, complaining about missing features,
<br />
DV&gt; answering questions of other users or simply encouraging us to
<br />
DV&gt; continue our work.
<br />
<br />DV&gt; What about the future?  Well, the work for the next stable series
<br />
DV&gt; (2.6.x) is proceeding very well.  Fvwm will go into feature freeze
<br />
DV&gt; again near the end of the year so that 2.6 is ready before fvwm's
<br />
DV&gt; tenth birthday on 1st of Junly, 2003.  I have vague plans for a
<br />
DV&gt; big event on that day to remind people that fvwm is still there
<br />
DV&gt; and that it can easily compete with any other window manager.
<br />
DV&gt; After that there are plans for a version 3.0 that would change a
<br />
DV&gt; lot of the syntax and introduce fantastic new features, but that's
<br />
DV&gt; too far from now.
<br />
<br />Ah the future...scary and exciting... :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps it'd be worthy of a page on the FVWM website too?
</em><br />
<br />DV&gt; That is definitely going to be done for fvwm's birthday.
<br />
<br />Cool.
<br />
<br />Hope my feedback helped fill in some more of the blanks.
<br />
<br />Later,
<br />
Chuck
