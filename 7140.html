<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not surprised that GNOME2 does not work well with FVWM. I hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that FVWM 2.6 will work not so bad. However, can you describe the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem you had?
</em><br />
<br />The problems are mostly with GNOME2, not with FVWM.
<br />
<br />I'm using the GNOME2 out of Debian unstable.  First, I couldn't figure
<br />
out how to tell GNOME2 to use FVWM instead of sawfish.  I had to
<br />
change the x-window-manager symlink to point to my local copy of FVWM
<br />
(built from source, since Debian doesn't have the unstable 2.5.x
<br />
branch).
<br />
<br />Second, my default FVWM config on Debian uses manual placement.  When
<br />
GNOME starts up, I have to manually position two panel windows and
<br />
Nautilus's desktop window (which forms the active desktop).  If I use
<br />
smart placement, both panels get placed near the top of the screen at
<br />
about geometry +0+50, the first one obscuring the one underneath.
<br />
<br />Third, the deskguide applet shows 4x1 desktops, even though my FVWM
<br />
configuration sets DesktopSize 2x1.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about running just the gnome2 panel?
</em><br />
<br />I really like some aspects of the GNOME2 panel.  However, it's
<br />
unpredictable and misbehaves occasionally in ways I can't reproduce.
<br />
For instance, just now when I used the panel's log out button, all my
<br />
apps closed but the X server didn't, so I had to Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to
<br />
get back to the gdm login screen.  I've never had FVWM fail to exit
<br />
when I tell it to.  (fvwm-themes, yes, FVWM itself, no :)
<br />
<br />Other times, the GNOME windowlist and pager applets won't display any
<br />
FVWM windows.  Now they do, and I haven't deliberately changed
<br />
anything to make it work correctly.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, the panel starts up at about geometry +0+50, so that I have
<br />
to reposition it manually to the top of the screen.  Sometimes it does
<br />
start up in the right place without me telling it to.
<br />
<br />I've also had the panel get into a weird state.  It would create one
<br />
1-pixel-high panel in the upper left corner, one 1-pixel-high panel in
<br />
the lower right corner, and one offscreen panel (as evidenced by the
<br />
FvwmWinList listing).  That state persisted across reboots.  That
<br />
state persisted even when I deleted my ~/.gnome and ~/.gnome2
<br />
directories.  Now the panel is back to normal again.  Something I did
<br />
between last week and today caused the panel to reset its state, but
<br />
since I have no idea how it got fixed, I'm at its mercy if it ever
<br />
decides that it wants to misbehave again.
<br />
<br />In contrast, FVWM and FvwmButtons are rock-stable and utterly
<br />
predictable.  I like FvwmButton's ability to swallow arbitrary apps,
<br />
which has worked since the old FVWM 1.x days.  In contrast, when I
<br />
upgraded from GNOME1 to GNOME2 all the applets changed and I couldn't
<br />
use the ones I was familiar with, including some I'd written myself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No you should use FvwmIconMan in the place of FvwmTaskBar and add a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (swallowed) clock and move your task bar launchers to some new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FvwmButtons buttons. For others mini apps you should find the good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's yourself (FvwmButtons can swallow AfterStep and WindowMaker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applets) or you can do it yourself with FvmwScript. There are a mixer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fvwm-themes (under the script dir) and a FvwmScript battery monitor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been send recently to this list (~ 1st december, Subject:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FvwmScript scripts eating memory).
</em><br />
<br />I'll look into FvwmScript.  I looked at the AfterStep and WindowMaker
<br />
applets, but they seem to all be 64x64 --- whereas I'm on a laptop
<br />
with a small screen and want my panel-workalike to be no more than 24
<br />
pixels high.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
