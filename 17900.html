<br />W&gt; I took a long long look at Rasterman's page.  Although I find his ideas to
<br />
W&gt; be REALLY cool, 8 hours of looking at that desktop could give one a very
<br />
W&gt; serious migraine headache.
<br />
<br />I probably wouldn't use the rxvt-background for long, considering HUGE
<br />
pixmaps (spell: slow redraw?) &amp; near unreadable text.
<br />
I do like the marble decorations, though. (I could live without, but ..)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />W&gt; I'm not saying that some of these feature shouldn't be added.  If these
<br />
W&gt; are fairly small nonintrusive patches they should included.  They could
<br />
W&gt; make for some VERY attractive desktops when used properly.
<br />
I guess andrew's workin on it, and I vote for inclusion of his patches.
<br />
<br />W&gt; What I would _r e a l l y_  like to see:
<br />
<br />W&gt; -	Optional mini-pixmaps on the WindowList, and title bar
<br />
W&gt; 	or on the N/W title bar button.  This mini-icon would
<br />
W&gt; 	&quot;follow&quot; the application via a common FVWM style.  This has
<br />
W&gt; 	already been done well by the Fvwm95 team via 
<br />
W&gt; 	Style &quot;whatever&quot; Titleicon mini-icon.xpm
<br />
W&gt; 	Perhaps Hector P. could share a patch with us.
<br />
somewhat cryptic, but sth like that should be considered.
<br />
(maybe I'll lokk at it, since I'm into windowlist by now)
<br />
any other windowlist ideas?
<br />
<br />W&gt; -	If the titlebar pixmap patch is not adopted, then at the
<br />
W&gt; 	least we should be able to set the titlebar (just the title
<br />
W&gt; 	button itself) to a different color that the rest of the 
<br />
W&gt; 	window frame.
<br />
I vote vor adoption. It's not that big, is it?
<br />
We could gain more by code-cleanups &amp; better orthogonality of features.
<br />
(i.e: the windowlist is a menu as well, so solve the mini-icon stuff for
<br />
menus in general, but in a way windowlist can use it, and the windowlist
<br />
mini-icons are free. I think _that_ patch would be included immediately.)
<br />
<br />W&gt; -	The ability to NOT display geometry on the WindowList.
<br />
W&gt; 	Actually, the whole WindowList syntax needs to be made less
<br />
W&gt; 	cryptic.  Again, Fvwm95 has improved this and we could benefit
<br />
W&gt; 	from their work.  Here is an excerpt from the Fvwm95 man page
<br />
W&gt; 	regarding WindowList options.
<br />
<br />has been done. (I mailed a patch to chuck, actually it contained some more
<br />
changes. You'll probably see them in 2.1.0)
<br />
<br />I'd suggest more people &quot;put their money where their mouth is&quot; (from
<br />
rec.ww) and not only discuss changes, but send chuck diffs.
<br />
<br />W&gt; This is just my two cents.  Although I have tinkered with and contributed
<br />
W&gt; code to Fvwm95, I'm no Win95 fan.  Nor am I really fond of the Win95
<br />
W&gt; (Where in hell did the frames go?!?) look. I'm sure many of you share this
<br />
W&gt; sentiment.  However, that doesn't mean that we can't benefit from some of
<br />
W&gt; the useful and attractive ideas of others.  Not everything in the Win95
<br />
W&gt; interface is bogus.  Even the taskbar itself is a good idea, especially
<br />
W&gt; when in autohide mode.  It's just a horizontal FvwmWinList with a few
<br />
W&gt; amenities, right?  If you think about it, we did it first.  So, let's sue
<br />
W&gt; MS. ;-)   Just kidding....
