Hmmm. . well, I'll admit that I am ignorant compared to many of the
people who frequent this list when it comes X protocol.  However, by
your own assertion, Netscape uses modal dialogs.  Now, given my
ignorance, I am not sure that I have experienced a modal dialog, but
Would not the Popup that is activated when I selected Options->"General
Preferences" from the pull-downs be a modal dialog?

If it is, then fvwm handles this correctly, because I have used fvwm
1.24 and fvwm2 for about a year and a half and it has ALWAYS behaved the
same; When this dialog is active, I cannot interact whatsoever with the
main window.

Again, My knowledge is limited, but from my minimal understanding, I
have not experienced any problems.  In fact, I use fvwm2 on Linux, AIX,
OSF/1 and HP-UX boxes and I have NEVER had the sorts of problems that
you report.

Personally, I think that fvwm2 is one of the greatest programs ever
developed.  Sure, the source is a bit sloppy and there are bugs, but
fvwm lets me create attractive, functional desktop across any UN*X box
I've used and always maintained an efficient level of memory usage.
Fvwm works the way I like it to, and has outperformed almost every other
window managers I've demo-ed.

But enough preaching. . . back to the point at hand.  Is the dialog box
I mentioned a modal dialog, and if so, what behavior do you observe that
is different from what I get?

As a side-note:  FVWM is not just popular among it's developers and
Linux users.  According to the X11 window manager homepage it is one THE
most popular window manager across UNIX platforms.  If you notice,
according to this page fvwm, fvwm95, and afterstep (all direct
descendants of fvwm1.24r) are way more popular among voters than mwm and
ol(v)wm.

You can review the numbers yourself at:

And although the voting was recently reset, the present results are
pretty consistent with the results of the list year and a half or so.
