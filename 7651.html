::--(tlau_at_ofb.net)-(18/01/03)--::
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On Friday, Maciej Kalisiak mumbled:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Note though that fvwm-themes is not a panacea for new FVWM users...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not yet. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nor is it a panacea for experienced FVWM users!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've configured a lot of FVWM's behavior in the past, but I had yet to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tackle the problem of making it look pretty beyond selecting different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colors for the window borders.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I was intrigued by fvwm-theme's purported ability to make FVWM look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like any number of other window managers.  However, I don't need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to swap themes at the click of a button!  While that's nice eye
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candy for newbies, and I did spend some time playing with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different looks, I just want a single lightweight configuration that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand and can tweak easily.  For example: I couldn't tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fvwm-themes that I only wanted two desktops!  So what I did was to rip
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out the &quot;nanogui&quot; theme and hardcode it into my fvwm2rc, along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my existing FVWM customizations.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However the process of ripping out just that one look-and-feel was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all simple; I had to read through all of the fvwm-themes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configurations and peel out portions of the nanogui configuration from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a multitude of different files.  There's a lot of knowledge embodied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the fwvm-themes package, but it's not very easy to use it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you give up your existing customization and buy into the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamically-generated-fvwm-configuration framework.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I did when I extracted the nanogui theme was to keep the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nanogui-specific configuration in separate files.  I'm using the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Debian system.fvwm2rc, which reads in user-supplied hooks at key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points.  So my hooks import the nanogui theme along with my other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; customization.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This solution is much less intimidating and less heavyweight than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using fvwm-themes, especially for people who already have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration they're comfortable with and just want to make it look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty.  I would love to see other themes broken out into similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; config-files that can be added to an existing FVWM configuration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply by adding a Read command.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; --Tessa
</em><br />
<br />after using fvwm for a few years, I thought I had a pretty good setup
<br />
with all the minor tweaks and features I'd added here and there...
<br />
Then I tried out fvwm-themes and *really* found out just how much can be
<br />
done with this superior WM. 
<br />
I too wanted to customise the theme that I eventually constructed within
<br />
the fvwm-themes framework and went about gathering all the includes
<br />
into one spot so I could be sure I knew what I was dealing with when it
<br />
came time to change anything. But still the process was suboptimal in terms 
<br />
of knowing just where to go to change some detail or other...
<br />
Thankfully, it's not that much trouble to consolidate your setup from fvwm-themes... 
<br />
-From the FAQ:
<br />
&quot;You can always get the fvwm configuration in one file (a-la .fvwm2rc)
<br />
of the currently used configuration (so called &quot;current&quot; theme) by
<br />
executing:
<br />
% fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc &gt;current-fvwmrc
<br />
You can skip the contents at the start responsible to manipulation of themes.&quot;
<br />
<br />Worked for me.
<br />
After that, of course, one has to go about making the generated file comprehendable,
<br />
which for me involved splitting that large file into a bunch of Read'able ones,
<br />
but at least I knew that I had a standalone file to work with, and could forget
<br />
about changing something that would affect other configurations in other
<br />
files...
<br />
<br />but here I've just quoted from the FAQ - and I must apologise for stating the
<br />
obvious by doing such.
