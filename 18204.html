<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; Continued use of pointer focus as the default will just

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; demonstrate a total lack of respect for industry standards by the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; fvwm developers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, Mr. Raney actually phrased things this way.  I think he must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peeved at the different behavior of &quot;standard&quot; mwm and its brethren as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to the occasionally idiosyncratic way fvwm appears to handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.  It is _possible_ that fvwm is rigorously enforcing the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protocol while other products are invoking nonstandard special handling. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not in a position to assess the matter.  However, I can overlook the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather strident form of Mr.  Raney's protest (posted about 9 pm after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps a long day at work) and examine the content.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps it was a bit strong, but we've been pointing out the inherent
<br />
and insurmountable problems of using pointer focus with real GUI
<br />
applications (as opposed to xterms) for years now, and have sent
<br />
requests in to the fvwm developers before with no effect.  And the
<br />
statement is true: explicit focus is the de facto industry standard,
<br />
and although having a contrarian streak is a stereotypical
<br />
characteristic of Linux users (and probably of fvwm users on other
<br />
platforms), there are times when playing nice with the other children
<br />
is the right thing to do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To quote Bruce, &quot;Howls of derisive laughter, Bruce!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; _IF_ the &quot;industry standards&quot; were any good, I wouldn't be using fvwm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I use pointer focus and detest click-to-focus and autoraise.  Not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all users have the same opinions.  And yes, fvwm does attempt to support 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all options.  But Mr. Raney has identified purportedly exceptional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not arguing against choice, only that the *default* setting should
<br />
be the one that will benefit the most users.  It just seems unfair
<br />
(and unwise) to me that those who are least able to make the changes
<br />
(new users) are the ones who are stuck with the task.  *You* know how
<br />
to set up fvwm and will probably be changing the configuration anyway
<br />
to suit your needs, so why not just make the default the one that's
<br />
best for the X and UNIX community as a whole?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; prevents many advanced applications (such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; MetaCard) from working well on many Linux systems, annoys and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; confuses novice users, and is generally detrimental to the success
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SR&gt; of products such as Linux that deserve all the help they can get.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Insisting of click focus demonstrates both a lack of design flexibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and a total lack of respect for user preferences by the MetaCard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; developers, prevents many advanced system tools (such as Linux and fvwm)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from working well with MetaCard, annoys and confuses both novice users and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those of us who must support them (and the later group quite often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; influence purchasing decisions) and is generally detrimental to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; success of products such as MetaCard that frankly may not deserve any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; help.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a developer is including the Linux world (and such of the commercial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world as use fvwm, which is a growing segment) in his market audience,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this seems good to me.  He does seem to be confusing Linux and fvwm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however large the overlap may be.
</em><br />
<br />I realize that they are separate, and it's good that you realize that
<br />
the considerable overlap means that their destinies are intertwined.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; First, the default focus policy is a site/distribution decision.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; would be better off haranguing them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, a README for the MetaCard distribution would be an appropriate idea. 
</em><br />
<br />The MetaCard installation instructions include details about how to
<br />
change the focus model for mwm and olwm (which together account for
<br />
about 98% of our installed base).  But these two both come configured
<br />
with explicit focus from the vendors, so there's no need to change
<br />
them in most cases.  And although you're correct that this is a
<br />
site/distribution decision, I think you underestimate the importance
<br />
of the recommendations (in the form of default settings) made by the
<br />
developers of the individual packages.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But _if_ MetaCard programmers have found a misbehavior of fvwm, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it appropriate to fix it.  The accompanying request to change the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default pointer focus behavior for fvwm is (I think) very much another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter.  It is unreasonable to insist that the present focus default is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irresponsible.  If one were marketing fvwm, then it would be a question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $ and market share, and the answer would come from a customer vote. 
</em><br />
<br />Even though you're not selling fvwm, it is certainly in all of our
<br />
bests interest that the largest number of people find it easy to learn
<br />
and easy to use (especially on most Linux systems, where fvwm is the
<br />
default window manager).  Unless you care to dispute the fact that
<br />
most people are familiar with explicit focus, or that explicit focus
<br />
is easier to learn for novices, the correct default setting seems clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I support 200 Win95 users. My most frequent request is to install Xmouse,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an unsupported (yet Microsoft-developed) extension to Win95 that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implements pointer focus for Win95.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is encouraging, as I think it shows signs of independent thinking on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the part of Microsoft users (;^)
</em><br />
<br />I actually find it confusing, unless these Windows users are former
<br />
workstation users.  Windows is exactly the kind of environment that I
<br />
was refering to that doesn't work very well with pointer focus.
<br />
Actually the problems aren't as bad in Windows applications as they
<br />
are with X applications because Windows has floating palettes that
<br />
stay on top even when they lose the focus, and because there is no
<br />
way to do &quot;active focus&quot; applications in Windows (clicking in a window
<br />
always activates that window in Windows).
<br />
<br />It's also confusing because pointer focus really only has advantages
<br />
when you're dealing primarily with xterm-type windows (as I invariably
<br />
discover is the standard tool of pointer focus afficianados).  When
<br />
your rarely or never use them, pointer focus is just a pain in the ass
<br />
because you're constantly having to move the mouse before you can type
<br />
in dialogs and such.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Second, fvwm 2 allows the focus policy to be set on a per window basis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; so it could be MouseFocus for most things, but ClickFocus for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; MetaCard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which only goes to show that the problem is MetaCard not supporting fvwm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and not fvwm's lack of support for MetaCard.
</em><br />
<br />This is really putting the cart before the horse: you buy a computer
<br />
to run applications, not a window manager.  If your applications work
<br />
with other window managers but not fvwm, it's fvwm that's broken, not
<br />
the applications.  We'd like to support Linux as best we can, and to
<br />
support choice in window managers on other workstations.  But to do
<br />
this we need better compatibility between fvwm and either mwm or olwm.
