<br />
<br />Horror at the Grocery Store
<br />
<br />It was one of those days when nothing was going right.  As dinner
<br />
time approached, I found that I was out of milk and kitty food,
<br />
so I grabbed the kidlet and ran to the store. The store was full
<br />
of people stopping for the milk or bread on their way home from
<br />
work, and even the express lane had 15 people in line.  With the
<br />
milk jug in my hand, and my two and a half year old on my hip
<br />
holding the box of kitten food, I waited my turn...

<br />FROM OUR BULLETIN BOARDS
<br />
<br />High Turnover Rate!!!
<br />
<br />As Assistant Director of a large center I am responsible for
<br />
hiring our staff and it is driving me crazy!!! We pay so little
<br />
good teachers are impossible to find, they can't afford  to work
<br />
for us. So we end up with aides with no education who actually
<br />
&quot;forget&quot; to come to work! This is my biggest headache. I
<br />
advertise at our local colleges but most of the students know
<br />
they can get better paying jobs with degrees. Does anyone have
<br />
any ideas?
<br />
<br />Do you have the answer? Good advice? Click here to reply:

<br />NEWS AND TIPS
<br />
<br />o Overcoming Shyness with Creativity
<br />
<br />While most young children possess a wonderful lack of inhibition
<br />
and eagerness to try new experiences, some lack social confidence
<br />
and find unfamiliar people and places frightening. By fostering
<br />
and encouraging creative skills, you can help build your child's
<br />
confidence...

<br />
<br />o Program Trains Substitutes for Day-Care Teachers
<br />
<br />...Through the GTCC Substitute Program, adults will learn how to
<br />
teach and care for children in day-care facilities. In turn,
<br />
their education will allow other day-care workers to leave their
<br />
post to further their own education, thus providing a higher
<br />
quality learning environment for the children they care for
<br />
each day...

<br />
<br />o Having Kids Can Pay Off at Tax Time
<br />
<br />Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone
<br />
is writing a book. -- Cicero
<br />
<br />Not much has changed in 2,000 years. Kids still don't listen, and
<br />
when they grow up, they write first-person essays for The New
<br />
Yorker about your Vienna sausage casserole...But one aspect of
<br />
child rearing has changed: the cost. The average family can expect
<br />
to spend $156,690 by the time a child reaches 17, according to
<br />
the Department of Agriculture.  That's just for food, health care
<br />
and sneakers. Toss in college tuition, and you're looking at
<br />
another $50,000 to $80,000 before you can turn junior's bedroom
<br />
into a yoga studio...
