<br />David&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I'm using it for.  My typical layout consists
<br />
David&gt; of about half a dozens xterms and one emacs window spread along the
<br />
David&gt; screen bottom.  Graphically, it looks something like this (assuming
<br />
David&gt; xterm1 is on top of the other xterms and emacs is on top of xterm4):
<br />
<br />David&gt;  +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+
<br />
David&gt;  | xterm1 | | xterm2 | | xterm3 | | xterm4 | | emacs  |
<br />
David&gt;  +--------+-----------------------------+--+-+--------+-------//
<br />
David&gt;  |                                      |    |
<br />
....
<br />
David&gt;  +--------------------------------------+----+---------------//
<br />
<br />David&gt; Thus, the tabs give direct access to any window.  With full title
<br />
David&gt; bars, the above configuration would imply that xterm2 and xterm3 would
<br />
David&gt; be hidden behind xterm1.
<br />
<br />David&gt; I *do* appreciate your efforts to avoid bloating fvwm.  However, I
<br />
David&gt; also believe that tabbing is not just another &quot;feature&quot;---it really
<br />
David&gt; can improve efficiency in interacting with a windowing system.
<br />
<br />With a window layout like that, I agree that it would help.  But in
<br />
the meantime, are there other alternatives?  Let's see what others
<br />
have to say:

<br />John&gt; I could see it being useful as I tend to use large fonts and large
<br />
John&gt; windows, so they overlap a lot. That's why I requested the smarter
<br />
John&gt; drawing routines to tile the windows from a defined corner gravity.
<br />
<br />John&gt; As to implementation on fvwm, I can't see it making sense unless you use
<br />
John&gt; the tab to substitute for all the features in the current title bar.
<br />
John&gt; Also it would seem to me code would also be needed to make the tabs
<br />
John&gt; smart, so they could reshuffle themselves around when new windows were
<br />
John&gt; overlapped on old ones to make the tabs all visible.
<br />
<br />The 'tab' is really just a shrunk down version of the title bar, so it
<br />
would theoretically retain all the old properties, just be smaller.

</em><br />
<br />Olly&gt; It's easy to see what benefit this would have to people adopting
<br />
Olly&gt; this style of layout.
<br />
<br />Olly&gt; However, I have a few points/questions:
<br />
<br />Olly&gt;   1. How would you handle the identification of sticky windows?
<br />
Olly&gt;      If you squeeze the title bar real tight, they'll be no room
<br />
Olly&gt;      left for the stripes.  I guess you could add a few pixels
<br />
Olly&gt;      either side and stripe those.
<br />
<br />Those extra pixels would be needed to indicate that, yes.  On a
<br />
related note, I'd like to bring back the alternate color for sticky
<br />
windows as an option too, if possible.  Although that might not be
<br />
possible, since I know Rob removed it because getting it to work
<br />
required some unclean code.
<br />
<br />Olly&gt;   2. Don't you think it may look a little silly with fvwm's
<br />
Olly&gt;      mwm-style 3d borders.  twm has very simple window
<br />
Olly&gt;      decorations and I agree that this type of title suits it
<br />
Olly&gt;      well.  I thought it would so I got out my trusty gif editor
<br />
Olly&gt;      (xpaint) and modified a current window grab.  I've included
<br />
Olly&gt;      the result at the end of this message.  It doesn't look as
<br />
Olly&gt;      bad as I thought it would, but I still don't know whether I
<br />
Olly&gt;      like it.
<br />
<br />I didn't look at your picture, but I looked at what it looks like in
<br />
ctwm, and yes I think it looks pretty silly that way.  And it would
<br />
probably look about the same in fvwm, although maybe it could be
<br />
cleaned up.
<br />
<br />Olly&gt;   3. Looking at the fvwm code, it would probably require a bunch
<br />
Olly&gt;      more windows (internal windows, not user windows) to model
<br />
Olly&gt;      this.  That would add a fair overhead per user window which
<br />
Olly&gt;      would increase the footprint of fvwm.  I think that twm's
<br />
Olly&gt;      simplistic styling avoids much of this and so can get away
<br />
Olly&gt;      with it.
<br />
<br />Depending on how it's done, I would have to agree here.  But if the
<br />
titlebar window were just shrunk and the borders just followed it and
<br />
left the top of the actual window bare (which is what ctwm does) then
<br />
it wouldn't require any more additional windws (at least I don't think
<br />
it would).
<br />
<br />But it would still require other info to be in the FvwmWindow
<br />
structure, and it would require more calculations and checking when
<br />
bordering windows.  It might be rather complex to add.  I won't know
<br />
until I look through the code some more and play a little with it.

</em><br />
<br />Jeff&gt; I agree with David.  Although I try not to let my desktops get
<br />
Jeff&gt; cluttered, I invariably have at least 6 xterms open on the same
<br />
Jeff&gt; desktop by the end of the day.  I know lots of people who like
<br />
Jeff&gt; using those little 80x24 xterms, but personally I like to see as
<br />
Jeff&gt; much of a file as I can, so I use lots of nice, tall xterms that
<br />
Jeff&gt; end up covering each other up.  I often find myself &quot;Lower&quot;ing
<br />
Jeff&gt; windows over and over again in search of a particular one.
<br />
<br />I'm one of those small font small xterm people myself, but I have a
<br />
button on my title bar to maximize the window vertically if need be,
<br />
which I sometimes do.  But then I shrink 'em back down again.
<br />
<br />Jeff&gt; I would LOVE to have a &quot;tab&quot; feature like this one to help me
<br />
Jeff&gt; quickly pull up the xterm I'm looking for.
<br />
<br />True, but then again so does the builtin window list (or the
<br />
FvwmWindowList module for that matter).  And that doesn't matter what
<br />
your current window setup is or what the titlebars look like.
<br />
<br />Jeff&gt; However, I also agree that fvwm should be kept nice and small,
<br />
Jeff&gt; so if this feature impacts the size or speed of fvwm
<br />
Jeff&gt; significantly and it can't be done in a module, than punt it.
<br />
<br />I couldn't have said it better myself...
<br />
<br />Hey - another related note came in.  Let's follow that up here too...

</em><br />
<br />Brian&gt; I think lots of people are missing the point of fVwm.  Tabs are
<br />
Brian&gt; essential, when you are limited to a single desktop.  With
<br />
Brian&gt; multiple desktops, tabs are kinda silly.
<br />
<br />This (multiple virtual desktops) is the very reason why I switched to
<br />
fvwm in the first place originally.  My mwm screen was just too
<br />
littered with windows (and too slow on my rather pitiful machine at
<br />
work).
<br />
<br />Right now I have about 33 windows spread across 4 pages of one 2x2
<br />
virtual desktop.  Alternately I could have chosen 4 individual
<br />
desktops to achieve the same effect.  And this way, I agree, no need
<br />
for tab style titlebars.
<br />
<br />Although switching windows this way could be slower than just clicking
<br />
on the tabs.
<br />
<br />Brian&gt; Admittedly, someone who has acquired their organizational
<br />
Brian&gt; habits from twm will desire tabs no matter how many
<br />
Brian&gt; desktops/windows they have configured, BUT that individual is
<br />
Brian&gt; probably better off sticking with twm if they aren't interested
<br />
Brian&gt; in trying new organizational methods.
<br />
<br />Or perhaps ctwm, vtwm, or tvtwm, which have similiar virtual
<br />
capabilities plus the old SqueezeTitle tabs.
<br />
<br />Brian&gt; Personally, if I wanted to organize things in that manner, I'd
<br />
Brian&gt; bind FvwmWinList to the right mouse button (done it), and use
<br />
Brian&gt; *that* to pull the appropriate window to the fore.  I'd also
<br />
Brian&gt; use styles so that my &quot;per machine&quot; windows grouped themselves
<br />
Brian&gt; together on a common desktop.
<br />
<br />Very similiar to what I suggested above.  These are some good ideas to
<br />
work with the large window styles without the tabs.  And that is
<br />
probably just as fast and easy as the tabs would be.
<br />
<br />Another way would be to use Prev/Next Focus to switch between windows.
<br />
This would be real good for large windows, especially if there weren't
<br />
too many of them (say &lt;10).  That way you wouldn't even need to reach
<br />
for the mouse.
<br />
<br />Brian&gt; A current window count shows 23 open windows on my machine
<br />
Brian&gt; right now.  This is hardly maximal for me.
<br />
<br />And my count of 33 above was much larger earlier too.  But still very
<br />
usable and not too hard to find any particular window.  Even easier if
<br />
I were to rename a few of my xterms uniquely.
