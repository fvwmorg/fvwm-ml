<br />((Chuck, are you still lurking?  Can you fill in the gaps before
<br />
1998?))
<br />
<br />Robert Nation started it back in 1993.  The first time anything
<br />
was heard about it in public was on the 1st of July in 1993, when
<br />
Rob bundled a development version (0.5.something) with an rxvt
<br />
release (a still popular terminal program).  In the next few
<br />
months, fvwm became an independent package and fvwm-1.0 was
<br />
released in fall, still 1993.  Originally, the &quot;F&quot; in fvwm stood
<br />
for &quot;feeble&quot;.  But then, Rob seems to have forgotten this at some
<br />
point in time and thus the famouse FAQ question 1.1 was born.  But
<br />
although there is strong evidence on the meaning of the &quot;F&quot; in old
<br />
new group archives, we nowadays prefer the &quot;mysterious F&quot;
<br />
interpretation ;-)
<br />
<br />I know litte about what happened between 1993 and 1996.  Rob
<br />
stopped to maintain fvwm and Charles Hines took over the project
<br />
for several years(?).  When Chuck resigned, Brady Montz became
<br />
the new maintainer for a couple of months, I believe in late 1997
<br />
or early 1998.  Anyway, it took almost 8 month between the 2.0.45
<br />
release (22nd of January, 1997) and 2.0.46 (20th of August, 1997).
<br />
I can only guess why, but probably this was a foresign of Chuck's
<br />
approaching retirement.  At this time I had been using fvwm-2.0.x
<br />
for about two years at home and wanted to implement some of the
<br />
features I liked in CDE to fvwm.  In December 1997 I sent Brady my
<br />
patches and never got an answer.  I tried again half a year later,
<br />
and contacted the mailing list, but fvwm development was as dead
<br />
as it could be.
<br />
<br />Then - I believe it was in September or October (I have to look
<br />
this up in the mailing list archive) - Brady resigned and
<br />
everybody on the mailing list thought this would finally be the
<br />
end of fvwm development.  Seeing this and not willing to give up
<br />
fvwm this easily, I took over the job as fvwm maintainer for the
<br />
moment.  After a lot of discussion we agreed that we should try to
<br />
make a first stable release in the 2.x series as soon as possible.
<br />
With a grat team effort we were able to resolve the most pressing
<br />
issues and managed to get the stable 2.2.0 release out the door
<br />
in February 1999.  (I want to thank all the people who helped to
<br />
make it possible back then).
<br />
<br />My memory of the sequence of events is a bit foggy.  Some time in
<br />
late 1998 or early 1999 we decided that having a single maintainer
<br />
as the master over the code wasn't such a hot idea.  In the past,
<br />
people had been eager to work on fvwm but had been hindered by the
<br />
maintainer, or more precisely:  by the absence of a maintainer.
<br />
As a result, almost no work had been done in fvwm for over one and
<br />
a half years.  So I gave up my role as the maintainer and the
<br />
responsibilities were since taken over by the people on the
<br />
fvwm-workers list.  Unfortunatly I'm still stuck with most of the
<br />
project organizing work.
<br />
<br />Anyway, since that day in October 1998 when a complete X newbie
<br />
couldn't keep his mouth shut fvwm development is as active as it
<br />
will ever be.  Some of the people that helped to make 2.2 possible
<br />
left and some became less active, but we still have an excellent
<br />
team here (with a weakness in writing documentation).  Although
<br />
I'd rather not single out anyone, I have to mention Olivier
<br />
Chapuis and Mikhael Goikhman who are doing an excellent job in
<br />
providing some framework (configure, fvwm-themes,
<br />
internationalization, not to mention all the nifty features in the
<br />
fvwm core they have written).  Although at times it might appear
<br />
as if I am the one that keeps fvwm alive, fvwm wouldn't be half as
<br />
good without the help of the many people on the mailing lists, be
<br />
it by writing bug reports, complaining about missing features,
<br />
answering questions of other users or simply encouraging us to
<br />
continue our work.
<br />
<br />What about the future?  Well, the work for the next stable series
<br />
(2.6.x) is proceeding very well.  Fvwm will go into feature freeze
<br />
again near the end of the year so that 2.6 is ready before fvwm's
<br />
tenth birthday on 1st of Junly, 2003.  I have vague plans for a
<br />
big event on that day to remind people that fvwm is still there
<br />
and that it can easily compete with any other window manager.
<br />
After that there are plans for a version 3.0 that would change a
<br />
lot of the syntax and introduce fantastic new features, but that's
<br />
too far from now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it'd be worthy of a page on the FVWM website too?
</em><br />
<br />That is definitely going to be done for fvwm's birthday.
<br />
<br />Bye
<br />
<br />Dominik ^_^  ^_^
