<p>==============================================================
<p>1. Search Engine News Flash
<p>1). Both Yahoo and LookSmart have recently increased the price of their
<br>Express submission service to $299 last month.
<br>AltaVista followed Inktomi's lead in offering a paid inclusion program.
<br>FAST is expected to bring out its own program shortly. (More details:
<br>http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/express_incl)
<p>2)<a href="http://www.eif.net">Eif.net and Rapid-Traffic.com</a> are
the best search engine ranking

<br>Specialist: an&nbsp; NTA report says they have increased the traffic
of 25%.
<p>3). LookSmart Adds Paid Listings Option For Small Businesses. A new
program
<br>called "Site Promote" from LookSmart has made it possible for small
<br>businesses and others with low publicity budgets to get listed within
the
<br>paid placement area of its search results. The new program allows site
<br>owners pay a monthly fee of $20 or $30 to appear within the "Featured
<br>Listings"
<br>area of the LookSmart search results page. These are paid listings
that
<br>appear above LookSmart's editorial results. (More details at
<br>http://listings.looksmart.com)
<p>4). Overture(the former Goto.com) has signed an agreement to provide
search
<br>results to Yahoo!'s millions of users last month. Users who conduct
searches
<br>at www.yahoo.com will see search results that include Overture's top
three
<br>search listings in a section called "Sponsor Matches." Two additional
<br>Overture listings will be featured at the bottom of the page in a
section
<br>called "More Sponsor Matches." When users click on the "Next 20" link,
they
<br>will also see five additional Overture listings in the same
configuration.
<br>All listings displayed in the Yahoo! implementation will feature a
one line
<br>description and URL with full title mouse-over as a part of the search
<br>results.

<p>=================================================================
<p>4. Three Steps To Overture(former Goto.com) Successs
<p>Following a mention in my free newsletter 'Success Lines'
<br>that I was having some success generating traffic from the
<br>pay-per-click search engine Goto.com, I received an email
<br>from a subscriber asking for a blow by blow account of how I
<br>did it. So, for the benefit of a wider audience here's my
<br>response.
<p>I should first point out that I like to keep things as
<br>simple as possible, so I'll limit this to three
<br>straightforward steps.
<p>Step 1 - Find your keywords
<p>Goto provide a useful tool for identifying the most commonly
<br>searched keywords for the previous month. There's no guess
<br>work here. If a search term has received hundreds of hits in
<br>a month, it's safe to assume that it'll continue to do so in
<br>the future.
<p>First you need to visit the page where Goto provides its
<br>advertising tools. This is:
<p>https://secure.goto.com/s/dtc/center/
<p>Then click on "Search Term Suggestion Tool". This will bring
<br>up a search box in which you type your main keyword. In this
<br>example I'll use the keyword "ebook". The result is a list
<br>of search terms from "free ebook" at 13944 hits to "ebook
<br>publish" at 49 hits.
<p>Step 2 - Find the cost to bid
<p>Having selected your search terms from the list, you need to
<br>determine whether you can afford to bid for them. You're
<br>aiming to get in the top 3 slots, as this means you will be
<br>featured on many other search engines rather than just Goto.
<p>Using the same URL as above click on "Get Current Bid Tool".
<br>This will open a search box in which you type your selected
<br>search term. I'm going to use "free ebook downloads" which
<br>appeared towards the middle of the previous list with around
<br>900 hits.
<p>The results tell me there are only 3 competitors bidding on
<br>this term at $0.06, $0.05, $0.05. So, to get a top 3 place
<br>as cheap as possible I need to bid $0.06 to get 2nd place,
<br>as a $0.05 bid would place me 4th.
<p>Do this for all your search times, listing the ones you can
<br>get cheaply. You'll find some will be very expensive. The
<br>price you bid is what you pay for every click through, so
<br>don't get carried away. The minimum bid is $0.05.
<p>Step 3 - Make your bids
<p>First visit the account set-up page at:
<p>https://signup.goto.com/s/dtc/signup/
<p>Complete a separate section of the form for every search
<br>term you're bidding for. You'll need to list search term,
<br>title of entry, description of entry, page URL, and bid.
<p>Try to include the search term in both the title and
<br>description and you'll get a much better response. There are
<br>full instructions on the page.
<p>You pay a minimum monthly fee of $20, whether you receive
<br>$20 of clickthroughs or not. So make sure you bid on enough
<br>terms. You'll hear back from Goto.com in about 5 days
<br>whether or not each bid has been accepted.
<p>You need to check back from time to time to make sure no one
<br>has outbid you, in which case you need to decide whether to
<br>up the bid. You also receive a monthly traffic report by
<br>email listing the hits on each keyword.
<p>That's basically all there is to it. Remember to be creative
<br>with your search terms. For example, a term containing
<br>"online" may be out of your price bracket, but one
<br>containing "on line" may not.
<p>Be successful!
