<br />
Scott,
<br />
<br />(and the fvwm list; I include this because there may be programmers out
<br />
there who see ways to implement what may be worthwhile in what I have to
<br />
say.  I will contribute no more to this thread, but I'm trying to be 
<br />
constructive in this addition.)
<br />
<br />Not to bash anyone or anything like that, but to my feeble understanding,
<br />
the dialog boxes you seem to be talking about are graphically disjoint
<br />
from the main window.  The features you seem to be favoring include the
<br />
dialog boxes logically in the main window focus (presumably a
<br />
multi-tasking machine is involved here and one should be able to receive
<br />
mail and such things without closing the application of primary interest),
<br />
but it should be possible to transfer the focus to another window.  
<br />
<br />The ability to type into a dialog box which has snatched the focus from
<br />
the main window (we might choose to view it as an appendage of the main
<br />
window, attached by virtue of its being really the same application) is
<br />
useful.  But the fact that the dialog and main window are separated is
<br />
really an artificial thing.  If you have used (for instance) tcl/tk to
<br />
generate windows, you know that events calling for input information or
<br />
display features can result in either calling up another window or in
<br />
extending or otherwise repacking the existing window.  You may pass the 
<br />
focus around among the sub-widgets as you please.  The features you
<br />
mention seem to treat the dialogs as somehow extensions of the main
<br />
window, and you should be able to do the same thing even if they live in 
<br />
different windows.
<br />
<br />Any implementation of pointer focus which forced each subwindow of an app
<br />
to be treated independently of its parent, and on equal footing with any
<br />
other window, *could* disable this feature.  I believe that the X wm
<br />
standards do not do this.  The X windows standard seems to allow dialogs
<br />
to be ignored by the window manager.  Can't you as the programmer
<br />
(institutionally) take the input focus which remains with the main window,
<br />
and knowing what dialog was requested, feed the input stream to that
<br />
dialog?  When you sense the dialog getting explicit focus or the main
<br />
window losing it as a result of a user's direct mouse actions, you could
<br />
go back to the other way of doing things.  Since the dialog is truly a
<br />
child of the parent process, they should have access to the same
<br />
information.  There seems to be no necessary conflict with either
<br />
click-to-focus or pointer-focus paradigms. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, you click on a button (or choose from a menu, or activate a menu
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; item with a mnemonic or accelerator) and it opens a dialog that gets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the focus.  You then type whatever you want and then close it by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pressing return, upon which the dialog closes and focus returns to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; application window that had it before.  This is the most standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operating method of modern GUI applications, and it just doesn't work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very well with pointer focus.
</em><br />
<br />You seem to insist that in pointer-focus mode, there is no way to get the
<br />
info for the dialog without transferring focus to the sub-window.  This
<br />
seems to be a programming obstacle, not a window manager matter.  Today's
<br />
commonly used techniques are not those of a decade ago, and today's
<br />
techniques stand about as much a chance of being those of a decade from
<br />
now.  Developing programming techniques to handle both pointer- and
<br />
click-focus would give you a headstart for tomorrow's work.  It shouldn't
<br />
be a great obstacle, unless the program really can't know which window 
<br />
has focus.  In which case the standards should maybe be modified.  But 
<br />
then again, Scott's first message mentioned an apparent ConfigureNotify 
<br />
event failure from fvwm....
<br />
