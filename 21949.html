<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Near 2000, Kendrick Vargas mumbled something about:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bother.. experiment. That's how you learn. And don't pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nay-sayers such as above... They're part of the reason a portion of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; population doesn't understand computers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Besides, experimentation can't hurt you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would hardly say it was close to crucial. I *barely* know how to program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in C, however even before I tried learning, I was building programs under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; IRIX and SunOS4/Solaris (SGI and Sun). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hey, if I want to get flamed, I'll ask for it.
</em><br />
<br />I wasn't really trying to flame you, believe it or not. I just think it's
<br />
a really bad thing to shun anyone from Linux software installations
<br />
because they don't know C. It's bad enough that Joe Schmoe loves
<br />
microsoft, but when you shush people away from a good free alternative
<br />
simply because they can't program (which from other posts, shows that
<br />
proggraming isn't necessary) is wrong and can hurt the Linux using
<br />
audience as well...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I merely wanted to point out the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess Fvwm was initially meant for Linux in the first place, so it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't be too difficult building it on a Linux box.
</em><br />
<br />Actually... Linux was built and based on TWM source code, and TWM source
<br />
code exhists long before Linux did. TWM was one of the first window
<br />
managers for X, wasn't it? And even then, FVWM was at 1.23 in 1994
<br />
(right?) when linux was just starting to approach 1.0 (not even 1.2). The
<br />
fact that it runs well now is a testament to the attempt to make Linux as
<br />
standards-compatible as possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But on some other systems (ever tried HP-UX ?) it can be quite a bit more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult. You really have to modify the makefiles and even some header files
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get it working. Then I haven't even mentioned the fact that on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HP-UX boxes over here, quite a few C libraries are missing :-(
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I can hardly imagine how one can modify C header
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files or C makefiles without knowing about C, thus not knowing what you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing.
</em><br />
<br />Knowing what you're doing and programming are two different things.
<br />
Makefiles aren't all that difficult to understand once you get the hang of
<br />
it. As for HP-UX, the guy said he was a novice and just installed linux.
<br />
I doubt he'd spend thousands of $'s for an HP box + (from what you've
<br />
mentioned) broken dev. kit on top of the cost for the OS. And even if he
<br />
did have to work on this system, someone could point him to a patch (cuz
<br />
if it were really necessary, a patch would prolly exhist) and he would
<br />
learn the art of patching, _OR_ someone would help him with his problem
<br />
offline. Either way, two rather important skills.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then about my &quot;don't bother&quot; statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Considering the above, I reckon that asking somebody for ready-to-run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; binaries is to be preferred above going through the entire compile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process if the person in question doesn't know about C.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. Eventually, this person might decide to recompile the
<br />
kernel, and then what will he do? He's gotta start somewhere. Therefore
<br />
telling him &quot;don't bother&quot; is kinda harsh.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It should, IMHO, however be the perfect occasion for starting to learn C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, indeed, experimenting does no harm, if you've got the time for it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may in fact be the best way of learning. But if you have to modify header 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files and makefiles whilst not knowing about C, you won't get very far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But again, if Fvwm compiles on Linux as easily as you say, my statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't apply to Linux.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next time, please think before you start swearing at people.
</em><br />
<br />I don't remember doing any swearing.
<br />
<br />Next time, please think before accusing people of swearing.
