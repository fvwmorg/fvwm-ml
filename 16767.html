Sorry it took so long to respond to this, but that happens

occasionally...

<br />AR&gt; I am the author of MFM - Motif File Manager.  It is a NeXTSTEP
<br />
AR&gt; look-and-feel filemanager for Unix.  I would like to collaborate
<br />
AR&gt; with the current maintainers of fvwm to integrate MFM with FVWM to
<br />
AR&gt; create an easy to use public domain desktop.  If you would be
<br />
AR&gt; interested in such a proposition, please contact me.
<br />
<br />Well, honestly I don't think I'd make any changes to fvwm to work with
<br />
any specific file manager (several reasons: don't want to bloat the
<br />
code, don't see where it buys a lot since most individual programs
<br />
won't respond to the drag and drop protocols, don't want to have to
<br />
support several different file managers with several different drag
<br />
and drop schemes, etc), but I'd like to make some suggestions here
<br />
that might make it possible from your end only.
<br />
<br />Please bear in mind that I don't use any file managers myself, and
<br />
have never seen MFM in action.
<br />
<br />AR&gt; Some of the things others have suggested to me is:
<br />
<br />AR&gt;   - drag-n-drop to/from GoodStuff Applications Launcher
<br />
<br />Going with my above statement, I don't think I would ever make
<br />
GoodStuff (or rather FvwmButtons, the equivalent in 2.xx) have any
<br />
specific drag and drop capabilites.
<br />
<br />But I think what might be better is to give MFM it's own toolbar (like
<br />
GoodStuff/FvwmButtons), which could perhaps be torn off (or made a
<br />
separate program entirely), and add code to MFM to allow it to be
<br />
compiled as an fvwm module.
<br />
<br />Also, in the not too distant future there will be some modules that
<br />
will allow for shell script communication with a running fvwm, and an
<br />
idea similiar to that could be used as well (so MFM wouldn't have to
<br />
be invoked as a module).
<br />
<br />And by building the toolbar into MFM, it would have drag and drop
<br />
functionality under any window manager, not just fvwm.  And under
<br />
fvwm, it could also possibly perform fvwm specific window manager
<br />
functions (much like tkgoodstuff).
<br />
<br />AR&gt;   - dynamic main window menu's
<br />
<br />There are pseudo facilities to do this now in the 2.xx betas, and will
<br />
probably be slightly easier in the next beta (2.0.43) and the first
<br />
official release (2.1.0) which should be out shortly after that.
<br />
<br />AR&gt;   - GUI interface to build .fvwmrc files
<br />
<br />Actually, two of these exist right now that I know of:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- FvwmConfig, module included in 2.xx, but isn't very good as far
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I know (that's stated right in the man page - honestly I've
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never even compiled it.  Rob made it before he retired from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working on fvwm).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Dotfile Generator, which also can create .emacs and .tcshrc
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files.  Never seen it, but I've heard good things about it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the official fvwm web page (<a href="http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/">http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/</a>)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a pointer to it.
<br />
<br />Not trying to discourage you from adding one to MFM, just letting you
<br />
know that some exist.
<br />
<br />Also, if certain little, prefferably generally applicable code changes
<br />
or additions to fvwm could make things easier, I may add them.  I did
<br />
one such thing for the freeware OFFIX drag and drop protocol (see
<br />
<a href="http://gutenberg.lcmi.ufsc.br/OffiX">http://gutenberg.lcmi.ufsc.br/OffiX</a> for info on that, which I should
<br />
probably have a pointer to on the fvwm home page) that allowed client
<br />
message events to be passed on from an icon to the program instead of
<br />
being ignored, which I thought should probably be done anyways (even
<br />
though every window manager that I looked at seemed to just throw that
<br />
event out in this case).
<br />
<br />Now, I should respond to a related note:

</em><br />
<br />Bryan, check your sendmail.cf file ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ or tell your
<br />
provider that they may be munging the mail addresses...
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; Guys,
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; Have been trying to install 2.0.42 on HPUX 9.05. Either the X
<br />
Bryan&gt; config files used by imake are totally fried or we're in big
<br />
Bryan&gt; trouble.  The files get through including sys/types.h and have
<br />
Bryan&gt; the nerve NOT to know what a caddr_t is! (Or couse, HP has
<br />
Bryan&gt; these things in there, about three levels deep into #if
<br />
Bryan&gt; defined(_HPUX_SOURCE) et al.
<br />
<br />I know several people on the mailing list have compiled under HPUX.
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; Next issue: I'm closely associated with the mfm people. (mfm is
<br />
Bryan&gt; a very nice desktop manager) What kind of work do you think the
<br />
Bryan&gt; two groups should do make these two programs work more
<br />
Bryan&gt; hand-in-hand?
<br />
<br />See above.
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; One area which seems a &quot;must&quot; is the ability to make a element
<br />
Bryan&gt; on the buttonBar be a drag-and-drop receiver.
<br />
<br />As you see in my above comments, I don't think it's a must (but that's
<br />
just me).
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; In other words, if I drag a file off of mfm and onto a
<br />
Bryan&gt; WordPerfect icon on the buttonbar, it'd be nice if WordPerfect
<br />
Bryan&gt; could be 'taught' in invoke itself with the name of the file.
<br />
<br />This would require coding changes on WordPerfect's part, for it to do
<br />
it itself, which is actually different from what you requested.  The
<br />
button bar would have to be recoded to recognize the drop, and invoke
<br />
WordPerfect with that file passed as a command line parm to it.  The
<br />
former would actually have much more functionality, as you could then
<br />
probably also drag onto a running WordPerfect...
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; Another feature, which would be neat, but somewhat NeXT-ish,
<br />
Bryan&gt; would be the ability for me to grab a binary, say, &quot;NeXs&quot;, and
<br />
Bryan&gt; move it into the buttonBar, thereby CREATING a new buttonBar
<br />
Bryan&gt; icon for NeXs&quot;.
<br />
<br />Good for a simple linear button bar, but the latest version of
<br />
FvwmButtons is more powerful layout wise.  Besides, how would you tell
<br />
whether or not what you were dragging was meant to be a new button or
<br />
a parameter to another exec?  And where to get the icon?  This would
<br />
be much simpler in an MFM specific toolbar (like I discussed above), I
<br />
think.
<br />
<br />Bryan&gt; What do you folks think? We have a fine window manager and a
<br />
Bryan&gt; fine desktop manager.  What makes windowing environments
<br />
Bryan&gt; successful is that the two work together in synergy.  To be
<br />
Bryan&gt; able to do this at the free(d)ware level on X would be a
<br />
Bryan&gt; tremendous benefit to everyone.
<br />
<br />As I said, I actually don't see where it buys a lot, since not many
<br />
programs would recognize the drag and drop protocol themselves.  That
<br />
would be the real win (for those that like and use drag&amp;drop).  But
<br />
until one becomes a real standard...
