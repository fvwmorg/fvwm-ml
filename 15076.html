</em><br />
<br />Todd&gt; Call me crazy, but I had more of a 'generic' idea of how one
<br />
Todd&gt; could configure boarders.
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; When you get right down to it, there are some basic things that
<br />
Todd&gt; make 'boarders' look like olvwm, fvwm, mwm, os/2, win95, mac,
<br />
Todd&gt; nextstep, etc.
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; So, if we could have the following controls over the
<br />
Todd&gt; boarderstyles:
<br />
....
<br />
<br />I've had similar (but simpler) thoughts from time to time.  But it
<br />
always just seems to be a lot of overkill.  What I would perhaps like
<br />
to implement:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- control over 3d look of borders (like width of shadow)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- separate control over border width and control handle width
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- titlesytles like flat, sunk, raised, &amp; justification controls
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Xpm/bitmaps for buttons
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- cursorstyle patch (perhaps modified for use in Style commands to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make it per window?)
<br />
<br />This should allow you to get relatively close to looking like pretty
<br />
much any window border look you want.  I don't feel that FVWM should
<br />
have to be able to look exactly like any other window manager type
<br />
program down to the exact pixel.  If you can get close, that's good.
<br />
This approach shouldn't bloat fvwm too badly, and a lot of that list
<br />
is already on my TO-DO list.
<br />
<br />Comments?  Anyone think I'm way off base with that?
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; menuloook yes, the menus should have their own little styles to
<br />
Todd&gt; them..  'ctrl3d' for win95'ish, 'plain black on white' for macos
<br />
Todd&gt; look, 'pop-off actions align to the top of the menu' for
<br />
Todd&gt; nextstep look, 'plain and boring' for win311 type look, '3d' for
<br />
Todd&gt; OS/2 look, etc...this should be on a 'per windowstyle basis'.  I
<br />
Todd&gt; KNOW this seems to be alot of bloat.  I guess definately for a
<br />
Todd&gt; module, eh?
<br />
<br />Again, just like above, I don't think that FVWM should have to have 10
<br />
different menu styles to look like 10 different window managers.
<br />
Perhaps some more generic controls though could be thought up to make
<br />
it customizable though.  I haven't given as much thought to this as to
<br />
the borders/titles &quot;problem&quot;.
<br />
<br />A module that has it's own menuing system that sends the commands to
<br />
FVWM instead of asking FVWM to put up the menus is an excellent idea
<br />
though.  Then you could make 10 different modules if you wanted
<br />
without bloating FVWM at all.  Plus it could be used w/ FvwmButtons to
<br />
get menus in it's buttons to popup on the button press instead of
<br />
release (since FVWM won't display the menu until the release).
<br />
<br />What would make it even better is to make it so the module can stay
<br />
running instead of being reinvoked every time you want to pop the
<br />
menus up.  Then there would be no more delay than popping up a normal
<br />
menu.  This will require some more thought though...
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; Now I don't pretend to know how to implement all of this, or
<br />
Todd&gt; whether it goes in the window manager, or if it goes in a
<br />
Todd&gt; module.  If it did go in a module, that module would either have
<br />
Todd&gt; to be started per window opened (ugh...NO! bad idea!)  or be
<br />
Todd&gt; able to manage all of the different windows, and if the module
<br />
Todd&gt; were not present, fvwm would then revert back to it's primitive
<br />
Todd&gt; window decorations.
<br />
<br />As I said in an earlier note, having modules control border/title
<br />
attributes presents some problems, but there shouldn't be any problems
<br />
with modules that popup menus themselves.
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; But, what I am asking, is...would the above 'boarderstyle'
<br />
Todd&gt; attributes be all that is needed in order to provide Fvwm the
<br />
Todd&gt; flexibility to make each window independently look like 'any os'
<br />
Todd&gt; the user desires?
<br />
<br />I think so.  But (like I said above) I don't think that it has to
<br />
match exactly.  Would the simpler approach I suggested be ok?
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; BTW, for those of you not following the 'wine' development
<br />
Todd&gt; project for Linux, they just added a '-managed' command line
<br />
Todd&gt; option to wine, which allows the program to act like an X app
<br />
Todd&gt; and instead of the 'windows' decorations around it, it makes the
<br />
Todd&gt; X window manager 'manage' the app...it would be hilarious (in my
<br />
Todd&gt; warped sense of humr) if one could do a win95/win311
<br />
Todd&gt; 'boarderstyle' to Fvwm...this would really screw with people.
<br />
<br />At least they aren't taking the evil WABI approach of override
<br />
redirect windows...
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; One thing that would help, instead of having pages and pages of:
<br />
....
<br />
Todd&gt; all being eactly the same, would be to have 'recursion' in style
<br />
Todd&gt; commands...  something like:
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; Style &quot;Win95_Look&quot; blah...blah...define a few styles for win95look
<br />
....
<br />
Todd&gt; Style &quot;wordpad&quot;  UseStyle Win95_Look
<br />
Todd&gt; Style &quot;Fvwm*&quot;    UseStyle Fvwm  # Just outt'a curiosity, what WOULD the fvwm style
<br />
Todd&gt;                                 # be if we can do all of the above? &lt;grin&gt;
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; You get the picture.. I assume (hope, maybe I'll hack it
<br />
Todd&gt; tonight) that this would not be a hard thing to do.  But boy,
<br />
Todd&gt; would it be a useful thing.
<br />
<br />I know that this Style command type modification has been suggested
<br />
before and I haven't really responded to it except to say &quot;you could
<br />
do this with FvwmM4 or Cpp&quot;, but this way of presenting it looks very
<br />
good and I bet not overly difficult to implement.
<br />
<br />Todd, if you come up with this in the near future, let me know.  I'm
<br />
adding it to the TO-DO list, so I'll take a crack at it eventually,
<br />
but if you do it first, that'd be great.
<br />
<br />Todd&gt; Please, comment on my above suggestion as to 'boarderstyle'
<br />
Todd&gt; decorations...  Did I miss anything?
<br />
<br />Only the misspelling of &quot;border&quot;.  ;^)
