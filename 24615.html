<br />
Greetings from a new user!
<br />
<br />I've been a WindowMaker/Enlightenment user for a couple of years, but
<br />
some trouble came up with desktop management in a program I need for my
<br />
research, so I had to join the fvwm club.
<br />
<br />Some things about fvwm2 are quite befuddling and I think you could save
<br />
new users trouble.  I may have missed something obvious, but I can't
<br />
find anywhere in your documentation or faq a simple explanation of how
<br />
users are supposed to create desktops and navigate them.  Just about
<br />
every other windowmanager comes with preconfigured key combinations to
<br />
change desktops.  It is hard to understand why fvwm2 makes it so
<br />
mysterious when so many other options are written out in such detail.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, I set out to make fvwm2 behave as much like WindowMaker as
<br />
possible, and in doing that I discovered the true beauty of fvwm2.  Many
<br />
many features can be customized.  I found editing the .fvwm2rc file to
<br />
be somewhat troublesome because of the problem of &quot;ordering&quot; as commands
<br />
override each other.  Still, most of that resolves itself with some
<br />
patience. The man page is really quite excellent and I compliment the
<br />
authors.
<br />
<br />I think I've gone about as far as I can go in fiddling the .fvwm2rc file
<br />
and the immitation-WM functionality is not bad.  I've got the staples of
<br />
the WindowMaker style interface, including:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alt-number to switch to desktop number
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alt-tab    to cycle (and circulateRaise applications)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alt-left click anywhere in a window to move it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alt-right click anywhere to resize
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left Double click title bar to shade
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right click title bar to show window ops menu.
<br />
<br />I've got buttons with pixmaps I ripped from the Enlightenment ShinyMetal
<br />
theme.  I've gotten rid of the motif style as much as possible.
<br />
<br />The Wharf can do most of the &quot;look&quot; of the WM dock, but has none of the
<br />
feel and ease of configurability. Too bad.
<br />
<br />I took a screenshot and put it here:
<br />
<a href="http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/FVWM2likeWM.jpg">http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/FVWM2likeWM.jpg</a>
<br />
And my .fvwm2rc is here
<br />
<a href="http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/fvwm2rc">http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/fvwm2rc</a>
<br />
<br />There are some things I cannot figure out, perhaps somebody in this list
<br />
can help me.
<br />
<br />Question 1.  Can fvwm2 be compiled to support png or tiff format
<br />
pixmaps?
<br />
<br />Question 2. I figured how to tile pixmaps in the title bar, but I can't
<br />
figure how to scale them. Is it not possible?
<br />
<br />Question 3.  Is it possible to make the side handles have width 0 but
<br />
have the bottom resize bar have with 5?
<br />
<br />Question 4.  I would like to do something pretty with the root menu.  I
<br />
was trying to put a pixmap on the background for each menu item, as in
<br />
WindowMaker or Enlightenment. But I couldn't make it work.  Possible?
<br />
<br />Question 5.  I had an entirely unhappy experience with FvwmIconBox. 
<br />
With gnome running, it is filled up with grey squares which, I think,
<br />
represent the gmc icons on the desktop.  Can someone give me a few
<br />
pointers on what this module is supposed to do? I imagined it would be
<br />
like the icon box in Enlightenment, which is empty until you minimize
<br />
something, and then it shows in the box.
<br />
