Peter,
<br />
<br />How loyal you remain to FVWM is going to depend a lot on what you need in a
<br />
window manager. My wife prefers gnome because it's closer to Windows, meaning
<br />
someone else did all the thinking and configuring, so all she needs to do is
<br />
click a few buttons to do what she wants to do, which is mostly recreational
<br />
stuff.
<br />
<br />I wear many hats; I do part time cgi perl scripting, have a server I host
<br />
domains on, am the webmaster for several domains, etc.  For me Gnome is a major
<br />
headache because it won't allow me to configure it the way I need to.
<br />
<br />FVWM takes a lot more work to get set up because I have to do all the thinking,
<br />
but it's an absolute dream once it's put together the way I need it.  I have it
<br />
configured to fit the way I think and work.  FVWM is the programmer's/hacker's
<br />
window manager.  It will be around as long as there are computer geeks who want
<br />
to do it their way.
<br />
<br />Will FVWM ever compete with KDE or Gnome?  That depends on the folks at FVWM.
<br />
Simply stated, Gnome and KDE are for people who aren't computer experts and who
<br />
need a window manager that does all the thinking for them, just like the way
<br />
Bill Gates designed Windows.  Linux when it first came out was much like FVWM in
<br />
that you basically had to do all the thinking.  Linux will do whatever you tell
<br />
it to, and much more than anything Windows can do, but you have to know what
<br />
you're doing to make it work.  As the Linux environment is maturing those who
<br />
are at the front lines are making it more and more Window-like in that it's
<br />
becoming more functional for the masses, but they're leaving it programmable so
<br />
those like us can still configure it the way we want.  If FVWM wants to compete
<br />
with Gnome and KDE they'll eventually need to come up with a system and default
<br />
configuration file that has all the features of the front runners and has it
<br />
working right out of the box. But they'll need to set it up within .fvwm2rc or
<br />
something similar so that it can still be customized as it can now.
<br />
<br />Personally I don't feel that FVWM needs to compete with KDE or Gnome to remain
<br />
viable.  As long as there are programmers and hackers who like to think for
<br />
themselves FVWM will have a place in the Linux world.
<br />

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm noticing that there are a lot of new clients that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people are running on KDE and gnome, for example my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coworkder is using a new mail client that seems to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite nice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is FVWM KDE and GNOME compliant? Meaning can I run these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clients under FVWM?  If not, when will they be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With the big push towards linux (did you read CNN today?,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IBM has promised 1 billion in developement in the Linux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;environment), it seems that these two WM are getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most of the attention.  Is it possible that there will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;come a day when it is no longer feasible to stay loyal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to FVWM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have not been reading the list lately so please forgive
</em><br />
